Instead, UK homes and businesses will rely more on \u201ccleaner\u201d electricity generated by wind farms, solar panels, hydro power and nuclear power reactors. A decade ago, coal plants generated almost a third of the UK\u2019s electricity, but in the first half of this year they have provided only 3%. In the same period renewable energy has climbed from supplying just 2% of the UK\u2019s power to a fifth of all electricity produced. The \u201clandmark tipping point\u201d is an \u201chistoric achievement\u201d in the UK\u2019s journey towards becoming a net-zero carbon economy by 2050, said National Grid.

The UK reached a record stretch of consecutive 18 coal-free days earlier this year, which ended on 4 June. The electricity system reached a second record this week after racking up 1,838 coal-free hours for this year, breaking a record set across the whole of 2018 in a little over six months. The coal-free days have effectively prevented 5m tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere, or the equivalent of over 12bn miles driven in a car. Chris Skidmore MP, the interim energy minister, said coal is \u201cfast becoming the fossil of our energy system and it will soon be consigned to the history books\u201d. He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve set in stone our commitment to end our contribution to climate change entirely by 2050 and this is yet another step on the path to becoming a net zero emissions economy.\u201d By the end of the winter the UK will be left with only five remaining coal fired power plants, after SSE said last week it plans to shut its Fiddler\u2019s Ferry plant near Warrington, Cheshire, next March. SSE revealed the closure after EDF Energy said it would shut its Cottam coal plant in September. The government plans to phase out all coal-fired power generation by 2025. National Grid is spending around \u00a31.3bn a year to adapt the grid to run on renewable energy, and believes that it will be ready to manage a completely zero-carbon electricity grid within six years. \u201cDo I expect that this will be a reality? No,\u201d Pettigrew said. \u201cBut we won\u2019t be a constraint in a low carbon world. We will be prepared to play our role.\u201d Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK\u2019s chief scientist, said the \u201cwatershed moment\u201d is a sign that the UK is \u201cbroadly heading in the right direction\u201d. \u201cThe question is, are we moving fast enough?\u201d he said. Research undertaken by National Grid alongside its record forecast has found that \u201cclimate anxiety\u201d is rising because people believe there is a lack of urgency in tackling the climate crisis. Nearly seven out of 10 people surveyed by National Grid are concerned about climate change and believe it is not being addressed urgently enough. More than a third of young people said their concerns about climate change would drive them to join a protest. Almost a fifth of 18- to 24-year-olds said they are prepared to skip school or work to do this, possibly inspired by student activist Greta Thurnberg who visited the UK earlier this summer. \u201cAs the climate emergency hits home right across the globe from Greenland\u2019s melting ice to India\u2019s scorching heatwave, the clock is ticking on our chances to avoid climate breakdown and public anxiety rightly remains high about the speed of change,\u201d Parr said. \u201cThis is no time for ministers to pat themselves on the back and uncork the bubbly,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 June 2019 to clarify in the text that nuclear is not a renewable energy source, and to change the description of the non-fossil fuels that are growing in use to \u201ccleaner\u201d, as they are referred to by National Grid.",

The former education secretary Nicky Morgan, one of Gove\u2019s earliest backers, suggested it would backfire, particularly with former supporters of Stewart.</p> \n<p>Privately, a senior member of Hunt\u2019s team admitted before the result that while they believed it was likely votes had been switching around, they cautioned that those who were playing political games would need to be deeply trusted by Johnson.</p> \n<p>\u201cWould Boris trust anyone other than himself and a few others?\u201d the MP said. \u201cPerhaps he\u2019s never even voted for himself.

      "bodyText": "Three is the magic number that has led many in Westminster to suspect that dark arts might have put Jeremy Hunt through to the final ballot to face Boris Johnson. At the final count, Johnson increased his lead by three votes, to 160. That small rise was the biggest clue so far that his supporters could have been lending votes elsewhere. At least five of Sajid Javid\u2019s supporters publicly backed Johnson after the home secretary was eliminated from the race on Thursday morning. If Johnson\u2019s team had encouraged tactical voting, they would not be alone. It emerged that in the final hours Johnson\u2019s supporters were being encouraged by text message from Gove supporters to back their candidate, stressing the need for there to be two Brexiters in the run-off. One cabinet minister, who has backed Johnson, played down the possibility of dark arts and said they believed Hunt\u2019s argument to colleagues had resonated: that the country did not need to see another \u201cpsychodrama\u201d between Gove and Johnson, and that he was best placed to renegotiate a Brexit deal. Even if some MPs were persuaded by honest argument, rumours were swirling in Westminster all week that politicking had killed off the campaigns of Dominic Raab, and then Rory Stewart. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, joked as he went in to vote that the contest had seen \u201cmore churn than a washing machine\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting how every time in this contest, we\u2019ve seen a surge, and then a defeat, surge, then defeat,\u201d one former Stewart backer observed after Gove was eliminated. Questions had already been raised about tactical voting on Thursday morning after the first round, when Johnson\u2019s vote went up by 14. Given he was unlikely to be gaining many votes from supporters of Stewart, who criticised the frontrunner at every turn, this suggested there had been some tactical voting in previous rounds. Overnight there were rumours that there was a serious \u201cstop Gove\u201d operation planned on Thursday among Johnson\u2019s supporters, but after the first ballot, that appeared to be stalling as the environment secretary overtook Hunt for the first time in the race. Those determined to stop Gove were said to be a mix of MPs who wanted to punish him for his shock leadership run in 2016, which killed Johnson\u2019s chances, and their belief that Hunt would be an easier opponent in the final round. Gove\u2019s team reacted angrily to suggestions that votes could be lent from Johnson to Hunt in order to squash his bid. The former education secretary Nicky Morgan, one of Gove\u2019s earliest backers, suggested it would backfire, particularly with former supporters of Stewart. Privately, a senior member of Hunt\u2019s team admitted before the result that while they believed it was likely votes had been switching around, they cautioned that those who were playing political games would need to be deeply trusted by Johnson. \u201cWould Boris trust anyone other than himself and a few others?\u201d the MP said. \u201cPerhaps he\u2019s never even voted for himself. But the reality is that if you\u2019re in the position where you can influence the entire race, then you\u2019d be crazy not to.\u201d The former defence secretary Gavin Williamson, who has been instrumental in whipping votes for Johnson, denied anyone had been asked to vote for a candidate they did not support. Early on Thursday, both Hunt and Gove\u2019s supporters were playing down expectations that they could capitalise after Stewart, the international development secretary, was knocked out of the race on Wednesday night. The final few hours were a scramble, with both the Gove and Hunt camps saying it was impossible to call. Most of Javid and Stewart\u2019s supporters remained tight-lipped. Gillian Keegan, one of Stewart\u2019s most vocal supporters, said she would take the secret to her grave. David Gauke, the justice secretary, one of the Stewart\u2019s most vocal supporters, declined to say who he was backing, as did Stewart himself. But Gauke, who left the voting room in conversation with the Hunt campaigner Philip Dunne, said he believed Stewart\u2019s 27 votes would not go as one bloc. Of his key backers, the Tory grandees Nicholas Soames and Ken Clarke left the voting lobbies refusing to say who they would back next, though the digital minister, Margot James, a backer of Matt Hancock and then Stewart, said she had voted for Hunt, calling allegations of dark arts \u201cappalling\u201d. After Javid was knocked out he declined to endorse a candidate, but is expected to pull behind Johnson in the later stages of the race, and is even tipped to be made chancellor. His core backers, including Stephen Crabb, Robin Walker, Simon Hoare and Victoria Atkins, also declined to say which way they would vote next.",

      "body": "<p>England are not due to finalise their Rugby World Cup squad until August but the chances of Dylan Hartley, Chris Robshaw and Danny Care being included are fast receding. The vastly experienced trio, along with Wasps\u2019 Nathan Hughes, have all been omitted from next week\u2019s preliminary training camp and, barring injuries elsewhere, are struggling to make the plane to Japan.</p> \n<p>It may yet be that at least a third of Jones\u2019s initial 29-man squad will also fall by the wayside given several prominent players from Saracens and Exeter will not be involved in full training until next month. When a rising son such as Harlequins\u2019 powerful back-row forward Alex Dombrandt appears better placed to fly to Tokyo than established senior figures such as Hartley, Robshaw or Care, however, Jones is issuing an unmistakably blunt message.</p> \n<p>The head coach has long enjoyed a bit of creative tension and has never been one to maintain the status quo for the sake of it. Strip away his vast experience and Hartley has not played competitive rugby since December, is still battling a niggling knee problem and after 97 caps, has plenty of miles on the clock. Robshaw is also 33 and has not played Test rugby for 12 months while Care has been slipping steadily down the pecking order at scrum-half.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/19/jack-nowell-rugby-world-cup-exeter-eddie-jones-england-saracens-ospreys\">England\u2019s Jack Nowell in fitness race for Rugby World Cup after ankle surgery</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Viewed in that harsh context, and with Owen Farrell having assumed the captaincy, their non-selections become less than surprising. Robshaw is probably the unluckiest but if Jones is looking for a match-turning blindside or a dynamic impact sub he can already choose between Maro Itoje, Sam Underhill, Mark Wilson, Brad Shields and Dombrandt.</p> \n<p>Loyalty only stretches so far when it comes to Hartley\u2019s proven leadership qualities. Many of the key games at this World Cup are likely to be played at a high tempo in warm, humid conditions; Jones, who coached Japan in 2015, knows better than most what levels of fitness and athleticism will be required.

      "bodyText": "England are not due to finalise their Rugby World Cup squad until August but the chances of Dylan Hartley, Chris Robshaw and Danny Care being included are fast receding. The vastly experienced trio, along with Wasps\u2019 Nathan Hughes, have all been omitted from next week\u2019s preliminary training camp and, barring injuries elsewhere, are struggling to make the plane to Japan. It may yet be that at least a third of Jones\u2019s initial 29-man squad will also fall by the wayside given several prominent players from Saracens and Exeter will not be involved in full training until next month. When a rising son such as Harlequins\u2019 powerful back-row forward Alex Dombrandt appears better placed to fly to Tokyo than established senior figures such as Hartley, Robshaw or Care, however, Jones is issuing an unmistakably blunt message. The head coach has long enjoyed a bit of creative tension and has never been one to maintain the status quo for the sake of it. Strip away his vast experience and Hartley has not played competitive rugby since December, is still battling a niggling knee problem and after 97 caps, has plenty of miles on the clock. Robshaw is also 33 and has not played Test rugby for 12 months while Care has been slipping steadily down the pecking order at scrum-half. Viewed in that harsh context, and with Owen Farrell having assumed the captaincy, their non-selections become less than surprising. Robshaw is probably the unluckiest but if Jones is looking for a match-turning blindside or a dynamic impact sub he can already choose between Maro Itoje, Sam Underhill, Mark Wilson, Brad Shields and Dombrandt. Loyalty only stretches so far when it comes to Hartley\u2019s proven leadership qualities. Many of the key games at this World Cup are likely to be played at a high tempo in warm, humid conditions; Jones, who coached Japan in 2015, knows better than most what levels of fitness and athleticism will be required. He must also be convinced his back-row depth is deep enough to withstand Hughes\u2019s absence even if Billy Vunipola should go down in a heap. If these selections also have the effect of galvanising everyone else, so much the better. The Northampton flanker Lewis Ludlam, Gloucester\u2019s Val Rapava Ruskin and the Bath wing Ruaridh McConnochie may be long shots for the World Cup but, like Dombrandt, they will focus the minds of those ahead of them. Dombrandt, 22, has shot to prominence after an eye-catching first season for Harlequins and scored two tries against the Barbarians this month. McConnochie has made an impressive impact at Bath having previously represented England at sevens while Rapava Ruskin would have been in the frame earlier had he been fit. While Mako Vunipola and George Kruis will both attend the camp to receive medical treatment, the Rugby Football Union and the Rugby Players\u2019 Association have defended Jones\u2019s decision to invite Dombrandt, Rapava Ruskin, Ludlam, Tom Dunn and Marcus Smith to train in Bagshot even though they have not been allowed a full five-week mandatory off season. The five weeks is supposed to consist of three weeks\u2019 holiday and two weeks \u201cactive rest\u201d but a temporary exemption has been granted.

There was a lot going on, and we were not focused. Sweden had played an incredibly defensive game and essentially stopped playing any kind of offense. I made comments straight after the match <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/la-sp-oly-rio-2016-hope-solo-doesn-t-hold-back-after-u-s-1471031683-htmlstory.html\">about the US losing to a \u201cbunch of cowards\u201d</a>. Not the best choice of words but in that moment I felt they didn\u2019t play a courageous game.

      "bodyText": "And our own Caitlin Murray was at the stadium tonight. You can read her full report below. Thanks for all your tweets and emails. VAR popped its head into the game once again today. Our columnist thinks goalkeepers in particular are being penalised by overly strict use of the technology: Sam Mewis and Tobin Heath were both excellent in that game. Mewis in particular has emerged as a valuable member of the US team. No news on Morgan\u2019s injury yet but she didn\u2019t seem in too much trouble before she went out. We can assume - for now - she was taken off as a precaution. US coach Jill Ellis speaks. She says she is pleased with going through the group stage without conceding a goal. \u201cWe needed this next level and they responded to that. That was the ignition we needed,\u201d she said. So, both teams will play again on Monday. Sweden will face Canada and the US will play Spain. Sweden were well-organised and picked up their game in the second-half but the US deserved their victory. We didn\u2019t know how the reigning champions would play against a world-class side. The answer is: pretty well. They will be particularly pleased with how solid they looked in defence, a worry before this tournament. And Chile\u2019s late penalty miss costs them. They fail to make the next round by a single goal. Nigeria go through in their place. Corner to Sweden. The US clear and that\u2019s pretty much the last action of the match. 90min +6: Hurtig should have done better there. She has plenty of space in the area but can\u2019t control the ball and Naeher rushes off her line to clear the danger. 90min +4: I\u2019m sure Sweden would like to draw this game but I\u2019m also sure they\u2019d be happy enough to play a few minutes less of added time. As would the US. Horan is the latest American to go down after a challenge. She continues though. 90 min+ 2: There\u2019s seven minutes of added time in Thailand v Chile too. I wonder if refs were given a word after Scotland appeared to be docked a few minutes of added time against Argentina yesterday. 90 min: Great save from Lindahl! Mewis plays in Lloyd and we\u2019d expect her to score but the Swedish keeper comes out and smothers the ball. We\u2019ll have seven minutes of added time. How? 88 min: O\u2019Hara is wandering around with a tissue up her nose after that knock earlier. All the kids will be wearing one next week. 87 min: Heath\u2019s goal earlier has been changed to an own goal for Andersson. Jakobsson tackles O\u2019Hara hard and is booked. O\u2019Hara should be OK. Both teams have taken hard hits in the last 20 minutes, not ideal as they prepare for the knockouts. 85 min: Chile have missed a golden chance to go through! They have a penalty to go 3-0 up against Thailand, and advance but hit the bar. 83 min: Pugh comes on as a late sub for Rapinoe, who hasn\u2019t been at her best. She faded badly after a good first 30 minutes. 82 min: A bad backpass from O\u2019Hara concedes a corner. Sweden will take through Bjorn who recovered from her head injury. She may still be feeling the after-effects: it swirls out for a goal-kick. 80 min: Chile have scored a second. They need one more goal against Thailand to advance at the expense of Nigeria. Ricky McGahey thinks the VAR decision was correct. \u201cLloyd is in an offside position, Swedish defender makes a clean play on the ball, so no offside. Lloyd never touched the ball. Here\u2019s how Fifa defines it: \u2018Interfering with play means playing or touching the ball passed or touched by a team mate.\u2019 Interfering with an opponent means preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball.\u201d Lloyd did neither. In an offside position, but no offside. The Swedish defender\u2019s play on the ball \u2018resets\u2019 the situation, ball comes to Heath who is in an onside position, and can proceed.\u201d 77 min: It looks like the US will go through as group winners. But then again, Scotland were 3-0 up at this stage yesterday ... Heath is down injured - a scare for the US - and trots to the sideline for treatment. Sorry, this is all just injury news at the moment, hopefully some football will happen soon. 74 min: Bjorn is fit enough to get to the sideline under her own steam. \u201cThe lesson of VAR is NEVER celebrate! Ever! As the expression of modern life, in lieu of celebration we should experience several minutes of anxiety,\u201d says Steve Murray. 72 min: Bjorn is down after her and O\u2019Hara go up for a header. The Swede got an (accidental) chunk of O\u2019Hara\u2019s head to her jaw. Ouch. 70 min: Lloyd is booked after clattering into Asllani. Sweden get a free-kick on the edge of the area as a result. Naeher comes out to claim the cross and misses. But so does everyone else and it\u2019s out for a goal kick. 68 min: Sweden continue to press and graze the cross from a Rolfo cross. Even US World Cup champions think that goal should not have stood: 65 min: \u201cHow was that not interfering with play?\u201d says Toby Rutland. \u201cThe American offside player forced 2 Swedish players to react, one of whom \u2018passed\u2019 the ball to the goal scorer. Fifa seem determined to ruin football.\u201d Oh, they\u2019ve been trying to do that for a while now. 62 min: Sweden ping it around nicely and have had their best spell of the game. They\u2019ve slowed the pace down, and are making the US chase the ball. Press comes on for Lavelle for the US. For Sweden, Glas replaces Seger. 59 min: Sweden have been better since conceding the second goal but the US defence have handled them pretty well. O\u2019Hara is booked for a hack on the substitute Rolfo. So maybe not that well. 57 min: The excellent Heath floats in from the right and delivers a cross but Sweden clear. Blackstenius then has a good chance and shoots at Naeher\u2019s near post but the US keeper turns it round the post. Rolfo replaces Schough for Sweden. 54 min: Sweden trot up the pitch for their first attack of the half. Schough take a free-kick from the edge of the area on the left. It\u2019s a whipped cross, and Blackstenius beats Lloyd to the ball but she heads over. It looked like Lloyd may have strayed a fraction offside when the ball was played into Heath. But the ref has a look and the goal will stand. Heath slowly advances on her marker on the edge of the six-yard area and smashes the ball in from a tight angle into the roof of the net. But we have a VAR review for a possible offside... 48 min: And Chile have taken the lead against Thailand in the other Group F game. It was an own goal by the Thai keeper Boonsing. If they score two more, Chile will go through. 46 min: And we\u2019re back. And Carli Lloyd is on for the US, replacing Morgan who may still be feeling that knock she got in the first-half. Rick McGahey has a few thoughts on the match so far. \u201cUS players are just much stronger, winning most of the contested balls, overloading them in the midfield, and outrunning the Swedes. But they aren\u2019t creating real shots, Sweden playing as if it were 0-0 and loading their defensive area so US can\u2019t create chances off the dribble. Maybe put Lloyd in midfield and let her bomb away from outside the area, see if that loosens Swedish defense at all. If not for poor Swedish defending early on, it would be 0-0.\u201d One of these teams will play Canada in the next round. Here\u2019s how they got on against the Netherland earlier: While Cameroon pulled off a late win over New Zealand to make the last 16: Chile and Thailand are 0-0, meaning it looks like Brazil, China, Nigeria and Cameroon will go through as the best third-placed teams. And, if things remain as they are in this game the US will play Spain and Sweden will face Canada. Well, we wondered how the US would do when they were challenged by a good side. The answer is pretty well. They are still, for me, the best attacking unit in the tournament. Their defenders have been decent but not faultless. Sweden, meanwhile, have decided they won\u2019t sit back and have made this a good back-and-forth contest. 45 min: Two minutes of added time to come. 44 min: Dunn tackles well to repel a Sweden attack. Thailand - 13-0 Thailand - have had some good chances in the last few minutes over in the other match and could easily be 2-0 up. 42 min: Lavelle goes on a beautiful run across the middle before Horan finds Rapinoe on the left. She gets it to Lavelle, who shoots at the keeper. 41 min: Jakobsson is completely unmarked in the area but can\u2019t control the ball to shoot. Dunn feels bad for her and feeds her back the ball a minute later and her shot goes over. Our first reminder that the US are vulnerable at the attack. 39 min: Rapinoe takes a throw-in a long way from where the ball actually went out but the ref is in a generous mood. The ball eventually finds Heath, who fires over from distance. 36 min: Morgan looks like she took a hit but runs it off and is OK to continue. US have 64% of the possession so far. 33 min: Lavelle doesn\u2019t want Dunn to be the only player trying ambitious shots form distance and unleashes a long-range effort of her own. It\u2019s ambition is not matched by its accuracy. Goal-kick to Sweden. 31 min: Lindahl suddenly believes she is an outfield player and tries to dribble up the field. This does not go well and she clatters the ball out for a US throw in. The US don\u2019t do much with it. 30 min: Heath has plenty of space on the right, and a few tricks get her into the box where she wins a corner, which she takes. The ball is driven into the near post and Lavelle gets a touch but Lindahl is able to gather and clear. 27 min: Sweden play it across the back as both teams catch their collective breaths. Dunn and Rapinoe have been good down the left, but O\u2019Hara and Heath have had plenty of joy down the right too. 24 min: It\u2019s still 0-0 in Chile v Thailand, so both teams are going out at the moment. Rapinoe has a good chance after she\u2019s played in by Lavelle but her shot hits the side netting. 21 min: This is a very fast-paced game. Luckily for the players, it\u2019s a cool-ish evening. Jakobsson romps through the US midfield before laying it off for Asllani, whose shot is straight at Naeher. There were doubts about the US keeper, but she\u2019s been solid so far. 18 min: Peter Oh has some thoughts on VAR: \u201cI wonder if the VAR manual is in the form of wordless cartoons, like IKEA\u2019s assembly instruction booklets. Sometimes I feel like the blob-shaped assembler character, with a question mark-filled thought bubble over my head as I try to understand how things are supposed to fit together.\u201d 17 min: A brilliant ball from Mewis, which slices across the Sweden backline. Morgan gets on the end of it but the finish does not do justice to the pass. \u201cHigh press. Making Naeher play the ball. Sweden came to play,\u201d writes Beau Dure. 15 min: Dunn and Rapinoe are linking up nicely on the left. Mewis shoots from distance but Lindahl stoops down and gathers it well. Sweden then try their own long-range shot, which Naeher handles comfortably. That\u2019s her biggest test of the World Cup so far. 12 min: Another corner for the US. Dunn has another shot from distance as a clearance falls at her feet on the edge of the penalty area. This one is better than her first but goes over again. The US are all over Sweden at the moment. 10 min: Dunn breaks up a Sweden attack - and launches Rapinoe up the leftwing. But the move breaks down when O\u2019Hara tumbles over her own feet. Heath wins a corner on the next attack. This is nothing like that defensive masterclass by Sweden in their 2016 Olympic victory over the US. 7 min: Dunn has a shot from distance but it flies over. Well, we knew the US like to attack. They have done nothing to disprove that. 5 min: There was a VAR check to see if there was an offside leading up the US goal. There wasn\u2019t. Sweden made a lot of changes going into this game and that could be to blame for the chaotic defending for that goal. Sweden fans must hope so. A stepover from Rapinoe wins a corner, the first of the game. She takes it too: and what that about Sweden being a sterner test for the US? The Swedes fail to clear the ball as it bobbles across goal and Horan pokes home from 0.0002cm out. 2 min: The US attack straight away but Sweden counter and spend more time - 42 seconds - in the US half than Chile and Thailand did in the entirety of the first two matches. 1 min: And we\u2019re off. The US are in all-white and Sweden are in their famous yellow and blue. Here\u2019s K\u00e1ri Tulinius on Sweden\u2019s chances today: \u201cNobody expects Sweden to beat the US, and while I\u2019d be surprised if they did, I wouldn\u2019t be flabbergasted. The team has a settled way of playing and does so well. They lost the 2016 Olympics final thanks to an uncharacteristic defensive calamity by Linda Sembrant, and if they avoid that kind of error, they\u2019ll have half a chance against the US. Only half a chance, mind you.\u201d We have a pretty full house - no surprise as Sweden and the US are among the best-supported teams at the World Cup. And the teams are out. The most nervous person in the tunnel appeared to be the ref, who took several deep breaths. Maybe she\u2019s thinking about VAR. The interesting thing for the US today will be how they cope with a team that actually musters a shot on target. While the Americans have the best attack in the world, their defence is more than a little shaky against the best teams. And Sweden are a very good team. This game is likely to tell us a lot about how far the reigning champions can go in the tournament. Hubert O\u2019Hearn emails in with a prediction: \u201cNot to be a complete buzz kill, but I\u2019ll be surprised if the USA doesn\u2019t completely overrun Sweden in the 4-1, 5-2 fashion. Thing is, both teams will enjoy beating the other, but the choice of meeting Canada or Spain is a bit of a toss-up threat Entertainment\u2019s hope is that as the result doesn\u2019t truly matter, Sweden will engage the Americans across the pitch and thus supply the rest of the round of 16 with some worthwhile scouting tape. And if the USA somehow lose? Journos charge your batteries as the simmering feuds within the US ranks will explode after the match. Good times!\u201d Both Sweden and the US are through already. A win or a draw for the US will see them go through as group winners, while a Sweden victory will win them the group. The reward for the winner is a meeting with Spain, the runner-up will face Canada, which could be very interesting if the US finish second. However, the group winner would be on a collision course with hosts and favourites France in the quarters. The runners-up would be in the same quarter-final bracket as Germany. As you may recall there is a little history in this one. At the 2016 Olympics Sweden played the revolutionary 136-0-0 formations, frustrating the US in a game that ended with a penalty shootout victory for the Swedes. Guardian columnist Hope Solo ended up calling Sweden \u201ccowards\u201d for their tactics, a comment which ended her US career - she would almost certainly have been playing today if she hadn\u2019t spoken out. We asked Hope for her thoughts on those comments three years on, and she was good enough to write about it for us. Here\u2019s what she said: It was a strange Olympics for us. Our team wasn\u2019t in great form and we had a lack of preparation. There was a lot going on, and we were not focused. Sweden had played an incredibly defensive game and essentially stopped playing any kind of offense. I made comments straight after the match about the US losing to a \u201cbunch of cowards\u201d. Not the best choice of words but in that moment I felt they didn\u2019t play a courageous game. In conveying what I thought was the exact opposite of \u201ccourageous\u201d, cowardly was what popped into my head. Of course, the loss was entirely down to our own lack of preparation. You can read the full column here: Meanwhile, Chile take on Thailand in the group\u2019s other game, which will start at the same time. We\u2019ll provide updates.

      "bodyText": "If the group-deciding match against Sweden was supposed to be the USA\u2019s first test in this Women\u2019s World Cup, then the Americans passed with flying red, white and blue. A goal from midfielder Lindsey Horan put the defending champions on the front foot in just the third minute, and they continued to put pressure on a Swedish team that was supposed to give the Americans trouble. With an extra goal from Tobin Heath, that was later changed to a Swedish own-goal, the USA won 2-0. With the result, the US women\u2019s national team have topped Group F and will face Spain on Monday in Reims, the site of their record-setting 13-0 tournament opener against Thailand. Sweden, dropping down to second in the group, will face Canada in Paris in the last 16. \u201cI\u2019m proud the team showed really well and we got some great goals,\u201d said defender Becky Sauerbrunn. Coming into Thursday\u2019s Group F closer, the narrative was whether the Americans might be better off losing so they could avoid a potential meeting with France in the quarter-final. But the US went full throttle against Sweden, dominating possession and creating constant danger without easing off. Both teams made seven changes from their previous matches, but while the US coach, Jill Ellis, was merely reverting back to what has become the first-choice starting lineup, Swedish manager Peter Gerhardsson was resting some of his go-to starters, such as veteran defender Nilla Fischer and forward Lina Hurtig. Julie Ertz was left out for what US Soccer termed a \u201chip contusion\u201d in a \u201cprecautionary\u201d decision but it sure looked like Ellis was resting one of her most important players. \u201cI\u2019m smiling ear to ear because they had such a great performance with two fantastic goals and everyone that stepped on the pitch was fantastic,\u201d Ertz said after the game. The result wasn\u2019t crucial either way \u2013 both teams were already through to the knockout stage of the tournament \u2013 and neither side said they wanted to avoid a particular team, such as hosts France. But Gerhardsson had clearly left out more crucial players than Ellis had chosen to. \u201cWe had a solid game with the players that we had and now we\u2019re looking forward to Monday\u2019s game and having fresh legs,\u201d said Sweden\u2019s Kosovare Asllani. No matter. The Americans, who have emphasized building confidence and momentum, finished Thursday exactly how they wanted: feeling good and in form. The win may not have exorcised the ghosts of the 2016 Olympics and Sweden\u2019s win there that has haunted the Americans ever since, but at least they can now move on and focus on the rest of the World Cup. There were no new goal celebrations to rile up anti-US fans as with the previous two games \u2013 the USA\u2019s dominance will have to do as a talking point. \u201cWe don\u2019t focus on how other teams view us, but I\u2019d hope if teams are watching us play, they see we are a complete team,\u201d said defender Crystal Dunn. \u201cWe\u2019re not just a high press team. We\u2019re a possession team, we want to move the ball and go for opportunities to catch teams out of their positions.

Some state and national Republicans, worried that Moore is too polarizing and could jeopardize what should otherwise be a reliable Republican seat, have discouraged him from entering the race. Republicans see retaking the Alabama seat as a top priority in 2020. \u201cAlabama can do better than Roy Moore,\u201d the state\u2019s senior senator, Republican Richard Shelby, told reporters shortly before Moore\u2019s announcement. He declined to say what he would do to try blocking Moore but said he believed \u201ca lot\u201d of Republican groups would oppose him. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, concurred in a brief interview with the Associated Press before the announcement. \u201cHe can do what he wants to, but we\u2019re certainly going to oppose him in every way,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said. Donald Trump tweeted last month that Moore \u201ccannot win\u201d and said Republicans need to retake the seat in the once reliably red state. \u201cRepublicans cannot allow themselves to again lose the Senate seat in the Great State of Alabama,\u201d Trump wrote. Moore brushed aside that criticism on Thursday, saying the people of Alabama are angry and want Washington to stay out of their elections \u201cCan I win? Yes I can win,\u201d he said. The Democratic senatorial campaigncommittee spokesman, Stewart Boss, said national Republicans who supported Moore\u2019s 2017 campaign \u201chave nobody to blame but themselves for the chaotic primary that\u2019s escalating in Alabama\u201d. Jones said in a statement that Moore\u2019s candidacy \u201cwill make a divisive Republican primary even more extreme\u201d. During the 2017 race, six women accused Moore of pursuing romantic or sexual relationships with them when they were teenagers as young as 14 and he was an assistant district attorney in his 30s. Two accused him of assault or molestation. Moore denied the accusations and has said he considered his 2017 defeat, when he lost to Jones by 22,000 votes out of 1.3m cast, \u201ca fraud\u201d.

Instead the 2050 date was dropped into a footnote that stated: \u201cFor a large majority of member states, climate neutrality must be achieved by 2050.\u201d</p> <p>The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told her fellow leaders that the EU needed to signal ambition ahead of that meeting. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, called for the EU to agree an unambiguous target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p> <p>But the Central European trio stood their ground against any mention of 2050 in the main EU summit communiqu\u00e9.</p> <p>The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, had quipped on his arrival at the summit: \u201cWhy should we decide 31 years ahead of time what will happen in 2050?\u201d</p> <p>Inside the meeting, Babi\u0161 questioned why Europe should act when emissions in China were rising, prompting a retort from the German chancellor. She countered that the Chinese were taking action that would mean a reduction in Chinese emissions after 2030.</p> <p>While supporters of the 2050 plan were disappointed, they are not giving up. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if the EU commits to climate neutrality, it\u2019s when,\u201d one diplomat said.</p> <p>A large majority of EU member states support the aim of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p> <p>Hopes had grown in recent days, after Slovakia, Bulgaria and some Baltic states announced their support for the 2050 target, seeing economic gains from the transition to a green economy. \u201cWe have come to the conclusion that this is a hell of an opportunity,\u201d the Latvian prime minister, Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161, told his fellow leaders.</p> <p>Earlier a senior EU diplomat said the debate among member states had moved on significantly since earlier discussions in March, when countries were \u201cvery divided\u201d. They said: \u201cWe still do not have unanimity, but an overwhelming majority of member states, including member states you would never expect of being ready to accept such an objective are going in that direction.\u201d</p> <p>The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, wants the climate summit in September to put the world on a path to limiting global warming to 1.5C \u2013 a non-binding aspiration of the 2015 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\">Paris accord</a>.</p> <p>Guterres wrote to European council president, Donald Tusk, last month and called on him to demonstrate the leadership of the EU. \u201cI write to you today both as a G20 member and as a leader who I believe can bring the ingenuity needed to transform our economic systems and avert the negative impacts of a world with high levels of carbon emissions \u2013 from rising levels of pollution to costly natural disasters,\u201d he stated.</p> <p>The letter calls for a change of course to \u201cachieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050\u201d and specifies that leaders should curtail current coal-burning power stations and discontinue new ones beyond 2020.</p> <p>Responding to the EU\u2019s failure to agree a 2050 target, green campaigners called on the EU to hold an emergency climate summit ahead of the UN meeting in September.</p> <p>\u201cHollow words can\u2019t rebuild a house flattened in a mudslide or repay a farmer who\u2019s lost their harvest to drought, said Greenpeace EU climate policy advisor Sebastian Mang. \u201cMerkel and Macron failed to convince Poland and bring others on board. With people on the streets demanding action and warnings from scientists that the window to respond is closing fast, our governments had a chance to lead from the front and put Europe on a rapid path to full decarbonisation. They blew it.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "A trio of central European countries have blocked the EU from inching closer to a net-zero carbon emissions target for 2050. European leaders meeting in Brussels sparred over the EU\u2019s role in tackling the unfolding climate emergency, which threatens to significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat, poverty and destruction of wildlife around the world. Dashing earlier hopes of a compromise, Poland and the Czech Republic refused to sign up to a text that referred to a climate-neutral EU by 2050 \u2013 a target that was already seen as too vague by green activists. In a further blow, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, joined his neighbours in opposing the EU text, despite earlier signs the country was ready to compromise. Supporters of the 2050 plan hoped the EU could show it was moving in that direction ahead of a major UN climate summit in September. Instead the 2050 date was dropped into a footnote that stated: \u201cFor a large majority of member states, climate neutrality must be achieved by 2050.\u201d The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told her fellow leaders that the EU needed to signal ambition ahead of that meeting. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, called for the EU to agree an unambiguous target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But the Central European trio stood their ground against any mention of 2050 in the main EU summit communiqu\u00e9. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, had quipped on his arrival at the summit: \u201cWhy should we decide 31 years ahead of time what will happen in 2050?\u201d Inside the meeting, Babi\u0161 questioned why Europe should act when emissions in China were rising, prompting a retort from the German chancellor. She countered that the Chinese were taking action that would mean a reduction in Chinese emissions after 2030. While supporters of the 2050 plan were disappointed, they are not giving up. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if the EU commits to climate neutrality, it\u2019s when,\u201d one diplomat said. A large majority of EU member states support the aim of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Hopes had grown in recent days, after Slovakia, Bulgaria and some Baltic states announced their support for the 2050 target, seeing economic gains from the transition to a green economy. \u201cWe have come to the conclusion that this is a hell of an opportunity,\u201d the Latvian prime minister, Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161, told his fellow leaders. Earlier a senior EU diplomat said the debate among member states had moved on significantly since earlier discussions in March, when countries were \u201cvery divided\u201d. They said: \u201cWe still do not have unanimity, but an overwhelming majority of member states, including member states you would never expect of being ready to accept such an objective are going in that direction.\u201d The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, wants the climate summit in September to put the world on a path to limiting global warming to 1.5C \u2013 a non-binding aspiration of the 2015 Paris accord. Guterres wrote to European council president, Donald Tusk, last month and called on him to demonstrate the leadership of the EU. \u201cI write to you today both as a G20 member and as a leader who I believe can bring the ingenuity needed to transform our economic systems and avert the negative impacts of a world with high levels of carbon emissions \u2013 from rising levels of pollution to costly natural disasters,\u201d he stated. The letter calls for a change of course to \u201cachieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050\u201d and specifies that leaders should curtail current coal-burning power stations and discontinue new ones beyond 2020. Responding to the EU\u2019s failure to agree a 2050 target, green campaigners called on the EU to hold an emergency climate summit ahead of the UN meeting in September. \u201cHollow words can\u2019t rebuild a house flattened in a mudslide or repay a farmer who\u2019s lost their harvest to drought, said Greenpeace EU climate policy advisor Sebastian Mang. \u201cMerkel and Macron failed to convince Poland and bring others on board. With people on the streets demanding action and warnings from scientists that the window to respond is closing fast, our governments had a chance to lead from the front and put Europe on a rapid path to full decarbonisation. They blew it.\u201d",

There had been some expectations in the markets that a couple of them could vote for an increase because of concerns that rising wages will push up inflation.</p> <p> However, figures this week showed the annual inflation rate fell to the bank\u2019s target of 2%, easing pressure to raise rates. Also, uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union remains despite a Brexit deadline extension and are keeping a lid on growth. Only around 20% of respondents to a Bank of England survey think Brexit uncertainty will be resolved by the end of this year.</p> <p> Though Britain\u2019s departure date from the EU has been pushed back to Oct. 31, there is still huge uncertainty as to whether the country will leave then. The Conservative Party contest to replace Prime Minister Theresa May has meant there\u2019s been little progress on Brexit in recent months and concerns are rising that Britain could crash out without a deal on future relations with the EU.

      "bodyText": "A late PS: Barani Krishnan, Senior Commodities Analyst at Investing.com, suggests the White House is caught in two minds over Iran: \u201cTrump has muddled his response to the Iranian situation, first tweeting that shooting the drone down was a \u2018big mistake\u2019, then backtracking in comments to reporters that it was probably the actions of a \u2018stupid\u2019 individual general.\u201d \u201cThe president seems to be bending over backwards these days not to add to geopolitical tensions that could send oil up 5-6% in a day like this. With his reelection bid in, low oil, and gas prices at the pump, seems to be Trump\u2019s primary concern. That\u2019s why he\u2019s even suggested being open to making peace with Tehran, despite the continued noises against Iran by some in his administration.\u201d Boom! Hopes that US interest rates will be cut next month have sent Wall Street to a new all-time closing high. The S&amp;P 500 has ended the day up 28 points at 2,954, a gain of 0.9%, following yesterday\u2019s dovish performance by the Federal Reserve. The Dow and the Nasdaq also gained around 0.9%, to finish close to their own highest levels. Predictions that the Fed will deliver on its pledge to act appropriately by cutting borrowing costs at its July meeting have helped investors ignore the threat of military action in the Gulf -- while energy companies obviously benefited from the jump in crude prices. Goodnight! GW US oil prices have now posted their biggest one-day gain in five months. Donald Trump\u2019s warning that Iran has made a \u201cvery big mistake\u201d by shooting down one of America\u2019s RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance drones has loomed over energy markets today. Here\u2019s Marketwatch\u2019s take: Language from Trump \u201chas driven up oil as traders fear supply in the Middle East might be squeezed by Washington D.C. potentially taking a tougher stance on the country,\u201d said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets. July West Texas Intermediate oil CLN19, +5.80% rose $2.89, or 5.4%, to settle at $56.65 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was the highest front-month contract finish since late May and biggest one-day dollar and percentage gain since December, according to Dow Jones Market Data. This, however, might be reassuring... This won\u2019t calm nerves in the oil market: Are investors getting carried away by the prospect of a US interest rate cut? They should remember that central bankers are becoming more cautious because the global economy looks weaker - not really a cause of jubilation. Fawad Razaqzada of Forex.com reckons the rally could \u201cturn to despair\u201d once markets have digested the situation. He points out: Rates are being cut because the global economy is, or perceived to be, slowing down amid the escalation of geopolitical risks. With global interest rates already so low, how much of a boost would the economy get from (the promise of) a 25 or 50 basis point reduction in interest rates? Granted, it will increase the marginal supply of cheap credit further, but that is not the issue here; it is all about marginal demand, or lack thereof, for cheap loans from consumers and businesses because of the latest or upcoming interest rate cuts. I think the law of diminishing returns apply here. Also, with central banks keeping rates so low for such a long period of time, what will happen if the economy were to deteriorate even further? Will the Fed and other central banks have any more monetary policy tools left at their disposals then? And what about a situation where we see a sudden economic recovery or a big jump in inflation? Surely in this event, central banks will have to tighten their belts quickly, potentially choking off growth. It\u2019s important to remember that while Washington and Tehran agree that an American spy drone has been shot down by Iranian forces, they don\u2019t agree on where it was flying at the time. Iranian media said the aircraft was hit inside Iranian airspace, near Kuh Mobarak, on Iran\u2019s southern coast. The US say the Global Hawk drone was flying in international airspace when it was shot down by an Iranian missile over the Strait of Hormuz. Navy Captain Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, insists: \u201cIranian reports that the aircraft was over Iran are false. This was an unprovoked attack on a U.S. surveillance asset in international airspace.\u201d But Ali Shamkhani, secretary for the Supreme National Security Council, is just as adamant that the aircraft had breached Iranian borders, saying: \u201cWe will defend Iran\u2019s airspace and maritime boundaries with all our might. It doesn\u2019t matter which country\u2019s aircraft cross our airspace.\u201d Such talk is raising concerns of military conflict in the Middle East, which would cause oil supply disruption. That\u2019s why oil prices are pushing sharply higher this afternoon: US crude: up 5.8% at $59.91 per barrel, a three-week high Brent crude: up 4.3% at $64.52 per barrel, also a three week high And here\u2019s our latest news story on the incident: US crude oil is now up nearly 6%, on fears of disruption in the Gulf. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbelligerent\u201d tweet accusing Iran of a \u2018big mistake\u2019 is driving oil up. Oil has extended gains on this response from the White House, which sounds quite belligerent. West Texas Intermediate is up 5% to 56.76, while Brent has broken up above $64. Oil has risen to its best in three weeks and now looks to have moved out of its bottoming formation. Oil is on track for its biggest daily rally in five months, driven by concerns that the US and Iran could be heading for military conflict. Newsflash: President Trump has tweeted that Iran made \u201ca very big mistake\u201d by shooting down a US military drone overnight. That has send the oil price soaring even higher. US crude is now up 4.5% today at over $56 per barrel, its highest level since 30 May. Nearly every one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones industrial average are up too. The top riser is Nike (+2.45%), followed by several tech firms including Cisco (+2%) and IBM (+1.7%). JP Morgan, though, is a rare faller - down 0.4%. Lower interest rates aren\u2019t good news for banks, as they erode the profit margin between borrowers and savers. President Donald Trump is excited by today\u2019s Wall Street action: With the re-election campaign kicking off, the president will use the stock market as proof that he\u2019s doing a good job. He\u2019ll also take the credit, pointing to his campaign to force the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates and start cutting (as they may do next month). Every sector of the US stock markets has risen today, helping to drive the S&amp;P to today\u2019s new all-time peak. Energy stocks are leading the rally, up 1.8%, followed by technology (+1.34%), miners (+1.2%), healthcare (+1%) and industrial companies (+1%). As explained in the introduction to today\u2019s blog, investors are bullish today because America\u2019s top central banker has turned more dovish. Fed chair Jerome Powell told reporters last night that \u201cThe case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,\u201d and that his committee wanted to see more economic data before making their next move. The Fed also dropped its pledge to be \u201cpatient\u201d, replacing it with a promise to take appropriate action to protect the economy (which is being interpreted as protecting the stock market too). So traders now reckon a July rate cut is hammered down, the only question is whether it\u2019s a small cut or a big one. Boom! Wall Street has hit a new all-time high at the start of trading in New York. The S&amp;P 500 index has jumped to 2,599 points, it\u2019s highest ever intra-day level. Investors are piling into shares following yesterday\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, when America\u2019s central bank dropped loud hints that it will cut interest rates this year -- probably starting next month. Wall Street has concluded that the Fed will do whatever it takes to maintain the current rally -- focusing on markets, rather than on inflation and unemployment. That will fuel concerns that we could be in a stock market bubble -- but anyone whose been been holding onto cash this year rather than stocks and bonds has missed out! Here\u2019s the opening prices: Dow Jones industrial average: up 253 points or 0.96% at 26,757 S&amp;P 500: up 28 points or 0.99% at 2,955 points. Nasdaq: up 92 points or 1.16% at 8,079 points. Having read the Bank of England minutes, Thomas Pugh of Capital Economics reckons the Monetary Policy Committee is more worried that Britain could crash out of the EU without a deal. He writes: Clearly the weaker economic news has played its part in causing the MPC\u2019s dovish shift, but there are also signs that the Committee is becoming more concerned about the possibility of a no deal Brexit. Indeed, instead of chastising the market for underestimating how much interest rates might rise as it did in May, the MPC pointed out \u201cthe ongoing tension between the MPC\u2019s forecast\u2026 of a smooth Brexit and the assumptions about alternative Brexit scenarios that were priced into financial market variables\u201d. The minutes are online here. Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take on the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision: The Bank of England kept its main interest rate on hold at 0.75% on Thursday and warned that a combination of Brexit worries and global trade tensions was weighing on growth. All nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee backed the decision to not change rates. There had been some expectations in the markets that a couple of them could vote for an increase because of concerns that rising wages will push up inflation. However, figures this week showed the annual inflation rate fell to the bank\u2019s target of 2%, easing pressure to raise rates. Also, uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union remains despite a Brexit deadline extension and are keeping a lid on growth. Only around 20% of respondents to a Bank of England survey think Brexit uncertainty will be resolved by the end of this year. Though Britain\u2019s departure date from the EU has been pushed back to Oct. 31, there is still huge uncertainty as to whether the country will leave then. The Conservative Party contest to replace Prime Minister Theresa May has meant there\u2019s been little progress on Brexit in recent months and concerns are rising that Britain could crash out without a deal on future relations with the EU. The favorite, Boris Johnson, has indicated that he\u2019s prepared to go ahead with a \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit. Most economists, including those at the Bank of England, think that leaving without a deal will cause huge damage to the British economy as trade with the EU is hit by tariffs and other disruptions. \u201cDomestically, the perceived likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has risen,\u201d rate-setters said in the minutes to Thursday\u2019s policy meeting. They also said that trade tensions have intensified and that economic growth is set to stall in the second quarter following a 0.5% pickup in the first three months. In its forecasts last month, the bank had projected growth of 0.2% in the second quarter. There is something slightly odd about today\u2019s minutes from the Bank of England, as it leaves interest rates on hold. On one hand, the Monetary Policy Committee sounds more concerned about Brexit (\u201cthe perceived likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has risen\u201d), the economy (no growth is expected in the current quarter) and the balance of risks (\u201cdownside risks to growth have increased\u201d). And yet... they still expect to raise interest rates at a gradual pace over the next couple of years. Why hasn\u2019t the Bank\u2019s guidance changed, if the economic picture has darkened? Are they afraid to sound too gloomy, or are they simply hoping that conditions pick up? Chris Giles of the Financial Times suggests that any dissenters on the MPC aren\u2019t prepared to break cover yet. Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University suspects that the Bank of England could cut interest rates in the coming months, rather than raise them. He tells me: MPC members decide on interest rates based on our economic performance as well as financial/economic policy risks. On the economic front, monthly GDP data suggests an economy which is at best weak (GDP fell by 0.4% in April) and CPI inflation is equal to the 2% target. Hence, economic front news suggests no need for an interest rate hike any time soon. If anything, economic front news points to an interest rate cut. Developments in financial and economic policy risk are currently cancelling each other. Indeed, UK financial risk (which combines information from the bond, equity, banking and foreign exchange market) remains low but economic policy risk, which largely relates to no-deal Brexit, is slightly on the rise. As we move towards the October deadline, there is a chance that both risk variables will escalate. Such a scenario will put MPC members under pressure to cut the policy rate.... Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, believes there\u2019s no chance of a UK interest rate rise until the next Brexit deadline. \u201cWith Brexit unresolved, it is now practically inconceivable that there will be a rate hike between now and October, despite GDP growth being close to potential. MPC members have been doing the rounds of late, making hawkish comments and it\u2019s easy to see why. The labour market is tight and prices are rising in sectors sensitive to the output gap, but \u2013 for now \u2013 this is being outweighed by weak goods inflation. With headline CPI on target, that\u2019s a decision for another day. \u201cUK businesses continue to be haunted by the looming Brexit deadline of October 31st and the spectre of uncertainty is weighing on activity. Even if a No Deal exit is averted for now, the cost of delay will mount if negotiations are extended once again. Consumers may receive some respite; above inflation earnings growth and continued low interest rates mean UK households have a bit more spending power, which is supporting the economy. With the end of Carney\u2019s tenure on the horizon, a rate rise might be an issue for his successor to grapple with.\u201d With summer holidays looming, the Bank\u2019s gloomy forecasts haven\u2019t helped families planning a trip across the Channel. Sterling has dropped by almost half a euro cent to \u20ac1.121, wiping out all yesterday\u2019s rally. The pound is also surrendering some of its early gains against the US dollar, and is now back below $1.27. Bad news for workers: the Bank of England\u2019s economists reckon that UK earnings growth \u201cmight have levelled off\u201d. Better news: They also predict that inflation (which fell to 2% last month) will fall further in the coming months. The nine policymakers on the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee were unanimous this month. They all agreed to leave interest rates at 0.75%, and still collectively agree that (should Brexit go smoothly) it makes sense to raise interest rates over the next couple of years. The minutes say: All members judged at this meeting that the existing stance of monetary policy was appropriate. The Committee continued to judge that, were the economy to develop broadly in line with its May Inflation Report projections that included an assumption of a smooth Brexit, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% target at a conventional horizon. With Brexit now delayed until (at least) 31 October, the Bank of England fears that businesses will keep sitting on their hands rather than buy new equipment and machinery. The minutes of today\u2019s meeting state: The underlying pattern of relatively strong household consumption growth but weak business investment had persisted. Surveys suggested that companies expected uncertainty to persist at elevated levels, and there were no clear signs that investment growth would pick up ahead of the October Brexit deadline. The Bank also points to the recent shutdowns in the car industry (as manufacturers braced for a no-deal Brexit that never came). It hopes that car production will accelerate over the summer: Weakness in motor vehicle production, related to some car manufacturers\u2019 Brexit contingency plans, was likely to push down on Q2 GDP growth, but push up on Q3 growth The Bank has cut its growth forecasts due to the damage caused by Brexit worries, the unwinding of stockpiling, and by the trade conflict between the US and China. In a statement, it says: Globally, trade tensions have intensified. Domestically, the perceived likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has risen. Trade concerns have contributed to volatility in global equity prices and corporate bond spreads, as well as falls in industrial metals prices. Forward interest rates in major economies have fallen materially further. Increased Brexit uncertainties have put additional downward pressure on UK forward interest rates and led to a decline in the sterling exchange rate. As expected, recent UK data have been volatile, in large part due to Brexit-related effects on financial markets and businesses. After growing by 0.5% in 2019 Q1, GDP is now expected to be flat in Q2. That in part reflects an unwind of the positive contribution to GDP in the first quarter from companies in the United Kingdom and the European Union building stocks significantly ahead of recent Brexit deadlines. Ouch! The Bank of England has also lowered its growth forecast for the second quarter of 2019, to zero. It had previously forecast 0.2% growth in April-June. Breaking! The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rate on hold at 0.75%. More to follow... It\u2019s nearly time for the main news of the day - the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy decision. The City is confident that the BoE will leave interest rates on hold today, at 0.75%. It probably won\u2019t make any changes to its quantitative easing programme either (which holds \u00a3435bn of mainly UK government bonds). But investors want to hear the Bank\u2019s views on Brexit, the state of the UK economy, and whether any policymakers are leaning towards an interest rate rise, or even a cut (just as America\u2019s Federal Reserve prepares to start cutting). Sam Cooper, Vice President of Market Risk Solutions at Silicon Valley Bank, sets the scene: \u201cMarket attention turns to the bank of England in this week\u2019s central bank relay. Participants will be searching for clues from the MPC as to the future path of monetary policy, with retail sales disappointing and inflation running on target, the case for the Bank of England to follow the lead from its US counterpart is gradually building. While sterling enjoys some welcome respite after last night\u2019s dovish hold from the Fed, any dissent within the committee in favour of an interest rate cut or reference to more accommodative policy in the statement could see the pound quickly reverse its recent bout of strength against the dollar.\u201d Iran\u2019s threat of \u2018consequences\u2019 against America will fuel fears of military conflict in the Gulf region. The Strait of Hormuz handles around 20% of the world\u2019s oil (tankers from Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE and Saudi Arabia\u2019s east coast all pass through on their way to the rest of the world) Economist Alastair Ross suggests markets are taking the drone shooting quite well: However, that could change if America takes a robust response to this latest incident (Donald Trump hasn\u2019t tweeted yet today....) Iran\u2019s foreign ministry has now weighed in, criticising America for illegally (it claims) violating its airspace. Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi says: \u201cAny such violations of Iran\u2019s borders are strongly condemned ... We warn of the consequences of such illegal and provocative measures.\u201d There\u2019s another reason oil is rising -- yesterday a rocket hit an Iraqi compound housing several international oil companies, including the US multinational ExxonMobil. That has heightened concerns that oil shipments from the Middle East could be disrupted. Crude oil prices have jumped sharply after Iran shot down a US spy drone, further straining relations between the two countries. US crude oil has surged by around 3% today to $55.53 per barrel, its highest level since the end of May. Brent crude, sourced from the North Sea, has also rallied, touching $63.88 per barrel for the first time since 10th June. The rally comes as Iran accused Washington of breaching its national sovereignty, after shooting down an unmanned US drone. According to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, the drone was flying in Iranian airspace, near Kuhmobarak in the southern province of Hormozgan, when it was shot. The US military, though, says its drone was in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz at the time. This incident comes just a week after the US accused Iran of attacking two tankers in the nearby Gulf of Oman, Our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour expains: Both Washington and Tehran insist they are intent on avoiding a war as tensions build over the consequences of the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018, but fears that an accidental chain of events will lead to escalation and finally a military confrontation are growing. The shooting down of the drone came as the US president, Donald Trump, was briefed on the details of a separate incident: a further missile strike in Saudi Arabia that appeared to come from Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, said on Wednesday in relation to the Saudi missile strike: \u201cWe are closely monitoring the situation and continuing to consult with our partners and allies.\u201d More here: Just in: UK retail sales fell in May, as the poor weather deterred people from buying new clothes. Shoppers bought 0.5% less stuff in May than in April, the Office for National Statistics reports, with the amount spent dropping by 0.3%. Britain suffered some rather cold weather last month, with the May Bank Holiday particularly inclement. This appears to have hit clothing sales, which slumped by 4.5% month-on-month, the ninth monthly decline in a row. The ONS says: Evidence from retailers suggested that the poor weather may have delayed the sales for summer ranges. Department stores are also struggling, with sales down again. Some traders reckon America\u2019s central bank could pull out its bazooka next month, and slash US interest rates by a chunky 50 basis points. That would be a serious reversal of its recent policy of raising interest rates, and suggest it is worried about growth prospects. Newsflash: Norway\u2019s central bank has defied the prevailing mood by raising interest rates. The Norges Bank voted to hike borrowing costs from 1% to 1.25%, in response to rising underlying inflation and solid growth. But.... it also acknowledges that other central banks are moving towards cutting rates. The upturn in the Norwegian economy appears to be a little stronger the coming year than projected earlier. On the other hand, there are prospects for weaker external growth and lower foreign interest rates. Retail analyst Patrick O\u2019Brien of GlobalData says Dixons Carphone isn\u2019t keeping up with a fast-moving mobile market: The FT\u2019s Cat Rutter Pooley says the company has disappointed the City: Far more galling for investors is the downgrade to expectations for the coming year. While the statutory pre-tax loss for the year to April was \u00a3259m, its \u201cheadline\u201d pre-tax number was a profit of \u00a3298m. In the new financial year, headline pre-tax profits are set to dip to \u00a3210m. Analysts had expected them to hold flat. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says the mobile phone division is dragging the rest of Dixons Carphone back: The mobile business in particular is on life support, draining capital and resources prior to its integration with the electricals business. The rapidly evolving nature of this segment has threatened to leave Dixons behind and thus, as a matter of urgency, the company has renegotiated its network contracts, although such benefits will take time to wash through. Elsewhere, tepid group revenue growth, lower free cash flow, higher net debt and a previously slashed dividend are far from being cause for celebration. There are some glimmers of hope, however. The electricals part of the business, particularly in the UK and Ireland, is holding its own in terms of revenue and is also seeing market share growth. Ouch! Shares in UK electronics retailer Dixons Carphone have plunged by a quarter in early trading. Dixons Carphone has shocked the City by warning that its UK mobile business will be \u201csignificantly loss making this year\u201d, as it struggles to persuade customers to upgrade their phones. It also posted a statutory pre-tax loss of \u00a3259m for the last financial year, down from a profit of \u00a3289m in 2017-18. Alarmingly for investors, the firm only expects to post profits of around \u00a3210m this financial year; analysts had been expecting a figure of about \u00a3296m. Mobile is a major part of the company\u2019s business, but it could take two years before it breaks even! CEO Alex Baldock warned: In UK mobile, the market is changing in the way we described in December, but doing so faster. So, we\u2019re moving faster to respond: we\u2019ve renegotiated all our legacy network contracts, we\u2019re developing our new customer offer, and are accelerating the integration of Mobile and Electricals into one business. This means taking more pain in the coming year, when Mobile will make a significant loss. Stock markets around the globe are also rallying today, thanks to the prospect that America\u2019s interest rates could be cut next month. In London, the FTSE 100 index has jumped by 30 points, or 0.4%, with European indices also rallying. That follows a strong session in Asia, where China\u2019s CSI 300 surged by 3% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei gained 0.6%. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says the Fed\u2019s dovish twist is driving shares up. We all know that central banks have been data dependent, but it is only now that they have started to acknowledge the weakness in the economic numbers. Last night, the Fed lowered its inflation forecast from 1.8% to 1.5% but , there wasn\u2019t any change in the growth forecast. The reason that the event was dovish came from fact that the Fed\u2019s outlook of the economy isn\u2019t positive; they said the global uncertainties are increasing. They feel it is time to shift the needle of the their monetary policy to spur the growth again or at least not letting the global economy go off the rails. The tantalising scent of a US rate cut is lifting the pound away from the five-month low of $1.2504 struck on Tuesday. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says it\u2019s \u201cquite a chunky move\u201d, helped by the prospect that UK interest rates could be raised in the coming months: Maybe the prospect of a more hawkish Bank of England is helping the pound. At least Mark Carney doesn\u2019t have to deal with a political leader on his case\u2026 Well, not yet anyway. Even so, political uncertainty is still weighing on sterling, Wilson adds: The prospect of Boris Johnson taking Britain out of the EU come October 31st is a risk. There\u2019s now talk of a possible general election if he gets in \u2013 risky, we know what happened to Theresa May. The prospect of a general election would not do anything to remove uncertainty around UK assets. Zero clarity still. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The US dollar is weakening this morning after America\u2019s central bankers dropped a loud hint that they will cut interest rates soon. Last night the Federal Reserve left borrowing costs unchanged, but also revealed that almost every policymaker expects at least one rate cut before the end of 2019. With inflation low, growth slowing, and Donald Trump dropping loud and unsubtle hints, the Fed is now preparing to reverse some of last year\u2019s rate hikes. It adjusted its guidance to the markets, dropping its promise to be patient. Instead, the Fed will \u201cact as appropriate to sustain the expansion\u201d and to \u201cclosely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell told reporters that his FOMC committee wanted a bit more information before acting. He told a press conference: \u201cWe\u2019d like to see if these risks continue to weigh on the outlook. We want to see and we want to react to trends that are sustained, that are genuine.\u201d The markets now reckon this means the Fed is certain to cut its benchmark rate, currently 2.25%-2.5%, at its next meeting in late July. This has, predictably, hurt the US dollar. This has lifted the pound back over $1.27 for the first time in a week, reversing this week\u2019s Brexit-induced losses. Also coming up today Two other central banks will seize the limelight from the Fed. The European Central Bank releases its latest economic bulletin, two days after its president, Mario Draghi, hinted that it implement more stimulus measures. Then at noon UK time, the Bank of England will set interest rates. We\u2019re not expecting any changes, but the minutes of this week\u2019s meeting will show the BoE\u2019s thinking. The agenda 9am BST: European Central Bank economic bulletin 9.30am BST: UK retail sales for May 12pm BST: Bank of England interest rate decision",

But he isn\u2019t strictly right.</p> \n  <p>At the beginning, Johnson did indeed say the UK \u201cmust come out on the 31st October\u201d. But when asked later by the host, <strong>Emily Maitlis</strong>, for an absolute guarantee the UK would leave on 31 October under his stewardship, he said: \u201cMichael [Gove] was guaranteeing to get out by the end of December [2019]. I think that October 31st is eminently feasible.\u201d (Johnson had been responding to a question from Gove about \u201cgetting [a] deal over the line\u201d on or around that date or \u201cripping it up\u201d just to keep to the timetable.)</p> \n  <p>He also spoke later about the importance of leaving with a deal, saying no one wanted a \u201cdisorderly Brexit\u201d.</p> \n  <p>So, it\u2019s \u2013 at best \u2013 debatable whether Johnson was failing to guarantee Brexit in any form on 31 October, or just failing to guarantee having a negotiated settlement done and dusted by that date.</p> \n  <p>However, what is less debatable is the accuracy of Duncan Smith\u2019s \u201ctrade agreement\u201d comment. No such document is on the table for Johnson to have referred to.</p> \n  <p>The portions to be determined prior to Brexit \u2013 and those which <strong>Theresa May</strong> had such trouble getting through Parliament \u2013 are the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration.</p> \n  <p>Broadly speaking, these set out the terms of the UK\u2019s exit and the foundations upon which a future trade deal could be built. Neither is a \u201ctrade agreement\u201d in the most common understanding of that term and no trade deal would be agreed before Brexit.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-20T19:06:19.171Z\">at 8.06pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d0bc8938f082364d7cee0b7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-20T17:58:26.486Z\">6.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Labour party has had its say on the news that <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> and <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> will face each other for the Tory leadership \u2013 and the keys to No 10.</p> \n  <p>There\u2019s perhaps little surprise in the fact that Labour wants a general election. <strong>Andrew Gwynne</strong>, its national campaign coordinator, has said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What a choice: the man who broke the NHS or the man who wants to sell it to Donald Trump.

He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think the members deserve a proper debate about the challenges that face the country and the Conservative party. Now clearly, Brexit is going to be a key issue, but I really hope that the candidates do look beyond that.</p> \n   <p>You have to think back to 1992 since the Conservative party last won a clear overall majority, and even that was a fairly small one, and 2015 was smaller still. If you\u2019re going by age group, you get to 51-year-olds before you find more people willing to vote Conservative than Labour. In 2017 we went backwards in BAME voters, who are a more important part of the electorate in many constituencies \u2013 in the suburbs, small towns.</p> \n   <p>The Tory party is facing some existential political challenges, and the union of the United Kingdom is under greater strain than I have never known it in my lifetime.

But the Commons has to approve recess dates (there is never normally a division, because they are agreed on a cross-party basis) and Labour would probably object if the government tried to start the recess before the new PM takes over. Downing Street has said, anyway, that it won\u2019t do this. But it does look as though the new PM will only have two or three days with the house sitting before recess starts.

There will be no key legislation to pass. Labour could go for a no confidence vote, but they are likely to wait until some Tories, or the DUP, have said they will vote with the opposition, and I would be surprised if that happens on day one. The potential Tory rebels are likely to give the new PM, even Boris Johnson, a chance, and see what he does first.</p> \n  <p>4) No.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/130333640\"> \n   <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> \n    <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> \n     <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13293412\" title=\"View NDL1234\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/13293412\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for NDL1234\"> </a> \n    </div> \n    <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> \n     <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> \n      <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13293412\" title=\"View NDL1234\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">NDL1234</span> </a> \n     </div> \n     <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> \n      <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/130333640\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">20 June 2019 11:13am</a> \n     </div> \n     <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n      <p>@Andrew</p> \n      <p>You have reported the dates of the recess; however it would be interesting to know if any MP raised objection to this and suggested they should be sitting to hold a new PM to account, deal with Brexit, actually carry out some work . . .</p>\n     </div> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </figure> \n  <p>As far as I can see, at business questions no MP did object to the proposed date of the recess, although Labour\u2019s Valerie Vaz asked for clarification as to when the new PM would take over.

Gove\u2019s strengths are that he is the best parliamentary debater in the party, an authentic Brexiter and activist minister, and that he has the zeal to pose more of a threat to Johnson in the final round than Hunt. But for some Tory MPs being a Brexiter and something of a zealot are drawbacks, and Hunt supporters are already asking MPs if they really want a leadership contest that would turn into a \u201cpsychodrama\u201d between the two Vote Leave leaders who fell out bitterly in 2016 when Gove sabotaged Johnson\u2019s leadership bid.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/1141681844846505984\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Clear what Hunt's argument is in the two remaining hours before voting opens for next round. \"If you want a match fit world leader who can beat Mr Johnson and avoid the psycho drama of Boris v Gove, support Hunt,\" says a campaign source.</p>\u2014 Heather Stewart (@GuardianHeather) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/1141681844846505984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 20, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p><strong>2) Sajid Javid\u2019s defeat was expected \u2013 but over the last 10 days he revived his campaign sufficiently to enable him to leave the contest with his standing in the party enhanced rather than damaged</strong>. What happens to the 34 votes he got this morning will decide whether it is Gove or Hunt on the final ballot.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) The size of Johnson\u2019s lead, and the two-vote gap between Gove and Hunt, means there is ample scope for tactical vote lending this afternoon</strong>. The Johnson camp think beating Hunt would be easier than beating Gove (and a ConservativeHome survey appears to back this up).

Of course, he denies all this \u2014 and, like the other candidates, promises to get a renegotiated withdrawal agreement out of the EU.</p> \n   <p>Perhaps he will. Most likely he will not. But one thing is for sure, having finally arrived in Downing Street, Mr Johnson won\u2019t be in a hurry to leave it. Opportunism knocks.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Perhaps the Evening Standard has just got it wrong. But Osborne has always been an astute political observer, and he knows Johnson very well.</p> \n  <p>A better way of reading the editorial is to see it as evidence of just how effective Johnson has been at giving different impressions to different audience. This might be a simple matter of lying (for which Johnson has some form), but it may be more a case of constructive ambiguity being deployed on an Olympian scale (ie, far beyond anything Tony Blair managed). This is the conclusion that Bloomberg\u2019s political editor <strong>Robert Hutton</strong> came to when he investigated <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-20/what-is-boris-johnson-s-brexit-plan-mps-aren-t-really-listening\">why Tories have such different views as to what Johnson will do.</a> He explains his findings in a Twitter thread starting here. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobDotHutton/status/1141643297519263745\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So here's a fun game for political correspondents.

I think I have the strongest case for being the other one, a change candidate that can win over the nation eventually in a general election with Jeremy Corbyn.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And <strong>Michael Gove</strong> said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d.

But, unlike May, he is going down fighting, and in his speech to the annual Mansion House dinner tonight he is going to effectively accuse all remaining Tory leadership candidates of failing to be honest with the public. And he is also going to tell them, in terms, that holding a second referendum may be the only option available to them.</p> \n  <p>By the time Hammond delivers his speech, the two final leadership ballots for Tory MPs will have concluded and we will know the names of the two candidates on the ballot paper for party members. Boris Johnson will be one of them. The other will almost certainly be Jeremy Hunt or Michael Gove; Sajid Javid, the fourth person still in the race, is expected to be out by lunchtime.</p> \n  <p>For the last week or so Rory Stewart has been playing the role \u201cBrexit truth oracle\u201d in Tory politics, pointing out the obvious flaws in the glib \u2018renegotiate the backstop\u2019 plans being championed by all the main leadership candidates. For his pains Stewart got booted out of the contest last night, receiving just 27 votes. As he takes on the voice of truth role tonight, Hammond will say:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are some immutable truths that will continue to shape the Brexit debate over the coming months, no matter who is leader of the Tory party:</p> \n   <p>First, unless there is a general election, the parliamentary arithmetic will not change. Parliament will not allow no-deal; and on the evidence so far, parliament will not support the only deal that is on the table;</p> \n   <p>Secondly, the European Union will not renegotiate the deal.</p> \n   <p>And, thirdly, the Irish question, and with it the backstop, will not go away.</p> \n   <p>It may be that I\u2019m wrong, and a new leader will persuade parliament to accept the deal it has already rejected.</p> \n   <p>Or that the European Union does a 180-degree U-turn and re-opens the withdrawal agreement.</p> \n   <p>But if I\u2019m not, if the deal the current PM has negotiated is, in fact, the best deal possible; and parliament continues to reject both it and no-deal, then the question to the candidates is not \u201cWhat is your plan?\u201d; but \u201cWhat is your plan B?\u201d.</p> \n   <p>If your plan A is undeliverable, not having a plan B is like not having a plan at all.</p> \n   <p>So, the candidates need to be honest with the public. They need to recognise and address the difficult trade-offs inherent in delivering Brexit ...</p> \n   <p>If the new prime minister cannot end the deadlock in parliament, then he will have to explore other democratic mechanisms to break the impasse.</p> \n   <p>Because if he fails, his job will be on the line \u2013 and so, too, will the jobs and prosperity of millions of our fellow citizens.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>As my colleague <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong> reports, Hammond will also say that,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/19/hammond-no-deal-brexit-will-quash-new-pms-spending-plans\"> if a new prime minister does opt for a no-deal Brexit, there will be no money available for extra spending or tax cuts.</a></p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>9.30am: </em>Michael Gove, the environment secretary and a Tory leadership contender, takes questions in the Commons.</p> \n  <p><em>9.30am: </em>Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and another Tory leadership contender, speaks at a Resolution Foundation event on intergenerational equality.</p> \n  <p><em>10am: </em>Tory MPs start voting in the fourth leadership ballot.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s most consequential events: The next prime minister will be either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt. Tory members will choose between the two after Sajid Javid was eliminated from the running in the fourth round of voting this afternoon, followed by Michael Gove in the fifth this evening. Labour criticised the process, saying the effective decision on who becomes the next prime minister should not be in the hands solely of the Tory party membership. Labour also described the choice facing those members as one between the \u201cman who broke the NHS [and] the man who wants to sell it to Donald Trump\u201d. There were claims of underhand tactics as Hunt made it through to the run-off. Some Gove supporters muttered darkly that Boris Johnson\u2019s camp may have lent votes to their candidate\u2019s preferred opponent to give him the best chance of winning. Other Tory figures dismissed the suggestion. There is \u201cenormous hostility\u201d within the EU to the idea of granting the UK a further Brexit extension, according to the Irish taoiseach. Leo Varadkar said he believed an extension would only happen if there was a general election or a second referendum. A technical advisory group has been established to advise the government on arrangements that could help keep the Irish border invisible after Brexit. Experts from Rolls Royce, Queens University and the Police Force of Northern Ireland met for the first time today. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Heather Stewart and Peter Walker have the full story: The Conservatives say there have been 20,000 applications for places at the 16 members\u2019 hustings around the country. The party\u2019s chairman, Brandon Lewis, has said: I\u2019d like to congratulate Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson on reaching the final stage of the leadership contest. I\u2019m delighted with the strong interest in our hustings to date, showing the vitality of our party in every nation and region of the UK. We are conscious that the Conservatives are not just selecting a new leader but also the next prime minister, and we take that responsibility extremely seriously at such an important time for our nation. Jeremy Hunt claims he is gong to give Johnson \u201cthe fight of his life\u201d in a video posted to his Twitter account: Of course, it may be a moot point. Mark Francois has told Sky News this evening that Johnson has promised the hard Brexit-supporting ERG, of which Francois is vice chairman, that Brexit will happen on 31 October \u201ccome hell or high water\u201d if he becomes prime minister. The former Tory leader, Iain Duncan Smith, is backing Boris Johnson, whom he describes as the man to \u201cinspire and lead\u201d the UK out of the EU. Duncan Smith also said remain-supporting MPs should \u201cstop bellyaching and moaning\u201d and claimed Johnson had been misinterpreted in the BBC debate. When Boris said it was eminently achievable he was talking about a trade agreement. He said at the beginning of the programme if we don\u2019t leave on October 31 we will face a cataclysm. Duncan Smith arguably has a point \u2013 and it\u2019s one he made in his post-debate spin. But he isn\u2019t strictly right. At the beginning, Johnson did indeed say the UK \u201cmust come out on the 31st October\u201d. But when asked later by the host, Emily Maitlis, for an absolute guarantee the UK would leave on 31 October under his stewardship, he said: \u201cMichael [Gove] was guaranteeing to get out by the end of December [2019]. I think that October 31st is eminently feasible.\u201d (Johnson had been responding to a question from Gove about \u201cgetting [a] deal over the line\u201d on or around that date or \u201cripping it up\u201d just to keep to the timetable.) He also spoke later about the importance of leaving with a deal, saying no one wanted a \u201cdisorderly Brexit\u201d. So, it\u2019s \u2013 at best \u2013 debatable whether Johnson was failing to guarantee Brexit in any form on 31 October, or just failing to guarantee having a negotiated settlement done and dusted by that date. However, what is less debatable is the accuracy of Duncan Smith\u2019s \u201ctrade agreement\u201d comment. No such document is on the table for Johnson to have referred to. The portions to be determined prior to Brexit \u2013 and those which Theresa May had such trouble getting through Parliament \u2013 are the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. Broadly speaking, these set out the terms of the UK\u2019s exit and the foundations upon which a future trade deal could be built. Neither is a \u201ctrade agreement\u201d in the most common understanding of that term and no trade deal would be agreed before Brexit. The Labour party has had its say on the news that Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt will face each other for the Tory leadership \u2013 and the keys to No 10. There\u2019s perhaps little surprise in the fact that Labour wants a general election. Andrew Gwynne, its national campaign coordinator, has said: What a choice: the man who broke the NHS or the man who wants to sell it to Donald Trump. A handful of unrepresentative Conservative members should not be choosing our next prime minister. People should decide through a general election. In April, in one of its regular surveys of Conservative party members, the ConservativeHome specifically asked how they would vote faced with a choice between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. Johnson won by a landslide, beating Hunt almost two to one (61% to 33%). It is only a survey, and this time there will be a campaign, hustings, and debates, but this is probably a fair guide as to what the party thinks at the moment. It shows the scale of the challenge facing Hunt. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. From the Financial Times\u2019 George Parker Mel Stride, Michael Gove\u2019s campaign manager said Gove\u2019s cocaine admission had damaged his leadership bid. \u201cIt stalled us and meant momentum was lost at that time,\u201d he said. Here is a useful chart with all the voting numbers from this round of the contest. Conor Burns, the Bournemouth MP and a key member of the Boris Johnson team, dismissed the idea that they had lent votes to Hunt to make sure he progressed. He said: The message came from Boris: if people want to support me they vote for me, no pissing around. We wanted at every stage to make progress. We wanted to go to the members will more than half of the party voting for Boris. That\u2019s a really strong mandate and message from our parliamentary colleagues to our members in the country \u2013 get on board and let\u2019s bring it all together. And here is Jeremy Hunt praising the final four candidates in the contest (but not the others). The Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar points out that, although Boris Johnson gained only three extra votes this afternoon, at least four MPs had said they would switch to him from Sajid Javid. ITV has announced the date of a debate it will host between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. It will on Tuesday 9 July. And here is Jeremy Hunt commenting on the result. He is describing himself as the underdog - and reaffirming his intention not to trigger an early election. And this is from the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar. Actually, \u201cvote-rigging\u201d is not the right word. Getting your supporters to vote in such a way as to deliver the required result is more akin to tactical voting than vote-rigging, which implies outright fraud. In private, Michael Gove\u2019s team are rather less sanguine than Gove\u2019s tweet suggests, according to the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. And this is from Michael Gove. This is from Boris Johnson. And here are the results in full, with the changes from lunchtime and the percentages (rounded up). Boris Johnson - 160 - up 3 - 51% Jeremy Hunt - 77 - up 18 - 25% Michael Gove - 75 - up 14 - 24% There was one spoilt ballot paper. Cheryl Gillan, the joint acting chair of the 1922 Committee, is now reading out the results. She starts by thanking by the officers and staff of the Commons for their work. That means it\u2019s over. There isn\u2019t a tie. All 313 Tory MPs voted, she says. There was one spoiled ballot paper. Boris Johnson - 160 Jeremy Hunt - 77 Michael Gove - 75 From the Financial Times\u2019 George Parker The results are due very soon. My colleague Peter Walker is in the room. This is from Sajid Javid, the home secretary, who was knocked out of the contest at lunchtime. Sir Max Hastings, the former Daily Telegraph editor who used to employ Boris Johnson when he was a journalist, is a frequent critic of his former employee, but he has been particularly harsh on the PM programme just now. This is from my colleague Jonathan Freedland. UPDATE: And this is from the BBC\u2019s Philippa Thomas. This is from BrexitCentral\u2019s Jonathan Isaby. Voting has closed in the fifth Tory leadership ballot. We are expecting the result at around 6pm. This is from the BBC\u2019s Jessica Parker, who is outside the room where MPs have been voting in the Tory leadership contest. The Conservative MP Chris Philp voted for Sajid Javid this morning. Now he is supporting Boris Johnson. David Lidington, the de facto deputy PM and formerly a Rory Stewart supporter, has emerged from the fifth round of voting to warn the final two candidates, whoever they are, to not focus too narrowly on issues like Brexit, saying the union of the UK is at the most risk he has ever seen, while the party faces \u201cexistential\u201d challenges. Lidington told waiting reporters he would welcome a \u201cvigorous\u201d debate, but urged the final two to pitch their appeal widely. On Brexit, he also said a no-deal departure would risk the UK splitting up. He said: I think the members deserve a proper debate about the challenges that face the country and the Conservative party. Now clearly, Brexit is going to be a key issue, but I really hope that the candidates do look beyond that. You have to think back to 1992 since the Conservative party last won a clear overall majority, and even that was a fairly small one, and 2015 was smaller still. If you\u2019re going by age group, you get to 51-year-olds before you find more people willing to vote Conservative than Labour. In 2017 we went backwards in BAME voters, who are a more important part of the electorate in many constituencies \u2013 in the suburbs, small towns. The Tory party is facing some existential political challenges, and the union of the United Kingdom is under greater strain than I have never known it in my lifetime. There are some key constitutional issues, some really key political challenges for the party, and I think it\u2019s really important that the candidates show they\u2019re up for addressing that. Echoing what Philip Hammond is saying in his Mansion House speech tonight (see 9.56am), on the union Lidington said: The fact that England and Wales voted to leave in the referendum and Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain adds to those political tensions. We have to rediscover ways in which people can be both proudly Scottish and proudly British at the same time. I think the union of the UK needs to be a priority that runs through the heart of the next government. I certainly believe that a no-deal Brexit would add to the risks to the union \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a secret I believe that \u2013 but I think, too, that we have to be confident about demonstrating that the union of United Kingdom brings benefits to every part of the Unitred Kingdom. The Conservative MP Kevin Foster, who voted for Sajid Javid this morning, says he has switched to Boris Johnson. Lord Heseltine, the Conservative former deputy prime minister and veteran pro-European, has told the BBC\u2019s PM programme that he finds the state of his party \u201cdeeply depressing\u201d. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn More from the committee corridor where MPs have been voting Liam Fox is backing Jeremy Hunt. From the Economist\u2019s Anne McElvoy The Conservative MP Richard Benyon seems a bit fed up with all the voting. These are from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. @SCrabbPembs is Stephen Crabb, the former cabinet minister who was backing Sajid Javid. Theresa May arrived at what could be her last European Union summit, stressing the UK\u2019s separate future as \u201cglobal Britain\u201d, while expressing her hope for \u201ca close and deep partnership\u201d in the future. The prime minister is attending a regular EU summit, devoted to the climate crisis and foreign policy problems, from Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea to a drilling dispute with Turkey. EU leaders will also hold the first round of serious negotiations over divvying up the EU\u2019s top jobs, replacements for Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk - a matter previous British prime ministers once strove to influence. Asked about British politics and her likely successor Boris Johnson, May sounded a familiar note. People will be looking for the UK to do what we have always said we would do, which is to make a constructive contribution as we remain a member of the European Union. For that period of time we will continue to meet our rights and obligations, but of course we will be leaving the EU and we look forward to developing a close partnership with the EU when we have left. She was also asked if she would miss attending EU summits, but swerved away from expressing personal feeling. I will continue to do what we have always done as the UK, which is to play a constructive role within the European Union while we part of the discussions around the table. But with EU leaders divided over top jobs, May could return for a special summit before the end of June or in early July. Sarah Wollaston, the former Conservative MP who now sits as an independent (after a detour through Change UK), thinks there will be a snap election if Boris Johnson becomes PM. Here are some questions from below the line that I can help with. 1) In theory the recess could start before the new prime minister has been appointed. But the Commons has to approve recess dates (there is never normally a division, because they are agreed on a cross-party basis) and Labour would probably object if the government tried to start the recess before the new PM takes over. Downing Street has said, anyway, that it won\u2019t do this. But it does look as though the new PM will only have two or three days with the house sitting before recess starts. (See 10.52am.) 2) No. The government has to request a recall of parliament. 3) The new PM will not have to prove he has a Commons majority before he gets appointed, and I think it is unlikely that the majority will get tested in the two or three days before the summer recess starts. There will be no key legislation to pass. Labour could go for a no confidence vote, but they are likely to wait until some Tories, or the DUP, have said they will vote with the opposition, and I would be surprised if that happens on day one. The potential Tory rebels are likely to give the new PM, even Boris Johnson, a chance, and see what he does first. 4) No. As far as I can see, at business questions no MP did object to the proposed date of the recess, although Labour\u2019s Valerie Vaz asked for clarification as to when the new PM would take over. (See 10.52am.) Sajid Javid would not say he was voting for when he cast his vote, the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson reports. Boris Johnson managed to jump the queue, apparently. More from the committee corridor, outside the room where Tory MPs are voting. Theresa May has arrived at the EU summit in Brussels. As my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports, she was not in the mood for chatty reflection about her dealings with her EU partners. (Is she ever?) Three former prime ministers, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron, joined Theresa May at Westminster Abbey earlier for the memorial service for Jeremy Heywood, who was cabinet secretary before his death last November. MPs have just started voting in the fifth ballot of the contest. Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt are the only names left in the contest. The top two will be on the ballot for the 160,000-strong Conservative party membership. MPs will vote until 5.30pm, and we will get the result at around 6pm. This is from Jonathan Isaby, editor of the BrexitCentral website. Experts from Rolls Royce, Queens University and the Police Force of Northern Ireland have been named as part of a new group to advise the government on arrangements that could help keep the Irish border invisible post Brexit. The 15-strong technical advisory group was meeting for the first time today in a session chaired by Brexit secretary Steve Barclay and Treasury minister Jesse Norman. In a statement, the Department for Exiting the EU said two other groups - one comprising business interests and the other politicians - would seen be announced with a budget of \u00a320m for their work. The \u201ctechnical advisory group\u201d announced today includes: academic Katy Hayward, a sociology reader at Queen\u2019s University, who has recently returned from a six-week Eisenhower fellowship trip to the US to study arrangements on the Canadian and Mexican border; Declan Billington of the Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association, who has said the government\u2019s tariff policy for the region could wipe out dairy farming on the border; and Tim Mairs, the Police Service of Northern Ireland\u2019s assistant chief constable, who is likely reflect the impact of no-deal on smuggling, organised crime and co-operation with the Gardai without data exchange or the Euro arrest warrant. Others on the group are experts on customs, freight forwarding and the former head of central technology at Rolls Royce, David Smith. Notably absent are any voices representing farming but these are expected to be represented in the second group of experts. \u201cThese groups will help inform the UK\u2019s negotiations with the EU on developing alternative arrangements to the Northern Ireland backstop, set out in the withdrawal agreement, with the aim of replacing it by December 2020 so that it is never needed,\u201d said DExEU in a statement. Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary who was chairing the first meeting of the group today along with Treasury minister Jesse Norman, said in a statement: The technical group will provide a forum for experts to discuss workable alternative arrangements, assessing both capability and timelines and bringing their significant experience to bear. The Labour MP Rachel Reeves, chair of the Commons business committee, has welcomed what the chancellor, Philip Hammond (see 9.23am), and Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister (see 10.13am), have been saying about Brexit today. In a statement released by the People\u2019s Vote campaign she said: The Dutch prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer are doing the one thing that Boris Johnson hates more any other: telling the truth about Brexit. Neither Mark Rutte nor Philip Hammond get many laughs, but they are serious and responsible figures who deserve to be listened to at this crucial time for our country. The prime minister of the Netherlands this morning exposed the vacuity of Boris Johnson\u2019s renegotiation fantasies. And this evening, the chancellor will blow a huge hole in the idea that forcing a destructive no-deal Brexit on the British people has even the semblance of economic or political credibility. Ladbrokes has Jeremy Hunt ahead of Michael Gove to make it onto the ballot of party members. It has Hunt at 1/2 and Gove at 6/4. And this is from the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves. From the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard Some worrying news from the BBC\u2019s Chris Mason ... Paul Goodman, editor of ConservativeHome, a website that is very influential with Tory members, has written a good preview of the final ballot starting at 3.30pm this afternoon. He suggests it might be easier for the party if Jeremy Hunt is on the ballot for members, not Michael Gove. Here is an extract. We end with the thought that, if Hunt wins through, it is relatively easy to imagine him as deputy prime minister or first secretary of state \u2013 rowing in behind [Boris] Johnson as a dependable deputy. The latter flourishes when strong support is to hand. Simon Milton in London was the quintessential example. If Gove survives the remaining ballot instead, we don\u2019t see how he could be deployed by Johnson in a similar way. There is too much tricky history between the two men. There would be too much media sensitivity to power struggles, appointments and policy differences. This is from Jeremy Hunt. Turning away from London, in Brussels, where the EU summit is getting underway, Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister) has said there is \u201cenormous hostility\u201d in the EU to the idea of granting the UK another extension. These are from my colleague Jennifer Rankin. Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt have both said they would not rule out asking for an extension of Brexit beyond 31 October, if both sides were close to a deal and more time were needed. Boris Johnson has said that he would not do this although, as noted earlier, many Tories believe that in practice he might want an extension. (See 12.22pm.) For article 50 to be extended again, beyond 31 October, the UK would have to request that, and the EU 27 would have to agree unanimously. UPDATE: Here are the full quotes from Leo Varadkar. On the backstop There\u2019s no withdrawal agreement without a backstop and there\u2019s no implementation period without a withdrawal agreement. On an extension There\u2019s very much a strong view across the European Union that there shouldn\u2019t be any more extensions. While I have endless patience, some of my colleagues have lost patience, quite frankly, with the UK and there\u2019s enormous hostility to any further extension. So, I think an extension could only really happen if it were to facilitate something like a general election in the UK or perhaps even something like a second referendum if they decided to have one. What won\u2019t be entertained is an extension for further negotiations or further indicative votes: the time for that has long since passed. Chris Skidmore, the universities minister and a Sajid Javid supporter, says he is now voting for Boris Johnson. Here is ITV\u2019s Robert Peston on Boris Johnson\u2019s dilemma. This is from a Tory in the Jeremy Hunt camp. Boris and Michael are great candidates but we have seen their personal psychodrama before: it\u2019s time to offer the country someone the EU will actually talk to. Jeremy is the candidate who can best unify the party and deliver Brexit. From the BBC\u2019s Sarah Smith This is not hugely surprising \u2013 because Michael Gove is a Scot. Boris Johnson, his main rival, is seen as toxic to Tory prospects north of the border. Here\u2019s Michael Gove pitching for the Sajid Javid vote. Sources close to Sajid Javid are saying he will not be endorsing any of the remaining candidates today. The ConservativeHome website has been tracking which MPs have declared for which candidates. This morning they had 23 names down for Sajid Javid. They were: Lucy Allan Edward Argar Victoria Atkins Fiona Bruce Stephen Crabb Mims Davies Kevin Foster John Glen Robert Halfon Luke Hall Simon Hoare Nigel Huddlestone Caroline Nokes Chris Philp Mary Robinson Andrew Selous Chris Skidmore Gary Streeter Derek Thomas Robin Walker Mike Wood Jeremy Wright It is not obvious where these votes will go. Boris Johnson will pick up a large number, but the contest for the number two slot will be decided by whether Jeremy Hunt can secure more of the new votes available than Michael Gove. And this is from Sajid Javid. He is not saying who he will support in the next ballot. And this is from Michael Gove. This is from Boris Johnson. Here are some thoughts on the results. 1) Michael Gove was the real winner from that round. After trailing Jeremy Hunt in the first three ballots, he has finally overtaken him and now must have a very good chance of joining Boris Johnson on the final ballot. Gove\u2019s strengths are that he is the best parliamentary debater in the party, an authentic Brexiter and activist minister, and that he has the zeal to pose more of a threat to Johnson in the final round than Hunt. But for some Tory MPs being a Brexiter and something of a zealot are drawbacks, and Hunt supporters are already asking MPs if they really want a leadership contest that would turn into a \u201cpsychodrama\u201d between the two Vote Leave leaders who fell out bitterly in 2016 when Gove sabotaged Johnson\u2019s leadership bid. 2) Sajid Javid\u2019s defeat was expected \u2013 but over the last 10 days he revived his campaign sufficiently to enable him to leave the contest with his standing in the party enhanced rather than damaged. What happens to the 34 votes he got this morning will decide whether it is Gove or Hunt on the final ballot. 3) The size of Johnson\u2019s lead, and the two-vote gap between Gove and Hunt, means there is ample scope for tactical vote lending this afternoon. The Johnson camp think beating Hunt would be easier than beating Gove (and a ConservativeHome survey appears to back this up). But we may never find out for certain if vote lending does take place, as Philip Cowley, an academic expert in parliamentary voting, points out. 4) Johnson remains all but unstoppable to become the next prime minister. His team are particularly pleased that he now has the backing of more than half the parliamentary party. And here are the results with changes from yesterday, and overall percentages (rounded up or down). Boris Johnson \u2013 157 \u2013 up 14 \u2013 50% Michael Gove \u2013 61 \u2013 up 10 \u2013 19% Jeremy Hunt \u2013 59 \u2013 up 5 \u2013 19% Sajid Javid \u2013 34 \u2013 down 4 \u2013 11% There were two spoilt ballot papers. Cheryl Gillan, the joint acting chair of the 1922 Committee, is now reading out the results. All 313 Tory MPs voted, she says. There were two spoiled ballot papers, she says (the first time that has happened in this contest). Boris Johnson \u2013 157 Jeremy Hunt \u2013 59 Michael Gove \u2013 61 Sajid Javid \u2013 34 Ann Widdecombe, the former Tory minister who is now a Brexit party MEP, has told the BBC\u2019s Politics Live that she thinks it would be better if the Conservative party let members whittle down the candidates to a shortlist of two, and then let MPs choose the winner (the reverse of how it happens now). From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn This is from my colleague Paul Johnson, who was watching the Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg on Sky News. We are about to get the results of the fourth Tory leadership ballot. This is the first time since the Conservative party started balloting MPs on who should be leader in 1965 that voting among MPs has gone through to a fourth round. For those of you interested, this Commons library note (pdf) has all the previous Tory leadership election results, plus a history of how the rules have changed. Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, who was knocked out of the Tory leadership contest yesterday, refused to say who he voted for this morning. He got 27 votes yesterday, all available for other candidates today. The Conservative MP Bob Stewart has told the BBC that he would trust Boris Johnson to lead a platoon of soldiers into battle. The Evening Standard editorial about Boris Johnson is well worth reading. In fact, for any student of our probable next prime minister, it is almost an essential text. Johnson has made himself the runaway frontrunner to be next PM partly by winning the votes of a large number of hardline Brexiters in the Commons, including the most important figures in the European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker. They believe he has promised them that he will take the UK out of the EU by 31 October, without a deal if necessary. Despite some quite strong hints that Johnson is wobbly on this, his supporters are adamant that he has made a firm promise. Here is Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, speaking on his behalf yesterday. Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, said yesterday that Johnson had looked him in the eyes and told him that he would deliver Brexit by 31 October. David Davis, another former Brexit secretary backing Johnson, said much the same on the Today programme this morning. But the Evening Standard, which is edited by the pro-remain Tory George Osborne (who takes a very close interest in what is said in his paper\u2019s editorials), says today that one reason it is backing Johnson is that he is the candidate with \u201cthe most room for manoeuvre\u201d and that he has been careful, in public, not to \u201cguarantee\u201d that Brexit will happen by 31 October. Today\u2019s editorial says: Mr Johnson is the candidate who has the most room for manoeuvre to get the country out of the Brexit mess. That may seem a paradox, as the one who helped get us into that mess, and who again today says he wants \u201cto get Brexit done by October 31\u201d. But he is careful not to \u201cguarantee\u201d that date \u2014 Mr Johnson may be loose with words when it comes to the fates of others but never when it comes to his own. The editorial also says Johnson is the candidate most likely to persuade MPs to vote for a version of Theresa May\u2019s deal and that he could even end up backing a second referendum. Ask yourself which of these potential prime ministers is most likely to persuade the Conservative party to vote for a repacked version of the existing deal? The one with the greatest credibility with hard Brexiteers. Indeed, which of these possible leaders could you imagine making the even bigger leap and asking the country again for its views? The candidate who first came up with the idea of two referendums back in early 2016. Of course, he denies all this \u2014 and, like the other candidates, promises to get a renegotiated withdrawal agreement out of the EU. Perhaps he will. Most likely he will not. But one thing is for sure, having finally arrived in Downing Street, Mr Johnson won\u2019t be in a hurry to leave it. Opportunism knocks. Perhaps the Evening Standard has just got it wrong. But Osborne has always been an astute political observer, and he knows Johnson very well. A better way of reading the editorial is to see it as evidence of just how effective Johnson has been at giving different impressions to different audience. This might be a simple matter of lying (for which Johnson has some form), but it may be more a case of constructive ambiguity being deployed on an Olympian scale (ie, far beyond anything Tony Blair managed). This is the conclusion that Bloomberg\u2019s political editor Robert Hutton came to when he investigated why Tories have such different views as to what Johnson will do. He explains his findings in a Twitter thread starting here. And here is one of his Hutton\u2019s key tweets. This strategy has clearly worked very successfully for Johnson in recent weeks. But there is an obvious problem if you win an election by promising different things to different people. At some point your supporters will turn on you when they realise they have been betrayed. Voting has now closed in the fourth Tory leadership ballot. We are due to get the results at about 1pm. More from outside committee room 14 The Evening Standard, which is edited by George Osborne, the Conservative former chancellor, has an editorial backing Boris Johnson for next PM. I will post more on what it says shortly. By coincidence, Johnson has agreed to give the paper an interview. It is probably not the most revealing he has ever given, but needs must. Here are some of the lines in it. Johnson, the former foreign secretary and favourite in the contest to be next prime minister, says he wants to be \u201cthe prime minister who does for the whole country what I did as mayor of London\u201d. He explains: It\u2019s the same formula: it is education, infrastructure and technology \u2014 those three things. I want to level up education funding across the UK. There are too many bits of it that don\u2019t get anything like the per-pupil funding as London. And we need to be doing far more with transport infrastructure. I would like to be the prime minister who does for the Northern Powerhouse rail and connectivity with the West Midlands what I was able to do with the Tube upgrades and Crossrail. He says he thinks the Conservatives can win votes from Labour in traditional Labour areas. He explains: I think we can recruit voters from everywhere. I think many Labour voters have no interest in the metropolitan obsessions of Jeremy Corbyn with Venezuela or, you know, neo-Marxist economics. The Corbynista anti-Semitism leaves people totally bewildered and cold. He says the Tories need to \u201cturbocharge\u201d their relationship with BME communities and do \u201cmuch more\u201d to appeal to them. He refuses to say if he will give Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, a job on his Brexit negotiating team. He says he sees no contradiction between being a Brexiter and a one nation Conservative. He says he would like to be remembered as someone who \u201chelped to unite the country and unite society\u2019. Mel Stride, the leader of the Commons, has just announced that MPs will rise for the summer recess on Thursday 25 July. The Conservative party has said its new leader will be announced in the week beginning Monday 22 July - ie, the week the recess starts - but it has not said exactly when the new prime minister will take over. Asked if the new prime minister would be in office before the recess, Stride told MPs that he could not say. But Downing Street has said that Theresa May\u2019s successor will be in post before the recess starts. More from the committee corridor, where Tory MPs have been voting Here is Sajid Javid with some of his supporters outside committee room 14, where MPs are voting. Broadcasters have been doorstepping all the leadership candidates this morning. Boris Johnson did not respond to questions, but the others did. Jeremy Hunt said the county could \u201cdo better than Boris Johnson\u201d for next prime minister. He said: I\u2019m confident but not over-confident. We\u2019ve had three ballots. In every one of those ballots people have said that I\u2019m not going to do well. Each time I\u2019ve exceeded expectations. I need my supporters to come and say, \u2018Yes, we can do better than Boris Johnson as the next prime minister of our country, we can choose someone who the European Union are actually going to talk to, and get that better Brexit deal.\u2019 Sajid Javid said he was best placed to take on Johnson because he was a change candidate. He said: My colleagues, I\u2019m sure, have been thinking carefully during the night and I hope I can pick up some votes ... It has been good news so far already, speaking to colleagues. I\u2019m sure I will be picking up some votes. But these things can be unpredictable. I want to go for it and try my very best and by the end of the day we will have two candidates for the leadership election. One of them will certainly be Boris Johnson. I think I have the strongest case for being the other one, a change candidate that can win over the nation eventually in a general election with Jeremy Corbyn. And Michael Gove said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d. He said: I\u2019m feeling very confident today. I had a wonderful level of support yesterday from parliamentary colleagues. I\u2019m looking forward to making it through to the final two and looking forward to a civilised debate of ideas on who to make sure that we can make this country better. From the Times\u2019 Francis Elliott Boris Johnson as prime minister would have to dump his pledge to get rid of the Irish backstop and then change the British government\u2019s red lines for there to be hope of further Brexit negotiations, the Dutch prime minister has said. As Daniel Boffey reports, Mark Rutte said an incoming prime minister needed to be flexible, adding that he hoped that the rhetoric of the Tory leadership campaign would be dropped once a new leader was confronted with the reality of the UK\u2019s position. The Independent\u2019s Rob Merrick reckons the UK would be better off with Rutte as the next PM. From my colleague Peter Walker, who is outside committee room 14, where MPs are voting MPs are now voting in the fourth ballot for the Tory leadership. The official register of MPs\u2019 interests was updated late yesterday, and the new entries show the battle for fundraising among the Tory leadership candidates. Michael Gove trousered the most, \u00a3150,000 in donations over the two-week period covered, including \u00a310,000 from Tory peer Lord Philip Harris, the carpet millionaire whose eponymous chain of academy schools was much-praised under Gove\u2019s tenure as education secretary. Another \u00a320,000 came from Simon Wolfson of the Next chain, also a Tory peer. Behind him in donations numbers was Rory Stewart, on \u00a3108,000, whose donors included David Dein, the former co-owner of Arsenal football club. Dominic Raab was on \u00a393,000 \u2013 he also got \u00a310,000 from Harris, who has clearly been spreading his bets. Jeremy Hunt received \u00a382,000 over the period, with Johnson lagging on \u00a325,000. However, in pervious editions of the register, Johnson had acquired signifcant sums before. Again, no entries for Sajid Javid, which may or may not be connected to the fact that the former banker is personally very well-off. In his Mansion House speech tonight Philip Hammond, the chancellor, will also revive his implicit threat to vote against any new Tory leader who tries to take the UK out of the EU without a deal. Echoing a famous speech by Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell in 1960, when Gaitskell said he would \u201cfight, fight and fight again\u201d to reverse a decision by his party to back unilateral nuclear disarmament, Hammond will say: I cannot imagine a Conservative and Unionist-led government, actively pursuing a no-deal Brexit; willing to risk the Union and our economic prosperity. And a general election that could put Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street, to boot. And I will not concede the very ground we stand on. I will fight, and fight again, to remake the case for pragmatism and, yes, for compromise in our politics \u2013 to ensure an outcome that protects the union and the prosperity of the United Kingdom. In the past Hammond has refused to rule out voting against a Tory government in a no confidence motion to stop a no-deal Brexit. At least two other Tories - Dominic Grieve, here, and Ken Clarke, here - have also said they would vote down a Tory government in these circumstances. At the weekend Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, said there were \u201ca number\u201d of other Tory MPs saying, in private, that they would do the same. In the Commons Michael Gove, the environment secretary and Tory leadership contender, is taking questions. In response to a question from Vicky Ford (who is backing the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, for the leadership) asking him to congratulate Hunt on his role in bringing the 2020 UN climate change talks to London, Gove said that Hunt was doing an \u201coutstanding job\u201d on the international stage and that he hoped he would continue. But there are 27 Rory Stewart votes up for grabs this morning, and Gove also made a point of praising the work done by Stewart, the international development secretary. In her final few weeks in office Theresa May has not been commenting on the Conservative leadership contest and, as a result, she has become a near-invisible presence in our media, because the statements she is making aren\u2019t deemed interesting and aren\u2019t being reported. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, will also be out of office by the end of the month. But, unlike May, he is going down fighting, and in his speech to the annual Mansion House dinner tonight he is going to effectively accuse all remaining Tory leadership candidates of failing to be honest with the public. And he is also going to tell them, in terms, that holding a second referendum may be the only option available to them. By the time Hammond delivers his speech, the two final leadership ballots for Tory MPs will have concluded and we will know the names of the two candidates on the ballot paper for party members. Boris Johnson will be one of them. The other will almost certainly be Jeremy Hunt or Michael Gove; Sajid Javid, the fourth person still in the race, is expected to be out by lunchtime. For the last week or so Rory Stewart has been playing the role \u201cBrexit truth oracle\u201d in Tory politics, pointing out the obvious flaws in the glib \u2018renegotiate the backstop\u2019 plans being championed by all the main leadership candidates. For his pains Stewart got booted out of the contest last night, receiving just 27 votes. As he takes on the voice of truth role tonight, Hammond will say: There are some immutable truths that will continue to shape the Brexit debate over the coming months, no matter who is leader of the Tory party: First, unless there is a general election, the parliamentary arithmetic will not change. Parliament will not allow no-deal; and on the evidence so far, parliament will not support the only deal that is on the table; Secondly, the European Union will not renegotiate the deal. And, thirdly, the Irish question, and with it the backstop, will not go away. It may be that I\u2019m wrong, and a new leader will persuade parliament to accept the deal it has already rejected. Or that the European Union does a 180-degree U-turn and re-opens the withdrawal agreement. But if I\u2019m not, if the deal the current PM has negotiated is, in fact, the best deal possible; and parliament continues to reject both it and no-deal, then the question to the candidates is not \u201cWhat is your plan?\u201d; but \u201cWhat is your plan B?\u201d. If your plan A is undeliverable, not having a plan B is like not having a plan at all. So, the candidates need to be honest with the public. They need to recognise and address the difficult trade-offs inherent in delivering Brexit ... If the new prime minister cannot end the deadlock in parliament, then he will have to explore other democratic mechanisms to break the impasse. Because if he fails, his job will be on the line \u2013 and so, too, will the jobs and prosperity of millions of our fellow citizens. As my colleague Jessica Elgot reports, Hammond will also say that, if a new prime minister does opt for a no-deal Brexit, there will be no money available for extra spending or tax cuts. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Michael Gove, the environment secretary and a Tory leadership contender, takes questions in the Commons. 9.30am: Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and another Tory leadership contender, speaks at a Resolution Foundation event on intergenerational equality. 10am: Tory MPs start voting in the fourth leadership ballot. Voting closes at 12pm, and the result will be announced at about 1pm. Lunchtime: EU leaders start arriving for their summit in Brussels. 3.30pm: Tory MPs start voting in the fifth leadership ballot. Voting closes at 5.30pm, and the result will be announced at about 6pm. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing almost exclusively mostly on the Tory leadership contest.

Johnson and Hunt\u2019s names will now go forward to the Tory membership of around 140,000 \u2013 with Johnson the overwhelming favourite to take possession of the keys to No 10 next month. But with the party\u2019s working majority in parliament a wafer-thin five, some senior Tories are already warning that whoever wins could find themselves forced to call a general election within months \u2013 or even weeks. Several pointed to the fact that two MPs spoilt their ballots as evidence that some disillusioned Tories may find it hard to support either candidate. With a recall petition in Brecon and Radnorshire threatening to remove another Tory MP, and several on their own side determined to resist a no-deal Brexit, even at the cost of their own seats, the Tories\u2019 working majority of six appears highly vulnerable. \u201cHe might have a premiership that is the shortest in history,\u201d one Tory frontbencher said. \u201cHe could have a confidence vote on his first day and be prime minister for ten minutes \u2013 if we lose in Brecon, we may have a majority of three by then and two colleagues have spoilt their ballots.

In an outspoken warning to the final candidates David Lidington, the de facto deputy prime minister, warned them to not focus too narrowly on courting the Tory faithful, saying the party faced \u201cexistential\u201d problems, while Brexit was placing the union at grave risk. Speaking after he voted in the final round, before the result was announced, Lidington said it was 1992 when the Conservatives last won a clear majority, while its electorate was ageing, and the 2017 election saw it lose support among BAME voters. \u201cThe Tory party is facing some existential political challenges, and the union of the United Kingdom is under greater strain than I have never known it in my lifetime,\u201d Lidington said. \u201cThere are some key constitutional issues, some really key political challenges for the party, and I think it\u2019s really important that the candidates show they\u2019re up for addressing that.\u201d On the union, Lidington said: \u201cThe fact that England and Wales voted to leave in the referendum and Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain adds to those political tensions.\u201d A no-deal Brexit \u201cwould add to the risks to the union,\u201d he added.

      "bodyText": "After the second winner, they gave Frankie Dettori the top jockey\u2019s armband. After the third, he said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get better than this.\u201d But it did. Caught in a pocket on Stradivarius with just over a furlong to run, Dettori managed to find room to launch a winning run on the even-money favourite. For the next 40 minutes, the bookmakers were staring into the abyss. Of all the jockeys of the past 30 years, it had to be him. Days such as these are the reason so many punters put Dettori\u2019s mounts in accumulators with almost religious devotion. Most of the bets end up as losers but they know if they forget to put their money down on a big afternoon of racing, they could end up regretting it for the rest of their days. Horses have always run for Dettori, ever since his time as a teenaged champion apprentice in the 1980s, and when he gets on a roll there is a sense anything is possible.

When he then added the Royal meeting\u2019s feature event with a typical display of composure under the greatest of pressure, office money from panicking bookmakers facing huge liabilities forced the double on Turgenev and Questionare, Dettori\u2019s final two mounts on the card, to around 10-1, from 250-1 at the start of the day. Dettori can move the markets like no jockey since Lester Piggott and the confidence and swagger of Dettori\u2019s double on Wednesday had been, in hindsight, a taster of what to expect on Gold Cup day.

By now, you could follow Dettori\u2019s progress from the track back to the winner\u2019s enclosure by listening for the swell of acclaim that swept from right to left as Dettori was led back in front of the packed stands. \u201cWhen Frankie\u2019s in form, he really sets this place alight,\u201d Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, said. \u201cAfter his first three winners, I thought: \u2018Wow, that\u2019s amazing\u2019 and he still had the ride on the favourite in the Gold Cup to come.

In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \u2018stuff\u2019 as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \u2018future high streets\u2019 fund under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2019?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But how many more of these requests from wealthy individuals are landlords prepared to tolerate?

Nor, it seems, can Peter Simon, a half-billionaire whose preferred luxury is expensive art. The founder and owner of Monsoon Accessorize would like his landlords to take rent cuts on 135 stores. From Simon\u2019s point of view, there\u2019s no harm in having a go. Nobody doubts that \u201cfundamental changes have taken place in the retail sector,\u201d as the company puts it, and the tune seems to be a winner. Green got his restructuring of Arcadia over the line, albeit at the second attempt, so why shouldn\u2019t Simon expect similar leniency? But how many more of these requests from wealthy individuals are landlords prepared to tolerate? Monsoon paid the Simon family \u00a3116m in dividends between 2008 and 2013, which is surely sufficiently recent for the property owners to expect a large chunk of the cash to come back into the business in tougher times. Nor can Simon be said to be going to extremes himself in his role as owner of Monsoon\u2019s head office.

The Rays have played at Tropicana Field since their inception in 1998 and drew their lowest home crowd of 5,786 against Toronto last month. They had looked into building a new stadium for years but in December abandoned a plan to build across the bay in Tampa. Manfred said the MLB executive council had given permission for the Rays to explore a split season.",

      "bodyText": "Labour staff, including some in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office, are contemplating strike action over allegedly paltry pay rates amid anger at the management style of his chief-of-staff, Karie Murphy. The Guardian understands Labour made an improved pay offer to staff of an annual rise of 2.2% on Thursday \u2013 but that falls short of the staff\u2019s demand for a rise in line with RPI inflation, which stood at 3% in April. The dispute covers all Labour staff, including those at its Southside HQ in Westminster and in the regions, and involves both the GMB and Unite unions. Several employees the Guardian spoke to, on condition of anonymity, said there were particular concerns about the management culture in Corbyn\u2019s office, which they described as ruthless. Staff will be given a vote on the improved offer. Some said they might still vote against the offer \u201con principle\u201d, because they are determined to draw attention to the issue. \u201cPeople are not happy with management and a lot of it seems to centre around his chief of staff,\u201d said one Labour staffer involved in the dispute. \u201cThere is loyalty to Jeremy but we are very concerned that we have found ourselves in this situation.\u201d They added: \u201cIt\u2019s got to the stage where people are afraid to speak up as individuals, because when you do you get sent to Siberia. When an individual has that much power in an organisation, it\u2019s a concern.\u201d And they said that while they had gathered a number of concerns and sought to raise them with management, no formal grievance had been raised because complainants preferred to remain anonymous. At a meeting last week, some staffers said they were so angry they were even prepared to contemplate strike action during the Labour conference \u2013 the most critical week in the party\u2019s calendar. Many were irked by the 15% pay increase Murphy was awarded last year, taking her salary above \u00a390,000. Those involved include political advisers to shadow ministers, known as PADs. Parliamentary records show that 46 people have been issued with parliamentary passes to work in Corbyn\u2019s office \u2013 including Murphy and other senior party officers. Murphy acts as Corbyn\u2019s gatekeeper and enforcer, as well as providing political advice and moral support. She and Corbyn\u2019s other close aide, Seumas Milne, watched the 2017 general election results with the Labour leader at his Islington home. Some Labour MPs regard Murphy as one of the driving forces behind the Labour leadership\u2019s reluctance to embrace an anti-Brexit position. But the Guardian understands that staff involved in the dispute span the political spectrum within the party, and they insist they are concerned about pay and conditions, not politics. A Labour spokesperson said, \u201cLabour is in negotiations with our staff on a pay offer and we are awaiting feedback from our recognised unions on the improved and final proposal we have made. \u201cIt is entirely false to suggest that the staff intend to ballot their members on anything other than pay.

      "bodyText": "I can only imagine the emotions felt by the Scotland players when their dreams of qualification for the knockout rounds died on Wednesday night as Florencia Bonsegundo\u2019s twice-taken penalty hit the back of the net, deep into stoppage time, and denied them victory over Argentina. For them, it must have been absolutely heartbreaking. Watching the drama unfold from a distance, I was feeling something quite different: fury. I don\u2019t think I have ever been as incensed by a football rule in my life. I was a fan of VAR at last year\u2019s World Cup: coming in at the right time, cleaning up refereeing errors and making the game more objective. But using it to interpret the new changes to the law covering penalties is ridiculous. VAR was intended to overrule clear and obvious mistakes, not to penalise goalkeepers for being inches off their line. Watching what looks like a bad experiment cheapen the Women\u2019s World Cup feels wrong, and speaks to the fact we\u2019re still not there in terms of equality. The last women\u2019s World Cup was played on artificial turf, another first that was incredibly unpopular with players and coaches. I don\u2019t believe a rule such as this would have been introduced so close to the men\u2019s tournament, and to wheel it out in a competition that stands as the pinnacle of the women\u2019s game is unfair. The Scotland goalkeeper, Lee Alexander, clearly had not been properly prepared. As she faced the second penalty, having been punished the first time for taking the smallest forward step, she couldn\u2019t even dive properly. At that point the law was crippling and the penalty taker may as well have had a free shot. Forward movement is part of a goalkeeper\u2019s technique for pushing themselves off into a save and, suddenly unable to stray even an inch off her line, she had no idea what to do. You may be questioning why, as a striker, I care so much about the goalkeeper when ultimately it makes it easier for my fellow strikers to score. I am aware this is the letter of the law, but I like to see a law that improves the game, brings competitive balance and fairness. Players are being put in a position where they are forced to invent a new technique in the 93rd minute of a vital match at the World Cup finals. The fact the Premier League has already announced VAR will not be used to monitor goalkeepers\u2019 positioning at penalties next season is hugely telling. Who was consulted before the decision to interpret the law so rigidly was taken? Were any football teams involved? Were goalkeepers part of it? It seems to me that people have made up this rule without any idea of how it was actually going to affect a player\u2019s movement. At least Alexander had saved the first penalty.

At the second attempt, she scored the only goal of another important group game and left Nigeria\u2019s hopes hanging by a thread. As the rule is being applied, a player could take the worst penalty in history, send it flying into the upper tier or spinning towards the corner flag, and still get another go.

Hargreaves has also waived its platform fee until the fund reopens, although Woodford has not reduced his management fees.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a34ab7fd-7b6c-4631-aeaf-bc0eebcb4675\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/neil-woodford\">Neil Woodford</a>&nbsp;was once the UK\u2019s biggest star fund manager, personally managing a \u00a325bn mountain of money on behalf of pension funds and other investors at Invesco Perpetual. When he decided to quit Invesco and go it alone in 2013 it was a huge shock for the fund management industry. Invesco shares slumped by 7% on the day he announced his departure.</p>\n    <p>At Invesco Woodford held control of huge stakes in some of the UK\u2019s biggest firms, and his opinions mattered. His criticism of AstraZeneca chief executive David Brennan in the 2012 shareholder spring was widely regarded to have cost him his job, and his critique of BAE\u2019s attempted \u00a328bn merger with Airbus is acknowledged as one of the reasons the deal collapsed.</p>\n    <p>Woodford, who was widely referred to in the media as an investment \u201chero\u201d and fund management \u201cstar\u201d, had done exceedingly well over his quarter century there. A \u00a31,000 investment placed when he started at the firm in 1988 would have risen to \u00a323,000 by the time he left.</p>\n    <p>Woodford accidentally fell into fund management and hadn\u2019t heard of the term until he rocked up in the City in the 1980s sleeping on his brother\u2019s floor while looking for a job. He got his first break in insurance, before drifting into fund management. He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn\u2019t pass the RAF\u2019s aptitude test, and instead read economics and agricultural economics at the University of Exeter.</p>\n    <p>Feeling he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, he set up his own firm Woodford Investment Management in 2014, on an industrial estate near Oxford. Within two weeks of launching, he had raised \u00a31.6bn, a UK record, and it quickly grew to \u00a316bn. In its first full year his flagship fund returned 16% and Woodford, a devotee of veteran US investor Warren Buffett, was dubbed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/oracle-of-oxford-sees-red-as-stock-picking-powers-misfire\">\u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p>Asked if he ever doubted his judgment, Woodford once said: \u201cDaily. You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying \u2018everybody go away, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u2019. You\u2019ve always got to expose yourself to criticism and the analysis that you may be wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Woodford went on to say that the secret of successful fund management was a balance of arrogance and humility. \u201cYou have to have a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction. If you didn\u2019t, you would end up with a portfolio that looks very much like the index. But, equally, you must have the humility to accept that you will get things wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rupertneate\"><b>Rupert Neate</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe are angered by the lack of resolution so far but remain actively engaged with the regulator, Woodford, Link and the Treasury select committee to ensure that all investors, not just those invested through Hargreaves Lansdown, are able to access their investment as soon as possible,\u201d Hill said in his post.

Johnson would roar, skid, veer and cheat \u2013 but he must be more likely pull it off. Dull it would not be. But what a risk. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

A couple of the changes were forced when we lost the all-rounder. It is just toying on ideas and depends on the surface day to day. All in all, we have a clear idea going forward. The fielding was very sloppy today; it was disappointing because we pride ourselves on our fielding. No excuses. Not yet thinking about the semi-finals.

Good fun passing the baton back and forth with you today between the various commentary boxes. Into the final ten, Bangladesh require 13.5 an over to pull off a miracle. Stoinis, who is going nicely, is sending down his sixth. He became a very useful death bowler for the Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash last season, so he knows the drill. It\u2019s a top over of accurate full deliveries here, not giving either batsmen a serious chance to free their arms. Four singles means the required rate shoots up to 14.78. Ouch.

They needed 387 to win against England a couple of weeks ago, and Shakib made a hundred that gave the impression he wanted to salvage net run rate. Then they needed 322 against the West Indies and Shakib made a hundred like he\u2019d never considered the possibility of not winning. He\u2019ll need another of the latter today if they\u2019re to be any chance, but they\u2019re unlikely to get bowling anywhere near as sloppy as the men in maroon dished up. <br></p> <p>David Warner, it seems strange to say, never seemed entirely in control as he has in the past. But he showed his ability, in finding a way to fight through a tricky start and then just keep going, maintaining his aggression en route to a large and fast hundred. He laid a massive base with Finch, Khawaja played his best innings coming in lower down the order, and Maxwell came in for a devastating salvo at the end that was cut short by Khawaja and a run out.</p> <p>Bangladesh were dominated today. They lost the toss, had to bowl, and never threatened. They were forced by injury to bring Sabbir into the side, who dropped Warner on 10, and Rubel, who went for 83 off 9 overs without a wicket. Their opening batsman had to bail them out with the ball, taking 3 for 58. Nothing went right really. It will have to go astronomically well with the bat for this match to be anything but a foregone conclusion.</p> <p>Adam will be back to take you through the chase, with occasional cameos from me as the day wears on.

But when the Fizz misses that length, Stoinis powers him back past the non-striker along the ground for four, hard enough to split the men in the deep. Super shot. Followed by a very not super shot, as Stoinis aims over midwicket but gets a thick lofted edge that floats over the keeper for four more.

Anyway, the good times roll when Khawaja again finds the boundary at backward point. 14 from the over making <strong>59 from the last four. </strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9feed97fb990fa1fde29eed2d05158c23772552a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9feed97fb990fa1fde29eed2d05158c23772552a/0_0_4875_3250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Warner reaches 151 after smashing a four.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warner reaches 151 after smashing a four.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-20T12:36:07.450Z\">at 1.36pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d0b7c308f082364d7cedbf3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-20T12:29:38.236Z\">1.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>42nd over: Australia 282-1 (Warner 143, Khawaja 76) </strong>As Andrew WK taught us, when it\u2019s time to party, you should party hard.

Who said that Khawaja couldn\u2019t go up the gears? (Me). 19 off the over, if you don\u2019t mind.

But as he looks vulnerable, Mustafizur strays onto leg stump and is put away for four through fine leg.

He\u2019s not looking so comfortable when Mustafizur nails him on the pad, but there was some bat involved as the ball cut back in.

      "bodyText": "Here is Geoff Lemon\u2019s report... That\u2019s Geoff and me done! Thanks for your company all day on the OBO. We\u2019ll be back with you again tomorrow. Night! Aaron Finch, Australian captain, speaks. Absolutely a few butterflies in the end. But having players from World Cups before is a huge advantage especially in the back end of the tournament. All in all, having experience and good partnerships with bat and ball is important. A couple of the changes were forced when we lost the all-rounder. It is just toying on ideas and depends on the surface day to day. All in all, we have a clear idea going forward. The fielding was very sloppy today; it was disappointing because we pride ourselves on our fielding. No excuses. Not yet thinking about the semi-finals. It is going to be a fight right to the end to hopefully secure one of those spots. Mashrafe Mortaza, Bangladesh captain, speaks. We had 40/50 runs lost in the field. If not for that it could have been a different chase. Credit to Warner. But credit to Mushfiq for how he batted. It\u2019s the best one-day team we\u2019ve had. You never know from here, we\u2019ll play hard and we\u2019ll see. David Warner, player of the match, speaks. It is about us geting these two points and moving onto the next game at Lord\u2019s. You always keep wickets in hand in ODI cricket, that\u2019s the way we play, we don\u2019t try and not get off to a good start but you have to respect the new ball. And the bowlers have been good early. It is about momentum and so far things are working well. Credit to the way Bangladesh played. A fine chase. They just needed too many. It finished as the highest score for Bangladesh in any ODI, overtaking the 330 they made against South Africa to begin this World Cup campaign. In order to qualify from here, they must run the table (against Afghanistan, India and Pakistan) and require other results to go their way. But their effort today with the blade cannot be faulted: it was with the ball, in the final 20 overs, that this game was lost. Stick with me for the post-game, when David Warner is named man of the match and we hear from the captains. 50th over: Bangladesh 333-8 (Mushfiqur 102 not out) Target 382 Shot! Mortaza, in what will almost be his final game against Australia in any format, smashes a four back over Stoinis\u2019 head. Remember that the Bangladesh skipper was in integral to the 2005 Cardiff epic, getting rid of Adam Gilchrist for a duck. He tries to go again from the final ball but picks out Maxwell on the midwicket boundary to give Stoinis a second wicket. Australia move to the top of the table with the win. 49th over: Bangladesh 326-7 (Mushfiqur 100, Mortaza 1) Target 382 A rapid yorker is kept out by Mashrafe Mortaza, giving the strike back to Mushfiqur, his old teammate, with two balls left in the Starc over. Now on 99, he... defends the first. And pushes the next to cover! That\u2019s the ton! 95 balls to get there, a fantastic innings of counterattacking cricket. Aaron Finch, a class act, makes a beeline for him at the end of the over to shake his hand. His seventh ODI ton. Mehidy chips Starc to Warner at mid-on. Just give Mushfiqur the strike, yeah? 48th over: Bangladesh 322-6 (Mushfiqur 96, Mehidy 6) Target 382 Mushfiqur is on the cusp of a World Cup ton and you better he will deserve the milestone if he gets there in the next over. He has never given up at any stage of this chase, coming out with a range of resourceful shots from the moment he arrived with ten and over needed even then. Here, against Stoinis, he beats mid-off to register one boundary then tickles a yorker off the bottom of the bat for another. Get there! 47th over: Bangladesh 310-6 (Mushfiqur 86, Mehidy 5) Target 382 Six taken from Starc, all in ones and twos, as the sting vanishes from this contest, I\u2019m afraid to report. The PA plays Horses at the end of the over and I realise that this is basically the song Australia is most known for in 2019 and it hurts. In saying that, I did get it (and Daryl Braithwaite) into the Wisden Almanack a few years ago. I\u2019m sorry. \u201cCan\u2019t work out who NCN is channelling with this new moustachioed look \u2013 I\u2019m getting essences of a Non-Hutchence member of INXS,\u201d observes Nick Toovey, whose Whatsapps I am not ignoring. \u201cAny thoughts?\u201d I\u2019ll throw that open! 46th over: Bangladesh 304-6 (Mushfiqur 84, Mehidy 1) Target 382 He doesn\u2019t get the hat-trick. The last one of those for an Australian in ODIs was James Faulkner (remember him?) at Colombo in 2016, a bit of history (I guess?) that I was calling on Sri Lankan radio. They nearly missed the third wicket due to an advertisement. It was that kind of station. \u201cI am setting up a tiger shop the next time Bangladesh play,\u201d says Michael Slater. I\u2019ll present that without further context. NCN is on a hat-trick! The new man Sabbir chops on first ball. He looked to run his fingers down the seam, the delivery sticking in the pitch. (Okay, now it\u2019s over) Ooooh. Exhale. He hit NCN well to square leg to the short boundary but it is too flat, picking out Cummins on the rope who makes no mistake. The end of a marvellous innings of 69 in 50 balls and a stand of 127 that unexpectedly brought this game back to life. 45th over: Bangladesh 300-4 (Mushfiqur 83, Mahmudullah 67) Target 382 Cummins is bouncing back and finding his mark, nearly nabbing Mushfiqur off a top edge as painless singles are taken. But Mahmudullah knows that isn\u2019t enough, so he loads up to clear his front pad and SMASH ANOTHER SIX over midwicket! 11 from the over, which means they still need 16.4 in each of the five remaining. But they are within striking distance. In the T20 era, this game is NOT yet over. 44th over: Bangladesh 289-4 (Mushfiqur 81, Mahmudullah 58) Target 382 Coulter-Nile (or NCN as I\u2019m going to keep calling him) has been useful today and has a couple up his sleeve. Mahmudullah is not going to stop for anyone though, crunching a boundary through cover to bring up his 50 (41 balls) then creaming the next ball to midwicket to the rope again through a gap that barely exists; gorgeous wrists. The task is gigantic but they are going to keep going and going. 43rd over: Bangladesh 277-4 (Mushfiqur 79, Mahmudullah 48) Target 382 MESSY! Cummins is the obvious man for this situation but the second ball of his ninth over is a bouncer, that bounces past Alex Carey for five wides! Another wide follows outside the off stump! You don\u2019t see this from Pat Cummins. Surely the wheels aren\u2019t about to fall off? Surely this is in hand? Cummins then pulls out of his run up and the Bangladesh loyalists are getting louder by the second. Another wide? Yes! Cummins has again missed his mark outside off. That brings up the 100-run partnership between this pair, in 83 balls! With a couple of singles to the third man along the way, the final damage is 13 off it. The crowd roar: BANGLADESH, BANGLADESH! This is great stuff. But they still need 15 an over. \u201cAs a part time worker in nearby Tromso, I have visited Sommaroy,\u201d writes Phil Dusart in reply to a conversation from earlier, before the game exploded (somewhat). \u201cWhile you\u2019d never have to worry about light, It is located in a series of rocky islands, and you\u2019d be hard pressed to build a cricket field where you wouldn\u2019t have to fish the ball out of the sea every time someone hits a six!\u201d 41st over: Bangladesh 264-4 (Mushfiqur 76, Mahmudullah 45) Target 382 HUUUUUGE SIX! Mahmudullah has gone BIG over long-on, so long that the fella just to our right has taken the catch on the third deck! AND HE GOES AGAIN! He\u2019s hit that even harder, flatter and squarer. SIX MORE! Wonderful ball striking from the man who delivered for Bangladesh when it mattered four years ago. 15 from the over, which is what they need for every subsequent over. But hope remains. As for Zampa, he is in a spot of bother. Will Finch use him again? I suspect not. 41st over: Bangladesh 249-4 (Mushfiqur 76, Mahmudullah 30) Target 382 Thanks again, Geoff. Good fun passing the baton back and forth with you today between the various commentary boxes. Into the final ten, Bangladesh require 13.5 an over to pull off a miracle. Stoinis, who is going nicely, is sending down his sixth. He became a very useful death bowler for the Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash last season, so he knows the drill. It\u2019s a top over of accurate full deliveries here, not giving either batsmen a serious chance to free their arms. Four singles means the required rate shoots up to 14.78. Ouch. Michael Clarke notes on the TV that the problem the Tigers have is that they aren\u2019t clearing the boundary, hitting only one six today so far - Australia clobbered ten. 40th over: Bangladesh 245-4 (Mushfiqur 75, Mahmudullah 28) What a shot. What a save! Mushfiqur is playing one of the most stylish and exciting knocks you could ever hope to see. He skips down to Zampa, opens the face and laces a cover drive. It deserves four, but Maxwell is in the deep. He dives, slides, takes the ball in one hand and is back up to throw in the one motion. Keeps the scoring to two. Incredible work all round. So Mushy goes for the reverse sweep, over backward point, and there\u2019s no one protecting that boundary! Four. In our final switcheroo for the day, here\u2019s Adam Collins. 39th over: Bangladesh 234-4 (Mushfiqur 68, Mahmudullah 24) Well, Mushfiqur probably knows that he\u2019s not going to win this game, but he\u2019s not going to give up either. Stoinis comes on for Cummins, and Mushy smacks him down the ground but Stoinis manages to get a touch on it and slow the ball down. Two runs. Mahmudullah gets strike and whips a brace through the leg side, then another. Eight off the over. 38th over: Bangladesh 226-4 (Mushfiqur 65, Mahmudullah 19) Short from Starc, and Mushfiqur rides again! Leans back a bit, ups periscope, and directs the ball over a fine third man region for four on the bounce. That is just gorgeous. Starc follows up with his best ball, a sizzling yorker that homes in on the stumps and takes a batsman in Mushy\u2019s sort of touch to block out. 37th over: Bangladesh 219-4 (Mushfiqur 60, Mahmudullah 18) Another smoked pull shot from Mush, but there\u2019s some excellent work on the rope by Stoinis sliding around at deep square leg to save it. Two of the three runs from that Cummins over come by that stroke. Cummins is 0-41 from 8 so far. Bangladesh need 12.5 an over from here. Something has to give. 36th over: Bangladesh 216-4 (Mushfiqur 58, Mahmudullah 17) That\u2019s what you can do against Starc! Width, pace, and Mushfiqur drives with style through point for four. Dish that up on a plate with a garnish. (I\u2019m doing Italian chef\u2019s fingers right now.) Here\u2019s Brian Withington. \u201cKim Thonger may be on to something with his promotion of Sommaroy as a cricket venue (27th over). Never mind 50 overs, they could host a World Cup of test match duration games on permanent rotation. In passing, in sun-kissed England I believe the nights start drawing in this weekend.\u201d 35th over: Bangladesh 208-4 (Mushfiqur 52, Mahmudullah 15) Cummins searching for that breakthrough. He\u2019s the one you don\u2019t want to have to attack, perhaps even more than Starc. He really ties down Mushy around off stump. But when he goes short, Mushy gloves him down through fine leg for four. Half century for the Bangladeshi keeper. Lovely batting. 34th over: Bangladesh 201-4 (Mushfiqur 46, Mahmudullah 14) Zampa nearly gets through a good over, but Mahmudullah has a big swing at the end and gets a thick outside edge, up and over backward point and it rolls away for four. There\u2019s the 200. Ok, the required rate is down a touch to 11.5. Interesting. Just a little. 33rd over: Bangladesh 194-4 (Mushfiqur 44, Mahmudullah 9) Coulter-Nile comes back from the Pavilion End, and Mushfiqur advances and launches him for four! Just bounced inside the rope at midwicket after a long launch that came down like a lunar module returning to earth. Single brings Mahmudullah on strike. Next ball? Charge, swat, four! Flat this time, through square leg and beats the sweeper! Ten from the over. 32nd over: Bangladesh 184-4 (Mushfiqur 39, Mahmudullah 4) And we come up to the drinks break via Zampa, who goes for four singles from his over. You don\u2019t get much chance to consolidate when the asking rate is going up like a 4th of July sky. 31st over: Bangladesh 180-4 (Mushfiqur 37, Mahmudullah 2) Ahoy again. One more switcheroo before we end. Is your head spinning yet? Liton Das\u2019 would be. Being whacked by Mitchell Starc is not the slightest bit of fun. The new pairing get through Coulter-Nile\u2019s over and collect three singles. They need close to 11 an over now. 30th over: Bangladesh 177-4 (Mushfiqur 35, Mahmudullah 1) Target 382 Mahmudullah is a man who knows all about big centuries in massive World Cup games. But has he got enough time? Is the task too big? He takes Zampa for one to get off strike, Mushfiqur also grabbing one to cover. Righto, I\u2019m back to the wireless for a bit so I\u2019m handing you back to Geoff Lemon for the next ten overs. Chat again when Mushfiqur is 100 not out from 55 balls. Yep, that\u2019s out. Going straight on, the ball is smashing into enough of leg stump. After a patchy first spell, that will do Zampa\u2019s confidence a world of good. IS DAS LBW? Zampa thinks so and Umpire Gough agrees. But it has been sent upstairs for a look by the batsman. Stand by. 29th over: Bangladesh 175-3 (Mushfiqur 34, Das 20) Target 382 Das goes again, this time at NCN who is back into the attack, pulling him hard through midwicket for another boundary! They\u2019re ticking over really well, these two. With four other runs coming in the smaller coins, that makes eight off. They need 9.89 an over to win. 28th over: Bangladesh 167-3 (Mushfiqur 33, Das 13) Target 382 In a competitive field, that\u2019s one of the most attractive shots played today, Liton Das driving Cummins straight past him for four. Very good batting. And he gets a bonus boundary to finish out on the rope at extra cover, Marcus Stoinis misfielding! That\u2019s the second time today the Australians have given away a four like that. You can be sure that will be a *cough cough* ~talking point~ when this is all over. \u201cRe: Starc\u2019s hand-over-mouth celebration,\u201d writes Nick Toovey. \u201cBrian Withington is a much more optimistic person than I with your assumption that it was mock-shyness. I assumed he was covering his mouth to disguise a frightful gobby send off that this new-age sporting Australian team no longer take part in.\u201d More likely. 27th over: Bangladesh 157-3 (Mushfiqur 32, Das 4) Target 382 Mushfiqur has been around long enough that you can be sure he will not give up. Starc is making making life difficult, but going around the wicket to finish, the punchy wicketkeeper strikes a crisp cover drive into the gap out to the short boundary. \u201cAfternoon Adam.\u201d Kim Thonger, hello! \u201cReading this it seems obvious to me that the next Cricket World Cup should be held in Sommaroy, Norway, where bad light would never be an issue, and floodlights never required. What Dickie Bird would make of it all I dread to think.\u201d And Iceland the tournament after that. 26th over: Bangladesh 149-3 (Mushfiqur 26, Das 2) Target 382 Understandably, Finch is also bringing Cummins back. As usual, the man with more dot balls in the tournament than any other is making it hard for both players to get him away, three singles their lot to the sweepers behind the wicket. \u201cStat-alert!\u201d alerts (?) Hari Shankar. \u201cNick Toovey\u2019s question made me think of which batsmen would have been the most unreliable. I check cricinfo stats expecting it to be the redoubtable Inzy. But the answer was a big surprise.guess? Drumroll.... Steve Waugh! There was a 10% chance that if you had a partnership with the senior Waugh you would be left stranded.\u201d I\u2019m on radio with Damien Fleming next door again soon - I\u2019ll get his take on that. 25th over: Bangladesh 146-3 (Mushfiqur 24, Das 1) Target 382 Back in his stance, Das gets off the mark from the next ball to square leg. Nicely done. Bangladesh are keeping pace with where Australia were, but, as Harsha Bhogle explains on the telly, it is the sharp increase after over 30 where they surely can\u2019t stay with it now. They need 9.5 an over from here, if that\u2019s how you like to measure these things. \u201cAs much as I\u2019m an Aussie supporter, I\u2019d love to see the Tigers win this one,\u201d writes Kathryn Barras. I suspect this was composed before the last couple of wickets. Ah well. Bring on the dead rubbers. She continues: \u201cCan we talk about the bad facial hair that the Aussies are sporting? Did they forget the bag of razors? (cf Pup\u2019s comments earlier on players bringing bags of gloves and thigh pads). Either it\u2019s the Dennis Lillee/Mitch Johnson mo or nothing. What a disgrace!\u201d Well, I can\u2019t speak for them. But on Geoff and my side of the desk, I lost the beard (but kept the mo) for the World Cup. Geoff says he is joining me in this pursuit. \u201cThere should be some form of penalty for bowlers expressing faux embarrassment with hand to mouth after taking a \u2018lucky\u2019 wicket,\u201d says Brian Withington, in response to Starc\u2019s response getting Tamim. \u201cNot a good look.\u201d This, of course, is the ground of Stuart Broad\u2019s double-hands-on-mouth from the 2015 Ashes. I know that isn\u2019t the same thing, but thought I\u2019d drop that in there. Liton Das hit. He\u2019s copped a whack to the side of the helmet from Starc first ball. He\u2019s fine, on his feet straight away, but there is a delay to replace his lid. Starc silences the crowd! First ball of his new over, Tamim misjudges a delivery just short of a length, chopping on when trying to steer to third man. It\u2019s not much of a ball but those mistakes come when facing a bowler of Starc\u2019s speed. 24th over: Bangladesh 144-2 (Tamim 62, Mushfiqur 23) Target 382 Zampa into his fourth and under pressure early on, Tamim sweeping hard and well for four! The spinner loses his line later in the over down the legside, Mushfiqur adding a couple more behind square to finish. Nine from it and the stands are PUMPING as the Bangladesh fans make more noise than they have at any time today. They want to believe. 23rd over: Bangladesh 135-2 (Tamim 57, Mushfiqur 20) Target 382 Starc is back to shake things up as he did against Sri Lanka in the middle overs. He has, by some margin, been Australia\u2019s best powerplay-to-powerplay bowler in this World Cup so far. Tamim gets off strike first ball, which is a good idea because the left-armer is bowling heat at Mushfiqur, peppering the line of his body a couple of times, the final delivery hitting the splice and flying down to third man. Between times, Khawaja lets one through his legs at mid-off, which isn\u2019t pretty. \u201cHad my heart in my mouth after you posted that the Tamim LBW was being sent for review immediately assuming he would go,\u201d writes Frederick Herbert. \u201cAfter finding out he wasn\u2019t out I thought I\u2019d do some research. Turns out, according to this handy analysis that only 20% of on-field not-out decisions are successfully overturned (a slightly higher 34% are overturned when the initial decision is out). As a behavioural scientist I\u2019m thoroughly ashamed of myself. As Mr Kahneman says, never neglect the base rate!\u201d I suspect I\u2019m going to lift this stat. Thank you for digging into it. Most interesting. 22nd over: Bangladesh 129-2 (Tamim 53, Mushfiqur 18) Target 382 Zampa, or \u2018Zorba\u2019 as Alex Carey calls him through the stump mic, again from our northern end of the ground. He\u2019s been good so far. But Mushfiqur really wants to take him down, last time around busting out two reverse sweeps, this time smashing him back over his head for SIX! He turned it into a full toss after dancing at him. Clarke is critical of Zampa\u2019s pace, saying he is sending it down too fast. \u201cYou can premeditate as a batsman as you know it isn\u2019t going to spin past you.\u201d Good point. 21st over: Bangladesh 120-2 (Tamim 51, Mushfiqur 11) Target 382 Thanks again, Geoff. An impressive little spell this from Marcus Stoinis, the slower ball he bowled to get rid of Shakib all-but ending Bangladesh\u2019s hopes of a miracle win. Tamim is not giving up though, pulling with authority to the rope at square leg then deflecting to backward point to register his half-century in 65 balls. He\u2019s batted really well here. The resourceful Mushfiqur keeps the board ticking. There is a huge roar around Trent Bridge, causing Geoff and me to leap out of our seats in case two more fans decided to run on the field. Not to be, though: it was an image of a fan on the screen having fallen asleep. \u2018Snooze Cam\u2019 they call it. 20th over: Bangladesh 111-2 (Tamim 45, Mushfiqur 9) Mushy! Be glad that he wasn\u2019t run out, because he\u2019s brought his bag of tricks and he\u2019s here to party. Gets down low and scoops Zampa over his own shoulder for a couple of fine leg, then once more drops like it\u2019s hot and reverse-sweeps over backward point for four! Zap, pow. Misses one that he nearly nicks. Charges one and defends. Sweeps conventionally to keep the strike. All happening. They need 8.98. 19th over: Bangladesh 105-2 (Tamim 45, Mushfiqur 2) No top spot for Shakib, he has to settle for 425 runs from his fifth World Cup 2019 innings, and his first thus far that hasn\u2019t passed 50. Big chases are a lot about luck as well as skill, and there are little moments that have to go your way. Mushfiqur Rahim comes to the middle, vastly experienced wicketkeeper-bat in this team. He\u2019s nearly run out for 1 as Tamim hits straight to Smith at midwicket and sets off regardless, and Mushy can only watch and hope the ball misses as he runs to the striker\u2019s end. It does. He still ran, though. NB: Usman. It\u2019s not Zampa who does it! One of those strokes of luck that falls one way and not the other. A simple shot from Shakib, trying to turn Stonis away square, but instead he gets a leading edge that loops up to mid-off. 18th over: Bangladesh 102-1 (Tamim 44, Shakib 41) Right then. It\u2019s leg-spin time. Adam Zampa has got to for a pile of runs if Bangladesh have any hope. We\u2019ve seen that teams can get on top of him if they attack early. But also he often gets his wickets when teams try to attack him. Who wins this part of the struggle? Zampa takes the early honours, beating Tamim\u2019s outside edge with a straight ball, and going for only four singles. 17th over: Bangladesh 98-1 (Tamim 42, Shakib 39) Slashed for four! Stoinis thought he was in business there with a wide ball bowled and backward point in play. But Tamim got his shot fine of Maxwell and it flies away to the boundary. Equally he nails a whip shot to close the over, but it\u2019s saved on the fence. Again, seven runs scored including a couple more singles. Bangladesh need 8.6 per over from here and they\u2019re nudging up towards 6 an over so far. 16th over: Bangladesh 91-1 (Tamim 36, Shakib 38) Tamim finally hits a pull shot flush, and this time will collect two as Cummins has some distance to cover in the deep. Then there\u2019s a lovely late steer from Shakib that has the crowd in raptures as it beats Maxwell at gully, but they quiet down rapidly when they see third man is set quite square and will save the boundary. Tamim flicks a run, Shakib pulls one. Seven from the over. This is a crazy-tough chase, but they\u2019ve got a real sense of purpose in their batting. Shakib needs 63 to get back to the top of the runs list, by the way. Count down. 15th over: Bangladesh 84-1 (Tamim 31, Shakib 36) A classic picket fence from Stoinis: six singles, as the batsmen do a decent job of having a look at him while at least scoring a few. He looks to be bowling freely, and does what he always does, hanging back of a length to avoid letting batsmen get a good swing. 14th over: Bangladesh 78-1 (Tamim 28, Shakib 33) And these are the kind of overs they can\u2019t afford. Coulter-Nile gets away with three singles, bowling a couple of good bouncers to force a dot ball and then a mistimed pull that only gets a hurried single. Stoinis will replace Maxwell next, and they\u2019ll need to take plenty from him too... 13th over: Bangladesh 75-1 (Tamim 27, Shakib 31) If Bangladesh have any hope in this monster chase they have to target Australia\u2019s weaker bowlers. Glenn Maxwell is an obvious target. Shakib zeroes in, lofting a straight drive that hangs in the air a fair while before bouncing for four, too straight to catch. Then a flatter harder one that skips over the straight rope. And two more runs to square leg. A dozen from the over with a couple of singles. These are the kind of overs they need, and plenty of them. 12th over: Bangladesh 63-1 (Tamim 26, Shakib 20) Shakib isn\u2019t nailing the pull shot today. Tries again versus Coulter-Nile, but can\u2019t time it to get more than a single. Four of those from the over as Nathan CN settles on a difficult length to get away. Paul Headon emails in. \u201cIn reply to Nick Toovey, over 5, my over-riding memory is Hussain running out Strauss shortly before he managed a second ton on debut. As I recall, he retired from the international game immediately after getting his own 100\u2026\u201d As a direct result, presumably. I\u2019ve always said that Adam Voges should have done that, in his 20th innings when the statisticians had to count his record, during which his average went up to about 101 while he was making a huge score in New Zealand. Should have walked straight off the field at that moment and never returned. It would have made everyone so mad. 11th over: Bangladesh 59-1 (Tamim 24, Shakib 18) Thanks Adam. Now Maxwell has had a chance of ends, after Cummins had a change of ends. Off-spin from the Pavilion End now. Tamim nudges a single. Shakib drives a couple in front of point, then two more lofted over backward point. He\u2019s gone back past Finch on the World Cup runs list, and taken his personal total past 400 for the tournament. Whew. Bangladesh chasing 382 need 8 per over and they\u2019re at 5.5. 10th over: Bangladesh 53-1 (Tamim 23, Shakib 13) Target 382 Coulter-Nile is bowling the final over of the first power play and he does well to keep Shakib stuck to the crease until the penultimate delivery, the No3 leaning into a glorious straight drive for four! He tries to pull the final ball but it doesn\u2019t get beyond midwicket. A nice little recovery. Righto, I\u2019m back over to the radio for a bit. I\u2019ll leave you with Geoff. 9th over: Bangladesh 49-1 (Tamim 23, Shakib 9) Target 382 Cummins again and Shakib is very keen on a shorter ball outside the off stump, crunching his cut shot to the eastern boundary. Beautiful cricket. The crowd are very involved now. 8th over: Bangladesh 41-1 (Tamim 22, Shakib 3) Target 382 \u201cAs a Dutchmen and cricket lover, it\u2019s generally rather lonely when you try to make a conversation about what\u2019s happening. So I cannot say thank you enough to OBO for existing, cause at least I now get the joy of listening to other people\u2019s conversations.\u201d Great to have you with us, Jaap van Netten. \u201cOne point I\u2019d like to make here, seeing all the Maxwellball discussion: during the most recent series against India (when Australia still regularly lost ODIs) I remember one of you guys (I guess it was Geoff) tweeting after a cheap dismissal: \u201cthis is the ball they\u2019ll use to drop Maxwell from the World Cup team.\u201d Yeah, that was me. \u201cWhat turned this around, with Maxwell now being by far the most dangerous batsmen in their team, and everyone raving about Maxwellball? Is it really Finch being captain, rather than Smith?\u201d I think Maxwell is in a very good headspace and it doesn\u2019t hurt at all that one of his best mates is the captain. It doesn\u2019t stop certain parts of the cricket community pling into him every time he\u2019s out but he\u2019s learned how to shut all that out. NOT OUT! Well, it is a good bit of bowling but it is just pitching outside leg, so that\u2019s the end of that. Australia lose their review. HAS COULTER-NILE TRAPPED TAMIM LEG BEFORE? It has been given not out but they are sending it up to the DRS. Stand by. 7th over: Bangladesh 38-1 (Tamim 21, Shakib 2) Target 382 Shot! Tamim is away, clipping Cummins beautifully through midwicket; his third boundary. With those runs in the bank, he plays conservatively for the rest of the set, getting under the bumper when it inevitably comes, finishing with a solid push past point for two. 6th over: Bangladesh 32-1 (Tamim 15, Shakib 2) Target 382 Glenn Maxwell is it, the two southpaws in the middle surely influencing this decision. It doesn\u2019t quite work to play at the start, the offspinner overpitching and creamed for four to the cover rope by Tamim, who is in very good touch today. A few more singles follow but the Bangladesh fans are up on their feet again in protest when Khawaja\u2019s throw hits Tamim on the leg, flooring the opening for a moment. Play on. \u201cBasically, the meteorological reason for the amount of rain in Manchester is the Pennines (the hills running down the centre of the country to the east of Manchester),\u201d explains Mark Gillespie. \u201cPrevailing weather comes from the west over the Atlantic, and picks up a lot of water. When that hits high land, i.e the Pennines, it dumps it as rain.\u201d Well there we go! Most informative. 5th over: Bangladesh 25-1 (Tamim 9, Shakib 1) Target 382 Starc, into the breeze, is sending them down at 92mph. As you do. Shakib is having a look, defending then pushing one to get off the mark. Tamim gives the No3 the strike back and he has to duck under a zippy bumper to finish. Much as it was against England and West Indies, I\u2019m sure they will try and test Shakib out early with the short ball. \u201cWould Khawaja be the record holder for the highest scorer that has to hide in the dressing room for fear of being eviscerated?\u201d asks Nick Toovey. 4th over: Bangladesh 23-1 (Tamim 8, Shakib 0) Target 382 Earlier in the Cummins over, Alex Carey failed to glove adequately glove a delivery that ran away for four byes. But that\u2019s all forgotten about now. Shakib ducks his first ball. As Michael Clarke points out on telly, the excellence of Finch there was taking an extra beat rather than throwing reflexively. He had the time, took it and nailed his ping. \u201cHere is a run-out story,\u201d writes Hari Shankar. \u201cIn my school cricket as a tail-ender I was \u201cprotected\u201d by my senior top-order batsman. For three consecutive overs the last ball ended in a single. On the last ball of the fourth over I decided to do a Khawaja. Much to my chagrin and to the delight of the watching girls I was chased all over the ground by a seriously-angry-swearing bat. My heart goes out to poor Khawaja when he walked back to the Aussie dressing room.\u201d We\u2019ve all done it. I\u2019ve twice been run out before facing a ball. Once, by a bloke who now plays in the Japan national team. If you\u2019re reading, Bebe, I\u2019m over it. Brilllllliant fielding by the Australian captain! They practice that exact move at training over and over again, Finch sliding at mid-on then pinging down the stumps at the non-strikers\u2019 end. Soumya is well short, Tamim sending him back upon realising the trouble. A very nasty mix up, both men running to begin. 3rd over: Bangladesh 19-0 (Tamim 8, Soumya 10) Target 382 \u201cSteve Smith has a whole bag of gloves,\u201d says Michael Clarke on the commentary. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here for, Pup. Next: has a sack full of thigh pads? A container of helmets? Back to the middle, Soumya gets down the other end via a leg bye, Tamim tucking a single. The strike rotation is followed by back to back boundaries for Soumya, clipping aerially through square leg then glancing a rank full toss fine, which Cummins misfields on the rope! You. Do. Not. See. That. 2nd over: Bangladesh 9-0 (Tamim 7, Soumya 2) Target 382 Cummins is bowling the second over today rather than the first, as he has in the last few games. It\u2019s a nice little sidebar of the Australian campaign so far: who is the top dog, Starc or Cummins? Who has choice of end? Who picks the ball? I love this stuff. Anyway, it is Cummins from our northern or broadcast end, to Soumya to begin who drives in the air towards Warner who makes an excellent diving stop. Tamim\u2019s turn, who strikes the first boundary of the reply with a beautifully timed straight drive. \u201cEnjoying the OBO,\u201d emails Robert Hogg. Why, thank you. \u201cOn childhood memories of weather, I grew up in Manchester. Winter was mild, wet and dominated by a sky the colour of lead. You had to detect changes in the seasons by the warmth of the drizzle. I can\u2019t remember summer ever coming up as a topic of conversation.\u201d Is there a meteorological reason why it rains more in Manchester? Or is it a bit of a made up thing and it rains there as much as it does anywhere in that region? 1st over: Bangladesh 4-0 (Tamim 3, Soumya 1) Target 382 Starc opens up from the southern or pavilion end. It almost certainly has other names but let\u2019s not get into OBO End Chat quite yet. We\u2019ll save that for the Test Matches later in the summer. He\u2019s on the mark to begin, Tamim playing straight before punching with control through the gap at cover for three to get the chase underway. When the attack leader goes a fraction shorter, Soumya opens with a steer down to third man. Lovely bloke, Tamim. I went to his house to interview him in Chittagong a couple of years ago and he invited me to stay with his family for Eid lunch. Great people. Afternoon everyone. Bangladesh have to start this positively. They weren\u2019t able to against England in Cardiff in pursuit of a similar target a couple of weeks back due to the way that Archer and Woakes opened up at them. They can\u2019t allow Starc and Cummins to do something similar. Instead, take the example of Sri Lanka, who were right on top in the power play on Saturday before throwing it away. With this being the final game at Nottingham for the World Cup, the volunteers (Cricketeers) are doing a lap of honour. Nice touch. The Australians are warming up in front of us, Marcus Stoinis getting ready to bowl. \u201cBut can he get through ten overs?\u201d asks Michael Clarke. If he can\u2019t, Australia will have a decision to make. \u201cJust another thought,\u201d emails Damien McLean. \u201cThe really frustrating thing is that run out risks taking oxygen away from the story of what was a fantastic innings for Khawaja. Great to see him back in some form, even if it ended badly.\u201d Yep, I share that. He batted wonderfully. Nothing detracts from that. I wish that Maxwell had the chance to finish what he started, but there\u2019ll be other days. As the players make their way to the middle, a reminder that you can chat with me throughout Bangladesh\u2019s chase in the usual ways: email or twitter. Can the Tigers pull off something ridiculous? Or will Australia move to top spot? Let\u2019s find out. Orders don\u2019t come much taller than that. They needed 387 to win against England a couple of weeks ago, and Shakib made a hundred that gave the impression he wanted to salvage net run rate. Then they needed 322 against the West Indies and Shakib made a hundred like he\u2019d never considered the possibility of not winning. He\u2019ll need another of the latter today if they\u2019re to be any chance, but they\u2019re unlikely to get bowling anywhere near as sloppy as the men in maroon dished up. David Warner, it seems strange to say, never seemed entirely in control as he has in the past. But he showed his ability, in finding a way to fight through a tricky start and then just keep going, maintaining his aggression en route to a large and fast hundred. He laid a massive base with Finch, Khawaja played his best innings coming in lower down the order, and Maxwell came in for a devastating salvo at the end that was cut short by Khawaja and a run out. Bangladesh were dominated today. They lost the toss, had to bowl, and never threatened. They were forced by injury to bring Sabbir into the side, who dropped Warner on 10, and Rubel, who went for 83 off 9 overs without a wicket. Their opening batsman had to bail them out with the ball, taking 3 for 58. Nothing went right really. It will have to go astronomically well with the bat for this match to be anything but a foregone conclusion. Adam will be back to take you through the chase, with occasional cameos from me as the day wears on. You can direct your emails to him from here on. 50th over: Australia 381-5 (Stoinis 17, Carey 11) We\u2019re back. Mustafizur has the job of closing the innings off for Bangladesh. Carey slams a yorker to deep cover for a single, and that sets the tone for the next two balls. But when the Fizz misses that length, Stoinis powers him back past the non-striker along the ground for four, hard enough to split the men in the deep. Super shot. Followed by a very not super shot, as Stoinis aims over midwicket but gets a thick lofted edge that floats over the keeper for four more. He finishes the innings with another slammed drive and Carey coming to the danger end bolts back for two. That\u2019s one hell of a score for Australia! One over for Australia to face. A restart is announced, as the sun comes out and sweeps briefly across the ground. Ten minutes away, at 14:35 UK time. \u201cWhen I see the phrase \u2018golden arm\u2019 I always think about Mudassar Nazar\u2019s 6 for 32 at Lords in 1982. Not bad for an opener.\u201d Quite so, David Brown. Soumya bowling the death overs is right up near that level. As for the next wicket, \u201cMaybe Smith\u2019s review was on the basis that the bails weren\u2019t going to come off?\u201d writes Jim Luetchford. Hit on the front pad, while standing back on your stumps, by a full toss in front of middle... that was a review more worthy of humour than any of poor Shane Watson\u2019s work. Thanks Adam. I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t on the keys when Maxwell was run out. There would not have been enough capital letters on the internet to adequately respond. Jane Evans agrees. \u201cTopping the poll for this week\u2019s least popular Australian cricketer is David War ... no ... Steve ... no ... Usman-there-shalt-be-no-Maxwellball-Khawaja.\u201d Writes Damien McLean, \u201cThe really frustrating thing is that run out risks taking oxygen away from the story of what was a fantastic innings for Khawaja. Great to see him back in some form, even if it ended badly.\u201d It was good to see, and he played beautifully. But that really looked like the work of a batsman who was thinking about his hundred and keeping himself safe rather than what the team could make. Understandable to a point, because he\u2019s been messed around regarding his place in the side and in the batting order, and making a hundred is the riposte that no one can deny. But late in the innings you\u2019ve got to take the risks and play for the more dangerous batsman. 49th over: Australia 368-5 (Stoinis 6, Carey 9) Soumya bowling the death overs here is everything I want in World Cup cricket. Yes, Carey found a way to slap him out to the deep cover boundary late in the over - a beautifully timed shot after getting to the pitch. But nine off it? Mashrafe Mortaza would take that. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? NOW IT IS RAINING! THE PLAYERS ARE OFF THE FIELD WITH AN OVER TO BOWL! With that, back to Geoff to OBO the rain. Urrrrrgh! 48th over: Australia 359-5 (Stoinis 3, Carey 3) What an excellent fightback from Mustafizur, who was toyed with by Khawaja in his previous set. His skipper needed him to bounce back and he has in this over, getting Smith\u2019s wicket and giving up only five singles. Can\u2019t ask for much more than that from the young gun. \u201cDisappointing not to see Maxwell get a chance to go on with it,\u201d says Damien McLean. \u201cDid Khawaja have a responsibility to sacrifice himself there? Surely Khawaja had done his job by then, no shame being run out for 89 trying to build.\u201d Yes. In a word. Yes. \u201cThen to top it off goes out himself two balls later... Geez. An opportunity missed for us Maxwellball fans.\u201d Let\u2019s be happy it happened rather than sad because Usman DIDN\u2019T RUN. Three wickets in six balls for Bangladesh! The Fizz traps Smith, who was deep in his crease trying to flick to square leg but doesn\u2019t make contact. He reviews, because that\u2019s what you do in over 48, but it is hitting middle half way up. 47th over: Australia 354-4 (Stoinis 1, Smith 1) The two wickets have done the job, only two runs coming after Maxwell\u2019s run out. Two new men are out there for the final stanza. Can Bangladesh keep their cool for the next 20 minutes? Soumya has a third! Can somebody please commission me to write 2000 words about this spell? It\u2019s slow (they all are) and Khawaja is through his pull by the time the ball arrives. A tiny underedge is located on the way through and that is that. Well played Usman. That innings is going to make Justin Langer very happy. Maxwell digs out a yorker through his legs and wanted the single, Khawaja refuses to come, Maxwell is run our by Rubel\u2019s direct hit. Hmmmm. Maxwell stares at his partner. He\u2019s walking off with 32 from 10, having slammed the previous ball for six as well. [Jim Maxwell HMMMMMMM [/Jim Maxwell] 46th over: Australia 346-2 (Khawaja 89, Maxwell 26) Maxwell or Dhoni?! THIS IS REMARKABLE HITTING! THE HELICOPTER TO BEGIN, nailing it over mid-off, over the rope. Outrageous. Next? He slams Hossain through cover for four, hit so well that no sweeper had a chance. Next? HUGE over midwicket, off balance for SIX into the stands. TV tells me that Australia have added 102 runs in their last 40 balls. Go again? Well, he tries but it doesn\u2019t get all of it, falling in the gap between the sweepers at midwicket. They race back for three. Khawaja\u2019s turn, finishing the over with a lavish boundary of his own through point. \u201cGoodness me,\u201d says Ian Bishop on TV. Indeed. 25 runs from the over. Maxwell has 26 from eight balls. 45th over: Australia 321-2 (Khawaja 84, Maxwell 7) Mel Jones notes on TV that Maxwell waited for Warner to walk off the field to first receive his standing ovation. Nice touch. The new man can\u2019t quite get Soumya away upon arriving either, until the final ball when he plays a wonderful shot from a yorker-length delivery, crushing it through point for his first four. Warner fell in the over but 12 runs were added, the latter more important at this stage of the innings. Soumya again! He has never bowled more than five overs in an ODI before but today, he has both Finch and Warner. Granted, the latter is 166 from 147 when walking off , the end of a masterful hand that included 14 fours and five sixes. But still! The opener audibly groaned as his miscued uppercut ended up the hands of Hossain at short third man. Time for Glenn Maxwell? Yes. Yes it is. 44th over: Australia 309-1 (Warner 162, Khawaja 83) Rubel Hossain returns after the Mustafizur misadventure. Mortaza is rotating his bowlers an over at a time here in an effort to somehow find a wicket. Not that this would necessarily help their cause with Maxwell and Stoinis the likely next two to walk out. Goodness me, Warner plays an utter brilliant upper cut from a ball hovering around his leg stump, following his body. He still has enough time to lift it over the cordon for four. He plays that the ball after whacking a full delivery down the ground for four, bringing up the Australian 300. This is a very impressive acceleration from Australia. I didn\u2019t know if they had it in them, to be honest. 43rd over: Australia 296-1 (Warner 151, Khawaja 82) Mortaza brings himself back and it doesn\u2019t go well. Warner, having to watch on as Khawaja went wild in the previous set, begins the very same way by smashing the first ball over the rope at midwicket for another six! With a single to follow, the opener raises his 150 from 139 balls. What a knock. He has 200 on the shelf here, all of a sudden. Shane Watson has Australia\u2019s highest score (185 not out, also against Bangladesh). I wonder if he knows? Anyway, the good times roll when Khawaja again finds the boundary at backward point. 14 from the over making 59 from the last four. 42nd over: Australia 282-1 (Warner 143, Khawaja 76) As Andrew WK taught us, when it\u2019s time to party, you should party hard. Australia are taking this advice as gospel in this final stanza, Khawaja driving four to backward point, cutting another in the same direction next ball, clipping a full toss off his legs to the midwicket rope before pulling a fourth boundary of the over into the gap at backward square. Who said that Khawaja couldn\u2019t go up the gears? (Me). 19 off the over, if you don\u2019t mind. Along the way, they raised their 150-run partnership. \u201cWith Soumya Sarkar adding his name to the pantheon of \u2018Wicket-taking Part Time Bowlers\u2019, has this World Cup been particularly kind on the remarkable species?\u201d writes Aditi Prabhudesai of the one man to strike today. \u201cWe already have Joe Root, Glen Maxwell (who\u2019s graduated to a full-time bowler in this World Cup) and Finch himself adorning the list. Is it an aberration or was it ever thus?\u201d I wrote 1000 words about this very topic a few years ago in a publication that doesn\u2019t reproduce its content online. The research has paid off during many quiet moments on the radio though, so no complaints. Love me a golden arm. 41st over: Australia 263-1 (Warner 143, Khawaja 57) Thanks, Geoff. Shakib has four overs up his sleeve for the death, which is a bit unusual for a spinner in the final ten. I don\u2019t think Mortaza has got his sums quite right in those middle overs. Anyway, sure enough, Warner is happy with it, swapping his stance and getting it over third man for four! Clever. The power is there too, heaving the spinner over the short boundary at midwicket a lonnnng way back. 13 from it. Buckle up. 40th over: Australia 250-1 (Warner 133, Khawaja 54) Nothing streaky about that one! Warner drives straight, and clean, and true. Over Rubel Hossain\u2019s head and back down the ground for six. Nearly hit it to me up here in the commentary box. Then flicks a couple through backward square. \u201cEvening Geoff/Adam,\u201d says Phil Withall. \u201cI know you two are pretty close and have done a hell of a lot together but giving up any pretense of security on you computer seems a little bit too trusting. I have a lot of trust in my daughters but wouldn\u2019t let them anywhere near any of my means of communication. The 21 Jump Street style relationship I have long imagined you having seens to have been confirmed.\u201d If I may commit heresy, I refer to the 21 Jump Street reboot, where Jonah Hill says to Channing Tatum, \u201cI f***ing cherish you.\u201d We\u2019re pretty much in joint bank account territory, don\u2019t worry. Speaking of, here\u2019s Adam for half an hour. Email me, it\u2019s fine. 39th over: Australia 237-1 (Warner 123, Khawaja 52) Warner thinks that it\u2019s go time against Mustafizur. He backs away and tries to slash over cover, but misses. The ball misses his leg stump by a fraction. So Warner goes again next ball, and this time toe-ends it over cover, another streaky boundary. Mushfiq can\u2019t take the next ball cleanly as Warner misses again, and they get a bye. Khawaja can\u2019t do much with the final three balls. 38th over: Australia 230-1 (Warner 119, Khawaja 50) That\u2019s huge for Khawaja. A run-a-ball fifty when he\u2019s struggled so far in the tournament. Plays a gorgeous pull through square from Rubel for four, then raises the milestone with a single next ball. Warner has already carved four through point, then almost gets whacked in the junkyard again trying to pull when the ball is too full. Just gets some bat on it. \u201cTwo queries,\u201d writes Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cWarner double ton on the cards? If a wicket falls now, is it time for another game of Maxwellball?\u201d For question one, Warner would have to get a move on. He hasn\u2019t really opened up thus far. For question two, you\u2019d better believe it. I\u2019m sure Aaron Finch will have his best striker padded up. 37th over: Australia 218-1 (Warner 113, Khawaja 44) Mustafizur starts after drinks, the most dynamic bowler in this Bangladesh team. He\u2019s zippy, he bends it, he can bowl a good bouncer. Khawaja strides into a couple of perfect cover drives, his signature shot, but one goes straight to cover and one is stopped by the sweeper. No reward for excellence in this format. When Warner gets strike he tries to smear a short ball over midwicket, but only gets a leading edge over cover, and takes two lucky runs. \u201cLoving the dynamic OBO hangovers between you and Adam today, like an intellectual wrestling tag team. Three falls and one submission in operation?\u201d I\u2019m going to assume Brian Withington meant \u2018handovers\u2019, though we\u2019ve had a few dynamic hangovers between us in our day. As for falls and submissions, neither sounds comfortable but I\u2019m not up to date with Wrestlemania. Glad you\u2019re enjoying the style though. Needs must when the World Cup drives. 36th over: Australia 212-1 (Warner 110, Khawaja 42) Rubel Hossain is back, pace from the Radcliffe Road end after a change. He\u2019s hanging back of a length, squeezed for one by Khawaja, cut by Warner, pulled by Khawaja. Not damage on the scoreboard, but damage when Rubel smashes Warner right in the Jatz. That was box-to-box midfield stuff, and the crowd goes up in a cheer as Warner drops, but I think they were thinking he\u2019d been bowled. The ball didn\u2019t get through him, it was well and truly stopped. Uncomfortably stopped. I\u2019d rather be bowled. Warner recovers and plays on. That\u2019s drinks. 35th over: Australia 208-1 (Warner 108, Khawaja 40) Mashrafe Mortaza comes back on. David Warner doesn\u2019t mind, because there\u2019s a short ball that he can swat away for four. No one out there on the short side of the ground. Warner drives a single, so Mash tries the same ball to Usman Khawaja. Who also pulls it for four. At 80 miles an hour, that\u2019s buffet stuff. This could be a truly huge score today. 34th over: Australia 197-1 (Warner 103, Khawaja 34) More fumbles from Bangladesh, Mahmudullah the one giving away an extra run. They\u2019ve been ropey in the field today. Runs from every delivery, seven from Mehidy\u2019s over. He finishes his 10 with 0 for 59. 33rd over: Australia 190-1 (Warner 101, Khawaja 29) Warner swaps his bat on 99, then nudges a single through square leg for the milestone run. He trots down the pitch then gives it the traditional leap and punch, but he\u2019s less demonstrative than when he made his ton against Pakistan. Celebration, but not over the top. He settles back down and they take only four singles from Shakib\u2019s over. 32nd over: Australia 186-1 (Warner 99, Khawaja 27) Bonus runs for Warner, as he slams Mehidy straight at backward point but it somehow bursts through. A boundary there, then he slaps three more through cover. Warner on to 99! 31st over: Australia 177-1 (Warner 91, Khawaja 26) That is the end of Soumya. Shakib will come back into the attack. It doesn\u2019t work out for him though, as singles and doubles flow. Even though Khawaja misses one reverse sweep, then gets only a sliver of bat on a regulation sweep, that goes past the keeper and fine for four. 30th over: Australia 168-1 (Warner 89, Khawaja 19) Mehidy continues spinning them down, and Khawaja gets marooned through the second half of the over. Drives one hard into his boot, which doesn\u2019t help, and which does hurt. 29th over: Australia 165-1 (Warner 87, Khawaja 18) Thanks Adam. Soumya Sarkar will bowl his fifth over, which he\u2019s only done once before in ODIs. He probably won\u2019t get a sixth though, because Warner clouts him through long-off, then carves him through cover. 1 for 29 from five overs. Warner eyeing off another hundred. Alan Trench writes, \u201cI doubt there\u2019s such a thing as a definitive book on the game (and there\u2019s certainly a lot of dross). There are two excellent books on cricket in the Indian sub-continent, which shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Ramachandra Guha\u2019s splendid A Corner of a Foreign Field: The Indian history of a British Sport is sadly hard-to-find (and, scandalously, out of print), but well worth trying to get hold of. Peter Oborne (yes, the high-Tory political commentator) wrote a good book on Pakistani cricket, Wounded Tiger, which tells one a lot about Pakistan\u2019s social and political history since Partition too.\u201d The very best history of Pakistan cricket is The Unquiet Ones, by Osman Samiuddin. Wonderful title, wonderful book. Must read. 28th over: Australia 153-1 (Warner 77, Khawaja 16) Up comes Australia\u2019s 150 with Warner push down the ground off Mehidy. This is real middle overs accumulation batting now, neither of the left-handers attacking the ropes. This is a good place for Khawaja to be, ticking the board over without a lot of pressure to get into his innings. Back to Geoff. I\u2019ll catch you for the final ten! 27th over: Australia 149-1 (Warner 75, Khawaja 14) They seem to have got Soumya worked out now, working him around to the sweepers as they continue to build this hefty base. 26th over: Australia 144-1 (Warner 72, Khawaja 12) Nearly a run out! A combination of a fumble and a throw to the wrong end saved Warner, who wasn\u2019t as keen on a single to mid-on as Khawaja was. With the exception of one huge strike from Finch, they are playing Mehidy with a lot of respect. But Warner will back himself to take him down eventually, playing so well against Bangladesh\u2019s spinners over there across two Test tons in 2017. 25th over: Australia 139-1 (Warner 69, Khawaja 10) At last a loose delivery from Soumya, Khawaja able to collect his first boundary of the day with a pull past short fine leg. He\u2019s been given a big chance here to walk in with the foundation very much laid. Given the left/right thing that the Australians have been doing, there was every reason to expect Steve Smith to walk down the steps, not Khawaja. \u201cYet to put the game on today, it all seems rather comfortable out there based on your OBO, absolute road?\u201d asks Matthew Potter. \u201cFirst 400 of the tournament coming up?\u201d The only positive for Bangladesh is that it was gripping early for Mortaza and Mustafizur when they rolled down their off-cutters, but there isn\u2019t a blade of grass on there. It\u2019s the type of Trent Bridge track where huge scores are tallied on the reg. 24th over: Australia 132-1 (Warner 68, Khawaja 4) They\u2019re happier scoring of Mehidy this time, knocking the ball around the sweepers for seven risk-free runs. Is this Bangladesh\u2019s biggest ever World Cup game, I wonder? Sure, if they don\u2019t beat Pakistan in 1999 they don\u2019t get Test status. And yes, they beat India in 2007. But since then, has there ever been a game for them with so much on the line? 23rd over: Australia 125-1 (Warner 64, Khawaja 1) These are the dictionary definition of gentle medium pacers from Soumya Sarkar but they are very effective. Indeed, he had only one ODI wicket at 138 before today across 48 matches. He\u2019s being turned to because Mortaza doesn\u2019t have Mossadek at his disposal today, the enigmatic all-rounder picking up a niggle against West Indies on Monday. The right-armer dots up Khawaja for the majority of the over, sneaking past his inside edge to have the whole crowd appealing for leg before from the penultimate delivery. Not to be. But lovely part-time work. I should add, if you want to stay in touch with me specifically as we pass the OBO baton back and forth today, please do so on the email or the tweet. 22nd over: Australia 123-1 (Warner 63, Khawaja 1) Good cricket from Mehidy Hasan, racing through a tidy over attempting to cramp up the left-handed pair, giving up only two singles down the ground. He isn\u2019t getting a lot of turn but drift is his main weapon at the moment, trying to pass beyond an inside edge or two. 21st over: Australia 121-1 (Warner 62, Khawaja 0) The words I typed and had to quickly delete as the wicket fell were \u201cAustralia are well on the way to making a statement here and becoming the first side to 400 in this World Cup.\u201d Realistically, Finch would have needed 150-plus of those, so that equation changes with Khawaja walking out. The number three defends his first ball. I\u2019ve only gone and got Bangladesh a wicket four balls after taking over! Soumya Sarkar has been turned to as a change bowler by Mortaza and he\u2019s created an error from seemingly nowhere. Finch has tried to steer him down to the gap at third man but instead, has given catching practice to the fielder there inside the circle, Rubel doing the rest. The pro-Bangladesh crowd are UP AND ABOUT. 20th over: Australia 117-0 (Warner 59, Finch 52) A gift from Mehidy for Finch, full and outside leg stump, and he can just turn it away to fine leg for four. His pile of runs grows ever larger. Right then. Adam Collins and I will be handballing the blog back and forth a bit today, as per radio broadcasting requirements. He\u2019s on for the next little while, but you can keep emailing me and he\u2019ll get those messages. Back shortly. 19th over: Australia 110-0 (Warner 59, Finch 45) Rubel decides he\u2019s being too economical, and throws in a couple of wides to spice things up. A couple of singles, then Mithun gets tangled up trying to field and kicks the ball away from himself to concede a second run. This opening stand is growing to truly frightening proportions for Bangladesh... Aditi Prabhudesai is on the email. \u201cNo doubt Mashrafe\u2019s parents had hoped their son would take to superheroing and thus bestowed upon him an alliterative name so essential to the trade. While Mashrafe, M.P. may or may not be vigilanting on the rain-soaked Bangla streets in the dead of night, he sure is an inspiration to those of us edging closer towards the mid-thirties. Creaky knees, pot-bellies I scorn thee.\u201d 18th over: Australia 104-0 (Warner 56, Finch 44) Big appeal from Mehidy against Warner, as the batsman advances to an off-break from around the wicket and misses it. Looks like it would have been going down the leg side. Three singles. Matthew Dony writes in. \u201cIf Jessica Morgan lives in Newport, Gwent, then it doesn\u2019t matter that it doesn\u2019t actually always rain. It\u2019s grim, even on a sunny day. But if she lives in Newport, Pembrokeshire, then she\u2019s a fortunate individual. It\u2019s nice enough there that the weather hardly matters at all. Two places in one country that share a name, but could not be more different.\u201d Simmer down Matthew, you\u2019ll have the Gwent mafia on my back. 17th over: Australia 101-0 (Warner 54, Finch 43) Rubel continues to have the most comfortable day of the bowlers, conceding only three again. A brace through square for Warner, and the century partnership is up. They\u2019ve done this plenty of times, this pair. Time for drinks. 16th over: Australia 98-0 (Warner 51, Finch 43) Mehidy Hasan replaces Shakib to try to find some control. Aaron Finch don\u2019t care. Thwack. Six. Over midwicket with a slog sweep. Finch goes for another, more over long-on this time, and it goes too high and lands just inside the rope, to bounce for four. Finch is the top of the World Cup runs list now, with 386, passing Shakib\u2019s 384. Over to you Shakib, in the second innings. 15th over: Australia 86-0 (Warner 50, Finch 33) Rubel continues, and Warner is happy to calm down a bit after that last flurry. Three singles. The last of them raises Warner\u2019s fifty, and that\u2019s off 55 balls. Much more like it. \u201cManchester\u2019s rain has moved on to us here in Yorkshire, as is so often the case,\u201d writes John Starbuck. \u201cIn Nottingham, the thing to really fear is the intense hailstorm that occasionally manifests itself in June. I\u2019ve been caught in a few and it\u2019s no joke.\u201d Well, Swann says we\u2019re getting our weather from Leicestershire, and that patch of sky doesn\u2019t look too bad. 14th over: Australia 83-0 (Warner 48, Finch 32) Here comes David Warner! He takes off his false moustache, removes his spectacles, and reveals his true identity. He advances to Shakib, makes the ball into a full toss and drives it through cover for four. Then stays back, drops to one knee and smears it for six! What a shot, that went miles over midwicket. \u201cShakib just tried to float that one up, and if you do that on this surface then you get punished,\u201d says Graeme Swann on the radio, and he knows a bit about bowling at Trent Bridge. \u201cI can definitely confirm that the weather was always better in the past, particularly when we were children and summers were long and hot, winters cold and snowy. Definitely. Always.\u201d So true, Simon Ingers. 13th over: Australia 72-0 (Warner 37, Finch 32) Ah, here\u2019s Rubel Hossain. Such a big part in Bangladesh cricket, the man who took the late wickets to seal Bangladesh\u2019s progression to the knockouts in the last World Cup, and got rid of England in the process. He has one good moment against Warner this over, beating the outside edge of a flashing shot outside off, and appealing vociferously. But there was no edge. 12th over: Australia 67-0 (Warner 33, Finch 31) Shakib continues, and the Australians milk him well until Warner carves through cover, flat-batted. Sabbir Rahman puts in the long strides to the longest boundary out that way, with the bowler coming from the Radcliffe Road end, and puts in a dive to save the four. Excellent effort. \u201cHaving driven past an unthinkably sunny Trent Bridge this morning on my way to work \u2013 the crowd arriving at the ground from all sides, spilling out of buses on Loughborough, laden with cool bags and floppy hats \u2013 and thinking of the things I\u2019ve witnessed inside over the years \u2013 Broad standing his ground in 2013; Cook, Bob Willis-like, strangling Ishant Sharma down the leg-side; England smearing 445 against Pakistan \u2013 I wonder whether there many better places to watch international cricket?\u201d Hard to disagree, Christopher Davis. It\u2019s pretty as a picture, with its open white stands and its turrets and peaks, even when the clouds have come over. 11th over: Australia 60-0 (Warner 28, Finch 29) Surely the end of Mashrafe Mortaza\u2019s spell. He bowls a good over, doesn\u2019t give anything away, until the final ball ruins it. Leg stump, leg glance, four runs. Australia ticking along, and Aaron Finch moves to second on the runs list for this World Cup, going past Joe Root\u2019s 367. 10th over: Australia 53-0 (Warner 26, Finch 24) Spin time. Inside the Powerplay. It will be Shakib al Hasan, with his left-arm tweak. He\u2019s so accurate, and he lands his first couple well. But Finch plays the second better: backing away, then driving crisply along the ground, inside the man at mid-on, and down the ground for four. Wonderful stroke. A couple of singles follow. The fifty partnership arrives as well. 9th over: Australia 47-0 (Warner 25, Finch 19) Finch is really winding up now, trying a huge heave that only skews off the inside edge through midwicket for two. Mashrafe is into his fifth over, and uses his tricks, mixing up his pace. Finch goes back into his shell and taps out the rest of the over until he knocks a single past the bowler. 8th over: Australia 44-0 (Warner 25, Finch 16) Australia\u2019s captain is really winding up now. He smokes Mustafizur but straight to cover. Then hits just as hard to mid-off, who\u2019s right back on the circle, and deep enough to concede a single. So The Fizz bounces Warner, and Warner hooks for six! Not entirely timed, he got a top edge and nearly tripped over himself, but the short square boundaries give full value even for those shots. The ball has been damaged by the impact and the umpires have to choose a replacement. The Fizz bowls a yorker and Warner digs. Then a bouncer and Warner dips. Kristian Petterson writes in. \u201cCan\u2019t let this slide with entreating Wayne Murray to read Derek Birley\u2019s \u2018A Social History of English Cricket\u2019. I\u2019ve read a few and, frankly, it\u2019s peerless. Not read the Wilde yet, mind.\u201d Strap your reading glasses on, Wayne. 7th over: Australia 36-0 (Warner 18, Finch 15) That\u2019s vintage Warner! It\u2019s still in there somewhere, as he punches Mortaza effortlessly past mid-off for four. That came after an inside edge past the stumps, mind. Jessica Morgan writes in from Newport, Wales, \u201cwhere it doesn\u2019t always rain,\u201d she says. \u201cHi Geoff and everyone. Re Wayne\u2019s comment, there\u2019s a rather good book on the geography of cricket, \u2018Rain Stops Play\u2019, by Andrew Hignall, with a foreword by John Kettley (he\u2019s a weatherman, and so is Michael Fish... as the song goes). It has some good stuff on rain and the location of cricket grounds. Btw, the cover is a painting of the beautiful ground at Arundel , but sadly it\u2019s reversed. Enjoy the burning orb of gas!\u201d 6th over: Australia 31-0 (Warner 13, Finch 15) A couple more uncomfortable balls for Warner, as Mustafizur hits his thigh pad, then bowls a good short ball that requires evasive action. Last ball of the over Finch nearly nicks behind flaying outside off stump. Lots of shots, but not entirely convincing so far today! \u201cGenuinely surprised Australia didn\u2019t put the Lyon on the Line,\u201d writes Nick Toovey. \u201cHis mastery of bowling with a new ball in Test cricket would seem suited to mixing it up in the early overs if Cummins and Starc go the distance like they did against Sri Lanka. Is it still the case that there\u2019s a ball at each end? The playing conditions change in ODI\u2019s so often that it\u2019s difficult to keep up.\u201d Indeed. Two new balls, which makes reverse swing in ODI cricket a rare (and eyebrow-raising) occurrence these days. 5th over: Australia 27-0 (Warner 12, Finch 13) Mashrafe starts anew, and Finch drives him over cover for six! Lovely simple shot, just a pick-up drive from a ball that wasn\u2019t all that full. But Mashrafe is bowling from the Pavilion end and that means the short boundary is at cover for the right hander. Finch took full toll. When Warner gets on strike, he cuts hard enough to force a misfield at backward point and score two. Australia\u2019s openers starting to build. In fact that misfield looks like a dropped catch, on the replay. It carried, low, to Sabbir Rahman. Brought into the side today thanks to Mossadek\u2019s injury, and his first contribution is not a good one. 4th over: Australia 18-0 (Warner 10, Finch 6) Interesting duel here between Warner and Mustafizur. Or between Warner and himself, perhaps. Warner hits straight to the field, then is tangled up by a full straight ball. But as he looks vulnerable, Mustafizur strays onto leg stump and is put away for four through fine leg. Then strays the other way and is smoked, but straight to point. 3rd over: Australia 12-0 (Warner 6, Finch 5) Today, Aaron Finch has Shakib al Hasan in his sights. Finch has 347 runs in this World Cup, and Shakib leads the tally with 384. Finch has played two more innings, mind you, including this one. But he\u2019d love to go Top of the Pops today. Knocks away a single from Mortaza. Warner lines up for a pull shot but mistimes the hoick and it bounces to midwicket. Dot ball, then a more circumspect single. A leg bye follows. 2nd over: Australia 9-0 (Warner 5, Finch 4) Mustafizur Rahman now, left-arm pace. And that\u2019s more convincing for Warner, an economical punch through the off side that picks him up a boundary. He\u2019s not looking so comfortable when Mustafizur nails him on the pad, but there was some bat involved as the ball cut back in. Then there\u2019s a trash wide ball that Warner slams, but straight to Mehidy at point for a dot ball. 1st over: Australia 5-0 (Warner 1, Finch 4) Away we go. Mashrafe Mortaza, the captain, starts things off to David Warner. He\u2019s had a funny old tournament, pottering along when he\u2019s made a score. He does the same to start here, defending, defending, inside edging a single eventually. But when Finch comes on strike, the captain flicks four from his first ball with ease. To save typing the numbers again, here\u2019s what Warner has been up to. Morning all! Or other times of day depending where you are. It\u2019s morning at Trent Bridge, any rate. You can direct your emails to me now, rather than Mike. Thanks Mike. Here\u2019s one from Wayne Murray. \u201cOBO\u2019s live updates (and digressions involving school-boy pranks) have been a pleasing occasional distraction from work here in Cape Town. Now that the Proteas have their marching orders, I may need further distraction. The reference to the \u2018unidentified burning orb in the sky\u2019 earlier got me thinking: how did it come to pass that a nation so routinely \u201cunder the weather\u201d came to invent a sport that specifically requires good weather? Is there a definitive cricketing history that I can read over the weekend?\u201d I\u2019d recommend Simon Wilde\u2019s Biography: The Story of England Cricket. Released recently. A fine work. And just before I hand over to Geoff, some recommended reading if you have time before play starts. From Geoff himself, on his unwavering love for Glenn Maxwell: And from Russell Cunningham, on, um, his unwavering love for Steve Smith: And with that, over to Trent Bridge for some actual cricket and proper insight... \u201cAll this talk of sunshine so early in the day!\u201d writes Ross Hall. \u201cI can\u2019t help but feel we\u2019re now due a day of rain! We\u2019ve had ours in Manchester this morning\u2026Nottingham, brace yourselves!\u201d Oh please, dear god, no. Meanwhile, here\u2019s Emma John and the latest Spin Podcast, this week featuring a lineup consisting of a respected cricket writer and two comedians. I\u2019ll let you decide which ones are which (boom, boom). Team news. Three changes for Australia: Jason Behrendorff, Kane Richardson and Shaun Marsh make way for the returns of Adam Zampa, Nathan Coulter-Nile and Marcus Stoinis. For Bangladesh, Sabbir Rahman and Rubel Hossain come into the team for Mohammad Saifuddin and Mossadek Hossain. Hold the back page: Aaron Finch finally wins a toss! That\u2019s the first time this tournament Australia have done. Unsurprisingly, he reckons getting some runs on the board is a good idea; there seems to be plenty of runs in this track. First email of the day. \u201cMorning Mike.\u201d Good evening, Nick Toovey. \u201cWith the as-yet-unidentified burning orb of gas appearing over the UK that residents of other countries refer to as \u2018The Sun\u2019, and Aus finally (or rumoured to be) playing Nathan Lyon, I wonder if this is the start of the \u2018Second Phase\u2019 of the tournament as such \u2013 tired pitches, dry weather (hopefully), we could see a complete 180 from yesterday\u2019s nip-and-nibble-like-fire from de Grandhomme in muggy conditions into the long-predicted spinners World Cup in baking conditions.\u201d Burning orb of gas, you say? It\u2019s definitely up there somewhere. Doesn\u2019t get much better than this. So, we\u2019re at the halfway stage of the tournament. How\u2019s it been for you so far? The general consensus is that there is definite room for a bona fide classic match to break out at some point, if the to-date overall disappointing weather will allow it. Pertinent to today\u2019s clash, Shakib al Hasan has proved he can be a world beater, while Australia seem to bring the best out of opposition fielders. Those and more talking points (10, count \u2018em, in total), as decreed by Simon Burnton, here: Weather update: The sun is shining in Nottingham and my sources (the weather app) tell me it\u2019s currently a balmy 15 degrees with a high of a 17 expected today. All with a zero percent (0%) chance of rain! On that incredible knock from Morgan \u2013 a 71-ball 148 \u2013 his partner-in-runs Joe Root, who himself scored a tidy 88 from 82 balls, didn\u2019t seem too surprised by his captain\u2019s exploits in the win over Afghanistan at Old Trafford. He said: A lot of the time he will play in that manner, very selflessly, potentially going a little bit too hard, because he wants to set the example. He\u2019s always been capable of doing it. It\u2019s great to see him doing it on this stage, in a World Cup. I\u2019m trying to find the right word to describe his innings. It was just phenomenal really, unbelievable ball striking and it completely took the game away. Full story here: Australia currently sit in third (see for yourself), having been deposed from top spot first by England \u2013 and Eoin Morgan\u2019s brutalist interpretation of the art of batting \u2013 and then shunted further down by New Zealand, whose victory over South Africa yesterday was inspired by a measured innings from Kane Williams that was in stark contrast to Morgan\u2019s festival of six-hitting. Ali Martin wrote of the Kiwi\u2019s century: Williamson\u2019s 138-ball masterclass on a pitch that prevented risk-free shot-making was an innings for the ages. The right-hander brought up his 12th ODI century with a six that levelled the scores in the final over, before guiding a four that completed a chase of 242 with three balls and four wickets to spare. Hello and welcome. West Bridgford, not far from the banks of the River Trent, is the location for today\u2019s Cricket World Cup clash, but this blog is initially brought to you from Sydney before heading back to Nottingham on the other side of the world where the dynamic duo of Geoff Lemon and Adam Collins will handle things from their positions on the ground (or in the press box at least) at Trent Bridge. Geoff will be along shortly; in the meantime I\u2019ll fill in to get the ball rolling and the juices flowing as Australia seek to reclaim top spot on the World Cup table with victory over Bangladesh. It\u2019s a 10:30am start, local time, 7:30pm AEST. Stick around.",

Last season before the Singapore Grand Prix Hamilton attended launches of his clothing range in Shanghai and New York. He then delivered one of the best qualifying laps of his career and won the race. \u201cHe was in Shanghai on the catwalk, he was in New York a couple of days later, he came here, rock and roll and he blew everyone away,\u201d Wolff said at the time. \u201cLet\u2019s be non-judgmental and allow everyone to judge how he performed best. And he knows best what is good for him.\u201d",

Ratcliffe, the husband of the imprisoned Iranian-British dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, began the protest last weekend and has been visited by a growing number of family members, supporters and politicians, including SNP MPs and Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson. Tired but in good spirits and surrounded by flowers and signs, Ratcliffe said on Thursday he would continue at least until the weekend, when he would speak to his wife about the steps she wished him to take next. He said it had been the decision of the Iranians to erect two large corrugated iron barriers in front of the entrance to the embassy opposite Hyde Park. The ambassador, Hamid Baeidinejad, said they were designed to shield staff from being filmed. In an apparent reprisal for the protest, some of the diplomatic protection provided for the British embassy in Tehran has been removed. Watson expressed solidarity with Ratcliffe. \u201cHis family is trapped in a terrifying geopolitical game,\u201d he said. \u201cI urge the Iranian government to assist the de-escalation of military tension and release Nazanin as an act of humanity.\u201d Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence for espionage and is on hunger strike in Tehran in protest at her conditions.

      "bodyText": "The teams have been named and the battle lines drawn. State of Origin Game 2 is ready to rumble in Perth on Sunday night and, as usual, the focus has been near-completely upon the NSW Blues \u2013 and, more specifically, coach Brad Fittler\u2019s team selection. Fittler has made seven changes to an Origin team that lost Game 1 by four points, including dropping the centre who a month ago was regarded as the best player in the world. Fittler has picked fullbacks in the centres. He has picked a seven who\u2019ll play second-fiddle to the six. He has picked a tyro in the front-row and four back-rowers on the bench. And he has picked, arguably, a stronger team for Game 2 than he did for Game 1. It\u2019s arguable because chief enforcer, David Klemmer, is a huge miss for the Blues. His hard charges in the opener in Brisbane laid a platform of ragged, scattered, back-peddling Queenslanders into which the fleet-footed duo of James Tedesco and Damien Cook wrought havoc in the first 30 minutes. But then Klemmer went off and the Maroons found starch in the guts. They swamped the Blues with committed, physical defence.

      "bodyText": "Interest rates are heading for unprecedented lows below 1% and the Reserve Bank could even be forced into extraordinary measures such as money printing to stimulate the struggling economy, forecasters believe. The governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, raised expectations that the cash rate will be cut again next month when he said on Thursday that \u201cthe possibility of lower interest rates remains on the table\u201d. It prompted forecasters to price in a 0.25% reduction in the cash rate at the bank\u2019s next monetary policy meeting in July or in August. The dovish comments also raised the prospect of more reductions in the borrowing rates of Australia\u2019s millions of mortgage holders, with some market watchers tipping home lending rates to fall to 3%. But as policymakers grapple with powerful global financial forces pushing borrowing rates ever lower, many economists believe that Lowe and his colleagues will slash the cash rate to 0.75% by the end of the year. The Reserve Bank could also resort to quantitative easing of the type seen in the US, Britain and Europe after the global financial crisis. QE involves central banks buying up government bonds to pump money into the financial system and lubricate the economy. NAB economists brought forward their expectations of a cut to July from August and said the deteriorating economy would force the bank to keep on acting, perhaps even introducing QE in 2020. \u201cWe still see a strong case for the Reserve Bank to do even more on policy and expect another cut to 0.75% in November, with the risk of alternative monetary measures in 2020,\u201d they said in a note.

The European Central Bank has also said it will revert to its \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d policy to keep the eurozone economy alive. The Fed\u2019s forward advice pushed the yield, or interest rate, on US 10-year government bonds below 2%, an historic portent of recession and a level that indicates interest rates are likely to remain low for a long period.

      "bodyText": "Independent MPs who passed legislation allowing the medical evacuation of asylum seekers are urging Jacqui Lambie to use her crucial Senate vote to keep the laws in place. The Coalition has indicated it will move to repeal the so-called medevac laws when parliament resumes next month, but will need the support of four crossbench senators to do so. One Nation\u2019s two senators and independent Cory Bernardi support the government\u2019s bid to wind back the laws, while Labor, the Greens and Centre Alliance are holding firm in support of the legislation. This means Lambie is likely to have the deciding vote. The former independent Wentworth MP Kerryn Phelps, who spearheaded the legislation, told Guardian Australia she had contacted Lambie on Thursday and would lobby her to support the medical evacuation laws. \u201cI am very keen to sit down and have a chat to her about the medical aspects and medical protocols involved and the need for this legislation,\u201d Phelps said. She said her message to the senator would be to \u201ctalk to the people who have worked on Manus and Nauru\u201d. \u201cTalk to the doctors who have put together a very robust and professional process of assessment to ensure that the requirements of the legislation are met and that these people cannot get the medical attention they need on Manus Island and Nauru,\u201d she said. The Coalition has ramped up its pressure on Labor to side with the government to scrap the laws after the federal court ruled that a doctor could assess a patient\u2019s need for a medical transfer from Nauru based on their medical file. The Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie urged Lambie to withstand the \u201cscare tactics\u201d of the Coalition, saying the bill was \u201ca good piece of legislation that is saving lives\u201d. \u201cI would like to think that Jacqui will recognise how vulnerable these people are when we already have so many reports of self-harm since the election,\u201d Sharkie said. The MP for the South Australian seat of Mayo also took aim at Bernardi for backing the government\u2019s position, while also promoting his Christian beliefs. \u201cWe should be the good samaritan here and I find it quite disturbing that after all this time we are still having such a fear campaign around this legislation.\u201d Bernardi said his position on the bill had not changed, and agreed with Dutton that the federal court ruling could make it easier for people to be transferred to Australia. Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, labelled Dutton\u2019s warnings about potential boat arrivals \u201cscaremongering\u201d, insisting there was no \u201cpull factor\u201d because the laws only apply to the current cohort on Manus Island and Nauru. \u201cThis legal action was always about a clarification of the law, and provides certainty that people on Nauru can submit an application to trigger the medevac legislation and process,\u201d she said. \u201cApplicants will still be assessed by doctors, both in Nauru and Australia.\u201d But Dutton said Labor needed to change its position because people of \u201cbad character\u201d could come to Australia as a result of the legislation. \u201cIt is a bad law and it undermines border security in this country,\u201d Dutton said.",

      "bodyText": "Hospital patients are facing growing delays in getting a bed, help from staff or relief from their pain because surging demand for care is undermining how well they are looked after, the NHS care regulator has said. The proportion of people admitted to hospital who are satisfied with their care fell last year for the first time in six years, an official survey of 76,000 patients found. \u201cStaff are working incredibly hard but it is clear we have reached a point where this alone is not enough,\u201d said Prof Ted Baker, the chief inspector of hospitals at the Care Quality Commission (CQC). \u201cThe mounting pressure on the system is having a direct impact on how people are experiencing inpatient care.\u201d He said the need for care was rising so rapidly at a time of acute staff shortages that the NHS\u2019s progress towards providing better care had stalled and in some areas was going backwards. The findings of the CQC\u2019s annual inpatient survey were the worst in the last 10 years. They are based on the views of 76,000 people who were being cared for in hospital in England on one day in July 2018. Experts said the results were alarming and showed that the NHS could no longer always look after every patient properly because it was so hamstrung by shortages of staff and money. While large majorities of participants were happy with their experience, smaller numbers of people increasingly raised concerns. Some of these included: One in 10 (11%) inpatients said they should have been admitted to hospital \u201ca lot\u201d sooner \u2013 the highest percentage in a decade. Almost one in six \u201cdefinitely\u201d felt they had to wait too long to get a bed on a ward once they had been admitted. A third (33%) did not think hospital staff were doing everything they could to control their pain, while 32% felt they did not get enough help to wash. Only 59% said they could always get a member of hospital staff to help them within a reasonable time. The proportions of patients who said they always had confidence and trust in nurses (77%) and doctors (79%) both fell between 2017 and last year. Just 37% said they could definitely find a staff member with whom to discuss their worries and fears, and 53% felt they always got enough emotional support. Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, which represents specialists in general and acute medicine, said: \u201cThe results from the data released by the CQC absolutely reflect the everyday realities of urgent medical care in the NHS. They show that despite the often heroic efforts of staff on the ground, the relentless pressures building in the system for years on end are starting to take a toll. \u201cThe dissatisfaction expressed might reflect the growing realism amongst the population that the NHS is struggling, and not only in winter, and people are no longer prepared to put up with things that aren\u2019t good enough. It is of no surprise that given the issues around staffing, at times people cannot find someone to talk to when they felt the need.\u201d Fewer patients said they felt involved with their care and had received written information about their medicines. Discharge from hospital was another area of concern. A quarter said their release from hospital was delayed by at least four hours, while 40% did not get printed information about how to look after themselves when they got home.

Shirley Anne Somerville, the equalities secretary, said she would launch new consultations to ensure that anxieties that women and girls could fall victim to predatory men or lose access to single-sex services were properly addressed. Somerville said the Scottish government was determined to update the legal rights of trans men and women, with a simpler, quicker process to allow people to get a new gender recognition certificate through self-declaration rather than requiring medical evidence. Ministers wanted to allow trans men and women to get a certificate six months after starting to live in their acquired gender, after signing a legally binding statutory declaration.

Consult on whether to lower the minimum age to apply for a gender recognition certificate from 18 to 16, and improve support for children considering changing gender. Set up a working group on how to extend legal gender recognition to non-binary people. Her decision to reassess and delay the legislation was widely welcomed at Holyrood and by women\u2019s groups who had campaigned for a review of the government\u2019s original proposals.

      "body": "<p>On Thursday evening, after five ballots in eight days among Conservative MPs, the 10 original would-be successors to Theresa May were finally reduced to two: Boris Johnson and, trailing a distant second, the foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt. The two will now face the Tory membership before one of them emerges next month in a postal ballot as the new party leader. For the first time, a prime minister of the UK will be chosen by party grassroots activists. This means the new leader will <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48395211\" title=\"\">largely be the choice</a> of middle-class white men over 55 in the south of England who support the death penalty, oppose income redistribution and back a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>It is worth reminding ourselves that this wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. For the last decade, the Tory party at Westminster has been keenly alive to the fact that the final say in the next leadership contest would rest with a relatively small and unusually rightwing membership. Tory MPs have spent countless hours over long years in exclusive dining clubs plotting and gaming the options to prevent Mr Johnson, whom many of them loathe personally and oppose politically, from getting into the final two. Yet when the chips were down, this came to precisely nothing. Fear of the Brexit party has combined with the onward march of the Tory right to blow away old orthodoxies about what kind of person might make a suitable national leader, with Mr Hunt just scraping into the final to represent what remains of centrist Toryism.</p> <p>There was a lot of talk during the past two weeks about how Tory MPs are a sophisticated \u2013 for which read untrustworthy \u2013 electorate, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/20/amber-rudd-challenge-boris-johnson-tactical-voting\" title=\"\">dark hints</a> about how Mr Johnson\u2019s camp might \u201clend\u201d votes to other candidates to ensure the elimination of dangerous rivals or the success of others thought more beatable. Some of this may have gone on at the margins, as Michael Gove\u2019s supporters will doubtless believe after Mr Hunt narrowly edged him out in the fifth round. But most of the talk was self-important untruth. The most striking thing about the parliamentary phase that ended on Thursday evening is how consistent the successive ballot results were. Mr Johnson led easily on every round and put on votes each time. He is clearly the favourite to win in the members\u2019 ballot and to succeed Mrs May. From the start, his rivals were fighting for survival or, in Mr Gove\u2019s and Mr Hunt\u2019s case, for second place. The only significant moves during the five ballots were Rory Stewart\u2019s brief flurry in the second round, which was soon extinguished in the third, and Mr Gove\u2019s overtaking of Mr Hunt in Thursday\u2019s fourth ballot as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48707448\" title=\"\">Sajid Javid</a> was eliminated.</p> <p>The overall conclusion is that, in the absence of a more compelling centre-right option, the Tory party has made another significant slide to the hard-Brexit right. Mr Stewart flew the flag of Brexit compromise, and his future career will be worth watching, but his wing of the party was undone by divisions when faced with the right\u2019s unity behind Mr Johnson.

      "bodyText": "On Thursday evening, after five ballots in eight days among Conservative MPs, the 10 original would-be successors to Theresa May were finally reduced to two: Boris Johnson and, trailing a distant second, the foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt. The two will now face the Tory membership before one of them emerges next month in a postal ballot as the new party leader. For the first time, a prime minister of the UK will be chosen by party grassroots activists. This means the new leader will largely be the choice of middle-class white men over 55 in the south of England who support the death penalty, oppose income redistribution and back a no-deal Brexit. It is worth reminding ourselves that this wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. For the last decade, the Tory party at Westminster has been keenly alive to the fact that the final say in the next leadership contest would rest with a relatively small and unusually rightwing membership. Tory MPs have spent countless hours over long years in exclusive dining clubs plotting and gaming the options to prevent Mr Johnson, whom many of them loathe personally and oppose politically, from getting into the final two. Yet when the chips were down, this came to precisely nothing. Fear of the Brexit party has combined with the onward march of the Tory right to blow away old orthodoxies about what kind of person might make a suitable national leader, with Mr Hunt just scraping into the final to represent what remains of centrist Toryism. There was a lot of talk during the past two weeks about how Tory MPs are a sophisticated \u2013 for which read untrustworthy \u2013 electorate, and dark hints about how Mr Johnson\u2019s camp might \u201clend\u201d votes to other candidates to ensure the elimination of dangerous rivals or the success of others thought more beatable. Some of this may have gone on at the margins, as Michael Gove\u2019s supporters will doubtless believe after Mr Hunt narrowly edged him out in the fifth round. But most of the talk was self-important untruth. The most striking thing about the parliamentary phase that ended on Thursday evening is how consistent the successive ballot results were. Mr Johnson led easily on every round and put on votes each time. He is clearly the favourite to win in the members\u2019 ballot and to succeed Mrs May. From the start, his rivals were fighting for survival or, in Mr Gove\u2019s and Mr Hunt\u2019s case, for second place. The only significant moves during the five ballots were Rory Stewart\u2019s brief flurry in the second round, which was soon extinguished in the third, and Mr Gove\u2019s overtaking of Mr Hunt in Thursday\u2019s fourth ballot as Sajid Javid was eliminated. The overall conclusion is that, in the absence of a more compelling centre-right option, the Tory party has made another significant slide to the hard-Brexit right. Mr Stewart flew the flag of Brexit compromise, and his future career will be worth watching, but his wing of the party was undone by divisions when faced with the right\u2019s unity behind Mr Johnson. The hard Brexiters managed 117 votes against Theresa May in the December no-confidence challenge and 118 against her Brexit deal in January. In the first ballot last week, Mr Johnson got a similar number, 114. But in the later rounds the majority of Tory MPs failed to unite behind the most obvious centre-right candidate, Mr Hunt, while many defected into the Johnson camp to ensure a triumph for the right. These less hardline MPs presumably rallied to Mr Johnson from a combination of ministerial ambition, the belief that he can save their seats and a hope \u2013 flippantly endorsed by George Osborne\u2019s Evening Standard on Thursday \u2013 that Mr Johnson is not the hard Brexiter he says he is. Many will be disappointed on all three. Mr Johnson is a chancer, not a strategist. He is one gaffe or scandal away from being a liability rather than an asset. He has no clear Brexit plan and, even if he did, he lacks a majority in parliament. He is, though, the reckless architect of the reckless decision to leave the EU.

      "body": "<p>Conservative MPs have spoken: after five rounds of voting it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2019/jun/20/and-then-there-were-two-politics-weekly-podcast\">Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt</a> who will go to the 120,000-plus party membership as the two candidates to replace Theresa May as leader. What are the differences between their policies and personalities? Here\u2019s what we know so far.</p> <h2>Brexit</h2> <p><strong>Johnson: </strong>He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate last week, Johnson said only that it was \u201ceminently feasible\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Hunt:</strong> He says a new deal with the EU is possible by 31 October and he would send a cross-party negotiating team to Brussels, including members of the DUP. He would countenance leaving the EU without a deal but is notably more wary than Johnson. A key moment of the BBC debate came when Hunt recalled meeting a sheep farmer who said he would be wiped out by post-no-deal tariffs. Hunt contrasted Johnson\u2019s \u201cdream\u201d of becoming PM with the fate of the farmer losing a family business.</p> <h2>Personal style</h2> <p><strong>Johnson:</strong> While campaign-period Johnson has been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, his primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun, and of not \u2013 to use the phrase endlessly trotted out against those less enthusiastic for Brexit \u2013 \u201ctalking Britain down\u201d. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor. The caveat is both that Johnson was a notably more liberal figure then and that his victories relied in large part on votes from the capital\u2019s traditionally Tory outer suburbs. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/20/jeremy-hunt-and-boris-johnson-are-final-two-in-tory-leadership-race\">Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson are final two in Tory leadership race</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Hunt:</strong> His style is notably technocratic, with few rhetorical flourishes and an emphasis on his consensual approach and long record as a minister, notably during more than five years as health secretary, a traditional graveyard of ministerial careers. Hunt\u2019s attempts to talk up a backstory as an \u201cunderestimated\u201d entrepreneur can fall flat given he is also the son of an admiral and was head boy at Charterhouse. Overall, Hunt\u2019s approach can seem uninspiring and hard to pin down in terms of core beliefs, hence the \u201cTheresa in trousers\u201d nickname among some Tory MPs \u2013 one that is more catchy than accurate (since May herself often wears trousers).</p> <h2>Taxation</h2> <p><strong>Johnson:</strong> His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members. While this has at times been styled as an aspiration (not least as it would struggle to get through parliament), Johnson backers such as Liz Truss say it is a definite plan. Johnson\u2019s camp insist it would be part of a wider \u2013 and so far unknown \u2013 package of tax changes.</p> <p><strong>Hunt:</strong> Has been fairly silent on this, beyond a proposal to cut corporation tax from 19% to 12.5%, which would cost an estimated \u00a313bn a year. Even at 19%, the UK rate is well below European and global averages.</p> <h2>Public spending</h2> <p><strong>Johnson:</strong> He has said relatively little on this, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding and to equalise schools spending across regions, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country. Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted \u201cBoris island\u201d airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services.</p> <p><strong>Hunt: </strong>There have been few specifics so far. Before the campaign began he called for a doubling of defence spending, but he has since pulled back slightly, saying only that it should increase. At the BBC debate Hunt called for a boost to public services, and he risked annoying May by arguing that cuts to social care budgets had gone too far.</p> <h2>Climate and environment</h2> <p><strong>Johnson:</strong> This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050. Like the other candidates, when asked about the climate emergency at the BBC TV debate, Johnson had no particularly bold promises to make.</p> <p><strong>Hunt:</strong> Also backs the 2050 target for zero net carbon emissions and has called for \u201csensible tax incentives\u201d to encourage green initiatives, but very little beyond this.</p> <h2>Foreign policy</h2> <p><strong>Johnson:</strong> While this is also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on \u201cglobal Britain\u201d, it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary, a tenure he has mentioned in the campaign notably less often than his time as London mayor. He was seen as something of a joke by diplomats \u2013 both UK and foreign \u2013 and is likely to face more questioning over his gaffe about the jailed British-Iranian woman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</a>, especially now she and her husband are on hunger strike.</p> <p><strong>Hunt: </strong>A likely strength for him, as he has been seen as a solid foreign secretary, an impression burnished by taking over from the chaotic Johnson. This has been a key part of his pitch.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Conservative MPs have spoken: after five rounds of voting it is Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt who will go to the 120,000-plus party membership as the two candidates to replace Theresa May as leader. What are the differences between their policies and personalities? Here\u2019s what we know so far. Brexit Johnson: He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate last week, Johnson said only that it was \u201ceminently feasible\u201d. Hunt: He says a new deal with the EU is possible by 31 October and he would send a cross-party negotiating team to Brussels, including members of the DUP. He would countenance leaving the EU without a deal but is notably more wary than Johnson. A key moment of the BBC debate came when Hunt recalled meeting a sheep farmer who said he would be wiped out by post-no-deal tariffs. Hunt contrasted Johnson\u2019s \u201cdream\u201d of becoming PM with the fate of the farmer losing a family business. Personal style Johnson: While campaign-period Johnson has been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, his primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun, and of not \u2013 to use the phrase endlessly trotted out against those less enthusiastic for Brexit \u2013 \u201ctalking Britain down\u201d. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor. The caveat is both that Johnson was a notably more liberal figure then and that his victories relied in large part on votes from the capital\u2019s traditionally Tory outer suburbs. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass. Hunt: His style is notably technocratic, with few rhetorical flourishes and an emphasis on his consensual approach and long record as a minister, notably during more than five years as health secretary, a traditional graveyard of ministerial careers. Hunt\u2019s attempts to talk up a backstory as an \u201cunderestimated\u201d entrepreneur can fall flat given he is also the son of an admiral and was head boy at Charterhouse. Overall, Hunt\u2019s approach can seem uninspiring and hard to pin down in terms of core beliefs, hence the \u201cTheresa in trousers\u201d nickname among some Tory MPs \u2013 one that is more catchy than accurate (since May herself often wears trousers). Taxation Johnson: His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members. While this has at times been styled as an aspiration (not least as it would struggle to get through parliament), Johnson backers such as Liz Truss say it is a definite plan. Johnson\u2019s camp insist it would be part of a wider \u2013 and so far unknown \u2013 package of tax changes. Hunt: Has been fairly silent on this, beyond a proposal to cut corporation tax from 19% to 12.5%, which would cost an estimated \u00a313bn a year. Even at 19%, the UK rate is well below European and global averages. Public spending Johnson: He has said relatively little on this, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding and to equalise schools spending across regions, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country. Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted \u201cBoris island\u201d airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services. Hunt: There have been few specifics so far. Before the campaign began he called for a doubling of defence spending, but he has since pulled back slightly, saying only that it should increase. At the BBC debate Hunt called for a boost to public services, and he risked annoying May by arguing that cuts to social care budgets had gone too far. Climate and environment Johnson: This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050. Like the other candidates, when asked about the climate emergency at the BBC TV debate, Johnson had no particularly bold promises to make. Hunt: Also backs the 2050 target for zero net carbon emissions and has called for \u201csensible tax incentives\u201d to encourage green initiatives, but very little beyond this. Foreign policy Johnson: While this is also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on \u201cglobal Britain\u201d, it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary, a tenure he has mentioned in the campaign notably less often than his time as London mayor. He was seen as something of a joke by diplomats \u2013 both UK and foreign \u2013 and is likely to face more questioning over his gaffe about the jailed British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, especially now she and her husband are on hunger strike. Hunt: A likely strength for him, as he has been seen as a solid foreign secretary, an impression burnished by taking over from the chaotic Johnson. This has been a key part of his pitch.",

      "body": "<p>Paul Mason is right (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/18/labour-brexit-remain\" title=\"\">Labour has no choice but to back remain</a>, 19 June), but Brexit policy change alone will not regain lost support. To be credible there must be a change of leadership and a decisive break from three years of failed \u201cconstructive ambiguity\u201d over Brexit. By echoing the Conservatives\u2019 \u201crespect the will of the people\u201d nonsense, Labour has locked itself into a blind alley.</p> <p>Under new leadership Labour should explain what a Tory Brexit means: the devastation of employment as industries reduce UK operations or quit altogether rather than face the logistical nightmare of border controls, tariffs, increased bureaucracy and an end to single-market harmonisation; further decline in inward investment; reduced diplomatic status; reputation damage; reduced access to Europe-wide instruments in fighting organised crime and terrorism; loss of access to dozens of specialist agencies; loss of influence in EU defence and international security institutions; damage to Anglo-French defence and security relations; a degraded role in the transatlantic alliance; a weakened voice inside Nato; exclusion from EU-negotiated trade agreements with over 60 countries; threats to peace in Northern Ireland and the Good Friday agreement; risks to the integrity of the United Kingdom itself, including potential Scottish independence.</p> <p>Economic damage will make Labour\u2019s plans to invest in the NHS, social care, the regions, technology, research and renewable energy completely unaffordable. Only under new leadership and a remain policy can Labour emerge stronger from this chaos.<br><strong>Dr Simon Sweeney</strong><br><em>University of York</em></p> <p>\u2022 I must disagree with Paul Mason. I don\u2019t think he has realised that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s appeal as a politician is his integrity: he is a man of his word and acts on principle. What Mason wants him to be is just another politician, a person without principle, like Boris Johnson, who calculates what manoeuvres will bring political success. If that means contradicting on Wednesday what you said on Monday, like Nick Clegg over tuition fees, then so be it.</p> <p>Mason, like many others, is trying to get the Labour party to support remain and to call for a second referendum because he thinks it will pay political dividends. But the Labour party has a moral obligation to honour the results of the referendum and indeed in its last election manifesto made a promise to do so. It is unscrupulous to break a promise because you think that breaking it will bring you an advantage. Corbyn, unlike those who are urging him to break his promise, knows this.<br><strong>Malcolm Pittock</strong><br><em>Bolton</em></p> <p>\u2022 Why in the Brexit debate is freedom of movement only discussed in terms of inward immigration to the UK and its future control? Citizens of the EU27 nations will continue to enjoy their right to freedom of movement within the 27, while UK \u201ccitizens of nowhere\u201d who have embraced this freedom lose these rights through no choice of our own. Our opportunities for outward immigration are being stripped away. I for one am bereft.<br><strong>Margot Crookshank</strong><br><em>Hove</em></p> <p>\u2022 Paul Mason quite rightly challenges, at last, the wisdom of the Labour leadership\u2019s indulgence of leave voters in traditionally Labour-voting areas, emphasising how many remain voters (many from the same areas) this policy risks alienating.</p> <p>For more than three years Labour seems to have accepted that there is nothing it can do about Labour supporters who voted leave.

      "bodyText": "Paul Mason is right (Labour has no choice but to back remain, 19 June), but Brexit policy change alone will not regain lost support. To be credible there must be a change of leadership and a decisive break from three years of failed \u201cconstructive ambiguity\u201d over Brexit. By echoing the Conservatives\u2019 \u201crespect the will of the people\u201d nonsense, Labour has locked itself into a blind alley. Under new leadership Labour should explain what a Tory Brexit means: the devastation of employment as industries reduce UK operations or quit altogether rather than face the logistical nightmare of border controls, tariffs, increased bureaucracy and an end to single-market harmonisation; further decline in inward investment; reduced diplomatic status; reputation damage; reduced access to Europe-wide instruments in fighting organised crime and terrorism; loss of access to dozens of specialist agencies; loss of influence in EU defence and international security institutions; damage to Anglo-French defence and security relations; a degraded role in the transatlantic alliance; a weakened voice inside Nato; exclusion from EU-negotiated trade agreements with over 60 countries; threats to peace in Northern Ireland and the Good Friday agreement; risks to the integrity of the United Kingdom itself, including potential Scottish independence. Economic damage will make Labour\u2019s plans to invest in the NHS, social care, the regions, technology, research and renewable energy completely unaffordable. Only under new leadership and a remain policy can Labour emerge stronger from this chaos. Dr Simon Sweeney University of York \u2022 I must disagree with Paul Mason. I don\u2019t think he has realised that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s appeal as a politician is his integrity: he is a man of his word and acts on principle. What Mason wants him to be is just another politician, a person without principle, like Boris Johnson, who calculates what manoeuvres will bring political success. If that means contradicting on Wednesday what you said on Monday, like Nick Clegg over tuition fees, then so be it. Mason, like many others, is trying to get the Labour party to support remain and to call for a second referendum because he thinks it will pay political dividends. But the Labour party has a moral obligation to honour the results of the referendum and indeed in its last election manifesto made a promise to do so. It is unscrupulous to break a promise because you think that breaking it will bring you an advantage. Corbyn, unlike those who are urging him to break his promise, knows this. Malcolm Pittock Bolton \u2022 Why in the Brexit debate is freedom of movement only discussed in terms of inward immigration to the UK and its future control? Citizens of the EU27 nations will continue to enjoy their right to freedom of movement within the 27, while UK \u201ccitizens of nowhere\u201d who have embraced this freedom lose these rights through no choice of our own. Our opportunities for outward immigration are being stripped away. I for one am bereft. Margot Crookshank Hove \u2022 Paul Mason quite rightly challenges, at last, the wisdom of the Labour leadership\u2019s indulgence of leave voters in traditionally Labour-voting areas, emphasising how many remain voters (many from the same areas) this policy risks alienating. For more than three years Labour seems to have accepted that there is nothing it can do about Labour supporters who voted leave. Has it ever thought about actually trying to persuade people? It can\u2019t be that difficult to expose Brexit for the extreme rightwing coup it is, its chief cheerleaders a mixture of old Etonians and failed bond dealers with no interest in protecting jobs, the NHS, workers\u2019 rights or indeed anything other than their own careers and pockets. Of course, some people will remain committed to Brexit, but a bit of enthusiasm and leadership in 2016 might have made all the difference \u2013 and still could. The Labour leadership\u2019s feeble performance during the referendum campaign and since is why I no longer vote Labour. Matthew Taylor Hove \u2022 You report (Corbyn rebuffs calls to win back voters with move towards remain, 20 June) that 26 Labour MPs have warned Jeremy Corbyn that embracing a second Brexit referendum would be \u201ctoxic to our bedrock voters\u201d and that \u201cparty strategists\u201d have produced evidence for the shadow cabinet that a more pro-remain position would not win back voters in sufficient numbers. These assessments are countered by the article by Peter Kellner, based on the latest YouGov polling evidence, that you published online (Trying to unite the country over Brexit won\u2019t win Labour a general election, 19 June) but not in print. Kellner wrote that \u201cIn all bar a very few constituencies, most Labour supporters in leave constituencies voted remain three years ago\u201d and that a decisive move towards a fresh referendum would lose the party only a small number of voters. So who are we to believe \u2013 YouGov, or a small collection of anti-second-referendum Labour MPs and backroom strategists?

They\u2019re people, not problems, and their welfare is our priority at Brighton and Hove city council. Your report (UK homeless crisis triggers council purge of \u2018tent cities\u2019, 18 June) says we charge \u00a325 to return a confiscated tent to rough sleepers. The way we manage tents in the city reflects the range of reasons people camp illegally. Brighton is a tourist destination, and people often pitch tent on the beach in summer rather than paying for official campsites. The \u00a325 charge is for storage of tents removed following advice to the occupants that they\u2019re pitched where camping is not allowed. The fee is designed as a deterrent to stop people camping in the city. Tents are usually removed when they\u2019ve been abandoned. It\u2019s not always easy to know if a tent is abandoned or not when it\u2019s not in use. The \u00a325 storage fee is waived for anyone who is homeless or sleeping rough.

That was one of the great Royal Ascot days of all-time. Frankie Dettori is a master of his craft and racing is going to miss him once he\u2019s gone. But it won\u2019t be for some years yet as he needs the thrill that the sport gives him and this will have encouraged him to stay around for longer.

Among the most relieved was Robert Speechley, taking bets as Posh Bookmakers, who owns the S&amp;D Bookmakers firm that has 10 shops around Peterborough.<br><br>\u201cThe liabilities in those shops [if Dettori had kept winning] was a quarter of a million pounds,\u201d Speechley said. \u201cIt was massive, massive to get him beat. I can hardly get the words out. I thought he\u2019d won a distance.\u201d<br><br>But the ring was eerily quiet in the five minutes before the Britannia began, with no visible sign of panic, because the huge change since Dettori\u2019s magnificent seven in 1996 is the advent of betting exchanges. The high street bookmaking firms sent boatloads of cash to the track in 1996 to shorten the odds of Dettori\u2019s mounts but the belief now is that that action goes straight online. While the Italian\u2019s fans were cleaning up, some of the bookies here were still turning a profit.<br><br>\u201cYears ago, all the off-course bookmakers would be running for cover,\u201d said Geoff Banks, standing in the middle of Ascot\u2019s front line of bookies and speaking before Turgenev\u2019s defeat. \u201cBut they don\u2019t lay multiples any more. Otherwise, there\u2019s no chance Stradivarius would have gone off at even money, it would have been 4-7 or something like that. <br><br>\u201cThese days, they\u2019re not laying the multiples, they\u2019re playing the exchanges, and everybody that\u2019s here, they\u2019re all casual investors.<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t see the firms playing at all. Many years ago, my father [John Banks, also a bookmaker] said the biggest touch he ever had was not to be here on Frankie\u2019s big day. He was in America and that must have saved him everything. He said he would have stood the last winner, Fujiyama Crest, for the maximum, it had no chance on form. The house, my schooling, everything would have gone.<br><br>\u201cToday, there seems to be no alarm. It wont be dramatic here because on Ladies Day, the wagering is a lot smaller. The other days, we\u2019re taking some proper bets, \u00a340,000 to \u00a31,000 each-way. We\u2019ve had some \u00a3500s and \u00a31,000s, so it\u2019s been OK. But today, a lot smaller.<br><br>\u201cStradivarius came up a winner on my book, even though I was 6-5 at the off. All the casual customers here, good luck to them, but they want bigger odds. An even-money chance, what\u2019s that to them? It\u2019s not even odds they understand.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9e21a6b0f2f11425b4ebcb5c6d042f4a921e2c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9e21a6b0f2f11425b4ebcb5c6d042f4a921e2c3/0_140_4210_2526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The villainous Harry Bentley saves the bookmakers from a meltdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The villainous Harry Bentley saves the bookmakers from a meltdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images for Ascot Racecourse</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-20T16:35:24.039Z\">at 5.35pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d0bb3c78f081e872734b84c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-20T16:28:23.423Z\">5.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Frankie could still ride five winners.

Sir Ron Priestley is unbeaten in two this year and was at one stage being considered for a Group Two contest rather than this handicap; it looks as though connections feel his rating is still lenient and one can easily imagine why, in light of his comfortable wins.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db4c3e2f944d6d02c855f3c67a9e7d4f59b660ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db4c3e2f944d6d02c855f3c67a9e7d4f59b660ff/409_0_3683_2211/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frankie Dettori riding Stradivarius (yellow cap) on their way to winning the Gold Cup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frankie Dettori riding Stradivarius (yellow cap) on their way to winning the Gold Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Crowhurst/Getty Images for Ascot Racecourse</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0baf228f080e828514c335\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-20T16:10:32.885Z\">5.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Britannia Stakes Handicap (5.00pm) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>1 <strong>Biometric</strong> (Harry Bentley) 28-1 <br>2 <strong>Turgenev</strong> (L Dettori) 7-2 Fav <br>3 <strong>Fanaar</strong> (Dane O\u2019Neill) 50-1 <br>4 <strong>Awe</strong> (K McEvoy) 14-1 <br>28 ran <br>Non Runners: 5,16,26,24 </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38148d813301637fc0bf2bcd39614c3c33d6e8c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38148d813301637fc0bf2bcd39614c3c33d6e8c0/0_0_3500_2212/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Biometric ridden by Harry Bentley on the way to winning the Britannia Stakes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"632\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biometric ridden by Harry Bentley on the way to winning the Britannia Stakes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Davy/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-20T16:24:32.575Z\">at 5.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d0bad538f081e872734b7ef\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-20T16:04:00.084Z\">5.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Britannia Stakes (5.00pm)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And they\u2019re off ...

The ground must be a worry for King Ademar, who was a non-runner because of soft ground here in May. Motafaawit looks the right type, having beaten a subsequent winner to score here last time.

His popularity means recreational punters will have chanced their arms on the man on fire and bookies are taking evasive action on his last three rides of the day.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"382a72a591cae9d7066309c6ea1c87c1beeb66ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/382a72a591cae9d7066309c6ea1c87c1beeb66ae/0_95_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frankie Dettori returns triumphant on Star Catcher after the Ribblesdale Stakes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frankie Dettori returns triumphant on Star Catcher after the Ribblesdale Stakes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0b9e608f081e872734b6cd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-20T14:56:11.844Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s all Frankie!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BeemieAwards/status/1141703346451025920\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Updated Ascot&#39;s Wiki page. <a href=\"https://t.co/l6ZMa6ekuK\">pic.twitter.com/l6ZMa6ekuK</a></p>&mdash; Jason Beem (@BeemieAwards) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BeemieAwards/status/1141703346451025920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 20, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0b9de68f080e828514c220\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-20T14:53:38.083Z\">3.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s building ...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sharpeangle/status/1141720627696549888\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Frankie&#39;s winning accumulator odds on Magnificent Seven day were 25,095/1.

This is hard to fathom. As he has shown repeatedly over the last two years, he is an exceptional stayer and can prove it with a second success in Royal Ascot\u2019s feature race. Versatile as to ground and increasingly hard to outbattle, Stradivarius has the right men around him to make the most of his exuberant talent, in John Gosden and Frankie Dettori. He can outclass Cross Counter, whose globetrotting exploits, while impressive, still leave him something to prove here. When last seen in Britain, the Godolphin horse was beaten in a Group Two, though he did have Dee Ex Bee four lengths behind on his previous start. </p> <p>Dee Ex Bee has made a good start to his career in marathons but the form of his wins doesn\u2019t entitle him to take this. Flag Of Honour might be more of a threat, bearing in mind he got within three lengths of Stradivarius last year when just a three-year-old.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9d8d870aa1f766ef25179cc849c32f607a9f81e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9d8d870aa1f766ef25179cc849c32f607a9f81e/407_197_2445_3056/800.jpg\" alt=\"Frankie Dettori is on the Gold Cup favourite and looks unstoppable right now.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frankie Dettori is on the Gold Cup favourite and looks unstoppable right now.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Davies/racingfotos.com/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0b9bdf8f080e828514c20b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-20T14:47:57.295Z\">3.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ribblesdale Stakes (3.40pm) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>1 <strong>Star Catcher</strong> (L Dettori) 4-1 <br>2 <strong>Fleeting</strong> (R L Moore) 7-4 Fav <br>3 <strong>Sparkle Roll </strong>(Oisin Murphy) 11-1 <br>11 ran <br>Also: 9-2 Queen Power 4th</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01aff4e028e20c7b3dff58d9d5bd0563c0a500f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01aff4e028e20c7b3dff58d9d5bd0563c0a500f5/0_0_3265_1961/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Star Catcher ridden by Jockey Frankie Dettori wins the Ribblesdale Stakes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Star Catcher ridden by Jockey Frankie Dettori wins the Ribblesdale Stakes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-20T14:52:09.278Z\">at 3.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d0b9a548f082364d7cedd8a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-20T14:40:41.395Z\">3.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ribblesdale Stakes (3.40pm)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And they\u2019re off ...

She seemed beaten on merit when sixth in the Oaks but perhaps she has more to offer three weeks down the line.

His plugging-on fourth in the French Derby was a bit dour but reads well in this company and, as a brother to Highland Reel, he should have plenty of improvement in him. Headman has become a non-runner because of the rain-softened ground but that won\u2019t be a problem for King Ottokar, who won in the Newbury mud in April, beating Dancing Willoughby, the Queen\u2019s Vase winner on Wednesday. He may not have stayed in the Chester Vase and this return to 10 furlongs could help, though it\u2019ll be a stiff 10 furlongs. </p> <p>Fox Chairman was also beaten at Chester, in the Dee Stakes, when he didn\u2019t get a clear run but seemed to me to lack a bit of tactical speed. I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s as short as 4-1. Sangarius was third to King Of Comedy last time, which is strong form, but his pedigree isn\u2019t crying out that he wants 10 furlongs on soft and he hung badly last time. Great Scot won\u2019t stay unless he learns to settle and is a risk in this atmosphere.

He\u2019s had a fruitful week but his critics were still out in force after he was well beaten on Norway, 11-4 favourite for Wednesday\u2019s Queen\u2019s Vase. Looking at the replay again this morning, I think he was the victim of circumstance to a large extent. On the short run to the first bend, a row of three horses went past on his outside, heading for the front of the field, and you can almost see him thinking: \u2018Hold on, they\u2019re about to go a bit quick here.\u2019 On a horse whose stamina was not assured, he understandably opted to settle out the back. What happens next but those horses, having reached the front, slam on the brakes and it becomes a steady pace all the way down to Swinley Bottom. The first three at that point remained in the first three all the way to the line. With half a mile to go, Norway was obviously in an impossible position, though it has to be said he still didn\u2019t finish like a horse who could have done a lot better behind a stronger pace. It was a frustrating experience for his backers but I don\u2019t blame Moore for what happened.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d8f0051944180f868c8c40c9b4713d1579587ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d8f0051944180f868c8c40c9b4713d1579587ec/0_55_4944_2966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Judy Murray has arrived.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judy Murray has arrived.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0b62aa8f082364d7ceda5c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-20T10:43:39.555Z\">11.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fashion is front and centre today and I can recall when the lampshade hats first appeared on the fashion catwalk in the early 90s I did opine that this was the last thing we would ever see on the street.

Green, which the Queen has worn 11 times since 2005, and white, also 11, are her next most-fancied hat colours and look likely to get a showing this week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b28341ccade98e86841a8a7578ec06feb561dc0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b28341ccade98e86841a8a7578ec06feb561dc0e/0_31_1203_1203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yout form guide form the Queen\u2019s Hat Stakes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yout form guide form the Queen\u2019s Hat Stakes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: bettingexpert.com</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0b5c078f081e872734b2ef\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-20T10:14:38.234Z\">11.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Top trainers</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Aidan O\u2019Brien</strong> 3 wins<br><strong>William Haggas</strong> 2<br><strong>Andrew Balding</strong> 1<br><strong>Charlie Hills</strong> 1<br><strong>Sir Michael Stoute</strong> 1<br><strong>Mark Johnston</strong> 1<br><strong>Ian Williams</strong> 1<br><strong>Charlie Appleby</strong> 1<br><strong>David O\u2019Meara</strong> 1<br><br>O\u2019Brien is well on his way to being top trainer here for the 10th time, as Haggas just can\u2019t match him for firepower over the final three days here.

But you can only deal with the forecasts put in front of you and there is genuine hope of a dry afternoon on the biggest day of the week at the Royal meeting.</p> <p>That would be good news for anyone with an expensive outfit to protect from the elements. Whether it is quite as much of a positive for the punters remains to be seen. Ascot\u2019s ground drains more freely than it did in the past but it still has a reputation for turning a bit gluey as it does so and Stradivarius, last year\u2019s winner and the favourite for the Gold Cup, is the most obvious example of a horse that might not find it entirely to his liking.</p> <p>The latest going report from the course has just dropped on Twitter and Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, reports that \u201cthe going this morning is now soft, good-to-soft in places\u201d.</p> <p>He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s actually been dry since racing yesterday, but we did have 10mm of rain during racing yesterday afternoon. The forecast is better for today, it\u2019s due to stay largely dry, with a risk of an occasional sharp shower this afternoon. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a decent breeze blowing up the track at the moment so we may see an improvement in the conditions as the day goes on. The forecast for the rest of the week is largely dry, with a reduced risk of showers for Friday and Saturday.\u201d</p> <p>It was good-to-soft when John Gosden\u2019s magnificent chestnut took the stayers\u2019 race on Champions Day last October, becoming the first Gold Cup winner for half a century to go unbeaten through all season. That, though, was a Group Two and his best form is all on good-to-firm ground. It is certainly something for punters to think about ahead of today\u2019s race and it looks like they already are, with Stradivarius out to 6-4 from a price of 6-5 overnight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41f8e5e7d48d5d04997172066b44275d92555ac8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41f8e5e7d48d5d04997172066b44275d92555ac8/83_464_3046_1828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Racegoers arriving at Royal Ascot on Gold Cup day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Racegoers arriving at Royal Ascot on Gold Cup day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The strength of this year\u2019s opposition may also have something to do with that, as he faces up to last year\u2019s Melbourne Cup winner in Cross Counter and also Mark Johnston\u2019s Dee Ex Bee, who was within two lengths of winning the Derby when he finished second to Masar at Epsom last June. Capri, the 2017 St Leger winner, adds further quality to the line-up, bringing form that includes a three-and-a-quarter length fifth behind Enable in last season\u2019s Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe. </p> <p>Stradivarius will still start as one of the shorter favourites of the week, and with Frankie Dettori in the saddle after his fine double yesterday, the success, or otherwise, of the Gold Cup favourite is likely to a defining moment in the week-long battle between bookies and punters. The Oaks third Fleeting, in the Ribblesdale Stakes, and Pat Twomey\u2019s exciting Irish two-year-old Sunday Sovereign, a recent purchase by the King Power Racing operation to run in the opening Norfolk Stakes, will be other big fancies today but Stradivarius is the one that really matters.</p> <p>Chris Cook\u2019s tips for the day are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jun/19/talking-horses-stradivarius-triumph-second-gold-cup-royal-ascot-horse-racing-tips\">here</a> and the action gets under way at 2.30pm.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-20T09:51:06.071Z\">at 10.51am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Well if the Carabao Cup draw at Morrison\u2019s in Colindale tonight is half as exciting as today has been we\u2019re in for a thriller. That was one of the great Royal Ascot days of all-time. Frankie Dettori is a master of his craft and racing is going to miss him once he\u2019s gone. But it won\u2019t be for some years yet as he needs the thrill that the sport gives him and this will have encouraged him to stay around for longer. Tomorrow will be an anti-climax, in fact that goes for the rest of the Flat season. Anyway, we\u2019ll be back here for the last two days of the meeting ... see you then. 1 South Pacific (J A Heffernan) 22-1 2 Constantinople (R L Moore) 11-2 3 Eminence (W M Lordan) 25-1 4 Persian Moon (F Norton) 33-1 16 ran Also: 7-2 Fav Questionare Non Runners: 13,16,4 And they\u2019re off ... Sir Ron Priestly leads and Frankie is last on Questionare ... Majestic dawn is in second ... Persian Moon comes there and South Pacific comes fast and late to win for a one-two-three for Aidan O\u2019Brien. Relief washed through the Ascot betting ring as Frankie Dettori and Turgenev were overhauled close home by the 28-1 shot Biometric. Among the most relieved was Robert Speechley, taking bets as Posh Bookmakers, who owns the S&amp;D Bookmakers firm that has 10 shops around Peterborough. \u201cThe liabilities in those shops [if Dettori had kept winning] was a quarter of a million pounds,\u201d Speechley said. \u201cIt was massive, massive to get him beat. I can hardly get the words out. I thought he\u2019d won a distance.\u201d But the ring was eerily quiet in the five minutes before the Britannia began, with no visible sign of panic, because the huge change since Dettori\u2019s magnificent seven in 1996 is the advent of betting exchanges. The high street bookmaking firms sent boatloads of cash to the track in 1996 to shorten the odds of Dettori\u2019s mounts but the belief now is that that action goes straight online. While the Italian\u2019s fans were cleaning up, some of the bookies here were still turning a profit. \u201cYears ago, all the off-course bookmakers would be running for cover,\u201d said Geoff Banks, standing in the middle of Ascot\u2019s front line of bookies and speaking before Turgenev\u2019s defeat. \u201cBut they don\u2019t lay multiples any more. Otherwise, there\u2019s no chance Stradivarius would have gone off at even money, it would have been 4-7 or something like that. \u201cThese days, they\u2019re not laying the multiples, they\u2019re playing the exchanges, and everybody that\u2019s here, they\u2019re all casual investors. \u201cI don\u2019t see the firms playing at all. Many years ago, my father [John Banks, also a bookmaker] said the biggest touch he ever had was not to be here on Frankie\u2019s big day. He was in America and that must have saved him everything. He said he would have stood the last winner, Fujiyama Crest, for the maximum, it had no chance on form. The house, my schooling, everything would have gone. \u201cToday, there seems to be no alarm. It wont be dramatic here because on Ladies Day, the wagering is a lot smaller. The other days, we\u2019re taking some proper bets, \u00a340,000 to \u00a31,000 each-way. We\u2019ve had some \u00a3500s and \u00a31,000s, so it\u2019s been OK. But today, a lot smaller. \u201cStradivarius came up a winner on my book, even though I was 6-5 at the off. All the casual customers here, good luck to them, but they want bigger odds. An even-money chance, what\u2019s that to them? It\u2019s not even odds they understand.\u201d Frankie could still ride five winners. Fred Archer (the \u2018Tin Man\u2019) was the only previous rider in 1878 to ride a five-timer at Royal Ascot. Sinjaari \u2013 9/2 Sir Ron Priestley \u2013 5/1 Questionnaire \u2013 6/1 Constantinople \u2013 7/1 Good Birthday \u2013 12/1 Fox Premier \u2013 14/1 Babbos Boy \u2013 18/1 Majestic Dawn \u2013 22/1 Summer Moon \u2013 20/1 Almania \u2013 20/1 Persian Moon \u2013 40/1 Severance \u2013 28/1 Antilles \u2013 40/1 Eminence \u2013 40/1 South Pacific \u2013 28/1 Leroy Leroy \u2013 66/1 Kuwait Currency \u2013 125/1 Full Oddschecker betting here Do we not like Harry Bentley. Frankie looked to have that won on Turgenev and what a ride he gave that horse. It\u2019s such a shame but the game goes on and Dettori rides Quesionare in the last race of the day. O\u2019Brien evidently feels Constantinople is leniently treated, since this return to handicapping is a surprising move after the colt won the Gallinule. He has plenty more to offer and the extra quarter-mile promises to help. A wide draw has not been the disadvantage one might expect in past runnings of this race, possibly because those on the rail get in each other\u2019s way early on. Sinjaari is progressive and went close in the London Gold Cup, often a strong contest. Sir Ron Priestley is unbeaten in two this year and was at one stage being considered for a Group Two contest rather than this handicap; it looks as though connections feel his rating is still lenient and one can easily imagine why, in light of his comfortable wins. 1 Biometric (Harry Bentley) 28-1 2 Turgenev (L Dettori) 7-2 Fav 3 Fanaar (Dane O\u2019Neill) 50-1 4 Awe (K McEvoy) 14-1 28 ran Non Runners: 5,16,26,24 And they\u2019re off ... Certain Lad is prominent as is Turgenev ... Hero Hero leads nearside ... Turgenev goes for the lead ... He leads but is being challenged ... He\u2019s just been beaten by Biometric ... Bookies still quaking. If Frankie wins on Turgenev we are possibly in for one of the greatest days in the history of the sport as we approach the final race on Ladies\u2019 day at Royal Ascot. Turgenev \u2013 9/2 (From 14/1) Migration \u2013 8/1 King Ademar \u2013 9/1 Davydenko \u2013 11/1 Hero Hero \u2013 14/1 Velorum \u2013 12/1 Aweedram \u2013 14/1 Morafaawit \u2013 14/1 Awe \u2013 16/1 Barristan the Bold \u2013 20/1 Beatboxer \u2013 25/1 Dunkirk Harbour \u2013 33/1 Pogo \u2013 33/1 Dark Vision \u2013 28/1 Biometric \u2013 33/1 Tulfarris \u2013 33/1 Dubai Legacy \u2013 40/1 Numerian \u2013 40/1 Fanaar \u2013 50/1 Glorious Lover \u2013 50/1 Victory Command \u2013 66/1 Eclipse Storm \u2013 66/1 Dark Jedi \u2013 66/1 Finoah \u2013 66/1 Sameem \u2013 80/1 Certain Lad \u2013 100/1 Hot Team \u2013 100/1 Dunkerron \u2013 150/1 Mordred \u2013 150/1 Full Oddschecker betting here In a wide open contest, a case can be made for the 40-1 shot Eclipse Storm, who has suggested he may be on a handy mark for this first venture into handicap company. He ran on into a never-nearer second in a Listed contest at The Curragh last time, sparking memories of the same stable\u2019s Son Of Rest, winner of the Ayr Gold Cup a week after being a never-nearer second in a Group One. Migration has an obvious chance on the strength of his strong-finishing success at Newmarket and this course promises to suit him even better, but the betting market is well aware of his claims. The ground must be a worry for King Ademar, who was a non-runner because of soft ground here in May. Motafaawit looks the right type, having beaten a subsequent winner to score here last time. Richard Hannon\u2019s runner is unbeaten in two since a gelding operation. Here is Chris Cook\u2019s report on Frankie Dettori day at Royal Ascot Willie Mullins is not here at Royal Ascot to see his horses run this week and the owner Rich Ricci has just told ITV the trainer has had surgery, details unspecified. \u201cThere was no serious cause of it but, like the rest of us, we\u2019re getting older and need a little maintenance. He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d 1 Stradivarius (L Dettori) Evens Fav 2 Dee Ex Bee (S De Sousa) 7-2 3 Master Of Reality (W M Lordan) 66-1 11 ran Also: 4-1 Cross Counter 4th And they\u2019re off ... Dee Ex Bee leads and Stradivarius is third early just behind Master Of Reality ... a long way to go ... not mush change in the order as they pass the stands with the crowd cheering on Frankie on Stradivarius ... Dee ex Bee leads ... Frankie in third ... Capri and Thomas Hobson are close up ... Raymond Tusk is last and Cross Counter is held up towards the rear ... Stradivarius still third and going well ... Dee Ex Bee making it a stamina test kicks on ... Capri goes closer ... Stradivarius comes with a move on the home turn ... He can\u2019t get through ... here comes Stradivarius and leads to win for a Frankie four-timer!!!! Bookies running for cover reports our Greg Wood ... Go on Frankie! There was a slightly awkward scene next to the prize-giving podium after the Ribblesdale, as the winning trainer, John Gosden, and Star Catcher\u2019s groom, Lin Thompson, evidently expected there would be some sort of trophy for the winning groom. In fact, prizes are only handed out to grooms here after the Group One races, but that policy could usefully be reviewed. Increasingly, it\u2019s clear that racing\u2019s audience expects grooms to be recognised when their charges win major races. We see this on social media, when viewers protest about grooms not being able to lead their horses into the winner\u2019s enclosure if the owner wishes to do that by themselves. In fairness to Ascot, names of grooms are presented next to the runners in racecards throughout the Royal meeting. Stradivarius \u2013 11/10 Cross Counter \u2013 4/1 Dee Ex Bee \u2013 9/2 Flag of Honour \u2013 14/1 Called to the Bar \u2013 16/1 Capri \u2013 22/1 Thomas Hobson \u2013 22/1 Magic Circle \u2013 28/1 Raymond Tusk \u2013 40/1 Master of Reality \u2013 80/1 Cyprus Creek \u2013 80/1 Full Oddschecker betting here Stradivarius is looking well to take Frankie Dettori into Ascot history again in the Gold Cup. Simon Clare of Ladbrokes-Coral is taking cover. The odds are shortening. Frankie Dettori\u2019s mount Stradivarius is odds-on for the Gold Cup now that the jockey has ridden the first three winners and Turgenev, his mount in the 5.00, is 13-2 from 12-1 in the last hour. The bookies are very worried. According to Oddschecker, British bookmakers are set for a monster \u00a3180m payout if Frankie Dettori can complete the perfect day at Royal Ascot and go through the card. Oddschecker spokesperson Callum Wilson: \u201cFrankie Dettori is showing why he is one of the most revered flat jockeys in history as he looks to go through the card at Royal Ascot in a feat that would write him into folklore. His popularity means recreational punters will have chanced their arms on the man on fire and bookies are taking evasive action on his last three rides of the day.\u201d It\u2019s all Frankie! It\u2019s building ... Some interesting new opponents line up against Stradivarius, suggesting the chestnut is still seen as beatable in some quarters. This is hard to fathom. As he has shown repeatedly over the last two years, he is an exceptional stayer and can prove it with a second success in Royal Ascot\u2019s feature race. Versatile as to ground and increasingly hard to outbattle, Stradivarius has the right men around him to make the most of his exuberant talent, in John Gosden and Frankie Dettori. He can outclass Cross Counter, whose globetrotting exploits, while impressive, still leave him something to prove here. When last seen in Britain, the Godolphin horse was beaten in a Group Two, though he did have Dee Ex Bee four lengths behind on his previous start. Dee Ex Bee has made a good start to his career in marathons but the form of his wins doesn\u2019t entitle him to take this. Flag Of Honour might be more of a threat, bearing in mind he got within three lengths of Stradivarius last year when just a three-year-old. 1 Star Catcher (L Dettori) 4-1 2 Fleeting (R L Moore) 7-4 Fav 3 Sparkle Roll (Oisin Murphy) 11-1 11 ran Also: 9-2 Queen Power 4th And they\u2019re off ... Peach Tree and Fanny Logan lead ...Shambolic now second ... Frankellina is close up ... Queen Power is there but Fleeting is trying to catch Star Catcher ... but it\u2019s Star Catcher .. and a hat-trick for Frankie Dettori! Frankie now all the rage ... his mount is being well backed in the next Fleeting \u2013 13/8 Queen Power \u2013 5/1 Star Catcher \u2013 5/1 Frankellina \u2013 8/1 Sparkle Roll \u2013 12/1 Fanny Logan \u2013 16/1 Shambolic \u2013 33/1 Peach Tree \u2013 33/1 Fresnel \u2013 33/1 Altair \u2013 50/1 Love So Deep \u2013 100/1 Full betting at Oddschecker here Fleeting looks like being a short price on the strength of her running-on third in the Oaks but she was ridden to pick up the pieces that day. This will be more of a test and it\u2019s by no means clear that she\u2019ll thrive on it. Queen Power did well at Newbury to overhaul talented rivals who had first run off a steady pace and the well-bred filly can prove hard to beat. The inexperienced Frankellina might be best avoided by anyone who\u2019s had enough of backing horses that don\u2019t start this week, as she was very slowly away when second in the Musidora. She seemed beaten on merit when sixth in the Oaks but perhaps she has more to offer three weeks down the line. John Gosden fields four but the pick of them, Star Catcher, seems held on her third to Queen Power last time. Frankie Dettori has not been leading jockey at Ascot since 2004 but he has not ridden better and has Stradivarius to come in the Ascot Gold Cup. 1 Sangarius (L Dettori) 13-2 2 Fox Chairman (S De Sousa) 7-2 Fav 3 King Ottokar (James Doyle) 5-1 13 ran Also: 25-1 Eightsome Reel 4th Non Runners: 2,10 And they\u2019re off ...

Aidan O\u2019Brien had a rough time of it on Wednesday, with three consecutive beaten favourites, but Cape Of Good Hope can steer the Irishman back towards the winner\u2019s enclosure. His plugging-on fourth in the French Derby was a bit dour but reads well in this company and, as a brother to Highland Reel, he should have plenty of improvement in him. Headman has become a non-runner because of the rain-softened ground but that won\u2019t be a problem for King Ottokar, who won in the Newbury mud in April, beating Dancing Willoughby, the Queen\u2019s Vase winner on Wednesday. He may not have stayed in the Chester Vase and this return to 10 furlongs could help, though it\u2019ll be a stiff 10 furlongs. Fox Chairman was also beaten at Chester, in the Dee Stakes, when he didn\u2019t get a clear run but seemed to me to lack a bit of tactical speed. I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s as short as 4-1. Sangarius was third to King Of Comedy last time, which is strong form, but his pedigree isn\u2019t crying out that he wants 10 furlongs on soft and he hung badly last time. Great Scot won\u2019t stay unless he learns to settle and is a risk in this atmosphere. Cap Francais went close behind Cape Of Good Hope at Epsom but seemed to regress at Lingfield, albeit that race was won by the subsequent Derby winner. 1 A\u2019ali (L Dettori) 5-1 2 Ventura Rebel (P Hanagan) 16-1 3 Dubai Station (J P Spencer) 14-1 14 ran Also: 13-8 Fav Sunday Sovereign, 50-1 Strive For Glory 4th Non Runner: 8 And they\u2019re off ...

A\u2019Ali takes it up inside the closing stages and kicks clear. 1st Grey/Silver 6-4fav Nicola McGeady of Ladbrokes said: \u201cWe suspended betting on the colour of the Queen\u2019s hat this morning. Pink was the favourite but after witnessing a run of bets on grey/silver at 12/1, alarm bells rang. It was clearly the right decision to pull the plug with the grey gamble landing this afternoon.\u201d Sunday Sovereign \u2013 13/8 Aali \u2013 6/1 Mount Fuji \u2013 8/1 Air Force Jet \u2013 8/1 Expressionist - 12/1 Ventura Rebel \u2013 14/1 King Neptune \u2013 20/1 Misty Grey \u2013 20/1 Real Appeal \u2013 28/1 Dubai Station \u2013 33/1 Strive for Glory \u2013 66/1 Firepower \u2013 80/1 Emten \u2013 80/1 Cool Sphere \u2013 150/1 Full betting at Oddschecker here Billy Lee had a dismal experience in the Queen Mary, when Ickworth refused to start, but hopefully Sunday Sovereign can brighten the Irishman\u2019s week. The colt has improved in leaps and bounds and inflicted the only defeat so far in the career of Arizona, winner of the Coventry Stakes on Tuesday. There are some unexposed rivals ranged against him but he sets a high bar. Wesley Ward runs Maven, described as having worked \u201clights out\u201d at Kempton last week. He was offered for sale at an auction on Monday but was bought back by the owner at \u00a3725,000 and now has the chance to win 8% of that. A\u2019Ali was beaten favourite on his only start so far but the winner had the benefit of a previous run and it was nine lengths back to the third at Ripon that day. Frankie Dettori climbs aboard. Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s runner is Mount Fuji, a half-brother to a Group One-winning juvenile. He overcame greenness to win on his debut but will have to be a lot more savvy here. The French raider Real Appeal has strong form, plenty of speed and was sold for \u00a3265,000 on Monday. It\u2019s slightly surprising that he\u2019s drifted from 12s to 20-1. The royals went for a coordinated look, with the Queen, Duchess of Cambridge, Duchess of Cornwall, Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie and Zara Tindall all arriving in varying shades of blue. Could the royals be entering a blue period? William and Kate have form on this front, having gone for a blue theme on several of their Christmas cards. Examples of \u201cgroup dressing\u201d also extended outside the Royal Enclosure, with several groups opting for yellow \u2013 aka the shade of the summer and \u201cthe left-field hit of the spring catwalk shows\u201d, which featured at Erdem and Givenchy, Moschino and Oscar de la Renta, to name just a few. The novelty of jumpsuits, first permitted by Ascot in 2017, also appears to have worn off, with the majority women opting for dresses and skirts instead. Yet there were fewer full-length dresses than one might have expected in a year when the prairie dress has reigned supreme, considering that, at the stricter end of Ascot\u2019s dress code, hemlines are required to be \u201cof modest length defined as falling just above the knee or longer\u201d. Tulle \u2013 the material dubbed by this paper as \u201cthe first major trend of 2019\u201d \u2013 did get a look in however, appearing on the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s Elie Saab gown, amongst others. As always, the hats have been a focus, providing an ample platform for the literal dressing trend favoured by Melania Trump on her recent trip to the UK. Horses, the Union Jack, bees and even a floral arrangement spelling out the word \u2018Ascot\u2019 all featured this year, along with a hat comprised of a stack of hats, as worn by model Jodie Kidd. Poppies were another recurring motif \u2013 and black and red a popular colour combo for men and women \u2013 cropping up on both hats and dresses in what could well be a nod to the 75th Anniversary of The D-Day landings, which was commemorated earlier this month. Royal Ascot is always as much about what is seen and happens off the track as it is on. And Ladies\u2019 day is the most important day of the week in that regard. Let our fashion expert be your guide ... After a rainy start to Ascot, Ladies\u2019 day brought the sunshine \u2013 and the fashion. Gone were the plastic ponchos \u2013 but if florals for spring aren\u2019t exactly \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d, neither is the prominence pink on Ladies\u2019 day. Pink pom-poms adorned oversize hats, alongside pastel pink hair, and almost-fluro pink dresses \u2013 a carryover from this year\u2019s Oscars celebrations perhaps, where bright pinks ruled the red-carpet. Uh-oh! More rain on the way?

But just look at those prices! That train strike has been a damp squib Royal Ascot 2019 is the first at which detailed sectional timing \u2013 information about how fast the horses are going at every stage of the race \u2013 is being supplied after every race, something that has been standard practice at several of the world\u2019s other major tracks for some years. Sectionals offer what can seem, at first sight, to be a bewildering array of numbers, offering insight only to a punter with a first in advanced mathematics. What the numbers reveal on closer inspection, however, is the underlying rhythm of a race. How strong was the pace? Was it even throughout? Was the runner-up given too much to do? Sectionals offer answers to these questions and more, all of which can be of considerable assistance when attempting to back future winners. Despite this, though, there are those who remain unconvinced about the need for such information to be made widely available to punters \u2013 including, oddly, some who make a living from \u2026 making information available to punters. Bruce Millington, the former editor of the Racing Post no less, suggested as much in a recent column, claiming that \u201ca better ambition would be to present existing data in a way that will appeal to a new generation of punters, but that will rely more on clever use of symbols, colours and user experiences than by smearing even more numbers across a card.\u201d Simon Rowlands, a leading advocate for sectionals, responded for the defence here and punters who like to think for themselves can find a more general guide to the data and its uses here. Race-by-race data can be found via the results section on the At The Races website \u2013 look for the \u201cSectionals PDF\u201d link at the bottom of the result. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another jockey in Britain or Ireland who gets second-guessed as much as Ryan Moore; it comes with the territory, when you\u2019re first jockey at Ballydoyle. He\u2019s had a fruitful week but his critics were still out in force after he was well beaten on Norway, 11-4 favourite for Wednesday\u2019s Queen\u2019s Vase. Looking at the replay again this morning, I think he was the victim of circumstance to a large extent. On the short run to the first bend, a row of three horses went past on his outside, heading for the front of the field, and you can almost see him thinking: \u2018Hold on, they\u2019re about to go a bit quick here.\u2019 On a horse whose stamina was not assured, he understandably opted to settle out the back. What happens next but those horses, having reached the front, slam on the brakes and it becomes a steady pace all the way down to Swinley Bottom. The first three at that point remained in the first three all the way to the line. With half a mile to go, Norway was obviously in an impossible position, though it has to be said he still didn\u2019t finish like a horse who could have done a lot better behind a stronger pace. It was a frustrating experience for his backers but I don\u2019t blame Moore for what happened. Fashion is front and centre today and I can recall when the lampshade hats first appeared on the fashion catwalk in the early 90s I did opine that this was the last thing we would ever see on the street. But they did appear at race meetings \u2013 at Epsom at the 1991 Derby and at Royal Ascot in 2000. Blue \u2018won\u2019 the Queen\u2019s Hat Stakes on Tuesday and Wednesday so will the Queen pull off the greatest shock of all by wearing a blue hat in this now traditional daily betting heat for the third day running? Ladbrokes opened their betting like this: Pink 2/1, Yellow 3/1, Green 3/1, Purple 6/1, Red 8/1, Orange 10/1, Cream/White 10/1, Silver 12/1, Gold 14/1, Blue 16/1, Brown 20/1, Black 50/1, Union Jack 500/1. However, it appears the layers are running scared and they have suspended betting. Ladbrokes have had a big run on pink. Nicola McGeady, the firm\u2019s spokeswoman, said: \u201cWe have suspended our betting. The shrewd money was on silver/grey which was the early gamble. Pink was also very popular and due to the volume of bets we feel someone knows somethign we don\u2019t.\u201d A spokesperson for bookmakers.tv said: \u201cDespite bookies having reportedly their best ever day in the Queen\u2019s hat betting history on Wednesday, firms have battened down the hatches for Ladies\u2019 day. Pink, yellow and even silver/grey have all been reported as favourites. As a result, odds compilers are taking no risks on punters fighting back from their worst run of hat betting in recent memory.\u201d bettingexpert have given us a form guide (below) for all the hat colours worn by the Queen since 2005. Pink and blue have made up 57% of her choices on the Tuesday in that time, while pink has also featured most on the Wednesday and Thursday of the five-day meeting. Green, which the Queen has worn 11 times since 2005, and white, also 11, are her next most-fancied hat colours and look likely to get a showing this week. Aidan O\u2019Brien 3 wins William Haggas 2 Andrew Balding 1 Charlie Hills 1 Sir Michael Stoute 1 Mark Johnston 1 Ian Williams 1 Charlie Appleby 1 David O\u2019Meara 1 O\u2019Brien is well on his way to being top trainer here for the 10th time, as Haggas just can\u2019t match him for firepower over the final three days here. John Gosden has yet to score, a situation he hopes to correct in today\u2019s Gold Cup with Stradivarius. Wesley Ward is 0/4 so far but Kimari went close for him in the Queen Mary and the American has five more shots at Ascot glory this year. Ryan Moore 3 wins Danny Tudhope 3 Frankie Dettori 2 Jim Crowley 1 Oisin Murphy 1 James Doyle 1 Richard Kingscote 1 Moore was beaten on three consecutive favourites on Wednesday but still bagged the final race to hold onto his position at the top of this table, underlining the quantity of good material he gets to work with. He\u2019s ahead by dint of his three second places, while Tudhope has none of those, but then Tudhope has achieved his three wins from just five rides and that surely is the greater achievement. Of course, Tudhope isn\u2019t even at Ascot today, he\u2019s chasing easier meat at Ripon, which is why he\u2019s an 8-1 shot to come out on top by Saturday evening, odds that do not look generous. You want to know what\u2019s going to win, right? Here are our selections for the third day. Stay here and we\u2019ll have an in-depth preview for every race as the afternoon goes on. 2.30 Norfolk Stakes Sunday Sovereign 9-4 3.05 Hampton Court Stakes Cape Of Good Hope 6-1 3.40 Ribblesdale Stakes Queen Power 100-30 4.20 Gold Cup Stradivarius 5-4 5.00 Britannia Handicap Eclipse Storm (nap) 40-1 5.35 King George V Handicap Constantinople 9-2 Nothing remarkable about five of those but the elephant in this room is the 40-1 nap. Sometimes \u201cnap\u201d represents great confidence. On this occasion, it stands for my sense that this is a potential winner at a really big price. Is Eclipse Storm the most likely winner in the race? I wouldn\u2019t argue that. But there\u2019s easily enough encouragement in his background to think he could be in the shake-up and it\u2019ll be some thrill if it pans out that way. Saturday\u2019s big race, the Diamond Jubilee Stakes, looks a stormer after the news this morning that Blue Point has been declared to run again, having won the King\u2019s Stand here on Tuesday. He will try to become just the second horse to do the double, following the extraordinary performances by the Australian raider Choisir in 2003. Blue Point evidently loves Ascot, having won four times from five races here, and Charlie Appleby reports him in the form of his life, which explains why they\u2019ve opted to roll the dice with him. Also making a quick reappearance in the race is Le Brivido, who didn\u2019t quite get home when fifth in the Queen Anne on Tuesday. Aidan O\u2019Brien clearly thinks he might have enough speed to make a classy sprinter. You could win a \u00a350 account credit from Ladbrokes Coral by proving your tipping prowess on today\u2019s races.

Congratulations to melonk, who won Wednesday\u2019s competition with a final score of +28, thanks to Raffle Prize (18-1), Dashing Willoughby (6-1) and Southern Hills (7-1). On a high-scoring day, that was enough to see off Affirmed and Harrytheactor, joint second on +21. Please post your tips or racing-related comments below. After two consecutive days when the forecast rainfall for Ascot was barely on nodding terms with the drenching actuality, it is probably unwise to point out that the prospects for Ladies\u2019 Day, featuring the Gold Cup at 4.20, are much more promising. But you can only deal with the forecasts put in front of you and there is genuine hope of a dry afternoon on the biggest day of the week at the Royal meeting. That would be good news for anyone with an expensive outfit to protect from the elements. Whether it is quite as much of a positive for the punters remains to be seen. Ascot\u2019s ground drains more freely than it did in the past but it still has a reputation for turning a bit gluey as it does so and Stradivarius, last year\u2019s winner and the favourite for the Gold Cup, is the most obvious example of a horse that might not find it entirely to his liking. The latest going report from the course has just dropped on Twitter and Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, reports that \u201cthe going this morning is now soft, good-to-soft in places\u201d. He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s actually been dry since racing yesterday, but we did have 10mm of rain during racing yesterday afternoon. The forecast is better for today, it\u2019s due to stay largely dry, with a risk of an occasional sharp shower this afternoon. \u201cThere\u2019s a decent breeze blowing up the track at the moment so we may see an improvement in the conditions as the day goes on. The forecast for the rest of the week is largely dry, with a reduced risk of showers for Friday and Saturday.\u201d It was good-to-soft when John Gosden\u2019s magnificent chestnut took the stayers\u2019 race on Champions Day last October, becoming the first Gold Cup winner for half a century to go unbeaten through all season. That, though, was a Group Two and his best form is all on good-to-firm ground. It is certainly something for punters to think about ahead of today\u2019s race and it looks like they already are, with Stradivarius out to 6-4 from a price of 6-5 overnight. The strength of this year\u2019s opposition may also have something to do with that, as he faces up to last year\u2019s Melbourne Cup winner in Cross Counter and also Mark Johnston\u2019s Dee Ex Bee, who was within two lengths of winning the Derby when he finished second to Masar at Epsom last June. Capri, the 2017 St Leger winner, adds further quality to the line-up, bringing form that includes a three-and-a-quarter length fifth behind Enable in last season\u2019s Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe. Stradivarius will still start as one of the shorter favourites of the week, and with Frankie Dettori in the saddle after his fine double yesterday, the success, or otherwise, of the Gold Cup favourite is likely to a defining moment in the week-long battle between bookies and punters. The Oaks third Fleeting, in the Ribblesdale Stakes, and Pat Twomey\u2019s exciting Irish two-year-old Sunday Sovereign, a recent purchase by the King Power Racing operation to run in the opening Norfolk Stakes, will be other big fancies today but Stradivarius is the one that really matters. Chris Cook\u2019s tips for the day are here and the action gets under way at 2.30pm.",

Set a fairytale 406, they were all out for 120. Harry Podmore snaffled five for 41 , including Chris Nash and Joe Clarke in the same over.

But left-arm spinner James Logan, 21, and playing only in his second game, had a spring in his heels, taking four for 22.

      "bodyText": "Nottinghamshire collapsed to their fourth defeat of the season at Tunbridge Wells, their side of talented allsorts tumbling to yet another batting collapse against Kent. Set a fairytale 406, they were all out for 120. Harry Podmore snaffled five for 41 , including Chris Nash and Joe Clarke in the same over. The Nottinghamshire captain Steven Mullaney was blunt in response: \u201cIt\u2019s not quite a car crash yet, but our decision making has been poor. We\u2019ve been the worst team in this division by a long stretch in the opening seven games. You get what you deserve in this game, and we deserve to be bottom.\u201d At York, Warwickshire survived a mid-innings collapse of six for 49 to beat Yorkshire by three wickets and pocket their third Championship win, quite a turnabout since the spring. Set a target of 217, Dom Sibley and the big hitting Will Rhodes \u2013 who smashed three sixes off one over - reached 132 without loss. But left-arm spinner James Logan, 21, and playing only in his second game, had a spring in his heels, taking four for 22. The charge, however, had come too late. Leicestershire and Gloucestershire shook hands after tea, their big-bucket run fest at Grace Road coming to a close with Hasan Azad and Paul Horton both 100 not out. Earlier Ryan Higgins was out for 199. There is plenty of life left on the final day at Kidderminster, where Sussex clawed themselves back into the match against Worcestershire thanks to spirited batting from Laurie Evans (106 not out) and Ben Brown. In the one remaining game, Sussex are fighting back - a lead of 62 thanks to Evans and Brown. I\u2019ll disappear for a little now, to write up. Er - Warwickshire? I had to deal with a slight situation and ran back to type up the easy Warwickshire win...219 for seven?!?! Losing 5-34?!?! Yorkshire didn\u2019t plug in their James Logan bot till a little too late, alas. Anyway, well done Warwickshire. On the way now, I think. And bravo to York - so glad you got a thriller after the rain on day one. Sussex dribble into the lead at Kidderminster, lead of 11 with six wickets in hand. A invaluable partnership of 106 between Laurie Evans and that man again..... Ben Brown. He\u2019s fourth in the Division Two averages with 609 runs at 76.12 Hands have been shaken at Grace Road with Azad and Horton both exactly 100 not out! Hope the sun\u2019s out for a bit of mid-summer chilling after that thousand run plus festival of batting. Perhaps a balti all round? Completely against the run of play at York, a wicket. At 170 for two, Warwickshire need 47 to win. Northants doing pretty well in that Australia A game, 258-9 with seven balls to go. A fifty for Rob Newton; Ashton Agar 3-55. So where we are at just after tea on day four ? Three games left: a dead one at Grace Road and a easy stroll for the Bears, barring disaster, at York. Then a potentially interesting one at Kidderminster, if Sussex can show a bit of batting spine for two sessions -it\u2019s only day three there. Trouble at mill. Division One York: Yorkshire 259 (SA Patterson 60, GS Ballance 54, O J Hannon-Dalby 5-76, CN Miles 4-44) &amp; 211 (Leaning 65) Hannon-Dalby 4-61, Patel 4-48); Warwickshire 254 (DP Sibley 67) &amp; 133-1 (Rhodes 83, Sibley 50 not out).

Grace Road: Leicestershire 487 (NJ Dexter 180, Mohammed Azad 137, CN Ackermann 56no, J Shaw 4-85) &amp; 131-0 (Azad 56, Horton 64); Gloucestershire 571 (RF Higgins 199, CDJ Dent 176,; Klein 4-113). Paul Horton making up for his first innings duck, when there were zillions on offer. Currently 64 not out in a first-innings partnership of 131 with Hasan Azad. Lovely batting practice, this. Assuming all goes as it seems, this will be Kent and Warwickshire\u2019s second wins of the season. Leaving Notts and Surrey stranded with no wins by late June. Cricket, it does like to flummox you. There\u2019s a poignancy about the cricket scoreboard. Hope is there till the very end. \u201cNottinghamshire need 305 runs to win\u201d Warwickshire 110, over half way there with ten wickets in hand - too easy. Bald facts from Graham in the York tent. Scores are level at Grace Road -571 each. Jim, is there a special klaxon for that? Oh dear, Notts, oh dear. 94 for 7. Oh dear Sussex, oh dear, dear. 30 for 3. Except at Kidderminster, there\u2019s a post-prandial lull. For a moment, batting is easy. Sussex at risk of slipping up here, at 12 for 2 and still 116 behind. This match still has a day in hand remember. Finch, b Finch, for four. I\u2019ll give Vic a plug, as he\u2019s too modest to do it himself. The great man has described it as \u201cgentle\u201d read. Can\u2019t wait. Leicestershire 50 for 0; and an early wicket at Kidderminster. Wells lbw to the fifth ball of the innings for a duck. Sussex 11 for 1. Mullaney out for 11, an lbw for Mulder. Notts 75 for six. Warwickshire off to an absolute flyer at York. Sitting pretty at 52-0, only 161 to win. Dom Sibley\u2019s season creeps up on everyone. Now for the score from Tunbridge Wells. Notts are half way through their Notts-up at 72 for five. Can Mullaney and Moores save the day? Shane comes in off his long run, and a(nother) lovely story coming out of Somerset. Here\u2019s to you, Jack Harding from all at CCLive!

WARWICKS NEED 197 TO WIN. Tunbridge Wells: Kent 309 (Z Crawley 111, G Stewart 59, J L Pattinson 6-73) &amp; 363-5 declared (JL Denly 161 not out, DJ Bell-Drummond 79); Nottinghamshire 267 (CD Nash 67, SR Patel 52, ME Milnes 5-68) &amp; 56-4 (Podmore 3-24). NOTTS NEED 350 TO WIN. Division Two Not lunch: Kidderminster: Sussex 255 (BC Brown 80, CJ Jordan 52, WD Parnell 4-92); Worcestershire 364-9 (CJ Ferguson 56, MH Wessels 55, OB Cox 61; Robinson 4-77). Grace Road: Leicestershire 487 (NJ Dexter 180, Mohammed Azad 137, CN Ackermann 56no, J Shaw 4-85) &amp; 35-0; Gloucestershire 571 (RF Higgins 199, CDJ Dent 176,; Klein 4-113). With two minutes to go till lunch, Notts are 54 for four. A wicket for Grant Stewart to complement Podmore\u2019s three. Samit Patel gone for six. The batsmens\u2019 confidence is non existent at the moment, must be a tricky dressing-room to be in. Some snazzy names here on the Australia A scoresheet. Worth a pop down to The County Ground if you\u2019re nearby. Over at Trent Bridge, David Warner has a hundred - off 109 balls - and Australis are 197 for one off 34 overs. Some CricViz stats that show he is playing himself into ominous form: to his first 30 balls he played false shots 17% of the time. Since his 90th delivery there hasn\u2019t been a false shot. Worcestershire quietly ploughing on - they\u2019ve added 70 this morning, through Parnell and Leach, Cox and D\u2019Oliveria. And a handshake for Jeetan Patel - 700 wickets for Warwickshire! A serious question - what would they do without him? Gloucestershire all out for a magnificent 571. Trumpets and brass bands all round. Funny, after all those runs on both sides the Gloucestershire lead was only 56. A lot of running just to keep still. Oh heck, Notts. The gurgle has started. Podmore has snaffled three for 23. A duck for Joe Clarke. He shouldered arms and was lbw - his nightmarish mid-season continues. Seven for Nash. Here is the final wicket to fall in the Yorkshire innings. Is it a knell? Four each for Hannon-Dalby and Patel. Warwickshire need 217 to win. A solve-able equation. Can someone do a maths joke? Ben Duckett out for 23. Hmmm. Notts 36 for one. The plug being pulled out of the bath, or just a rubber duck falling into the bubbles? Bens Slater and Duckett are making a solid start at Tunbridge Wells: Notts 17/0. van Buuren has followed Higgins back to the pavilion at Grace Road: Gloucestershire 551 for eight. And that little run machine Ben Cox goes for 61 at Kidderminster, Worcestershire have a sneeze of a lead of 37 over Sussex. Yorkshire lose another. Logan for 7, a third for the irrepressible Jeetan Patel. He needs a few more to keep in touch with Simon Harmer (42) in the cut-throat competition for leading Divison One wicket-taker. Luis Reece has a small lead in the Division Two (31) bowl off. A few wickets in the air this morning. At York Patterson is bowled by Oliver Hannon-Dalby. James Logan has come in and cuts a boundary straight away. Jack Leaning a steady 55 and counting on his home ground. Kent have lost two quick wickets and - they\u2019ve DECLARED! at 363 for five after a bit of ball-thumping from Denly. Denly 167 not out. Notts set 406 to win. Ahem. Oh dear, that really is a shame. Ryan Higgins out for 199 at Grace Road, bowled by Chris Wright. Division One York: Yorkshire 259 (SA Patterson 60, GS Ballance 54, O J Hannon-Dalby 5-76, CN Miles 4-44) &amp; 178-7; Warwickshire 254 (DP Sibley 67). Tunbridge Wells: Kent 309 (Z Crawley 111, G Stewart 59, J L Pattinson 6-73) &amp; 277-3 (JL Denly 111 no, DJ Bell-Drummond 79); Nottinghamshire 267 (CD Nash 67, SR Patel 52, ME Milnes 5-68). Division Two Kidderminster: Sussex 255 (BC Brown 80, CJ Jordan 52, WD Parnell 4-92); Worcestershire 262-6 (CJ Ferguson 56, MH Wessels 55, OB Cox 53 no). Grace Road: Leicestershire 487 (NJ Dexter 180, Mohammed Azad 137, CN Ackermann 56no, J Shaw 4-85); Gloucestershire 503-6 (RF Higgins 196no, CDJ Dent 176, BAC Howell 52). Result: Lancashire (236 &amp; 4-0) beat Derbyshire (153 &amp; 84) by 10 wickets. Result: Middlesex (410 &amp; 125-4) v Glamorgan (288) \u2013 match drawn. There is a rain delay at Kidderminster, just as Sussex were about to take the new ball. Northants news: Adam Rossington has signed a two year contract extension with the club, and will captain them in red ball cricket for the rest of the season, following the resignation of Alex Wakely. Also, just because everyone loves Moeen Ali. Ali Martin showed me this on Tuesday. It\u2019s from 2015 but it\u2019s a little gem. And this little nugget could make things interesting at Trent Bridge, where Australia won the toss, are batting and are 9-0 off two overs. Here\u2019s Jimmy in all his glory, in case you didn\u2019t catch him yesterday. Hello! Hope you\u2019ve all had a good couple of days. It feels strange dropping in at the end, just for the glory, though I see Lancs have continued their dominance of division two. Elsewhere, can anyone see Notts chasing 300 plus in a day? Maybe they can last the match. And well done Joe Denly. Could be very tasty at York with a lead of 183 for Yorkshire with three wickets in hand. In Division Two Leicester and Gloucester has degenerated into a run-fest, and it is day three of an even-stevens game at Kidderminster. Over at Trent Bridge, fingers crossed for Bangladesh \u2013 if Australia win that, there are a basketload of dead matches at Old Trafford, Chester le Street, Headingley and Lord\u2019s to come. It\u2019s the downside of doing the matches in chunks - though obviously these grounds could have been left with all the nail-biters. For all the bad decisions, and the limited size of the World Cup, I feel for the organisers \u2013 a double whammy of bad weather and overtly dominant performances from the big four. Follow Bangladesh v Australia here with Geoff Lemon: In other World Cup news, the cheekily talented Rishabh Pant replaces Shikhar Dharwan, whose thumb isn\u2019t playing fair. And at the County Ground, Northampton take on Australia A in a one-day game.",

However, a letter to other USS employers from the scheme\u2019s chief executive, obtained by Varsity, Cambridge\u2019s student newspaper, said that \u201cshould one more strong employer withdraw from the scheme then the covenant would be downgraded\u201d from its current rating of strong. UCU\u2019s higher education section has backed formal UK-wide censure and boycott, a rarely invoked \u201cgrey listing\u201d that would bar UCU members from applying for jobs at Trinity or attending conferences, conducting research or teaching students at the college. UCU\u2019s higher education committee will hold an emergency meeting on Friday, which is likely to give the go-ahead for the national boycott unless Trinity\u2019s fellows achieve the two-thirds majority needed to rescind withdrawal. The USS was the subject of widespread campus strikes last year that halted plans to scrap guaranteed benefits, which would have meant lower pensions for its members. Jo Grady, the general secretary-elect of UCU, said: \u201cI hope Trinity\u2019s fellows realise what\u2019s at stake here. USS have threatened to downgrade the covenant if another strong employer leaves. That will put the future of a \u00a364bn pension scheme at risk. That is why the union voted to apply a boycott to Trinity if it refuses to stop or reverse its decision. \u201cTrinity\u2019s departure is not just financially wasteful for the college, it could also do immense damage to the whole sector. UCU members, including many of Trinity\u2019s fellows, went on strike last year to prevent the closure of our guaranteed pension. The fellows know that the union is preparing for another strike ballot in the autumn in order to force our employers to make proper commitments to its longer-term viability. It would make that struggle easier for all of us if Trinity\u2019s fellows could do the right thing and vote to stay in the scheme.\u201d",

But next week promises to be a particularly special time for the UK, as madam\u2019s wellness summit comes to London.</p> <p>The event is called <a href=\"https://goop.com/ingoophealth/\" title=\"\">In Goop Health</a>, but is specifically billed as a summit. Cost? \u00a31,000 for a day ticket, or \u00a34,500 for the weekend, which includes a two-night hotel stay. I don\u2019t think your wallet would ever have felt cleaner. Or, indeed, more rinsed. If I had to pick the summit the Goop summit seems most like, I would probably go for Munich 1938. One party \u2013 the customer \u2013 is going to come away imagining they\u2019ve got something worthwhile out of it, while the other party \u2013 a madly revanchist would-be empire \u2013 is going to be laughing all the way to the central bank. \u201cDid you have a good time, Neville?\u201d \u201cYes! I hold in my hand a <a href=\"https://shop.goop.com/shop/products/psychic-vampire-repellent?country=GBR\" title=\"\">\u00a327 Psychic Vampire Repellent</a>. It says here that you simply \u2018spray around the aura to protect from psychic attack and emotional harm\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>There aren\u2019t a huge number of Nevilles at In Goop Health, of course, \u201cwellness\u201d being something that more easily parts women from their money. We know this because the event has recently been held in New York, giving us ready access to the weapons-grade bollocks that has already been written about it, and a guide to what to expect for any Londoner planning to attend.</p> <p>It is extremely hard to choose a favourite among these reports, but for me, <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/takeaways-from-2019s-in-goop-health-summit\" title=\"\">the Teen Vogue one</a> probably edges it. A kind of prose colonic, this science-free quasi-press release gives everything about the summit the slavish credence it doesn\u2019t deserve. Sample text includes: \u201cIt became clear that radical self-acceptance is a core tenet of Goop\u2019s evolving wellness code.\u201d Mmm.

      "bodyText": "It is always instructive to hear from turbocapitalist fanny-steamer magnate Gwyneth Paltrow, whether it be about the desirability of $956 bog roll or the dream of a zero-carb economy. But next week promises to be a particularly special time for the UK, as madam\u2019s wellness summit comes to London. The event is called In Goop Health, but is specifically billed as a summit. Cost? \u00a31,000 for a day ticket, or \u00a34,500 for the weekend, which includes a two-night hotel stay. I don\u2019t think your wallet would ever have felt cleaner. Or, indeed, more rinsed. If I had to pick the summit the Goop summit seems most like, I would probably go for Munich 1938. One party \u2013 the customer \u2013 is going to come away imagining they\u2019ve got something worthwhile out of it, while the other party \u2013 a madly revanchist would-be empire \u2013 is going to be laughing all the way to the central bank. \u201cDid you have a good time, Neville?\u201d \u201cYes! I hold in my hand a \u00a327 Psychic Vampire Repellent. It says here that you simply \u2018spray around the aura to protect from psychic attack and emotional harm\u2019.\u201d There aren\u2019t a huge number of Nevilles at In Goop Health, of course, \u201cwellness\u201d being something that more easily parts women from their money. We know this because the event has recently been held in New York, giving us ready access to the weapons-grade bollocks that has already been written about it, and a guide to what to expect for any Londoner planning to attend. It is extremely hard to choose a favourite among these reports, but for me, the Teen Vogue one probably edges it. A kind of prose colonic, this science-free quasi-press release gives everything about the summit the slavish credence it doesn\u2019t deserve. Sample text includes: \u201cIt became clear that radical self-acceptance is a core tenet of Goop\u2019s evolving wellness code.\u201d Mmm. It\u2019s not that radical, is it, if you dropped at least a grand to be there, and someone\u2019s trying to flog you an ear-seeder while telling you it\u2019ll balance your nervous system? Speaking of which, one of the summit\u2019s events is a financial workshop described as \u201centering a realm of vulnerability\u201d. Well, quite.

      "body": "<p>In 1962 a medical intern sat with a man recovering from alcohol poisoning in a veterans\u2019 hospital in the US state of Nebraska. Henry Lynch, who has died aged 91, listened as the young farm worker told him that he liked to drown his sorrows because, as with everyone else in his family, he was pretty much guaranteed to die young of cancer.</p> <p>Lynch, with a background in genetics and psychology, wanted to know more about this family and its high prevalence of cancer. His investigations into <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1483189/\" title=\"\">this and other such families</a> led to the discovery of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, which in 1984 was <a href=\"http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1970.html\" title=\"\">renamed Lynch syndrome</a>. They also resulted in the discovery of breast-ovarian cancer syndrome, which in turn led to the identification of the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet\" title=\"\">BRCA genes</a>.</p> <p>People with Lynch syndrome lack one of five \u201cmismatch repair\u201d genes, which correct errors in the DNA copying process when a cell divides. Depending on which gene the individual lacks, they have a 22% to 74% risk of developing colon cancer in their lifetime (compared to around 5% in people who do not have Lynch syndrome). They also have an elevated risk of developing a wide range of other cancers. It is estimated there are 175,000 people in the UK with <a href=\"https://www.genomicseducation.hee.nhs.uk/resources/genetic-conditions-factsheets/item/81-lynch-syndrome/\" title=\"\">Lynch syndrome</a>, and they may be helped with frequent screening and preventive measures.</p> <p>Lynch wanted to meet as many members of his young patient\u2019s extended family as possible. He bought a camper van, equipped it with a centrifuge and some other equipment, and spent weekends touring Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri. He took blood samples and case histories and collected medical and pathology records of the family members who had died so that he could build a detailed picture. A significant number had cancer, particularly of the colon before the age of 50, and the women also often had endometrial or ovarian cancer. It was more than could be explained by sheer chance, and Lynch could not find a plausible explanation \u2013 except through genetics.</p> <p>In 1964 he presented his hand-drawn family pedigree to the American Society of Human Genetics. There he met Dr Marjorie Shaw, who invited him to study a similar family in Michigan. In all, Lynch and his team traced the genetic histories of more than 3000 \u201ccancer families\u201d across the world, in the US, Europe, New Zealand, Israel and Uruguay. He also studied families from the past, including that of Napoleon Bonaparte, whose cause of death in 1821 was carcinoma of the stomach, the same disease that killed his three sisters, brother, father and grandfather.</p> <p>It took decades, however, for doctors to accept Lynch syndrome, and lack of research funding frustrated him. Throughout the 1960s and 70s he was turned down for a research grant from the National Institutes for Health. The NIH pink rejection slips frequently suggested that, given the rural background of his cancer families, he look for other causes such as environmental carcinogens. The pendulum of interest in the cancer community at this time had swung towards environmental factors. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/25/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Richard Doll</a> and others in the 1950s had established that smoking was carcinogenic and doctors were interested to see if there were other such factors. Furthermore, some doctors thought that telling patients cancer can be hereditary might induce fatalism in those who had the disease running through in the family, and complacency in those who did not.</p> <p>A turning point came in the 1980s with the advent of molecular genetic techniques. Microsatellites are short repeated sequences of DNA. Laboratories in Johns Hopkins, Yale and San Diego Universities were simultaneously working on microsatellite change (\u201cinstability\u201d) in certain cells that led to cancer. Other scientists who had been studying yeast pointed out that such instability results when the cell in question lacks a DNA repair gene. In this way, they identified MSH2, one of the missing DNA repair genes in Lynch syndrome. Since then five genes have been identified in Lynch syndrome. Research scientists were able to apply the new DNA testing techniques to Lynch\u2019s cancer families to establish the hereditary nature of their disease, and thus his standing as the \u201cfather of cancer genetics\u201d.</p> <p>Born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and brought up in New York, Henry was the son of Henry Sr, a salesman, and his wife, Eleanor, a secretary. Using a cousin\u2019s identity he enlisted under age in the navy to fight in the second world war. Afterwards, he became a professional boxer with the moniker \u201cHammerin\u2019 Hank\u201d. He was a large man and, as his son said, fortunately for cancer research he did not take too many blows to the head.</p> <p>He gained a degree in clinical psychology at Denver University (1952), and because he was interested in the genetics of mental illness started a PhD in genetics at the University of Texas. However, in 1956 he decided to switch to medicine, graduating in 1960. He held several junior posts in Indiana and Omaha before becoming assistant professor of biology and medicine at the University of Texas in 1966.</p> <p>A year later, he joined <a href=\"https://www.creighton.edu/publicrelations/newscenter/news/2019/june2019/june32019/henrylynchobitnr060319/\" title=\"\">Creighton University school of medicine</a> in Omaha, Nebraska, where he remained for the rest of his career as professor of medicine. In 1984 he established and became director of Creighton\u2019s hereditary cancer centre, and continued to work into his 80s. </p> <p>In 1951 Henry married Jane Smith, who initially was a psychiatric nurse but became his office manager. She died in 2012, and he is survived by his son, two daughters, 10 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Henry Thompson Lynch, genetics researcher and professor of medicine, born 4 January 1928; died 2 June 2019</p>",

Other scientists who had been studying yeast pointed out that such instability results when the cell in question lacks a DNA repair gene. In this way, they identified MSH2, one of the missing DNA repair genes in Lynch syndrome. Since then five genes have been identified in Lynch syndrome. Research scientists were able to apply the new DNA testing techniques to Lynch\u2019s cancer families to establish the hereditary nature of their disease, and thus his standing as the \u201cfather of cancer genetics\u201d. Born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and brought up in New York, Henry was the son of Henry Sr, a salesman, and his wife, Eleanor, a secretary. Using a cousin\u2019s identity he enlisted under age in the navy to fight in the second world war. Afterwards, he became a professional boxer with the moniker \u201cHammerin\u2019 Hank\u201d. He was a large man and, as his son said, fortunately for cancer research he did not take too many blows to the head. He gained a degree in clinical psychology at Denver University (1952), and because he was interested in the genetics of mental illness started a PhD in genetics at the University of Texas. However, in 1956 he decided to switch to medicine, graduating in 1960. He held several junior posts in Indiana and Omaha before becoming assistant professor of biology and medicine at the University of Texas in 1966. A year later, he joined Creighton University school of medicine in Omaha, Nebraska, where he remained for the rest of his career as professor of medicine. In 1984 he established and became director of Creighton\u2019s hereditary cancer centre, and continued to work into his 80s. In 1951 Henry married Jane Smith, who initially was a psychiatric nurse but became his office manager. She died in 2012, and he is survived by his son, two daughters, 10 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. \u2022 Henry Thompson Lynch, genetics researcher and professor of medicine, born 4 January 1928; died 2 June 2019",

The reasons given include reduced sleep, fewer secure social networks, financial pressures and worries for the future.</p> <p>The Living Well report, which uses data collected every six months, and is the result of collaboration between Oxford Economics and National Centre for Social Research, confirms a general picture of British society that has been emerging in recent years: of rising social disconnect and loneliness, of work stress and excess screen time, and of many individuals experiencing a significant crisis in mental health.</p> <p>Yet the report also raises a lot of questions about how we measure and respond to data around concepts such as \u201cwellbeing\u201d, community and loneliness. And how we talk about socialisation.</p> <p>The take-home headlines from this report focus on sociability, loneliness and declining community: \u201cNearly half of Britons socialise with family and friends only once a month or less,\u201d <a href=\"https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqSQgKIkNDQklTTERvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoOGFIV1IwVldwM1VFdE5WREk0V1RsSlRXMHRSMWd5VERCR2FrWlZPVFpOS0FBUAE?q=Half+of+Britons+socialise+with+family+and+friends+at+most+once+a+month&amp;lr=English&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB:en\" title=\"\">was the line</a> many, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/17/half-of-britons-socialise-with-family-and-friends-at-most-once-a-month\" title=\"\">the Guardian</a>, homed in on. This featured a finding that \u201cnearly one in 10 (9.1%) participants said they never met friends, family members or coworkers socially\u201d.</p> <p>This is yet more evidence, says Simon Roberts, Sainsbury\u2019s retail and operations director, that \u201cthere has been a decline of the sense of community the nation feels as a whole\u201d.</p> <p>Given the social breakdown caused by Brexit and the intense focus on loneliness and mental health we have seen across the media in recent months, this seems a logical conclusion. And yet.</p> <p>Sociability is not the opposite of loneliness. We can all be lonely in a crowd. One of the problems in how loneliness is often framed is the sense of a lonely person as being socially isolated, when there is so much more to consider.</p> <p>Yes, humans need other people for contentment and wellbeing, but not just anyone \u2013 which is one of the challenges in addressing loneliness by creating opportunities to meet other people. We need meaningful relationships that bring us a sense of connectedness to our lives. And that can\u2019t be measured in the number of times we go out for a drink with work colleagues: how emotionally satisfying that drink might be, is more to the point.</p> <p>The relationships that give us meaning and a sense of wellbeing will vary. It is entirely possible for people \u2013 especially shy, young people \u2013 to find the community they need on social media, provided it connects to real-life experience rather than replacing it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It should be recognised that plenty of people don\u2019t want to be sociable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the problems with talk of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/01/loneliness-illness-body-mind-epidemic\" title=\"\">\u201cloneliness epidemic\u201d</a> is that its language eradicates important differences in experience. There is a difference between transitional loneliness, which might affect students or those moving between jobs, and chronic loneliness, which is experienced by people with mental health problems, or experiencing trauma or social isolation. And different measures will be needed to address each version of loneliness, especially when it is unwanted.</p> <p>It should be recognised that plenty of people don\u2019t want to be sociable \u2013 especially when they are tired, broke and annoyed with the very people they are expected to see. And people won\u2019t go out to eat when they are worried about money; they might eat alone when they are exhausted from their zero-hours contract work or living in a bedsit hundreds of miles from friends and family. But people also eat alone meditatively, savouring the calm after a hectic day.</p> <p>There are huge questions about how we live in the early 21st century that can be hinted at but are not fully addressed in large-scale studies of wellbeing. In this case, 8,000 or so people were consulted, but we need to know much more about them \u2013 their age, gender, class, health, ethnicity, geography and so on \u2013 to help understand when social isolation becomes unwanted loneliness and the remedies that might be needed to address it.</p> <p>So, too, does understanding what we mean by community: it is not a static entity that exists outside the meanings we give it.

      "bodyText": "Humans are social animals and the ways we connect \u2013 not only intellectually, but emotionally and sensorially \u2013 is crucial to physical and emotional \u201chealth\u201d. Rituals such as eating together are fundamental in forming social relationships and emotional bonds. And this social connectedness is key to understanding loneliness. Sainsbury\u2019s Living Well index has identified a reduction in eating with others as a significant index of a decline in wellbeing, especially among baby boomers. It suggests this is linked to the breakdown of relationships in later life; middle-aged people score highly in loneliness measures as a rule, too, particularly when they have experienced divorce and social isolation. Importantly, there is another group that shows a significant decline in wellbeing: the child-free generation X. The reasons given include reduced sleep, fewer secure social networks, financial pressures and worries for the future. The Living Well report, which uses data collected every six months, and is the result of collaboration between Oxford Economics and National Centre for Social Research, confirms a general picture of British society that has been emerging in recent years: of rising social disconnect and loneliness, of work stress and excess screen time, and of many individuals experiencing a significant crisis in mental health. Yet the report also raises a lot of questions about how we measure and respond to data around concepts such as \u201cwellbeing\u201d, community and loneliness. And how we talk about socialisation. The take-home headlines from this report focus on sociability, loneliness and declining community: \u201cNearly half of Britons socialise with family and friends only once a month or less,\u201d was the line many, including the Guardian, homed in on. This featured a finding that \u201cnearly one in 10 (9.1%) participants said they never met friends, family members or coworkers socially\u201d. This is yet more evidence, says Simon Roberts, Sainsbury\u2019s retail and operations director, that \u201cthere has been a decline of the sense of community the nation feels as a whole\u201d. Given the social breakdown caused by Brexit and the intense focus on loneliness and mental health we have seen across the media in recent months, this seems a logical conclusion. And yet. Sociability is not the opposite of loneliness. We can all be lonely in a crowd. One of the problems in how loneliness is often framed is the sense of a lonely person as being socially isolated, when there is so much more to consider. Yes, humans need other people for contentment and wellbeing, but not just anyone \u2013 which is one of the challenges in addressing loneliness by creating opportunities to meet other people. We need meaningful relationships that bring us a sense of connectedness to our lives. And that can\u2019t be measured in the number of times we go out for a drink with work colleagues: how emotionally satisfying that drink might be, is more to the point. The relationships that give us meaning and a sense of wellbeing will vary. It is entirely possible for people \u2013 especially shy, young people \u2013 to find the community they need on social media, provided it connects to real-life experience rather than replacing it. One of the problems with talk of a \u201cloneliness epidemic\u201d is that its language eradicates important differences in experience. There is a difference between transitional loneliness, which might affect students or those moving between jobs, and chronic loneliness, which is experienced by people with mental health problems, or experiencing trauma or social isolation. And different measures will be needed to address each version of loneliness, especially when it is unwanted. It should be recognised that plenty of people don\u2019t want to be sociable \u2013 especially when they are tired, broke and annoyed with the very people they are expected to see. And people won\u2019t go out to eat when they are worried about money; they might eat alone when they are exhausted from their zero-hours contract work or living in a bedsit hundreds of miles from friends and family. But people also eat alone meditatively, savouring the calm after a hectic day. There are huge questions about how we live in the early 21st century that can be hinted at but are not fully addressed in large-scale studies of wellbeing. In this case, 8,000 or so people were consulted, but we need to know much more about them \u2013 their age, gender, class, health, ethnicity, geography and so on \u2013 to help understand when social isolation becomes unwanted loneliness and the remedies that might be needed to address it. So, too, does understanding what we mean by community: it is not a static entity that exists outside the meanings we give it. We can inhabit many communities during our lives, and some will be more fulfilling than others. But the very notion of community that is regularly invoked as an antidote to loneliness ignores this arbitrariness and hints at David Cameron\u2019s \u201cbig society\u201d. But we don\u2019t necessarily need to panic about declining sociability \u2013 instead, let\u2019s ask questions about why people are not socialising as much (if indeed this is a national trend), and what they might be doing instead. Examine what emotions accompany the desire not to socialise rather than dressing it up as yet another \u201cought\u201d.

      "body": "<p>When Joseph Heller, a 38-year-old New York advertising executive, published his first novel in 1961, an urgent query came in from the Finnish translator: \u201cWould you please explain me one thing? What means catch-22? I didn\u2019t find it in any vocabulary. Even the assistant air attach\u00e9 of the USA here in Helsinki could not explain exactly.\u201d Within a couple of years \u2013 after <em>Catch-22</em> had become a million-selling paperback in the US and UK, and done well in Finland and most other countries \u2013 nobody needed the phrase translated. It is likely to be familiar to those who watch the new six-part TV adaptation on Channel 4, even if they do not know the book.</p> \n<p>Heller, however, grouched that most people still didn\u2019t understand. I interviewed the writer, who died in 1999, several times. He was a large, loud man, who loved food: \u201cHungry Joe\u201d, the nickname given to a character in <em>Catch-22</em>, was Heller\u2019s own army monicker. He had never lost his Brooklyn accent: Martin Amis once remarked that this was the only major American writer who referred to his profession as \u201clitta-ra-chewer\u201d. Across our encounters, there was a running gag in which someone \u2013 a diner in a Long Island seafood restaurant, a fan at a literary festival, a BBC executive \u2013 would tell Heller their own experience of a \u201ccatch-22 situation\u201d. When they had gone, the writer would growl: \u201cThat\u2019s not a catch-22. They almost never are.\u201d</p> \n<p>Most of the anecdotes were minor domestic dilemmas, along the lines of not being able to find your lost spectacles without your spectacles. Heller was dismissive of such mild diurnal circuits of unfairness. For him, a true catch-22 was perfectly, cruelly illogical, with life-or-death peril, like the one discovered by John Yossarian, a member of a US bomber crew stationed in Italy during the second world war:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one\u2019s safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn\u2019t, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn\u2019t have to, but if he didn\u2019t want to he was sane and had to.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is a passage of comic prose so magnificent that the script of the TV adaptation, co-created and co-directed by George Clooney, simply slices it into dialogue.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22891af3d24ab97847a972b4b98a579bfb50f954\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22891af3d24ab97847a972b4b98a579bfb50f954/0_1089_1392_835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Hungry Joe\u2019 ...

At appearances to publicise his later books, readers would often bluntly tell him that he hadn\u2019t written anything as good as <em>Catch-22</em>, to which the reply, after a growly laugh, was: \u201cNo. But nor has anyone else.\u201d So he would not have been shocked by either the initial success or the continuing popularity of his first book. What had made him nervous at first was the title. The manuscript on which he worked between 1953 and 1960, fictionalising his own experience as a bombardier in the US air force, was originally called \u201cCatch-18\u201d. But, soon after the book was bought by Simon and Schuster, rival publisher Doubleday announced <em>Mila 18</em>, a second world war novel by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jun/25/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"\">Leon Uris</a>. Deciding it was unlikely that two stories of conflict with the same number on their covers would become bestsellers in the same season, Heller\u2019s editor nudged him up or down the abacus. This request appalled and unsettled the author for whom, during eight years of work, \u201c18 had always been the only number\u201d.</p> \n<p>Heller\u2019s resistance was partly down to stubbornness, which even his friends identified as a prime quality, but also something subtler. He was one of the wave of male Jewish-American writers who dominated American literature in the second half of the 20th century. But, while readers soon realised the roots of Philip Roth and Saul Bellow from the content of their novels, Heller\u2019s specifically Jewish works came much later, with <em>Good as Gold</em> (1979) and <em>God Knows</em> (1984), comedies respectively about Henry Kissinger and King David. However, one reason that the number 18 seems to have meant so much to him is that it had a literally mystical significance; in Hebrew, where letters have a numerical value, the sum of one and eight can spell \u201clife\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The Vietnam war created a market for a story&nbsp;that depicted US army commanders as&nbsp;quixotic, paranoid brutes</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Heller cussedly continued to prefer the original name, and his concerns seemed to have been justified when, at the hardback stage, <em>Mila 18</em> made the New York Times bestseller list and Heller\u2019s book didn\u2019t. (Incidentally, in Ian McEwan\u2019s <em>Machines Like Me</em>, set in an alternative postwar Britain, people are reading \u201cCatch-18\u201d.) Once the mass market editions appeared, though, Heller rapidly eclipsed Uris. A key reason is that while <em>Mila 18</em> was a conventionally solemn war novel, <em>Catch-22</em> is a daringly dark farce, which anticipated the mood soon to engulf the US.</p> \n<p>During the novel\u2019s lengthy gestation \u2013 writing in short bursts after work at the ad agency, and at weekends \u2013 Heller was confronted by publishers who feared that a story set in the early 40s risked missing its time, seeming irrelevant in prosperous American peacetime. Two members of the same young military generation \u2013 Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal \u2013 had published novels based on their experiences soon after demobbing: Vidal\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview37\" title=\"\">Williwaw</a></em> was in bookshops by 1946, Mailer\u2019s <em>The Naked and the Dead</em> two years later.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8deb32c9-a982-4e68-b015-baaefaf2eae0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LmwruYL8V0s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Then, in May 1961, a few months before publication, John F Kennedy secretly escalated US assistance to the South Vietnamese; by the time <em>Catch-22</em> had become a soft-cover super seller, Lyndon B Johnson was ruinously involved in a war that was vehemently opposed, especially by students. Whether or not Heller\u2019s book would have had equal success as \u201cCatch-18\u201d, it seems impossible that it would have reached such heights without America\u2019s global anti-communist mission creating a market for a story that depicted US army commanders as quixotic, paranoid brutes.</p> \n<p>Though devastating in most other aspects, the war in Vietnam was generous to the genre of military black comedy. <em>Slaughterhouse-</em><em>Five</em> by Kurt Vonnegut \u2013 a second world war novel delayed even longer than <em>Catch-22</em> \u2013 was based on Vonnegut\u2019s exposure, as a captured serviceman, to the allied bombing of Dresden in 1945. But, when the book was published in 1969, it appealed to the anti-war sentiment of young people resisting conscription to Vietnam. Similarly, <em>M</em><em>A</em><em>S</em><em>H: A Novel About Three Army Doctors</em> by Richard Hooker (a pseudonym for Dr H Richard Hornberger and WC Heinz) was published in 1968, 15 years after the end of the Korean war in which it is set, by which time that conflict was almost forgotten. However, first as a 1970 movie and then as a long-running TV series, the story of a previous American imperial folly seemed to be a commentary on the nation\u2019s miscalculations in south-east Asia. So, paradoxically, three of the key Vietnam era fictions \u2013 <em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em>, <em>Catch-22</em> and <em>MASH</em> \u2013 all dramatised much earlier conflicts.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"09ec7425424cb00bcfcb4d5f2de2603f17aae456\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09ec7425424cb00bcfcb4d5f2de2603f17aae456/0_58_2745_1648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould in M*A*S*H (1970)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-war sentiment \u2026 Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould in <em>M*A*S*H</em> (1970)</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/CBS TV</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The significance of this is that Heller, Vonnegut, and Hooker, writing at a distance from events, were able to be mordantly satirical about war in a way that would have brought accusations of bad taste to an author writing contemporaneously in such a way about the second world war, Korea, or Vietnam. A work of fiction about a war that never happened \u2013 the USA-USSR nuclear war satirically imagined in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s <em>Doctor Strangelove</em> (1964) \u2013 also helped to shape the culture in which <em>Catch-22</em> became a cult.</p> \n<p>The TV series <em>M*A*S*H</em> is still popular today, and is partly responsible for the success of conflict-based comedy on TV. As the camera pans across camouflage tents and the sardonically amazed faces of troops given ridiculous orders, Clooney\u2019s new <em>Catch-22</em> seems to contain a deliberate visual homage to the series. Another predecessor in this respect is <em>Blackadder Goes Forth</em> (1989), which dared to joke about military cruelty and incompetence, and connects directly to the latest Heller adaptation through the casting. Hugh Laurie, who played Lieutenant George in Blackadder\u2019s first world war farce here appears as the deranged Major De Coverley.</p> \n<p>The 1970 movie version of <em>Catch-22</em>, directed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/20/mike-nichols-a-director-who-found-the-zeitgeist-in-every-decade\" title=\"\">Mike Nichols</a>, was badly received by critics and struggled at the box office, encouraging the view that Heller\u2019s novel might be one of those books \u2013 <em>Finnegans Wake,</em> <em>Moby-Dick</em> \u2013 that defy successful cinematic adaptation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"757e82163cebc6894cda6b989bb9e47b2493ed03\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/757e82163cebc6894cda6b989bb9e47b2493ed03/0_193_3416_2050/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Arkin in Nichols\u2019s Catch-22.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Arkin as Yossarian in Nichols\u2019s Catch-22.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>However, the dominant problem in such cases has been the level of compression necessary to fit long, populous books into just one movie: the Nichols <em>Catch-22</em> runs for 122 minutes.

As for racial diversity, aside from Yossarian \u2013 who is Armenian-American (and is played in the series by Italian-Portuguese-American actor Christopher Abbott) \u2013 Heller\u2019s airmen are predominantly white Americans.

      "bodyText": "When Joseph Heller, a 38-year-old New York advertising executive, published his first novel in 1961, an urgent query came in from the Finnish translator: \u201cWould you please explain me one thing? What means catch-22? I didn\u2019t find it in any vocabulary. Even the assistant air attach\u00e9 of the USA here in Helsinki could not explain exactly.\u201d Within a couple of years \u2013 after Catch-22 had become a million-selling paperback in the US and UK, and done well in Finland and most other countries \u2013 nobody needed the phrase translated. It is likely to be familiar to those who watch the new six-part TV adaptation on Channel 4, even if they do not know the book. Heller, however, grouched that most people still didn\u2019t understand. I interviewed the writer, who died in 1999, several times. He was a large, loud man, who loved food: \u201cHungry Joe\u201d, the nickname given to a character in Catch-22, was Heller\u2019s own army monicker. He had never lost his Brooklyn accent: Martin Amis once remarked that this was the only major American writer who referred to his profession as \u201clitta-ra-chewer\u201d. Across our encounters, there was a running gag in which someone \u2013 a diner in a Long Island seafood restaurant, a fan at a literary festival, a BBC executive \u2013 would tell Heller their own experience of a \u201ccatch-22 situation\u201d. When they had gone, the writer would growl: \u201cThat\u2019s not a catch-22. They almost never are.\u201d Most of the anecdotes were minor domestic dilemmas, along the lines of not being able to find your lost spectacles without your spectacles. Heller was dismissive of such mild diurnal circuits of unfairness. For him, a true catch-22 was perfectly, cruelly illogical, with life-or-death peril, like the one discovered by John Yossarian, a member of a US bomber crew stationed in Italy during the second world war: There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one\u2019s safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn\u2019t, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn\u2019t have to, but if he didn\u2019t want to he was sane and had to. This is a passage of comic prose so magnificent that the script of the TV adaptation, co-created and co-directed by George Clooney, simply slices it into dialogue. Heller was a man of considerable self-confidence. At appearances to publicise his later books, readers would often bluntly tell him that he hadn\u2019t written anything as good as Catch-22, to which the reply, after a growly laugh, was: \u201cNo. But nor has anyone else.\u201d So he would not have been shocked by either the initial success or the continuing popularity of his first book. What had made him nervous at first was the title. The manuscript on which he worked between 1953 and 1960, fictionalising his own experience as a bombardier in the US air force, was originally called \u201cCatch-18\u201d. But, soon after the book was bought by Simon and Schuster, rival publisher Doubleday announced Mila 18, a second world war novel by Leon Uris. Deciding it was unlikely that two stories of conflict with the same number on their covers would become bestsellers in the same season, Heller\u2019s editor nudged him up or down the abacus. This request appalled and unsettled the author for whom, during eight years of work, \u201c18 had always been the only number\u201d. Heller\u2019s resistance was partly down to stubbornness, which even his friends identified as a prime quality, but also something subtler. He was one of the wave of male Jewish-American writers who dominated American literature in the second half of the 20th century. But, while readers soon realised the roots of Philip Roth and Saul Bellow from the content of their novels, Heller\u2019s specifically Jewish works came much later, with Good as Gold (1979) and God Knows (1984), comedies respectively about Henry Kissinger and King David. However, one reason that the number 18 seems to have meant so much to him is that it had a literally mystical significance; in Hebrew, where letters have a numerical value, the sum of one and eight can spell \u201clife\u201d. Heller cussedly continued to prefer the original name, and his concerns seemed to have been justified when, at the hardback stage, Mila 18 made the New York Times bestseller list and Heller\u2019s book didn\u2019t. (Incidentally, in Ian McEwan\u2019s Machines Like Me, set in an alternative postwar Britain, people are reading \u201cCatch-18\u201d.) Once the mass market editions appeared, though, Heller rapidly eclipsed Uris. A key reason is that while Mila 18 was a conventionally solemn war novel, Catch-22 is a daringly dark farce, which anticipated the mood soon to engulf the US. During the novel\u2019s lengthy gestation \u2013 writing in short bursts after work at the ad agency, and at weekends \u2013 Heller was confronted by publishers who feared that a story set in the early 40s risked missing its time, seeming irrelevant in prosperous American peacetime. Two members of the same young military generation \u2013 Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal \u2013 had published novels based on their experiences soon after demobbing: Vidal\u2019s Williwaw was in bookshops by 1946, Mailer\u2019s The Naked and the Dead two years later. Then, in May 1961, a few months before publication, John F Kennedy secretly escalated US assistance to the South Vietnamese; by the time Catch-22 had become a soft-cover super seller, Lyndon B Johnson was ruinously involved in a war that was vehemently opposed, especially by students. Whether or not Heller\u2019s book would have had equal success as \u201cCatch-18\u201d, it seems impossible that it would have reached such heights without America\u2019s global anti-communist mission creating a market for a story that depicted US army commanders as quixotic, paranoid brutes. Though devastating in most other aspects, the war in Vietnam was generous to the genre of military black comedy. Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut \u2013 a second world war novel delayed even longer than Catch-22 \u2013 was based on Vonnegut\u2019s exposure, as a captured serviceman, to the allied bombing of Dresden in 1945. But, when the book was published in 1969, it appealed to the anti-war sentiment of young people resisting conscription to Vietnam. Similarly, MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors by Richard Hooker (a pseudonym for Dr H Richard Hornberger and WC Heinz) was published in 1968, 15 years after the end of the Korean war in which it is set, by which time that conflict was almost forgotten. However, first as a 1970 movie and then as a long-running TV series, the story of a previous American imperial folly seemed to be a commentary on the nation\u2019s miscalculations in south-east Asia. So, paradoxically, three of the key Vietnam era fictions \u2013 Slaughterhouse-Five, Catch-22 and MASH \u2013 all dramatised much earlier conflicts. The significance of this is that Heller, Vonnegut, and Hooker, writing at a distance from events, were able to be mordantly satirical about war in a way that would have brought accusations of bad taste to an author writing contemporaneously in such a way about the second world war, Korea, or Vietnam. A work of fiction about a war that never happened \u2013 the USA-USSR nuclear war satirically imagined in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Doctor Strangelove (1964) \u2013 also helped to shape the culture in which Catch-22 became a cult. The TV series M*A*S*H is still popular today, and is partly responsible for the success of conflict-based comedy on TV. As the camera pans across camouflage tents and the sardonically amazed faces of troops given ridiculous orders, Clooney\u2019s new Catch-22 seems to contain a deliberate visual homage to the series.

Hugh Laurie, who played Lieutenant George in Blackadder\u2019s first world war farce here appears as the deranged Major De Coverley. The 1970 movie version of Catch-22, directed by Mike Nichols, was badly received by critics and struggled at the box office, encouraging the view that Heller\u2019s novel might be one of those books \u2013 Finnegans Wake, Moby-Dick \u2013 that defy successful cinematic adaptation. However, the dominant problem in such cases has been the level of compression necessary to fit long, populous books into just one movie: the Nichols Catch-22 runs for 122 minutes.

It said a significant number of stores were unprofitable as a result and it needed to reduce costs in order to ensure their \u201congoing viability\u201d.</p> <p>The plan involves two insolvency procedures known as company voluntary arrangements, which must win the backing of at least half of the retailer\u2019s independent creditors at a vote on 3 July.</p> <p>Paul Allen, the chief executive of Monsoon Accessorize, said: \u201cTrading for the group has been difficult for some time, as it has been for much of the retail industry.

      "bodyText": "Monsoon Accessorize is asking landlords to reduce rents on more than half its 258 leased stores in return for a \u00a310m share of profits and an \u00a318m interest-free loan to keep the company afloat. The multi-millionaire owner, Peter Simon, has also promised to halve the \u00a35m rent on the fashion business\u2019s London head office, which he owns, to help reduce costs. He has already loaned the business \u00a312m and pledged to hand over an additional \u00a318m interest-free loan if the rescue plan is approved. Monsoon said it was asking for rent cuts of between 25% and 65% at 135 stores because current costs were \u201cunaffordable, given the fundamental changes that have taken place in the retail sector\u201d. It said a significant number of stores were unprofitable as a result and it needed to reduce costs in order to ensure their \u201congoing viability\u201d. The plan involves two insolvency procedures known as company voluntary arrangements, which must win the backing of at least half of the retailer\u2019s independent creditors at a vote on 3 July. Paul Allen, the chief executive of Monsoon Accessorize, said: \u201cTrading for the group has been difficult for some time, as it has been for much of the retail industry. This is due to a combination of factors, including rising costs, increased competition and subdued consumer spending.\u201d A CVA document seen by the Guardian says the company expects to fall to a \u00a33m underlying loss this year from a \u00a32.7m profit in 2018 as sales fall just over 3% to \u00a3358m. \u201cIf the proposal is not approved it is likely that the company will no longer be able to trade as a going concern, which could be likely to result in the appointment of administrators or liquidators to the Company,\u201d the document says. No store closures are planned under the proposals but the CVA document indicates Monsoon is seeking the right to exit at least seven stores within eight months. It is not seeking rent cuts on at least seven more as these leases can already be let go at short notice. The CVA is likely to prove controversial as Simon, who has a family fortune of \u00a3387m, according to the latest Sunday Times Rich List, has taken millions out of the company over the years. As well as collecting \u00a34.99m in rent on the group\u2019s main head office in 2017, Simon\u2019s Adena Property Investments also took \u00a3124,000 in annual rent from Monsoon on another west London office. Simon\u2019s company Balmain Invest &amp; Trade also received \u00a3556,000 in consultancy fees that year. Monsoon Accesorize\u2019s holding company also paid his family \u00a3116m in dividends between 2008 and 2013, although no dividends have been paid since then.",

      "bodyText": "Frankie Dettori almost brought Britain\u2019s betting industry to its knees for a second time on Thursday , 23 years after his Magnificent Seven winners at Ascot cost the bookies tens of millions of pounds. There is a statue of Dettori near the entrance to Ascot\u2019s Royal enclosure to mark his astonishing day in 1996, and he joked that the course \u201cmight need to get another statue\u201d after winning the first four races on Ladies\u2019 Day with a flawless series of rides. Lester Piggott, in 1965, was the last jockey to ride four winners on the same afternoon at the Royal meeting. A\u2019Ali (5-1), Sangarius (13-2) and Star Catcher (4-1) all won for Dettori before Stradivarius, at even money, completed the four-timer in the Gold Cup, the biggest race of the week. \u201cHe is a phenomenon,\u201d John Gosden, the trainer of Stradivarius, said. \u201cFrankie is like a player who gets to the final of Wimbledon and then raises it to another level. \u201cFor a kid of 48 he is remarkable. And when he rides here he goes to another level. \u201cHe\u2019s been in the gym, working out, and then he comes and rides out for me and he\u2019s so relaxed. The horses are here to do a job, but he does it so beautifully with them and that makes a difference.\u201d Dettori was short of racing room in the closing stages of the Gold Cup but waited for a gap to appear and seized his chance when it did. \u201cI don\u2019t normally hear the crowd because I\u2019m so focused [on the race] but the roar from the crowd was incredible,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cThis horse has captured people\u2019s imaginations and we\u2019ll bring him back next year.\u201d Dettori\u2019s winning streak came to an end when he could finish only second in the fifth race after leading with a furlong to run. \u201cTwenty years ago I would have won that,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cIt was 16-1 this morning and it was favourite [at the start], he gave me a great spin but it wasn\u2019t to be. Listen, I\u2019ve had a good day so I\u2019m not going to cry.\u201d Despite his failure to win either of the last two races on the card, bookmakers said it had been one of their worst days at the Royal meeting. \u201cWe are hugely relieved to have avoided the worst-case scenario of a Magnificent Six,\u201d said Nicola McGeady of Ladbrokes. \u201cBut we are by no means celebrating. A four-timer for the most popular jockey at the biggest meeting of the Flat season is a shocking result and can only be described as a bloodbath.\u201d",

Havel led the protests that resulted in the fall of the communist regime in the 1989 Velvet Revolution. The wreath-laying event came after she was greeted at Prague Castle by Milo\u0161 Zeman, the populist Czech president whose controversially outspoken views are seen as the polar opposite of what his new Slovak counterpart represents. The two leaders exchanged friendly words but appeared ill at ease as a brass band played during a welcome ceremony attended by senior Czech politicians and other dignitaries. There were fears beforehand that the meeting might be marred by Zeman\u2019s penchant for politically insensitive and sometimes sexist remarks. The visit followed a convention established after the 1993 dissolution of Czechoslovakia into the separate states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia that the presidents of each country should call on the other as their first trip abroad. But the visit of \u010caputov\u00e1, five days after her inauguration last Saturday, carried added piquancy because her political outlook is so at odds with Zeman\u2019s.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s proving to be an unusually cold summer in Hollywood, a sun-drenched town suddenly facing a rather worrying frost. Ever since the 70s, it\u2019s a time of year that has brought with it huge profitability, with studios unveiling their splashiest and starriest offerings but this year, toasting success has been replaced with analysing failure, a string of underperformers raising a number of uncomfortable questions. Aside from a legitimate discussion over franchise fatigue, there\u2019s another debate that rages on: what is a \u201cmovie star\u201d in 2019?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/14/murder-mystery-review-netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston\">Murder Mystery review \u2013 Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston buoy fun Netflix comedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last weekend resulted in a rather nasty box office bloodbath that left a pricey reboot and a glossy sequel battered and bruised. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/12/men-in-black-international-review-f-gary-gray-chris-hemsworth-liam-neeson-tessa-thompson\">Men in Black: International</a>, a $110m attempt to resurrect a franchise that had lain dormant since 2012, scored the lowest opening of the series to date with just $30m stateside despite a hefty $120m spend on promotions and advertising and the pairing of Avengers: Endgame stars Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth. Further down the chart, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/13/shaft-review-samuel-l-jackson-jessie-t-usher\">attempt to revive Shaft</a>, last seen in 2000, was an unmitigated disaster, making less then $9m (less than half of what the last outing could muster on its first weekend) despite boasting another Marvel stalwart, Samuel L Jackson, to hand over the torch to his on-screen son.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cd8e23d508fb70ac8b78deab0897772c7c75b246\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd8e23d508fb70ac8b78deab0897772c7c75b246/0_56_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson in Men in Black: International.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson in Men in Black: International.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Keyte/Sony</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The same weekend also saw Emma Thompson and Mindy Kaling\u2019s comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/26/late-night-review-emma-thompson-mindy-kaling-sundance\">Late Night</a> crash and burn weeks after an underwhelming result for Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson\u2019s Dirty Rotten Scoundrels remake <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/09/the-hustle-review-anne-hathaway-rebel-wilson\">The Hustle</a> and middling returns for Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron\u2019s romcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/03/long-shot-review-charlize-theron-seth-rogen\">Long Shot</a>. The summer has also seen other bigger failures (including big-budget bombs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/28/godzilla-king-of-the-monsters-film-review\">Godzilla: King of Monsters</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/05/x-men-dark-phoenix-review\">Dark Phoenix</a>) but what ties all of these together is that they relied heavily on star power to sell tickets. Even though Men in Black is an established property, it\u2019s not really lingered in the pop culture lexicon since its third outing and while Thompson has the bigger role, it was the shoulders of the more established Hemsworth that the film\u2019s success was resting on. But despite being known as the god of thunder, Hemsworth has struggled to make much work outside of the Marvel universe with Blackhat, Rush, 12 Strong and In the Heart of the Sea all doing bad to adequate business. And even a more tested draw like Jackson couldn\u2019t sell the latest Shaft film, a failure that was at least somewhat predicted by backers New Line who sold the non-US rights to the film to Netflix, where it will premiere at the end of the month.</p> <p>It has become a far safer home for stars, a development confirmed once again this past weekend. Because while audiences shunned big stars on the big screen, they chose to stream them at home instead with the Friday release of Adam Sandler/Jennifer Aniston comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/14/murder-mystery-review-netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston\">Murder Mystery</a> breaking a major Netflix record. The film, an engaging Agatha Christie homage, was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NetflixIsAJoke/status/1141088463934173189\">reportedly consumed by 30m households worldwide</a> in its first few days, with more than 13m accounts residing in the US. If we\u2019re using the average US movie ticket price of $9.11, this would mean the equivalent box office would be around $121m, although if each household represented at least two tickets then it would be double or more. Now when talking about Netflix viewership, especially when statistics are coming from Netflix themselves without independent verification, a handful of salt is always recommended. But there\u2019s no denying that however it\u2019s spun, more people saw Murder Mystery than anything at the cinema over the weekend.</p> <p>Obviously, the investment is far easier, with the consumption of Murder Mystery not requiring anything more than a click, but what\u2019s interesting is how its success proves that movie stars do continue to wield power just not in the way we\u2019re traditionally used to seeing.</p> <p>The last 12 months have seen a number of major stars stumble. Keanu Reeves couldn\u2019t push sci-fi thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/11/replicas-review-keanu-reeves-fights-to-save-brain-dead-sci-fi-thriller\">Replicas</a> over a miserable $4m total, Matthew McConaughey failed to make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/11/the-beach-bum-review-matthew-mcconaughey-haromny-korine\">The Beach Bum</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/07/white-boy-rick-review-teenage-hustler-matthew-mcconaughey\">White Boy Rick</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/24/serenity-review-the-years-first-gloriously-bad-movie-is-here\">Serenity</a> appealing to audiences, Will Ferrell\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/06/holmes-and-watson-review-film-john-c-reilly-will-ferrell\">Holmes and Watson</a> (a film Sony allegedly regretted so much <a href=\"https://theplaylist.net/netflix-holmes-watson-sony-20181228/\">they tried to unsuccessfully sell it to Netflix</a>) couldn\u2019t make back its $40m globally, Steve Carell wasn\u2019t enough to save <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/19/welcome-to-marwen-review-steve-carell-mark-hogancamp\">Welcome to Marwen</a> from <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2018/12/welcome-to-marwen-bombs-at-box-office-will-lose-60m-1202525686/\">a $60m loss</a>, Mark Wahlberg didn\u2019t prove a draw for action flick <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/19/mile-22-review-mark-wahlberg-peter-berg\">Mile 22</a>, Charlize Theron\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/02/tully-review-charlize-theron-jason-reitman-diablo-cody\">Tully</a> was a disappointment, but not quite as bad as her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/08/gringo-review-nash-edgerton-david-oyelowo-charlize-theron\">Gringo</a>, while pretty much no one wanted to see Jake Gyllenhaal and Joaquin Phoenix as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/02/the-sisters-brothers-review-jacques-audiard-saddles-up-for-a-subtle-and-funny-western\">The Sisters Brothers</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a2f6d725e055abb10abf2d809e102c05e87934b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2f6d725e055abb10abf2d809e102c05e87934b2/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sandra Bullock in Bird Box.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandra Bullock in Bird Box.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Merrick Morton/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet on Netflix, stars who haven\u2019t had the most consistent track record have excelled. Action thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/06/triple-frontier-review-netflix-ben-affleck-oscar-isaac\">Triple Frontier</a> was seen by a reported 52m accounts in its first four weeks meaning an unqualified success for star Ben Affleck, Sandra Bullock\u2019s meme-friendly horror <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/14/bird-box-review-sandra-bullock-netflix-susanne-bier\">Bird Box</a> had 45m streams in its first week while back in 2016 Sandler\u2019s first Netflix original <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/15/the-ridiculous-six-review-adam-sandler-western-comedy\">The Ridiculous 6</a> became their most watched film within less than a month. His old-fashioned eight-movie deal was seen as a particularly important game-changer, and it\u2019s one that I believe will continue to have a profound impact on how stars find security within the industry.</p> <p>While he became known as one of the most bankable comedy stars in Hollywood with hits like The Waterboy and 50 First Dates, Sandler\u2019s magic faded over time and he made the smart decision to transport his brand to the small screen, to a less discerning audience far more willing to spend an evening with him. His Netflix output has been largely rubbished by critics but that has made zero impact on reach. He has become part of their stable in the kind of deal that movie stars might have found easier to secure in the golden age but one thathas become harder to nab in riskier times. While not locked down in the same way, Bullock has also decided to reteam with Netflix to produce sci-fi adventure <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/sandra-bullock-netflix-reborn-1203115971/\">Reborn</a> while Gyllenhaal, who has starred in both Okja and Velvet Buzzsaw for the platform, will see his next film, the video game adaptation The Division, also head straight to stream.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"43c28f797ceb04484e9c6271b19fdf932e10f5bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43c28f797ceb04484e9c6271b19fdf932e10f5bd/0_95_3824_2294/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Aniston arrives to attend the Los Angeles premiere screening of Murder Mystery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Aniston arrives to attend the Los Angeles premiere screening of Murder Mystery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Val\u00e9rie Macon/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The success of Murder Mystery also owes a great deal to Aniston, a star who maintains a foothold in the industry and within public consciousness without really finding projects that seem to attract the requisite audience. Given the incredible second life that Friends has found on Netflix, who recently paid <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/business/media/netflix-friends.html\">a whopping $100m</a> to keep showing it for an extra year, and her role in their fauxspirational comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/06/dumplin-review-jennifer-aniston-netflix-movie\">Dumplin\u2019</a>, she has become a tried and tested draw for them and her role in Apple\u2019s glossy new comedy show implies a major strategic change on her part, a second life that she\u2019s struggled to find on the big screen. The mass exodus of stars from cinema to TV has meant that we don\u2019t need to rush out to see the latest films from Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Colin Farrell, Emma Stone, Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Nicole Kidman or even Meryl Streep, as they\u2019re all easily accessible at home.</p> <p>While Netflix original movies started out with relatively smaller stars, over time they have managed to lure bigger names and their forthcoming slate, including films starring <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/chris-evans-red-sea-diving-resort-bought-by-netflix-1203141274/\">Chris Evans</a>, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/film/news/ryan-reynolds-michael-bay-6-underground-netflix-movie-1203087558/\">Ryan Reynolds</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfr44G1KJmc\">Robert De Niro</a>, <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2018/10/netflix-panama-papers-movie-the-laundromat-david-schwimmer-steven-soderbergh-gary-oldman-meryl-streep-antonio-banderas-1202479036/\">Meryl Streep</a> and <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/film/news/anne-hathaway-dee-rees-last-thing-he-wanted-netflix-1202821078/\">Anne Hathaway</a>, is as high wattage as that of any studio.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s proving to be an unusually cold summer in Hollywood, a sun-drenched town suddenly facing a rather worrying frost. Ever since the 70s, it\u2019s a time of year that has brought with it huge profitability, with studios unveiling their splashiest and starriest offerings but this year, toasting success has been replaced with analysing failure, a string of underperformers raising a number of uncomfortable questions. Aside from a legitimate discussion over franchise fatigue, there\u2019s another debate that rages on: what is a \u201cmovie star\u201d in 2019? Last weekend resulted in a rather nasty box office bloodbath that left a pricey reboot and a glossy sequel battered and bruised. Men in Black: International, a $110m attempt to resurrect a franchise that had lain dormant since 2012, scored the lowest opening of the series to date with just $30m stateside despite a hefty $120m spend on promotions and advertising and the pairing of Avengers: Endgame stars Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth. Further down the chart, an attempt to revive Shaft, last seen in 2000, was an unmitigated disaster, making less then $9m (less than half of what the last outing could muster on its first weekend) despite boasting another Marvel stalwart, Samuel L Jackson, to hand over the torch to his on-screen son. The same weekend also saw Emma Thompson and Mindy Kaling\u2019s comedy Late Night crash and burn weeks after an underwhelming result for Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson\u2019s Dirty Rotten Scoundrels remake The Hustle and middling returns for Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron\u2019s romcom Long Shot. The summer has also seen other bigger failures (including big-budget bombs Godzilla: King of Monsters and Dark Phoenix) but what ties all of these together is that they relied heavily on star power to sell tickets. Even though Men in Black is an established property, it\u2019s not really lingered in the pop culture lexicon since its third outing and while Thompson has the bigger role, it was the shoulders of the more established Hemsworth that the film\u2019s success was resting on. But despite being known as the god of thunder, Hemsworth has struggled to make much work outside of the Marvel universe with Blackhat, Rush, 12 Strong and In the Heart of the Sea all doing bad to adequate business. And even a more tested draw like Jackson couldn\u2019t sell the latest Shaft film, a failure that was at least somewhat predicted by backers New Line who sold the non-US rights to the film to Netflix, where it will premiere at the end of the month. It has become a far safer home for stars, a development confirmed once again this past weekend. Because while audiences shunned big stars on the big screen, they chose to stream them at home instead with the Friday release of Adam Sandler/Jennifer Aniston comedy Murder Mystery breaking a major Netflix record. The film, an engaging Agatha Christie homage, was reportedly consumed by 30m households worldwide in its first few days, with more than 13m accounts residing in the US. If we\u2019re using the average US movie ticket price of $9.11, this would mean the equivalent box office would be around $121m, although if each household represented at least two tickets then it would be double or more. Now when talking about Netflix viewership, especially when statistics are coming from Netflix themselves without independent verification, a handful of salt is always recommended. But there\u2019s no denying that however it\u2019s spun, more people saw Murder Mystery than anything at the cinema over the weekend. Obviously, the investment is far easier, with the consumption of Murder Mystery not requiring anything more than a click, but what\u2019s interesting is how its success proves that movie stars do continue to wield power just not in the way we\u2019re traditionally used to seeing. The last 12 months have seen a number of major stars stumble. Keanu Reeves couldn\u2019t push sci-fi thriller Replicas over a miserable $4m total, Matthew McConaughey failed to make The Beach Bum, White Boy Rick or Serenity appealing to audiences, Will Ferrell\u2019s Holmes and Watson (a film Sony allegedly regretted so much they tried to unsuccessfully sell it to Netflix) couldn\u2019t make back its $40m globally, Steve Carell wasn\u2019t enough to save Welcome to Marwen from a $60m loss, Mark Wahlberg didn\u2019t prove a draw for action flick Mile 22, Charlize Theron\u2019s Tully was a disappointment, but not quite as bad as her Gringo, while pretty much no one wanted to see Jake Gyllenhaal and Joaquin Phoenix as The Sisters Brothers. Yet on Netflix, stars who haven\u2019t had the most consistent track record have excelled. Action thriller Triple Frontier was seen by a reported 52m accounts in its first four weeks meaning an unqualified success for star Ben Affleck, Sandra Bullock\u2019s meme-friendly horror Bird Box had 45m streams in its first week while back in 2016 Sandler\u2019s first Netflix original The Ridiculous 6 became their most watched film within less than a month. His old-fashioned eight-movie deal was seen as a particularly important game-changer, and it\u2019s one that I believe will continue to have a profound impact on how stars find security within the industry. While he became known as one of the most bankable comedy stars in Hollywood with hits like The Waterboy and 50 First Dates, Sandler\u2019s magic faded over time and he made the smart decision to transport his brand to the small screen, to a less discerning audience far more willing to spend an evening with him. His Netflix output has been largely rubbished by critics but that has made zero impact on reach. He has become part of their stable in the kind of deal that movie stars might have found easier to secure in the golden age but one thathas become harder to nab in riskier times. While not locked down in the same way, Bullock has also decided to reteam with Netflix to produce sci-fi adventure Reborn while Gyllenhaal, who has starred in both Okja and Velvet Buzzsaw for the platform, will see his next film, the video game adaptation The Division, also head straight to stream. The success of Murder Mystery also owes a great deal to Aniston, a star who maintains a foothold in the industry and within public consciousness without really finding projects that seem to attract the requisite audience. Given the incredible second life that Friends has found on Netflix, who recently paid a whopping $100m to keep showing it for an extra year, and her role in their fauxspirational comedy Dumplin\u2019, she has become a tried and tested draw for them and her role in Apple\u2019s glossy new comedy show implies a major strategic change on her part, a second life that she\u2019s struggled to find on the big screen. The mass exodus of stars from cinema to TV has meant that we don\u2019t need to rush out to see the latest films from Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Colin Farrell, Emma Stone, Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Nicole Kidman or even Meryl Streep, as they\u2019re all easily accessible at home. While Netflix original movies started out with relatively smaller stars, over time they have managed to lure bigger names and their forthcoming slate, including films starring Chris Evans, Ryan Reynolds, Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway, is as high wattage as that of any studio. This year has brought some theatrical success stories, but they have rarely relied on big names to attract crowds, instead sold on either the horror genre (films such as Ma, Us, Pet Sematary and The Curse of La Llorona continue to make big bucks from small budgets) or property pre-awareness (Marvel hits such as Avengers: Endgame or Captain Marvel or remakes like Aladdin). This weekend is set to show both of these learnings to be true once again, with tracking suggesting big numbers for both horror remake Child\u2019s Play and Disney sequel Toy Story 4 (it\u2019s no coincidence Disney is having a record year given that it\u2019s a studio whose successes aren\u2019t star-led). And in forthcoming weeks, hits are predicted in the shape of the horror sequel Annabelle Comes Home, Marvel adventure Spider-Man: Far From Home and Disney remake The Lion King. Sandler\u2019s Netflix deal, initially scoffed at by many, may well become a much-desired solution for stars who want to keep making mainstream movies for an audience that will actually sit down and watch them.

The best counter to the Downtonisation of cinema is Kind Hearts and Coronets, from 1949, in which ex-draper Louis D\u2019Ascoyne Mazzini murders the seven people (all played by Alec Guinness) standing between him and a dukedom. This adaptation of Roy Horniman\u2019s Edwardian novel Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal was not on-message at the time. To fit with the postwar Britain of the NHS, state education and nationalisation, Louis should have sought to string up all aristos by their entrails for a more egalitarian Britain, rather than terminating those between him and the ducal crown.</p> <p>But in any case the leading role of the underclass in British cinema is not to get on, but to be ruthlessly erased. In Peter Watkins\u2019 Culloden, based on John Prebble\u2019s Fire and Sword trilogy, the Duke of Cumberland\u2019s men butcher the retreating Highlanders on the road to Inverness.</p> <p>In Douglas McGrath\u2019s 1996 adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s Emma , Harriet Smith and her schoolfriend Miss Bickerton go out for a walk and are importuned by gypsies in the woods. Miss Bickerton sprints off, but Harriet suffers cramp from the previous night\u2019s dancing at the Crown Ball (we\u2019ve all been there, right?) and is left to the gypsies\u2019 mercies. Harriet gives them a shilling, but they demand more. Just then Ewan McGregor\u2019s Frank Churchill arrives on a horse, rescues Harriet and transports her to Hartfield where, her exposure to rustic roughnecks mingling with erotic flutterings for her hero, she faints.</p> <p>It is striking that Fellowes sets his Downton Abbey film in 1927 \u2013 a time when the stately homes of England and the gentry were under threat as never before. Increasingly, the greatest houses were being bought for the National Trust, the organisation founded in 1895 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/06/past.housing\" title=\"\">Octavia Hill</a>, a devotee of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/aug/30/john-ruskin-artists-victorian-social-critic\" title=\"\">John Ruskin</a>, who believed beauty should be for everyone. But that egalitarian sensibility is not shared by all. The same year Fellowes got his peerage, the conservative philosopher Roger Scruton gave the Gifford lectures in Edinburgh, arguing: \u201cThe parks and houses preserved by the National Trust owe their beauty to the patterns of ownership that the Trust itself destroys.\u201d</p> <p>Scruton suggests that presenting the aristocracy\u2019s ancestral seats as museums for the plebs is a betrayal of lordly spirit. What has this got to do with Hugh Bonneville\u2019s stewardship of Downton? Think of it this way: it is only a matter of time before he is obliged to flog his ancient birthright to the National Trust or English Heritage.</p> <p>What remains after such an aristocratic yard sale is to muse nostalgically on what was lost. Downton Abbey, and so much of Britain\u2019s cinema, asserts that upstairs and downstairs must be kept apart for the national good. At the same time, this cinema proselytises for the return of the old order, a golden age where everyone knew their place and we were happy to abase ourselves before our betters, even if they were drunk, stupid and inbred.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a4f070ec2440f10941ad91f36a1bdadecd7a6c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a4f070ec2440f10941ad91f36a1bdadecd7a6c2/0_0_1834_1204/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gwyneth Paltrow and Toni Collette in Emma.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gwyneth Paltrow and Toni Collette in Emma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Miramax</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scruton gives gloss to this when he writes that the philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/23/in-praise-of-john-locke\" title=\"\">John Locke</a> believed the mix of labour with the things of the earth is the justification for private property.

It is a plan so monstrous, so expensive, so disruptive and so archaic as to beggar belief. No city in the developed world would think of increasing flights over its built-up area by 700 planes a day. None would think of jamming its busiest stretch of urban motorway for a decade, consuming 1,000 acres of greenbelt land and building the world\u2019s largest car park (for 50,000 vehicles), all in an area already intolerable with congestion, aircraft noise levels and illegal air pollution \u2013 and all at a time of mounting concern over climate change.</p> <p>Heathrow\u2019s managers rival Johnson for pledge-busting.

Two years ago a former transport minister, Stephen Hammond, said the infrastructure cost to the Treasury, such as for tunnelling the M25, might be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/26/heathrows-third-runway-public-bill-hidden-tory-mp-stephen-hammond-taxpayer-cost\" title=\"\">as high as \u00a310bn</a>.

Its director, Syima Aslam, pointed out that 51% of the audience for the south Asian, Muslim-led festival last year were from BAME backgrounds, with 61% from families with a household income of less than \u00a340,000.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf441d102994d0ff4e8b544ed1d4cac9c1487206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf441d102994d0ff4e8b544ed1d4cac9c1487206/0_354_5315_3189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The festival\u2019s director, Syima Aslam.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The festival\u2019s director, Syima Aslam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lorne Campbell/Guzelian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBLF\u2019s work in Bradford spans all communities particularly those which are the most disadvantaged,\u201d the organisers said in a statement. \u201cThe BSBT programme is a broad initiative, working with communities across the board. For us, in the context of this festival, the focus of the BSBT work has been on promoting the value of education and the importance of literacy, which is central to the ethos of this festival.\u201d</p> <p>But Manzoor-Khan said literary festivals should not be framed as encouraging Muslims \u201cto work on themselves\u201d as part of a government programme.

      "bodyText": "Six writers and activists have pulled out of the Bradford literature festival (BLF) in protest after it emerged it received funding from a government counter-extremism programme. The group withdrew from planned appearances after learning that the 10-day event, which was founded in 2014, has accepted money provided as part of the Home Office\u2019s counter-extremism strategy for the first time. The Home Office programme, Building a Stronger Britain Together (BSBT), provides \u201cfunding and support for groups involved in counter-extremism projects in their communities\u201d. Separate to the counter-terrorism Prevent strategy, BSBT is part of the 2015 counter-extremism strategy and funds more than 230 groups. The Bradford-born poet Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan, who was the first to withdraw, said the government strategy treated all Muslims as potential criminals and that she could not endorse community organisations working with counter-extremism funding and support. \u201cIt is not the fault of practitioners that there have been cuts to community spaces,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cI want to make a broader point about accepting money from a government who could choose to end austerity, but instead awards money to Muslim or BAME communities under a counter-extremism lens.\u201d The others to boycott the festival, due to start next weekend, are Lola Olufemi, Waithera Sebatindira, Malia Bouattia, Sahar al-Faifi and Hussein Kesvani. The organisers of the festival said they regretted the withdrawal of the artists but defended the use of the funding to run a pre-festival education project focused on raising aspirations and literacy levels. Its director, Syima Aslam, pointed out that 51% of the audience for the south Asian, Muslim-led festival last year were from BAME backgrounds, with 61% from families with a household income of less than \u00a340,000. \u201cBLF\u2019s work in Bradford spans all communities particularly those which are the most disadvantaged,\u201d the organisers said in a statement. \u201cThe BSBT programme is a broad initiative, working with communities across the board. For us, in the context of this festival, the focus of the BSBT work has been on promoting the value of education and the importance of literacy, which is central to the ethos of this festival.\u201d But Manzoor-Khan said literary festivals should not be framed as encouraging Muslims \u201cto work on themselves\u201d as part of a government programme. She pointed out that much of her work, including This is Not a Humanising Poem, which went viral in 2017, criticised the government\u2019s counter-extremism agenda and Islamophobia. In a statement, she wrote that she was \u201calarmed\u201d to learn of the funding source, saying it undermined the festival\u2019s aims of inclusivity. She said the government\u2019s counter-extremism strategy \u201crelies on the premise that Muslims are predisposed to violence and therefore require monitoring and surveillance\u201d. Bouattia, a former president of the National Union of Students, said she had been invited to discuss a chapter she had contributed to the anthology It\u2019s Not About the Burqa, which explicitly discusses the \u201cdestructive effect\u201d of counter-extremism funding on Muslim political spaces. Faifi said she could not endorse a strategy that had demonised Muslim communities, adding: \u201cI really hope that BLF will not receive this funding in future as we need such cultural festivals that celebrate diversity and inclusivity.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cIt is disappointing that some individuals are seeking to undermine and misrepresent the incredibly valuable work done in communities by our Building a Stronger Britain Together partners. \u201cBSBT is an open and transparent programme, which supports local people in their vital work to bring communities together, promote fundamental values and tackle the spread of all extremist ideologies.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Rutte, who described himself as a \u201ccertified Anglophile\u201d, said: \u201cIf nothing is happening?

      "bodyText": "A pharmacy chain has apologised after a woman was refused emergency contraception because the pharmacist said it went against her personal beliefs. Siani, 41, who did not want to give her surname, pre-ordered and paid for contraception online through the Lloyds Pharmacy website. After arriving at a branch in Brighton to collect the medication, the pharmacist told her the product was ready but that she would not dispense it for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d. The pharmacist did not disclose the reasons and was the only staff member in the store at the time. Despite being assured online that she could collect from any outlet, Siani was told to either return the next day or go to the nearest open branch \u2013 10 miles away in Newhaven. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that\u2019s really offering an acceptable alternative at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m shocked that a big company like Lloyds can discriminate against women by having their only branch in the city that\u2019s open on a Sunday staffed by a lone pharmacist who won\u2019t dispense women\u2019s services.\u201d Siani said she did not want to \u201cgo after\u201d an individual for her beliefs but thought it was \u201creally important that women\u2019s access to reproductive health services isn\u2019t obstructed, and a big company like Lloyds ought to ensure that they make reasonable accommodation to ensure that if people won\u2019t dispense some medicines, they have other staff available who will.\u201d Lloyds Pharmacy said it was looking into the incident and admitted there was \u201cmore the pharmacist could have done for the patient\u201d. A spokesperson said the company encouraged pharmacists to use professional judgment but expected them to follow General Pharmaceutical Council guidelines on the application of personal beliefs. These guidelines specify that pharmacists are obliged to \u201crecognise their own values and beliefs but \u2026 not impose them on other people\u201d and \u201ctake responsibility for ensuring that person-centred care is not compromised because of personal values and beliefs\u201d. The spokesperson apologised for \u201cthe distress and frustration\u201d caused by the incident and said the company had reached out to Siani to ensure she had received the support she needed. Mandu Reid, leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party, expressed concern and said \u201cwomen\u2019s reproductive rights are under threat the world over\u201d. \u201cIt is not the decision of individual pharmacists to dictate women\u2019s reproductive rights. I would expect the pharmacist to be sanctioned in the same way as if they denied any other health treatment or medicine,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "British arms sales to Saudi Arabia have been ruled unlawful by the court of appeal in a critical judgment that also accused ministers of ignoring whether airstrikes that killed civilians in Yemen broke humanitarian law. Three judges said that a decision made in secret in 2016 had led them to decide that Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt and Liam Fox and other key ministers had illegally signed off on arms exports without properly assessing the risk to civilians. Sir Terence Etherton, the master of the rolls, said on Tuesday that ministers had \u201cmade no concluded assessments of whether the Saudi-led coalition had committed violations of international humanitarian law in the past, during the Yemen conflict, and made no attempt to do so\u201d. As a result, the court said that the UK export licensing process was \u201cwrong in law in one significant respect\u201d and ordered Fox, the international trade secretary, to hold an immediate review of at least \u00a34.7bn worth of arms deals with Saudi Arabia. Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), which brought the case against Fox, welcomed the verdict that continuing to license military equipment for export to the Gulf state was unlawful. Thousands of civilians have been killed since the civil war in Yemen began in March 2015 with indiscriminate bombing by a Saudi-led coalition that is supplied by the west and accused of being responsible for about two-thirds of the 11,700 killed in direct attacks. A critical passage in the ruling added that \u201ca close reading\u201d of evidence supplied in secret suggested that in \u201cearly 2016\u201d \u2013 probably when David Cameron was prime minister \u2013 that there had been a covert change of UK policy towards Saudi Arabia. \u201cThere was a decision, or a change of position, so that there would be no assessment of past violation of IHL [international humanitarian law]\u201d by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, Etherton, Lord Justice Irwin and Lord Justice Singh concluded. Dr Anna Stavrianakis, a senior lecturer in international relations at the University of Sussex, said the verdict demonstrated that ministers had \u201cturned a blind eye\u201d to events in Yemen. \u201cThis finally bring some accountability to the UK\u2019s role in the war,\u201d she added. Fox responded by suspending new arms sales to Saudi Arabia while promising to appeal against the verdict. Labour called for an full inquiry and the permanent end of all arms sales to Riyadh. The international trade secretary made an emergency statement to MPs in which he argued that the court had not determined whether it was ethical to sell arms to Saudi Arabia, but \u201cconcerns the rationality of the process used to reach decisions\u201d. Fox added: \u201cWhile we do this, we will not grant any new licences for export to Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners which might be used in the conflict in Yemen.\u201d Later, Fox was understood to have privately told at least one MP that he expected that the review process called for by the court would take about 10 weeks \u2013 and would not lead to any of the previous licensing decisions being overturned. Arms trade campaigners say that Paveway, Brimstone and Storm Shadow bombs of the type used by the Saudi air force in Yemen are covered by separate \u201copen licences\u201d, which have not been suspended by Fox, and are only under review. \u201cThe bombs will continue,\u201d one source added. Arms export licensing decisions of the type held to be unlawful are made by Fox, as international trade secretary, on the advice of the foreign secretary, an office currently held by Hunt and previously by Johnson.

The Regeni family and Ballerini said the Egyptian authorities were instead focused on intimidating their legal team in Cairo.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an outrageous and disturbing attitude,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAt this point the only possible step is to withdraw the ambassador.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Egyptian ministry of foreign affairs repeatedly declined to respond when contacted by the Guardian to ask about the Regenis\u2019 comments.</p> <p>Maha Ahmed, of the Cairo-based Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, is under investigation and risks imprisonment, according to the ECRF. The commission tracks enforced disappearances like Regeni\u2019s, while some of their employees act as the Regeni family\u2019s Egyptian legal counsel.</p> <p>\u201cWith Maha, they are repeating the same scenario as Amal Fathy,\u201d said Mohammed Lotfy, the executive director of ECRF. Lotfy\u2019s wife, Amal Fathy, was arrested during a dawn raid at their home last May and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/27/egyptian-sexual-harassment-activist-amal-fathy-released\">imprisoned until December</a>, accused of a range of charges including \u201cspreading false news\u201d and membership of a terrorist group.</p> <p>Lotfy and the ECRF believe the Egyptian authorities are seeking to prevent them from working on the Regeni case by intimidating ECRF employees and their family members. \u201cI think the message is clear: take your hands off the case or else you\u2019ll get hurt,\u201d said Lotfy, adding that Ahmed\u2019s husband, Mohammed Helw, was one of the ECRF lawyers granted power of attorney by the Regeni family.</p> <p>An ECRF researcher, Ibrahim Ezz El Din, was <a href=\"https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/ecrf-researcher-ibrahim-ezz-el-din-detained-unknown-location\">forcibly disappeared</a> a week ago. A team headed by Sherif Magdy Abdel Al, an Egyptian National Security Agency official, arrested a second lawyer, Haitham Mohamedeen, on 13 May. Abdel Al is one of five Egyptian NSA members <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/29/giulio-regeni-murder-italy-names-egyptian-national-security-agents-suspects\">named</a> by Italian prosecutors last November as suspects in Regeni\u2019s disappearance.</p> <p>Italian officials are continuing to maintain pressure on Egypt. \u201cGiulio\u2019s parents will not be alone,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/roberto.fico.5/\">wrote</a> the Ppresident of the Italian parliament, Roberto Fico, in a statement on Facebook. \u201cNext week we will talk about Giulio with the German Bundestag: Giulio was not in fact just an Italian researcher, but a European one. It is a matter that concerns and must concern all the countries of the union.\u201d</p> <p>Italian prosecutors confirmed they had requested further evidence from their Egyptian counterparts after a new witness came forward testifying that one of the five accused men was overheard discussing Regeni\u2019s kidnapping at an African security conference in 2017.</p> <p>The Rome prosecutor Sergio Colaiocco, who is leading the investigation into Regeni\u2019s murder, said: \u201cWe have sent the authorities in Cairo an international rogatory [letter of request]. We can\u2019t disclose its contents. But we can say that our request is related to the new witness and that we\u2019ve had no answer since then.\u201d</p> <p>The ECRF believes that the Egyptian authorities are unwilling to shed light on Regeni\u2019s case owing to what it could reveal about the widespread practice of enforced disappearances in the country, where civilians are covertly arrested without legal representation or access to their families. The ECRF documented 230 cases of enforced disappearances between August 2017 and September last year.</p> <p>\u201cThe authorities say there are no enforced disappearances in Egypt,\u201d said Lotfy. \u201cYet while we are working on the case of a forcibly disappeared Italian researcher in Egypt, they forcibly disappear one of our staff members working on one of the most important cases,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re unafraid of public opinion. They want the world to believe what cannot be believed.\u201d </p>",

Regeni\u2019s mutilated body was found on an outlying Cairo desert highway in February that year, eight days after he disappeared while researching trade unions in Egypt. An Italian autopsy found his corpse bore the hallmarks of torture, and there were widespread suspicions that Egyptian officials were responsible. An Italian ambassador returned to Egypt in August 2017 in an effort to \u201creinforce judicial cooperation and as a consequence the search for the truth,\u201d according to the then foreign minister, Angelino Alfano. But in the two years since, Italian officials have accused their Egyptian counterparts of impeding their investigation and of failing to provide vital evidence that could show how Regeni disappeared and who was responsible for his death. The Regeni family and Ballerini said the Egyptian authorities were instead focused on intimidating their legal team in Cairo. \u201cThis is an outrageous and disturbing attitude,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAt this point the only possible step is to withdraw the ambassador.\u201d A spokesman for the Egyptian ministry of foreign affairs repeatedly declined to respond when contacted by the Guardian to ask about the Regenis\u2019 comments. Maha Ahmed, of the Cairo-based Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, is under investigation and risks imprisonment, according to the ECRF. The commission tracks enforced disappearances like Regeni\u2019s, while some of their employees act as the Regeni family\u2019s Egyptian legal counsel. \u201cWith Maha, they are repeating the same scenario as Amal Fathy,\u201d said Mohammed Lotfy, the executive director of ECRF. Lotfy\u2019s wife, Amal Fathy, was arrested during a dawn raid at their home last May and imprisoned until December, accused of a range of charges including \u201cspreading false news\u201d and membership of a terrorist group. Lotfy and the ECRF believe the Egyptian authorities are seeking to prevent them from working on the Regeni case by intimidating ECRF employees and their family members. \u201cI think the message is clear: take your hands off the case or else you\u2019ll get hurt,\u201d said Lotfy, adding that Ahmed\u2019s husband, Mohammed Helw, was one of the ECRF lawyers granted power of attorney by the Regeni family. An ECRF researcher, Ibrahim Ezz El Din, was forcibly disappeared a week ago. A team headed by Sherif Magdy Abdel Al, an Egyptian National Security Agency official, arrested a second lawyer, Haitham Mohamedeen, on 13 May. Abdel Al is one of five Egyptian NSA members named by Italian prosecutors last November as suspects in Regeni\u2019s disappearance. Italian officials are continuing to maintain pressure on Egypt. \u201cGiulio\u2019s parents will not be alone,\u201d wrote the Ppresident of the Italian parliament, Roberto Fico, in a statement on Facebook. \u201cNext week we will talk about Giulio with the German Bundestag: Giulio was not in fact just an Italian researcher, but a European one. It is a matter that concerns and must concern all the countries of the union.\u201d Italian prosecutors confirmed they had requested further evidence from their Egyptian counterparts after a new witness came forward testifying that one of the five accused men was overheard discussing Regeni\u2019s kidnapping at an African security conference in 2017. The Rome prosecutor Sergio Colaiocco, who is leading the investigation into Regeni\u2019s murder, said: \u201cWe have sent the authorities in Cairo an international rogatory [letter of request]. We can\u2019t disclose its contents. But we can say that our request is related to the new witness and that we\u2019ve had no answer since then.\u201d The ECRF believes that the Egyptian authorities are unwilling to shed light on Regeni\u2019s case owing to what it could reveal about the widespread practice of enforced disappearances in the country, where civilians are covertly arrested without legal representation or access to their families. The ECRF documented 230 cases of enforced disappearances between August 2017 and September last year. \u201cThe authorities say there are no enforced disappearances in Egypt,\u201d said Lotfy. \u201cYet while we are working on the case of a forcibly disappeared Italian researcher in Egypt, they forcibly disappear one of our staff members working on one of the most important cases,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re unafraid of public opinion. They want the world to believe what cannot be believed.\u201d",

Gove said he was \u201cabsolutely delighted\u201d to come second. The environment secretary tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s all to play for in the final ballot this afternoon. If I make the final two I look forward to having a civilised debate of ideas about the future of our country.\u201d A member of his camp said: \u201cWe are in a strong position to make the final two, where we can have a civilised debate in the country.\u201d The result is a blow for Hunt, with backers of the foreign secretary seeking to immediately rally support for him. Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, said Hunt being in the final two would avoid the drama of a new showdown between Johnson and Gove, who fell out over the 2016 leadership battle. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the best entertainment for journalists, but for people who are going to focus on the issues, the policies, and set out a vision for the party,\u201d she said. A source in the Hunt camp said: \u201cBoris and Michael are great candidates but we have seen their personal psychodrama before: it\u2019s time to offer the country someone the EU will actually talk to.\u201d One of the challenges for Johnson will be to convince Tory members he is serious about making Brexit happen on 31 October. On Thursday, Johnson was formally endorsed by London\u2019s Evening Standard, edited by the remain-backing former chancellor, George Osborne, with an editorial in the newspaper predicting that Johnson would end up persuading the Commons to \u201cvote for a repacked version of the existing deal\u201d. In a verdict unlikely to go down well among hard Brexiters \u2013 or Johnson\u2019s camp \u2013 the editorial noted that he had pointedly not completely guaranteed an exit on 31 October, and was the candidate with the most room to manoeuvre. Theresa May is travelling to Brussels for a European council summit and will miss the second vote. She has entrusted a proxy vote to Charles Walker, the acting co-chair of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, which is organising the contest. During the two-hour voting process, Javid arrived with a series of MPs who have supported him and they posed for a photo in the corridor near the committee room 14, where the voting took place. Javid told reporters he was hopeful of progressing. His exit from the race follows that of Rory Stewart, the international development minister, in the third round of voting on Wednesday. In the previous round, Dominic Raab came last and went out. Esther McVey, Mark Harper and Andrea Leadsom failed to reach the necessary vote threshold in the first round, while the health secretary, Matt Hancock, later withdrew.",

      "body": "<p>In the summer, my family and I took the ferry to France instead of flying off to warmer climes. We eat much less meat nowadays and we\u2019re saving to buy an electric car. But in the midst of a worldwide climate crisis, can my choices really make a difference?</p> <p>The short answer is: of course. The view that the choices we make as consumers don\u2019t affect our planet\u2019s health is increasingly considered both untrue and irresponsible; take the plastic bag charge or the rollout of smart meters, for example. Both rely on seemingly small adjustments to everyday life that, when enacted en masse, lead to something greater: the plastic bag charge has greatly reduced plastic waste, whereas smart meters help to make the energy system more responsive. Both signal a sea change in how we\u2019re engaging with the climate crisis.</p> <p>In 2017, my daughter and I founded Plastic Clever Salcombe, a child-led campaign to encourage the switch to reusables in my Devon hometown. Not only have 60% of Salcombe\u2019s businesses now reached \u201cplastic clever\u201d status, but our schools workshops have had positive ripple effects: parents proudly tell me they\u2019ve been told off for wrapping their child\u2019s sandwich in clingfilm or have discovered a new range of eco-cleaning products. Tiny changes, yes, but significant? In terms of public engagement, it\u2019s a big yes.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a real step change over the past two years in environmental awareness,\u201d says Emily Armistead, deputy programme director at Greenpeace UK. \u201cThe massive rise in activism is a defining moment for us in the battle to combat climate change.\u201d Greenpeace UK\u2019s climate emergency petition was its fastest-growing ever, accumulating 416,000 signatures in just under a month, while the charity\u2019s total number of supporters globally has risen by 20% to 1.26 million in recent years.</p> <p>This is crucial, says Armistead, because \u201cour actions make the most impact when recognised by those in power as a demand for further action \u2013 when our small actions help open up the political space for greater action.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We all have a part to play in changing our culture</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Alice Bell, co-director of charity 10:10 Climate Action, agrees that we have to act socially to cut carbon emissions. \u201cWe all have a part to play in changing our culture,\u201d she says. Take cutting down flying: we can amplify our efforts by talking about our decision, sharing images on social media of the train journey we have taken instead; doing what we can to create a cultural shift. Consider Greta Thunberg. Last August, the Swedish schoolgirl began a school strike to demand action on climate change \u2013 in March this year, 1.6 million young people around the globe followed suit. \u201cIt was a social act,\u201d says Bell. \u201cShe sat in a public place, she wrote a sign so people would engage and she spoke about what she was doing.\u201d</p> <p>So while we can all be catalysts for change, we don\u2019t exist in a vacuum; we are part of a complex ecosystem \u2013 and so advocacy is key. \u201cIf we want to make the changes we need, at the speed we need to do it,\u201d says Bell, \u201cwe have to be clever about how change happens.\u201d For Bell, that means a simultaneous bottom-up, top-down approach: making individual efforts while pressuring governments to make large-scale legislative change.</p> <p>Cardiff University\u2019s Prof Lorraine Whitmarsh, who has spentfive years working on the <a href=\"http://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/caspi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Low Carbon Lifestyles and Behavioural Spillover programme</a>, agrees: \u201cPolicymakers don\u2019t feel they have the mandate to take ambitious action unless there\u2019s grassroots demand for it. Equally, a top-down approach makes it easier for everybody to do things substantially differently.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://climateoutreach.org/resources/mainstreaming-low-carbon-lifestyles/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Studying 7,000 people across seven countries</a>, Whitmarsh explored the idea that taking up one eco-behaviour, such as recycling, may lead to another, such as eating less meat. The report concluded that any spillover depends on motivation: if a person <em>wants</em> to make that first shift, they\u2019re more likely to make further positive changes than if told to do so. Crucially, spillover only occurs when the similarities between behaviours are recognised as all contributing to a low-carbon lifestyle. Hence the importance of both advocacy and reinforcing positive social norms.</p> <p>While the report acknowledges that no lifestyle is identical, and not all changes are possible, it highlights five key \u201cbehaviours\u201d that can be adopted when working towards a low-carbon lifestyle. Civic action and political engagement is key, but four other everyday areas are also emphasised: transport, at best living car-free and avoiding air travel; diet, cutting down meat and dairy; \u201cinvestment decisions\u201d, such as opting for energy-efficient appliances; and household energy choices, including installing intelligent thermostats and smart meters.</p> <p>It takes, therefore, a myriad approach for change to reach a tipping point. Just as attitudes towards smoking changed, there\u2019s been a shift in opinion towards electric vehicles (EVs). In the Norwegian capital, Oslo, a combination of government policy \u2013 from VAT exemption to fast-charging stations \u2013 and municipal initiatives such as free parking and access to bus lanes \u2013 means that every third new car sold is battery powered.</p> <p>Here in the UK, transport accounted for <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmsctech/1454/145408.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a><a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmsctech/1454/145408.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">7% of the UK\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2018</a>, according to provisional figures. \u201cThanks to legislation, we are phasing out conventional vehicles and the number [of EVs] is increasing rapidly,\u201d says Whitmarsh. \u201cPeople are talking about their next car being an electric car, so we\u2019re on the cusp of change.\u201d</p> <p>George Marshall, founder of Climate Outreach, is an expert on attitudes to the climate crisis. \u201cWe can achieve substantial and sustained behaviour changes when people [make] those changes as part of their own identities,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you are consciously engaged, talking about what you have done can double or triple the impact.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/smarter-energy/2019/jun/14/think-outside-the-compost-box-10-small-steps-that-have-a-big-environmental-impact\">Think outside the compost box: 10 small steps that make a big environmental impact</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since UK households account for 18% of the UK\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions, we can all take steps to create a lower-carbon society \u2013 then use our voices and social influence to amplify the positive impact of our actions on the environment. In other words, be the change, and shout about it.</p> <p><em>Part of Britain\u2019s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network \u201csmarter\u201d \u2013 implementing digital tech to make our energy system more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed.

      "bodyText": "In the summer, my family and I took the ferry to France instead of flying off to warmer climes. We eat much less meat nowadays and we\u2019re saving to buy an electric car. But in the midst of a worldwide climate crisis, can my choices really make a difference? The short answer is: of course. The view that the choices we make as consumers don\u2019t affect our planet\u2019s health is increasingly considered both untrue and irresponsible; take the plastic bag charge or the rollout of smart meters, for example. Both rely on seemingly small adjustments to everyday life that, when enacted en masse, lead to something greater: the plastic bag charge has greatly reduced plastic waste, whereas smart meters help to make the energy system more responsive. Both signal a sea change in how we\u2019re engaging with the climate crisis. In 2017, my daughter and I founded Plastic Clever Salcombe, a child-led campaign to encourage the switch to reusables in my Devon hometown. Not only have 60% of Salcombe\u2019s businesses now reached \u201cplastic clever\u201d status, but our schools workshops have had positive ripple effects: parents proudly tell me they\u2019ve been told off for wrapping their child\u2019s sandwich in clingfilm or have discovered a new range of eco-cleaning products. Tiny changes, yes, but significant? In terms of public engagement, it\u2019s a big yes. \u201cThere has been a real step change over the past two years in environmental awareness,\u201d says Emily Armistead, deputy programme director at Greenpeace UK. \u201cThe massive rise in activism is a defining moment for us in the battle to combat climate change.\u201d Greenpeace UK\u2019s climate emergency petition was its fastest-growing ever, accumulating 416,000 signatures in just under a month, while the charity\u2019s total number of supporters globally has risen by 20% to 1.26 million in recent years. This is crucial, says Armistead, because \u201cour actions make the most impact when recognised by those in power as a demand for further action \u2013 when our small actions help open up the political space for greater action.\u201d Alice Bell, co-director of charity 10:10 Climate Action, agrees that we have to act socially to cut carbon emissions. \u201cWe all have a part to play in changing our culture,\u201d she says. Take cutting down flying: we can amplify our efforts by talking about our decision, sharing images on social media of the train journey we have taken instead; doing what we can to create a cultural shift. Consider Greta Thunberg. Last August, the Swedish schoolgirl began a school strike to demand action on climate change \u2013 in March this year, 1.6 million young people around the globe followed suit. \u201cIt was a social act,\u201d says Bell. \u201cShe sat in a public place, she wrote a sign so people would engage and she spoke about what she was doing.\u201d So while we can all be catalysts for change, we don\u2019t exist in a vacuum; we are part of a complex ecosystem \u2013 and so advocacy is key. \u201cIf we want to make the changes we need, at the speed we need to do it,\u201d says Bell, \u201cwe have to be clever about how change happens.\u201d For Bell, that means a simultaneous bottom-up, top-down approach: making individual efforts while pressuring governments to make large-scale legislative change. Cardiff University\u2019s Prof Lorraine Whitmarsh, who has spentfive years working on the Low Carbon Lifestyles and Behavioural Spillover programme, agrees: \u201cPolicymakers don\u2019t feel they have the mandate to take ambitious action unless there\u2019s grassroots demand for it. Equally, a top-down approach makes it easier for everybody to do things substantially differently.\u201d Studying 7,000 people across seven countries, Whitmarsh explored the idea that taking up one eco-behaviour, such as recycling, may lead to another, such as eating less meat. The report concluded that any spillover depends on motivation: if a person wants to make that first shift, they\u2019re more likely to make further positive changes than if told to do so. Crucially, spillover only occurs when the similarities between behaviours are recognised as all contributing to a low-carbon lifestyle. Hence the importance of both advocacy and reinforcing positive social norms. While the report acknowledges that no lifestyle is identical, and not all changes are possible, it highlights five key \u201cbehaviours\u201d that can be adopted when working towards a low-carbon lifestyle. Civic action and political engagement is key, but four other everyday areas are also emphasised: transport, at best living car-free and avoiding air travel; diet, cutting down meat and dairy; \u201cinvestment decisions\u201d, such as opting for energy-efficient appliances; and household energy choices, including installing intelligent thermostats and smart meters. It takes, therefore, a myriad approach for change to reach a tipping point. Just as attitudes towards smoking changed, there\u2019s been a shift in opinion towards electric vehicles (EVs). In the Norwegian capital, Oslo, a combination of government policy \u2013 from VAT exemption to fast-charging stations \u2013 and municipal initiatives such as free parking and access to bus lanes \u2013 means that every third new car sold is battery powered. Here in the UK, transport accounted for 27% of the UK\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, according to provisional figures. \u201cThanks to legislation, we are phasing out conventional vehicles and the number [of EVs] is increasing rapidly,\u201d says Whitmarsh. \u201cPeople are talking about their next car being an electric car, so we\u2019re on the cusp of change.\u201d George Marshall, founder of Climate Outreach, is an expert on attitudes to the climate crisis. \u201cWe can achieve substantial and sustained behaviour changes when people [make] those changes as part of their own identities,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you are consciously engaged, talking about what you have done can double or triple the impact.\u201d Since UK households account for 18% of the UK\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions, we can all take steps to create a lower-carbon society \u2013 then use our voices and social influence to amplify the positive impact of our actions on the environment. In other words, be the change, and shout about it. Part of Britain\u2019s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network \u201csmarter\u201d \u2013 implementing digital tech to make our energy system more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed. By collecting data on our energy use through smart meters, our network can better understand, plan for and balance out peaks and troughs in demand, making it easier to integrate renewable energy sources.

      "bodyText": "What is the best way of wrecking a city? Pour cars into it. Heavy traffic, 50 years of research shows, breaks up communities, disrupts social life and crushes local cultures. Noise drowns out conversation and drives people indoors. Pollution makes streets inhospitable. Cars take up the space that might have been used for children to play, adults to meet, and local projects to grow. Street life is treated as an impediment to traffic. In cities all over the world it has been cleared for cars. Stalls, hawkers, football and cricket games, old people playing dominoes, chess or p\u00e9tanque: all must make way for the car. So much land is required for driving and parking that there is little left for human life. In cities like Barcelona that curb traffic, cars use about 25% of the urban area. In cities like Houston that don\u2019t, they use 60%. The car eats the public space that could otherwise become parks, cycle lanes, markets and playgrounds. Land Rover\u2019s new advertisements for its Range Rover Evoque create the opposite impression: that this ridiculous gas guzzler contributes to urban culture. The Evoque is marketed as \u201cthe Range Rover for the city\u201d, which sounds like a contradiction: SUVs like this were originally designed for dirt roads in the countryside. But now, according to the agency behind this revolting campaign, we are invited to use it to \u201cexplore your city\u201d and create your own \u201curban adventures\u201d. One of the ads features the supermodel Adwoa Aboah driving through Brixton, staring at the interesting street life as if on a human safari and talking about its \u201camazing soul and rhythm \u2026 People here are real\u201d. It gives the impression the car is passing through market streets where traffic is prohibited. Why? Because these are the places with the most \u201camazing soul and rhythm\u201d. She also drives down Brixton Road, one of the most polluted streets in London. All the Evoque models have higher nitrogen oxide emissions than the average for new cars (and much higher CO2 emissions). The Evoque\u2019s sole contribution to Brixton\u2019s streetlife is likely to consist of accelerating the deaths of some of the \u201creal\u201d people it passes. Air pollution is now believed to kill more people than smoking. Across Europe it\u2019s estimated to cause the premature deaths of 800,000 people a year. Every week, cars here kill far more people than the entire toll of the Chernobyl disaster. Air pollution damages hearts and lungs, causes a wide range of cancers, and damages the health of unborn children. It can radically reduce intelligence, as a result of oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. So along comes Land Rover, not only promoting a polluting SUV as a city car, but suggesting it should be used for fun: to kerb-crawl through congested streets gawping at the human zoo. SUVs are killing machines: because they are higher and heavier, you are more likely to die if you are hit by one than if you are struck by an ordinary car. The fashion for SUVs is one of the two main reasons for rising road deaths among pedestrians (the other is drivers using mobile phones). They are likely to be especially dangerous if you use them for human game drives, rather than watching the road. Another of the ads urges drivers to \u201cSet off on an adventure. Discover Edinburgh, one of the UK\u2019s most forward-thinking cities\u201d. A forward-looking city should ban such cars from its streets. Land Rover\u2019s advertising agency promises to roll out this campaign across the world, naming cities in South Africa, China and Colombia. Wherever interesting urban cultures persist, a Range Rover will plough through them. These ads are horribly reminiscent of the commercial Jeep tours through Rio\u2019s favelas. Residents say the tours make them feel humiliated and objectified. The tourists sit behind the car windows, safely removed from the natives, filming exotic poverty as they are driven past people\u2019s homes. They also remind me of Volkswagen\u2019s disgusting adverts last year, which asked: \u201cLooking to boost your school gate credibility? Our Tiguan has been voted one of the coolest cars for dads on the school run.\u201d Poisoning children by driving a monster SUV to the school gate is, in my view, about the least cool thing a parent could do. These ads help to normalise antisocial \u2013 even pathological \u2013 behaviour. Just as we need to radically reduce the use of cars, for the sake of both human health and planetary survival (the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has just announced a car-free day in September to highlight this need), the manufacturers seek to drag us back into the 20th century. In his book Unlocking Sustainable Cities, Paul Chatterton argues that controlling the car is the first and most important step towards creating friendly and vibrant cities. He points to the work of architects such as Jan Gehl \u2013 who seek to reclaim the space now captured by cars, to allow \u201clife between buildings\u201d to flourish. Neither electric cars nor driverless cars will solve our problems. They take up as much space as fossil-powered vehicles. Electric cars are already triggering a series of environmental disasters, due to the rush for lithium, cobalt and nickel required to make their batteries. Driverless cars are likely to exacerbate congestion and accelerate climate breakdown, because of the energy demands of the data centres required to control them. It makes far more sense to build electrified mass transit. But those whose profits depend on urban carmageddon go to great lengths to thwart it. In the United States, Americans for Prosperity, a group founded and funded by the Koch brothers, has set up campaigns to fight new bus and light-rail schemes. It has managed to stop public transport systems in several states. The Kochs made much of their vast fortune from oil refining and asphalt production. Another planned advertisement for the Evoque, this time in Chicago, crudely defines the conflict. In Land Rover\u2019s words, \u201cThe Evoque will literally climb on top of the covered entrance to a busy transit station.\u201d The safari theme continues: the new Range Rover poses on top of the public transport system like a hunter with his foot on a slaughtered lion. In A Tale of Two Cities, Charles Dickens wrote of \u201cthe fierce patrician custom of hard driving\u201d. As aristocrats raced heedlessly through the streets of Paris in their carriages, everyone else had to jump out of the way or perish.

      "bodyText": "The outsourcing firm Serco was awarded new contracts to house vulnerable asylum seekers despite having been fined nearly \u00a37m for previous failings, the Guardian can reveal. Responsibility for housing people seeking asylum in the UK was taken away from local authorities in 2012 and given to the companies Serco, G4S and Clearsprings under deals with the Home Office known as Compass contracts. Despite concerns by leading charities that outsourcing the service had resulted in \u201csqualid, unsafe, slum housing conditions\u201d, in January the Home Office awarded Serco, Clearsprings and the company Mears new contracts to provide housing for asylum seekers for 10 years from September. Figures released following freedom of information requests and a parliamentary question show that \u00a36.8m worth of \u201cservice credits\u201d were imposed on Serco between April 2013 and December 2018. The figures do not include the month of March 2016. Service credits are sums deducted from a company\u2019s monthly invoice when it fails to meet key performance indicators included in its contract, such as property standards or how quickly issues are resolved. Serco was fined a total of \u00a32.8m for its contracts to provide asylum seeker housing in Scotland and Northern Ireland over that period, and just over \u00a34m for its contract in north-west England.

Most of these fines (\u00a31.7m) were incurred in 2013/14. Clearsprings, which manages asylum accommodation in Wales and south-west England and London and the south-eaast, was not fined, despite also being criticised over standards of accommodation.

      "bodyText": "More children may die in the detention of the US government unless Congress passes a $4.6bn emergency fund for immigration services at the US-Mexico border, the head of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has warned. John Sanders, CBP\u2019s acting commissioner, blamed the rising number of deaths of child migrants in US detention on a lack of federal funding to care for them, in an interview with the Associated Press. Referring to the death last month of Carlos Hernandez Vasquez, a 16-year-old from Guatemala who contracted the flu but was kept on a concrete bench in a cell, the border patrol chief said: \u201cThe death of a child is always a terrible thing, but here is a situation where, because there is not enough funding \u2026 they can\u2019t move the people out of our custody.\u201d At least seven migrant children have died in US custody since late 2018, as a combination of policies spearheaded by Donald Trump as part of his much-vaunted immigration crackdown have led to scenes of chaos and meltdown at the border. Children and families are being held for days longer than the 72 hours allotted in grossly overcrowded facilities in which medical provisions are scanty at best. Outcry erupted this week after a migrant teen was found to be nursing her premature baby in a Texas border patrol facility without proper neonatal care. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Texas criticized Trump for showing disregard for families with children, saying \u201cno human being should be held in the overcrowded and deplorable conditions that plague CBP holding facilities\u201d. Despite the growing evidence of extreme conditions and hardship at US border facilities, Trump appears to have no concerns and has vowed to step up the chaos. On Monday, he tweeted that agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) would next week begin a mass roundup of \u201cmillions\u201d of undocumented families including children \u2013 a move that could only increase pressure on overwhelmed federal services. Trump has heaped all responsibility for the crunch on his Democratic opponents in Congress, for their resistance to his demands for funding for his determined efforts to build a border wall. But all indications suggest that the president\u2019s crackdown has been self-defeating \u2013 the number of families with children turning up at the US border largely from Central America has shot up, in direct proportion to Trump\u2019s threats. Last month CBP arrested more people at the US border than at any time since 2007. There were 132,887 arrests in May, of whom 11,507 were children traveling on their own. At the time of Carlos\u2019 death, CBP was detaining about 2,500 children, Sanders told AP. That was out of a total of 15,000 migrant detainees \u2013 almost four times the federal agency\u2019s capacity. As the wrangling continues, experts on childhood trauma are becoming increasingly alarmed about the effect that prolonged detention in ill-equipped and overcrowded facilities will have on thousands of child migrants. They arrive at the border already often weak and traumatised, having fled gang violence and other extreme conditions in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras before making the long and perilous journey north. Last week, the advocacy group Physicians for Human Rights reported that Trump\u2019s immigration stance was compounding the children\u2019s trauma. \u201cChildren are being met at the US border with harsh, punitive policies that both violate their rights and severely affect their wellbeing,\u201d the group said.

Not only are Togo neighbours, they are also the side who profited when Benin collapsed to a 5-2 defeat in Mali on the last day of qualifying for the 2017 finals. So when Emmanuel Adebayor drew the visitors level in the 72nd minute in March, Benin fans must have feared missing out again. Mouni\u00e9 banished those thoughts by scoring in the 83rd minute, sealing second place in a group behind Algeria and a triumph that, he says, speaks volumes for the progress made by his team.</p> <p>\u201cAs professionals you have to turn pressure into positive pressure and, if you can do that, you will have a great performance,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like maybe one year ago we would have conceded a second goal and lost that match but this time we were very calm. We knew we would not accept losing this game. Experience is important.\u201d</p> <p>If Mouni\u00e9 will provide a goal threat in Egypt, so too will St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon, the 35-year-old former Sunderland and West Bromwich Albion forward who needs one goal to become his country\u2019s all-time top scorer. Sess\u00e8gnon is suspended for Benin\u2019s opening game. Mouni\u00e9, though, says his country have plenty of other players who could make names for themselves.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not well known and some of the players don\u2019t play in the best divisions but they deserve to play at a higher level,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel we will surprise a lot of people in this competition. And if some clubs take an interest they could get bargains!\u201d The Spanish side Alav\u00e9s have already signed the centre-back Olivier Verdon from Sochaux.</p> <p>Mouni\u00e9 is so enthused about the talent in his country that he is setting up an academy. \u201cIf you have the structure, the pitch, all the good things with which to work, then you can make great players who could play in any league in the world.\u201d He is also creating another foundation \u201cjust to give \u2013 to use my influence and the money I earn to try to help people in my country.\u201d</p> <p>That is for the future. For now Mouni\u00e9 and his teammates want their performances on the pitch to give a little joy to their people. At the start of this campaign the Benin football federation mooted changing the national team\u2019s nickname to something more fearsome before deciding that was unnecessary. \u201cWe have qualified and some other big animals have not,\u201d says Mouni\u00e9. \u201cSo we will keep this nickname. It\u2019s part of our history. We are the squirrels. And squirrels are strong.\u201d</p>",

Experience is important.\u201d If Mouni\u00e9 will provide a goal threat in Egypt, so too will St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon, the 35-year-old former Sunderland and West Bromwich Albion forward who needs one goal to become his country\u2019s all-time top scorer. Sess\u00e8gnon is suspended for Benin\u2019s opening game. Mouni\u00e9, though, says his country have plenty of other players who could make names for themselves. \u201cWe are not well known and some of the players don\u2019t play in the best divisions but they deserve to play at a higher level,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel we will surprise a lot of people in this competition. And if some clubs take an interest they could get bargains!\u201d The Spanish side Alav\u00e9s have already signed the centre-back Olivier Verdon from Sochaux. Mouni\u00e9 is so enthused about the talent in his country that he is setting up an academy. \u201cIf you have the structure, the pitch, all the good things with which to work, then you can make great players who could play in any league in the world.\u201d He is also creating another foundation \u201cjust to give \u2013 to use my influence and the money I earn to try to help people in my country.\u201d That is for the future. For now Mouni\u00e9 and his teammates want their performances on the pitch to give a little joy to their people. At the start of this campaign the Benin football federation mooted changing the national team\u2019s nickname to something more fearsome before deciding that was unnecessary. \u201cWe have qualified and some other big animals have not,\u201d says Mouni\u00e9. \u201cSo we will keep this nickname. It\u2019s part of our history. We are the squirrels. And squirrels are strong.\u201d",

Philippe Zdar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Foc Kan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
      "body": "<p>Philippe Zdar knew about the beauty of chance moments. On his first day as a tea boy at Studio Marcadet on the outskirts of Paris in the late 1980s, he earned respect when it turned out that, improbably, he was the only person present who knew how to roll a spliff. On his third day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jane-birkin\">Jane Birkin</a> came to record, before a performance that night. She was suffering from chronic back pain and required a cortisone shot that nobody knew how to administer. The show would be cancelled if she didn\u2019t get it. Zdar, fresh from his national service stint as an army nurse, volunteered to inject her. You can picture the scene: French music veterans holding their breath as a young scrapper performs DIY medicine on a national icon. It worked: the show went on, and studio owner Dominique Blanc-Francard hired the young Zdar.</p> <p>After providing nascent productions for French rapper MC Solaar alongside Hubert Blanc-Francard (AKA Boom Bass), Zdar had a revelation on a dancefloor: in December 1992, he took ecstasy at a rave and realised he had to pursue his love of Detroit techno and Chicago house. He was encouraged by an offer from James Lavelle of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/12/mo-wax-james-lavelle-trip-hop\">Mo\u2019 Wax</a> to release his and Blanc-Francard\u2019s Solaar productions as instrumental tracks. In 1994, the pair released two influential EPs of house, techno, hip-hop and breakbeat as La Funk Mob, before forming Cassius. Zdar also formed Motorbass with \u00c9tienne de Cr\u00e9cy, and helped define the sample-heavy, filtered take on house that would become known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/nov/18/10-best-french-touch-daft-punk-st-germain-motorbass\">French touch</a>. But he turned down label deals, and remained sceptical of the scene and the speed with which this new sound coalesced into cliche.</p> <p>His core project became Cassius, who created one of the defining French touch tracks: 1999, anchored by a voluptuous disco bassline amid a tornado of ghostly vocal samples. But Cassius were so much bigger than that one track: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrU2DThhsZI\">Feeling for You</a> struck a chord with UK garage fans, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfnPCymwl9k\">The Sound of Violence</a> showed the breadth of their ambition, bringing in rock dynamics that would inspire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/justice\">Justice</a> (and the bloghouse wave, and later EDM) and David Guetta to pursue that combination, albeit to very different ends.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PmU6G_Z4n8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_PmU6G_Z4n8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>An incident in the midst of this scene could have nixed what would become Zdar\u2019s most fruitful collaboration outside of Cassius. At a party at cult Paris boutique Colette, he spied the four young men of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/phoenix\">Phoenix</a> lingering in a hallway, and the two parties took an instant dislike to one another, assuming arrogant dispositions. Yet, his interest piqued by their demos, Zdar agreed to parachute in and attempt to save the disintegrating recording sessions for the group\u2019s debut album in 1999. The record, United, was rescued and a brotherhood was born, fully flourishing a decade later when Zdar co-produced the group\u2019s breakout album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/22/phoenix-wolfgang-amadeus-review-alexis-petridis\">Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</a>. That wasn\u2019t the plan: he had lent Phoenix his studio \u2013 literally a building site at the time \u2013 to work on the record at their leisure. As Zdar popped in and out to collect records for DJ slots, he offered the band transformative bits of advice. They asked him to come on board properly. The album became an era-defining smash and won the 2010 Grammy award for best alternative album.</p> <p>When I interviewed Zdar this year, he reflected on the moment they were told that the album had gone gold after Phoenix\u2019s headline performance at New York City\u2019s vast Madison Square Garden arena. He was incredulous that music had taken him from his childhood as a Sex Pistols-obsessed drummer in the Savoie region of the western Alps, where he was born Philippe Cerboneschi, to making a record that prompted his other childhood heroes the Beastie Boys to ask him to produce their next album.

      "bodyText": "Philippe Zdar knew about the beauty of chance moments. On his first day as a tea boy at Studio Marcadet on the outskirts of Paris in the late 1980s, he earned respect when it turned out that, improbably, he was the only person present who knew how to roll a spliff. On his third day, Jane Birkin came to record, before a performance that night. She was suffering from chronic back pain and required a cortisone shot that nobody knew how to administer. The show would be cancelled if she didn\u2019t get it. Zdar, fresh from his national service stint as an army nurse, volunteered to inject her. You can picture the scene: French music veterans holding their breath as a young scrapper performs DIY medicine on a national icon. It worked: the show went on, and studio owner Dominique Blanc-Francard hired the young Zdar. After providing nascent productions for French rapper MC Solaar alongside Hubert Blanc-Francard (AKA Boom Bass), Zdar had a revelation on a dancefloor: in December 1992, he took ecstasy at a rave and realised he had to pursue his love of Detroit techno and Chicago house. He was encouraged by an offer from James Lavelle of Mo\u2019 Wax to release his and Blanc-Francard\u2019s Solaar productions as instrumental tracks. In 1994, the pair released two influential EPs of house, techno, hip-hop and breakbeat as La Funk Mob, before forming Cassius. Zdar also formed Motorbass with \u00c9tienne de Cr\u00e9cy, and helped define the sample-heavy, filtered take on house that would become known as French touch. But he turned down label deals, and remained sceptical of the scene and the speed with which this new sound coalesced into cliche. His core project became Cassius, who created one of the defining French touch tracks: 1999, anchored by a voluptuous disco bassline amid a tornado of ghostly vocal samples. But Cassius were so much bigger than that one track: Feeling for You struck a chord with UK garage fans, and The Sound of Violence showed the breadth of their ambition, bringing in rock dynamics that would inspire Justice (and the bloghouse wave, and later EDM) and David Guetta to pursue that combination, albeit to very different ends. An incident in the midst of this scene could have nixed what would become Zdar\u2019s most fruitful collaboration outside of Cassius. At a party at cult Paris boutique Colette, he spied the four young men of Phoenix lingering in a hallway, and the two parties took an instant dislike to one another, assuming arrogant dispositions. Yet, his interest piqued by their demos, Zdar agreed to parachute in and attempt to save the disintegrating recording sessions for the group\u2019s debut album in 1999. The record, United, was rescued and a brotherhood was born, fully flourishing a decade later when Zdar co-produced the group\u2019s breakout album, Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix. That wasn\u2019t the plan: he had lent Phoenix his studio \u2013 literally a building site at the time \u2013 to work on the record at their leisure. As Zdar popped in and out to collect records for DJ slots, he offered the band transformative bits of advice. They asked him to come on board properly. The album became an era-defining smash and won the 2010 Grammy award for best alternative album. When I interviewed Zdar this year, he reflected on the moment they were told that the album had gone gold after Phoenix\u2019s headline performance at New York City\u2019s vast Madison Square Garden arena. He was incredulous that music had taken him from his childhood as a Sex Pistols-obsessed drummer in the Savoie region of the western Alps, where he was born Philippe Cerboneschi, to making a record that prompted his other childhood heroes the Beastie Boys to ask him to produce their next album. To his immense pride, they had recognised how he mixed heavy bass with airy lightness on Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix. That night, he said, he was so overwhelmed that he had to go and drink alone in a bar, weeping into his whisky. It is not hard to see why Phoenix and the Beastie Boys \u2013 and a list of collaborators not limited to Cat Power, Kanye West, Franz Ferdinand, Pharrell Williams, Hot Chip, Kindness, OneRepublic and Fatboy Slim \u2013 wanted to work with Zdar. As well as being a veritable Zelig of French music innovation at the turn of the century, from rap to electro-rock, he was, to hear his peers describe him, the epitome of the bon viveur, a man of such precise taste that he could recommend the best kind of pepper and who maintained a fridge stacked with champagne even while the rest of his studio was a safety hazard. He bought the studio, which he renamed Motorbass, in 2000, and demolished everything but the vintage equipment to prevent himself from getting comfortable \u2013 going a step too far when he smashed the toilet and realised that it was probably an essential item, offensive design or not. Everything he earned he put back into rebuilding the studio, importing the wood used to make Gibson guitars and stone from Java to improve the acoustics. Unsurprisingly, the studio is now renowned among musicians for the elegance of its design and rarity of its analogue equipment. Zdar\u2019s joie de vivre was equally evident in his music. Cassius\u2019s records were bumptious and bright, and in the 2000s they sampled Tom Z\u00e9, and made the unlikely yet brilliant move of recasting Cat Power as a diva house vocalist on their 2016 album Ibifornia. Zdar\u2019s dedication to pleasure stemmed from two things, he told me: losing his father as a child, and surviving cancer in his 20s. After that, he decided life was for eating well (more than one profile of Zdar describes his refined sweet tooth), celebrating family and friends, and taking a holiday whenever he deemed it necessary for his process.

      "bodyText": "Relatives and former students of the late Mexican artist Frida Kahlo have dismissed claims that a recently discovered recording could be the only surviving trace of her voice. Last week, the National Sound Library of Mexico unearthed what it said could be audio of Kahlo reading from her essay portraying her husband, the fellow artist Diego Rivera. The recording, made for the 1955 radio show El Bachiller, aired a year after Kahlo died in 1954. In the clip, a female voice is heard describing Rivera as resembling an \u201cenormous, immense child with a friendly face and a sad gaze\u201d. The problem, according to Kahlo\u2019s descendants, is that the voice is not hers. \u201cAs far as Kahlo family knows, there are no records of Frida\u2019s voice,\u201d they said in a statement. They also pointed out that one of the artist\u2019s students, Arturo Estrada Hern\u00e1ndez, had also said the voice on the recording was not Kahlo\u2019s. Another former student, Guillermo Monroy Becerril \u2013 who remembers his friend and teacher as \u201ca dazzling, optimistic woman dedicated to painting\u201d \u2013 said he did not recognise the voice either. Monroy told the Spanish news agency Efe he and his friends had practically lived with Kahlo at the Casa Azul, her family home in Mexico City. \u201cThe thing is, I don\u2019t recognise the voice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first time I met her, I noticed she was a woman with a very sweet, cheerful voice \u2026 Frida\u2019s real voice was very lively, charming, and cheery. It wasn\u2019t serious or smooth or delicate \u2026 it was crystal clear.\u201d A Mexican actor believes the recording is actually of her voice, and was made in 1953 or 1954. Amparo Garrido, who gave the voice to Snow White when Disney\u2019s 1937 film was dubbed into Spanish in the 1960s, told the Mexican radio station Radio F\u00f3rmula: \u201cI feel it\u2019s me and have for a while. I recorded various things for El Bachiller \u2026 I\u2019m almost absolutely sure that I recorded this one.\u201d Garrido\u2019s children also say they recognised their mother\u2019s voice in the clip.

The Ladbrokes owner GVC, William Hill, Bet365, the Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment and Sky Bet have told the government that they would be willing to increase the voluntary levy they pay from 0.1% of annual UK revenue to 1% within five years. Critics of the levy have said the \u00a310m it raises is not nearly enough to help tackle problem gambling and that some firms get away with paying nothing, leading to calls from politicians, charities and the industry regulator for a mandatory tax. The extra contribution offered by the five largest operators would yield \u00a360m, based on the Guardian\u2019s analysis of the UK earnings of the five companies. The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, said: \u201cI want the gambling industry to step up on social responsibility and keep their players safe, including through making more funding available for research, education and treatment to tackle problem gambling. \u201cProtecting people and their families from the risks of gambling-related harm is a priority for this government and I am encouraged that the sector now recognises that they need to do more.\u201d A spokesperson for the five firms said they would lay out a plan by the end of the year to support a \u201crapid expansion\u201d of treatment for problem gamblers and ensure young and vulnerable people were protected. \u201cWe will continue to engage on the issues and will consult with all relevant stakeholders on this to understand how best to achieve our shared aim of minimising the impact of gambling-related harm,\u201d they said. The sports minister, Mims Davies, drew criticism earlier this year for saying that a mandatory levy was not required. But the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is understood to have been in talks with operators for some time about raising their contribution by other means. GVC said earlier this year it would voluntarily increase its levy contribution to 1% of revenue.

      "body": "<h2><strong>20. Blew (1989)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Along with Mudhoney\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O90gPI2hk90\" title=\"\">Sweet Young Thing Ain\u2019t Sweet No More</a>, Nirvana\u2019s second single defined the initial sound of grunge: deeply unfashionable early-70s heavy rock refracted through a punk lens, where sludgy riffs met Ramones-ish third wall breaking (\u201chere is another word that rhymes with shame\u201d) and a coda so repetitious it sounded as if the record were stuck.</p> \n<h2><strong>19. Territorial Pissings (1991)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>An excoriation of machismo and sexism, Nirvana tended to launch into the H\u00fcsker D\u00fc-ish Territorial Pissings on TV shows where they were expected to play their new single: from the baby boomer-baiting strangulated verse of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_inXx-J3nU\" title=\"\">the Youngbloods\u2019 Get Together</a> that opens it to its frenetic screamed coda, it\u2019s a glorious two fingers to the world.</p> \n<h2><strong>18. Lithium (1991)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>With the benefit of hindsight, perhaps it wasn\u2019t so surprising that Nevermind \u2013 an album packing choruses as air-punch-inducing as Lithium\u2019s cry of \u201cyeah!\u201d \u2013 became huge. Behind it, however, lurks an intriguingly equivocal song about the comforts of faith \u2013 not, it has to be said, a topic regularly addressed in the US post-punk underground whence Nirvana sprang.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkcJEvMcnEg\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pkcJEvMcnEg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch the video for Lithium\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>17. Rape Me (1993)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>It says something about Nirvana\u2019s skill that swathes of <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/nirvana-in-utero-trivia-kurt-cobain-722109/\" title=\"\">In Utero</a> deal with the usually dispiriting topic of a band complaining about their treatment by the press without slipping into sanctimonious <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0usvv2KTXgg\" title=\"\">Mr Writer</a>-ish finger wagging. Rape Me is a case in point. It sounds both horrified and resigned: a man who, by all accounts, had been very ambitious cautioning to be careful what you wish for.</p> \n<h2><strong>16. Sappy (1990-93)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Depending on your perspective, a song about Kurt Cobain\u2019s pet turtle or an abusive relationship, Sappy was an outtake that deserved better, something Nirvana knew, playing it live for years and recording it over and over before defeatedly slipping it out as a hidden track on a charity compilation. A posthumous remix included on the deluxe version of In Utero reveals its melancholy potency.</p> \n<h2><strong>15. Scentless Apprentice (1993)<br></strong></h2> \n<p>The comedian Billy Connolly once opined that the words \u201cgo away\u201d could never have the same impact as the words \u201cfuck off\u201d. He had clearly never heard the scourging din of Scentless Apprentice, on which Cobain\u2019s agonised screaming of the seemingly innocuous phrase offers a deeply disturbing insight into the singer\u2019s post-fame state of mind.</p> \n<h2><strong>14. Polly (1991)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>No song came to represent the gulf between Nirvana and some sections of their newfound audience quite as starkly as Polly, a horrifying depiction of a rape that <a href=\"http://wespeakmusic.tv/the-story-behind-polly-by-nirvana/\" title=\"\">ended up cited in an actual rape case</a>: its perpetrators sang it to their victim. The song itself is stark and acoustic: it rams its subject matter in the listener\u2019s face, rather than coating it in distortion and rock dynamics.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dcc6a1588cfcce3b3f8215685d3ca8455f35a84c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcc6a1588cfcce3b3f8215685d3ca8455f35a84c/0_150_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nirvana while on tour in Germany in 1991\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nirvana while on tour in Germany in 1991 (left to right): Dave Grohl, Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Bergen/Redferns</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>13. School (1989)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Given what happened to Cobain, there is an understandable tendency to look for angst throughout Nirvana\u2019s catalogue. But they had a goofy sense of humour, at least at first: School\u2019s power comes from the ridiculous level of import the music\u2019s heaviness lends a lyric about getting a job as a janitor at your former alma mater, and envying the students\u2019 break time.</p> \n<h2><strong>12. Something in the Way (1991)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>The title of Nevermind\u2019s most poignant track turned <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelDrZ1aFeY\" title=\"\">the Beatles\u2019 most ardent love song</a> into a reference to an obstruction. Its lyrics offered the stark image of a homeless person dying, unnoticed, under a tarpaulin by a river, the music was hushed and haunting, Cobain\u2019s voice barely rising above a murmur.</p> \n<h2><strong>11. Been a Son (1989)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>No one, least of all Nirvana themselves, could have predicted Nevermind\u2019s success, but with hindsight, their early catalogue is sprinkled with suggestions that they were not the same as their grunge peers, among them the B-side Been a Son: a study of teenage alienation and gender that dispenses with the heaviness of Bleach in favour of a simple, relentless, unforgettable melody.</p> \n<h2><strong>10. Drain You (1991)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Kurt Cobain claimed Drain You was the equal of \u201cor better than\u201d Smells Like Teen Spirit, and he had a point: another in his line of slightly warped love songs, it shifts from a sparkling verse to an extended, improvised and faintly psychedelic interlude, by way of squeaky toys and aerosols being sprayed, and ends with one of Cobain\u2019s most startling screams. Dave Grohl compared it to Bohemian Rhapsody, which is perhaps pushing it a bit.</p> \n<h2><strong>9. Dumb (1993)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Typically, In Utero\u2019s calmest moment is a troubled paean to drugged-out indolence: the lyrics alternate between a kind of glassy-eyed transcendence and a fretful acknowledgment that the only time the narrator is happy is when they\u2019re stoned, their gathering darkness scratching at the sweetness of the tune and the simplicity of the arrangement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhcttcXcRYY\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AhcttcXcRYY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch a performance of About a Girl from 1993\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>8. About a Girl (1989)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>The highlight of debut album Bleach was a step away from the emotional terrain mined by, say, Nirvana\u2019s Sub Pop labelmates Mudhoney: they tended to deal in hedonism and alienation, but About a Girl was a surprisingly sweet and earnest love song that betrayed Cobain\u2019s love of tuneful-but-rickety British indie pop.</p> \n<h2><strong>7. Where Did You Sleep Last Night? (1993, released 1994)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Nirvana were always catholic in their choice of covers, but an unexpected, desolate version of traditional folksong <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MkfTYPmLlA\" title=\"\">In the Pines</a> is the most extraordinary, largely because of Cobain\u2019s vocal, which begins as a faltering mumble and ends up operating at a level of emotional intensity that\u2019s just shy of unbearable.</p> \n<h2><strong>6. Aneurysm (1991)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Bafflingly relegated to B-side status, Aneurysm is every bit the equal of anything on Nevermind: a lyric that could be about blooming love or blossoming addiction, set to ferocious drumming and walls of noisy guitar, the harmony vocals on the coda fighting against the ongoing din. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvwqSMRtoSI\" title=\"\">live version from 1992\u2019s Reading festival</a> is particularly fraught and gripping.</p> \n<h2><strong>5. Sliver (1990)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Nirvana\u2019s improbable rise in a nutshell. Sliver was the first track that really pointed the way to Nevermind, a gleeful retelling of a childhood visit to Cobain\u2019s grandparents in which throat-shredding vocals meet a glorious tune and Nirvana\u2019s celebrated, Pixies-inspired quiet/loud dynamic. But it was meant as a joke, a \u201cridiculous pop song\u201d recorded in an hour during labelmates <a href=\"https://www.subpop.com/artists/tad\" title=\"\">Tad</a>\u2019s lunch break.</p> \n<h2><strong>4. In Bloom (1991)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>The success of Nevermind made the lyrics of In Bloom seem weirdly and entirely unintentionally prescient: meant as a portrait of Cobain\u2019s friend <a href=\"https://thronesanddominions.com/dylan-carlson\" title=\"\">Dylan Carlson</a>, it ended up sounding like a howl of disgust at the more lumpen elements in Nirvana\u2019s new audience. The chorus, meanwhile, is the perfect example of Cobain\u2019s ability to conjure a simple but indelible melody.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hTWKbfoikeg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch the video for Smells Like Teen Spirit\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>3. Smells Like Teen Spirit (1991)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Overfamiliarity means it is hard to remember what an impact Teen Spirit had on release. In an era when major labels, big budgets and the quest for mainstream success almost invariably blunted an indie band\u2019s power, Nirvana, incredibly, seemed to have been vastly potentiated by the move, honing their sound and their songwriting without losing their individuality. Plus they had come up with one of the all-time great riffs.</p> \n<h2><strong>2. All Apologies (1993)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>A heartbreaking counterpoint to the anguish and noise elsewhere on In Utero, All Apologies was written in 1990, but tellingly exhumed after Nirvana hit big. It feels acquiescent, defeated, the sound of a man crushed by fame. There\u2019s no getting around the fact the lyrics read like a suicide note \u2013 \u201ceverything\u2019s my fault\u201d \u2013 although there is also a faint suggestion of a happier ending: \u201cIn the sun I feel as one.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6P0SitRwy8\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n6P0SitRwy8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch the video for Heart-Shaped Box\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>1. Heart-Shaped Box (1993)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>In Utero is an album whose reputation precedes it: an unsettling farewell note from a doomed man at the end of his tether; a noisy, wilfully unpalatable screw-you to anyone who wanted Nevermind II, Nirvana\u2019s horrified record company included. Those interpretations tend to overshadow the fact that it also represented a genuine musical progression. Heart-Shaped Box not only boasted one of Cobain\u2019s most haunting melodies, and some of his most disturbing lyrics \u2013 for some reason, its famous declaration of love, \u201cI wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black\u201d, has yet to be co-opted by the makers of Valentine cards \u2013 but also developed the band\u2019s trademark dynamic shifts: gradually ratcheting up the tension in the verses before the chorus explodes into jagged shards; nearly collapsing altogether after the guitar solo. Thrilling, white-knuckle listening.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "20. Blew (1989) Along with Mudhoney\u2019s Sweet Young Thing Ain\u2019t Sweet No More, Nirvana\u2019s second single defined the initial sound of grunge: deeply unfashionable early-70s heavy rock refracted through a punk lens, where sludgy riffs met Ramones-ish third wall breaking (\u201chere is another word that rhymes with shame\u201d) and a coda so repetitious it sounded as if the record were stuck. 19. Territorial Pissings (1991) An excoriation of machismo and sexism, Nirvana tended to launch into the H\u00fcsker D\u00fc-ish Territorial Pissings on TV shows where they were expected to play their new single: from the baby boomer-baiting strangulated verse of the Youngbloods\u2019 Get Together that opens it to its frenetic screamed coda, it\u2019s a glorious two fingers to the world. 18. Lithium (1991) With the benefit of hindsight, perhaps it wasn\u2019t so surprising that Nevermind \u2013 an album packing choruses as air-punch-inducing as Lithium\u2019s cry of \u201cyeah!\u201d \u2013 became huge. Behind it, however, lurks an intriguingly equivocal song about the comforts of faith \u2013 not, it has to be said, a topic regularly addressed in the US post-punk underground whence Nirvana sprang. 17. Rape Me (1993) It says something about Nirvana\u2019s skill that swathes of In Utero deal with the usually dispiriting topic of a band complaining about their treatment by the press without slipping into sanctimonious Mr Writer-ish finger wagging. Rape Me is a case in point. It sounds both horrified and resigned: a man who, by all accounts, had been very ambitious cautioning to be careful what you wish for. 16. Sappy (1990-93) Depending on your perspective, a song about Kurt Cobain\u2019s pet turtle or an abusive relationship, Sappy was an outtake that deserved better, something Nirvana knew, playing it live for years and recording it over and over before defeatedly slipping it out as a hidden track on a charity compilation. A posthumous remix included on the deluxe version of In Utero reveals its melancholy potency. 15. Scentless Apprentice (1993) The comedian Billy Connolly once opined that the words \u201cgo away\u201d could never have the same impact as the words \u201cfuck off\u201d. He had clearly never heard the scourging din of Scentless Apprentice, on which Cobain\u2019s agonised screaming of the seemingly innocuous phrase offers a deeply disturbing insight into the singer\u2019s post-fame state of mind. 14. Polly (1991) No song came to represent the gulf between Nirvana and some sections of their newfound audience quite as starkly as Polly, a horrifying depiction of a rape that ended up cited in an actual rape case: its perpetrators sang it to their victim. The song itself is stark and acoustic: it rams its subject matter in the listener\u2019s face, rather than coating it in distortion and rock dynamics. 13. School (1989) Given what happened to Cobain, there is an understandable tendency to look for angst throughout Nirvana\u2019s catalogue. But they had a goofy sense of humour, at least at first: School\u2019s power comes from the ridiculous level of import the music\u2019s heaviness lends a lyric about getting a job as a janitor at your former alma mater, and envying the students\u2019 break time. 12. Something in the Way (1991) The title of Nevermind\u2019s most poignant track turned the Beatles\u2019 most ardent love song into a reference to an obstruction. Its lyrics offered the stark image of a homeless person dying, unnoticed, under a tarpaulin by a river, the music was hushed and haunting, Cobain\u2019s voice barely rising above a murmur. 11. Been a Son (1989) No one, least of all Nirvana themselves, could have predicted Nevermind\u2019s success, but with hindsight, their early catalogue is sprinkled with suggestions that they were not the same as their grunge peers, among them the B-side Been a Son: a study of teenage alienation and gender that dispenses with the heaviness of Bleach in favour of a simple, relentless, unforgettable melody. 10. Drain You (1991) Kurt Cobain claimed Drain You was the equal of \u201cor better than\u201d Smells Like Teen Spirit, and he had a point: another in his line of slightly warped love songs, it shifts from a sparkling verse to an extended, improvised and faintly psychedelic interlude, by way of squeaky toys and aerosols being sprayed, and ends with one of Cobain\u2019s most startling screams. Dave Grohl compared it to Bohemian Rhapsody, which is perhaps pushing it a bit. 9. Dumb (1993) Typically, In Utero\u2019s calmest moment is a troubled paean to drugged-out indolence: the lyrics alternate between a kind of glassy-eyed transcendence and a fretful acknowledgment that the only time the narrator is happy is when they\u2019re stoned, their gathering darkness scratching at the sweetness of the tune and the simplicity of the arrangement. 8. About a Girl (1989) The highlight of debut album Bleach was a step away from the emotional terrain mined by, say, Nirvana\u2019s Sub Pop labelmates Mudhoney: they tended to deal in hedonism and alienation, but About a Girl was a surprisingly sweet and earnest love song that betrayed Cobain\u2019s love of tuneful-but-rickety British indie pop. 7. Where Did You Sleep Last Night? (1993, released 1994) Nirvana were always catholic in their choice of covers, but an unexpected, desolate version of traditional folksong In the Pines is the most extraordinary, largely because of Cobain\u2019s vocal, which begins as a faltering mumble and ends up operating at a level of emotional intensity that\u2019s just shy of unbearable. 6. Aneurysm (1991) Bafflingly relegated to B-side status, Aneurysm is every bit the equal of anything on Nevermind: a lyric that could be about blooming love or blossoming addiction, set to ferocious drumming and walls of noisy guitar, the harmony vocals on the coda fighting against the ongoing din. The live version from 1992\u2019s Reading festival is particularly fraught and gripping. 5. Sliver (1990) Nirvana\u2019s improbable rise in a nutshell. Sliver was the first track that really pointed the way to Nevermind, a gleeful retelling of a childhood visit to Cobain\u2019s grandparents in which throat-shredding vocals meet a glorious tune and Nirvana\u2019s celebrated, Pixies-inspired quiet/loud dynamic. But it was meant as a joke, a \u201cridiculous pop song\u201d recorded in an hour during labelmates Tad\u2019s lunch break. 4. In Bloom (1991) The success of Nevermind made the lyrics of In Bloom seem weirdly and entirely unintentionally prescient: meant as a portrait of Cobain\u2019s friend Dylan Carlson, it ended up sounding like a howl of disgust at the more lumpen elements in Nirvana\u2019s new audience. The chorus, meanwhile, is the perfect example of Cobain\u2019s ability to conjure a simple but indelible melody. 3. Smells Like Teen Spirit (1991) Overfamiliarity means it is hard to remember what an impact Teen Spirit had on release. In an era when major labels, big budgets and the quest for mainstream success almost invariably blunted an indie band\u2019s power, Nirvana, incredibly, seemed to have been vastly potentiated by the move, honing their sound and their songwriting without losing their individuality. Plus they had come up with one of the all-time great riffs. 2. All Apologies (1993) A heartbreaking counterpoint to the anguish and noise elsewhere on In Utero, All Apologies was written in 1990, but tellingly exhumed after Nirvana hit big. It feels acquiescent, defeated, the sound of a man crushed by fame. There\u2019s no getting around the fact the lyrics read like a suicide note \u2013 \u201ceverything\u2019s my fault\u201d \u2013 although there is also a faint suggestion of a happier ending: \u201cIn the sun I feel as one.\u201d 1. Heart-Shaped Box (1993) In Utero is an album whose reputation precedes it: an unsettling farewell note from a doomed man at the end of his tether; a noisy, wilfully unpalatable screw-you to anyone who wanted Nevermind II, Nirvana\u2019s horrified record company included. Those interpretations tend to overshadow the fact that it also represented a genuine musical progression. Heart-Shaped Box not only boasted one of Cobain\u2019s most haunting melodies, and some of his most disturbing lyrics \u2013 for some reason, its famous declaration of love, \u201cI wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black\u201d, has yet to be co-opted by the makers of Valentine cards \u2013 but also developed the band\u2019s trademark dynamic shifts: gradually ratcheting up the tension in the verses before the chorus explodes into jagged shards; nearly collapsing altogether after the guitar solo. Thrilling, white-knuckle listening.",

      "bodyText": "A previously confidential government study detailing 142 areas of life in Northern Ireland that will be impacted by Brexit has been published, revealing risks to everything from cooperation on congenital heart disease and cross-border child protection to rules preventing the looting of national treasures. The study was published by the Brexit select committee after it was obtained by a member of the public via a freedom of information request. The so-called \u201cmapping exercise\u201d was conducted in autumn 2017 but never shared with the select committee despite repeated requests from the chairman, the Labour MP Hilary Benn. It shows that the consequences of Brexit are not exclusively related to trade and customs checks, the focus of arguments presented by hard Brexiters that ultimately led to the departure of Theresa May as prime minister. Among the areas identified are an all-Ireland congenital heart disease network \u201cto ensure that vulnerable children receive treatment on the island of Ireland\u201d. Some 46 of them are classed as \u201cnot underpinned or linked\u201d to an EU law but listed because of their link to the Good Friday Agreement or another area of cooperation between Ireland and the UK. \u201cThe network has a single surgical centre in Dublin and a specialist children\u2019s cardiology centre in Belfast, supported by cardiology expertise in local hospitals and an all-island academic programme which is under development,\u201d the 35-page document says. Other areas of cooperation across the island of Ireland that will be affected by Brexit include major emergencies and A&amp;E services, cancer research and health promotion. Also underpinned by the EU are everyday services such as the operation of cross-border taxis and mobile phone roaming services. Ireland\u2019 prime minister Leo Varadkar said: \u201cI\u2019m glad that it now has been [published] and it really sketches out the very large number of areas where there is north-south cooperation, co-operation between Northern Ireland and Ireland. That cooperation is so much deeper than trade issues it applies to so many other things. \u201c[The mapping exercise] really sketches out what the Good Friday Agreement is all about, which is power sharing in the north and increased co-operation north south and east west. So when we talk about avoiding a hard border and also protecting the Good Friday Agreement they are not the same thing. It is both of those things that we seek to protect.\u201d Repatriation of waste, the prevention of the spread of animal diseases such as BSE and TB, flood risk management, wildfire initiatives and horse racing are also listed in the study. The Brexit select committee said the list showed the extent to which cooperation on the island of Ireland was underpinned by the Good Friday agreement and \u201cthe extent to which each is underpinned by existing EU legal and policy frameworks\u201d. Among the most serious issues impacted by Brexit is cross-border policing. It is known that both the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) are concerned about the future of data sharing and potential difficulties in apprehending criminals who flee across the border in the absence of the European arrest warrant system. But the mapping exercise also lists \u201cliaison, training, disaster planning, joint investigations and communications\u201d. It also notes there is a cross-border agency on smuggling and tax evasion, involving the Irish Revenue Commissioners and HMRC. Nineteen areas are listed as \u201cavoiding a hard border\u201d and include everything from the central issues of customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures. The latter is governed by EU rules that \u201cstop national treasures from leaving the country and prevent illicit trafficking and looting\u201d. Movement of medicine across the island is also an issue as \u201cNorthern Ireland and Ireland is currently treated as a single entity by pharma and medical device companies\u201d, and will be subject to checks unless EU regulations apply. David Lidington, the de facto deputy prime minister, told Benn that the documents \u201cwere produced as part of a scoping exercise\u201d and were intended to form the basis of discussion and not to be published separately. The government has never published its full Brexit impact statement for Northern Ireland. The mapping exercise does not detail the contingencies for police or for the supply of energy, for example. At one point the government considered putting a flotilla of barges in the Irish Sea to deliver energy to Northern Ireland if it were to become cut off from the all-island energy grid. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are steadfast in our commitment to uphold the Belfast/Good Friday agreement throughout the Brexit process in all scenarios. \u201cThe mapping exercise was a factual discussion between the UK government, Northern Ireland Civil Service, European commission, and Irish government to map current north-south cooperation between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\u201d",

Our fate is left to a rabble of extreme rightwing revolutionary Tory members who will tear up everything in pursuit of an abstract ideological phantasm. They may look like deceptively normal Rotarians and golf-club members, pillars of their communities, but <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/news/104687/ruth-davidson-tells-tory-members-take-long\" title=\"\">YouGov finds them</a> eager to wreck the union: 63% glad to see Scotland go, 59% waving goodbye to Northern Ireland in order to see Brexit take place.

On Wednesday, on just one ordinary news day, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported UK teachers have the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jun/19/teachers-in-england-have-unmanageable-job-global-survey\" title=\"\">heaviest workloads</a>, bar Japan. The head of NHS England found the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/19/hospital-bed-cutbacks-have-gone-too-far-nhs-england-boss-simon-stevens-says\" title=\"\">10% cut in hospital beds</a> has been too many (who knew?).

Instead, its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/may/26/european-election-latest-results-2019-uk-england-scotland-wales-ni-eu-parliament\" title=\"\">14% showing in the EU elections</a>, behind the Lib Dems and only just beating the Greens, shows Brexit blows away everything else, trumping old party loyalties. Pointing to austerity\u2019s devastations doesn\u2019t summon back those lost Labour votes.</p> <p>Fence-sitting has been calamitous: YouGov shows Labour has lost <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/04/05/support-slides-simultaneously-labour-and-tories\" title=\"\">half its 2017 general election votes</a> \u2013 a third to remain parties and 11% to Brexit parties. As the YouGov founder Peter Kellner points out, an average of the last year\u2019s polls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/19/unite-country-brexit-labour-general-election\" title=\"\">shows a national swing</a> \u2013 with 44% backing leave and 56% remain. This is partly demographic (older, mainly leave, voters are dying while pro-remain teenagers reach voting age) but crucially the swing to remain is bolstered by Labour voters in the north and Midlands changing their minds.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/19/labour-mps-warn-corbyn-not-to-commit-to-second-brexit-referendum\" title=\"\">shadow cabinet meeting on Wednesday</a> responded slower than a slug, while Labour members agitate frantically for a rapid response U-turn. A report presented, purporting to show backing remain would lose more seats than fence-straddling, has been forensically dismantled by Kellner and by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lewis_baston/status/1141370825083359234\" title=\"\">psephologist Lewis Baston</a>. In virtually all leave constituencies, most Labour supporters voted remain: non-Labour supporters created leave majorities.</p> <p>Those at the meeting say the report cut no ice \u2013 and there was marked shift in attitudes: only Ian Lavery, the party chair who ignores party members, and Jon Trickett stayed adamant Brexiters with a new softening of opposition from the likes of Richard Burgon and Andrew Gwynne. The rest moved with Corbyn\u2019s confirmed position, to support a referendum. But that\u2019s only halfway. At next Tuesday\u2019s meeting, they will have to move to backing remain. Nothing else will do. Said one, \u201cHow do you back a referendum but when asked what Labour supports, reply \u2018We don\u2019t know\u2019. Ridiculous!\u201d</p> <p>Despite references to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/25/britains-1975-europe-referendum-what-was-it-like-last-time\" title=\"\">Harold Wilson in 1975</a> letting his divided party take opposite sides, that can\u2019t and won\u2019t happen this time. (Though Brexiters may be recused in a campaign.) The party is not deeply divided, but very strongly remain in parliament and constituencies. Powerful voices \u2013 Keir Starmer, Tom Watson, Emily Thornberry, Diane Abbott, Andy McDonald and more \u2013 show why remain is the only credible Labour policy. Despite 26 of Labour\u2019s MPs <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/jeremy-corbyn/news/104708/labour-mps-warn-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">writing a letter</a> pleading against a referendum and remain, here\u2019s the question for them: will they really vote for any Boris Johnson deal (possibly a joint Nigel Farage/Johnson deal), and trust this most treacherous man with the crucial next stage of EU negotiations? To back it will be to sabotage the Northern Ireland border and the Good Friday agreement. Surely, come that day, they won\u2019t, they can\u2019t.</p> <p>Optimists in the shadow cabinet hope that as soon as next Tuesday Jeremy Corbyn will shift to remain. But will he sell it, argue for it, make the pro-European case, or skirt around it again, leaving it to half a mumbled phrase tucked into speeches on austerity? Rachael Maskell, a strong Corbyn-supporting MP, but co-founder of Love Socialism Hate Brexit, talks to him often. She has urged Corbyn \u201cto lead the charge. He\u2019s a visionary, but he\u2019s being choked off by the push-and-pull and by his inner office. We should be leading a big, bold reform in Europe, on climate, on globalisation, not a little England at the mercy of a Trump trade deal.\u201d</p> <p>Maskell wants those in leave seats to campaign as she did nonstop in her poorest working-class estates, successfully swinging them with proof that Brexit would be terrible for them.</p> <p>The time is short. Johnson will likely be prime minister in a month, and by then Labour needs to be his most powerful, coherent, unequivocal opposition \u2013 or others will. Labour\u2019s flannelling half-assent to Brexit gives daily aid to enemies of everything Labour stands for. Every day that passes, the less forgiven Labour will ever be by those who have already deserted it and may never come back.</p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "The nation watches this strange array of men deranged enough to aspire to run a country in an insoluble crisis of their own making. As a despairing and departing chancellor spells out today at Mansion House, they all lie through their teeth: there will be no new EU deal, they will be stopped from leaving with no deal, they will not keep their wild tax-cutting promises \u2013 and they know it. Yesterday they ejected the only one who tiptoed closer to these truths, but Rory Stewart also swore blind he would Brexit, come what may. We watch aghast at the grisly choice, outraged again at being excluded from electing our own prime minister. Our fate is left to a rabble of extreme rightwing revolutionary Tory members who will tear up everything in pursuit of an abstract ideological phantasm. They may look like deceptively normal Rotarians and golf-club members, pillars of their communities, but YouGov finds them eager to wreck the union: 63% glad to see Scotland go, 59% waving goodbye to Northern Ireland in order to see Brexit take place. But most astoundingly, nearly two-thirds of this erstwhile \u201cnatural party of government\u201d are quite sanguine if their Brexit does \u201csignificant damage to the UK economy\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell feature strongly in these Tory debates as mortal hazards facing the nation \u2013 looming Marxists ready to turn us into Venezuela. But in this world turned upside down, nothing ever proposed, planned, desired or dreamed by Labour\u2019s left, nothing in its natonalising manifesto, ever matched these Tory Maoists-on-speed\u2019s willingness to wreak \u201csignificant damage\u201d on us all. There never was a more open goal for Labour, as day after day the effects of a decade of malevolent maladministration tumble out. On Wednesday, on just one ordinary news day, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported UK teachers have the heaviest workloads, bar Japan. The head of NHS England found the 10% cut in hospital beds has been too many (who knew?). The number of rough sleepers in London reached a record high. The Resolution Foundation found 18- to 29-year-olds\u2019 spending money has fallen 7% since 2001 while the over-65s\u2019 has risen 37% over the same period. Labour should be stratospherically ahead in the polls. Instead, its 14% showing in the EU elections, behind the Lib Dems and only just beating the Greens, shows Brexit blows away everything else, trumping old party loyalties. Pointing to austerity\u2019s devastations doesn\u2019t summon back those lost Labour votes. Fence-sitting has been calamitous: YouGov shows Labour has lost half its 2017 general election votes \u2013 a third to remain parties and 11% to Brexit parties. As the YouGov founder Peter Kellner points out, an average of the last year\u2019s polls shows a national swing \u2013 with 44% backing leave and 56% remain. This is partly demographic (older, mainly leave, voters are dying while pro-remain teenagers reach voting age) but crucially the swing to remain is bolstered by Labour voters in the north and Midlands changing their minds. The shadow cabinet meeting on Wednesday responded slower than a slug, while Labour members agitate frantically for a rapid response U-turn. A report presented, purporting to show backing remain would lose more seats than fence-straddling, has been forensically dismantled by Kellner and by the psephologist Lewis Baston. In virtually all leave constituencies, most Labour supporters voted remain: non-Labour supporters created leave majorities. Those at the meeting say the report cut no ice \u2013 and there was marked shift in attitudes: only Ian Lavery, the party chair who ignores party members, and Jon Trickett stayed adamant Brexiters with a new softening of opposition from the likes of Richard Burgon and Andrew Gwynne. The rest moved with Corbyn\u2019s confirmed position, to support a referendum. But that\u2019s only halfway. At next Tuesday\u2019s meeting, they will have to move to backing remain. Nothing else will do. Said one, \u201cHow do you back a referendum but when asked what Labour supports, reply \u2018We don\u2019t know\u2019. Ridiculous!\u201d Despite references to Harold Wilson in 1975 letting his divided party take opposite sides, that can\u2019t and won\u2019t happen this time. (Though Brexiters may be recused in a campaign.) The party is not deeply divided, but very strongly remain in parliament and constituencies. Powerful voices \u2013 Keir Starmer, Tom Watson, Emily Thornberry, Diane Abbott, Andy McDonald and more \u2013 show why remain is the only credible Labour policy. Despite 26 of Labour\u2019s MPs writing a letter pleading against a referendum and remain, here\u2019s the question for them: will they really vote for any Boris Johnson deal (possibly a joint Nigel Farage/Johnson deal), and trust this most treacherous man with the crucial next stage of EU negotiations? To back it will be to sabotage the Northern Ireland border and the Good Friday agreement. Surely, come that day, they won\u2019t, they can\u2019t. Optimists in the shadow cabinet hope that as soon as next Tuesday Jeremy Corbyn will shift to remain. But will he sell it, argue for it, make the pro-European case, or skirt around it again, leaving it to half a mumbled phrase tucked into speeches on austerity? Rachael Maskell, a strong Corbyn-supporting MP, but co-founder of Love Socialism Hate Brexit, talks to him often. She has urged Corbyn \u201cto lead the charge. He\u2019s a visionary, but he\u2019s being choked off by the push-and-pull and by his inner office. We should be leading a big, bold reform in Europe, on climate, on globalisation, not a little England at the mercy of a Trump trade deal.\u201d Maskell wants those in leave seats to campaign as she did nonstop in her poorest working-class estates, successfully swinging them with proof that Brexit would be terrible for them. The time is short. Johnson will likely be prime minister in a month, and by then Labour needs to be his most powerful, coherent, unequivocal opposition \u2013 or others will. Labour\u2019s flannelling half-assent to Brexit gives daily aid to enemies of everything Labour stands for. Every day that passes, the less forgiven Labour will ever be by those who have already deserted it and may never come back. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

The internal DWP review ordered by Amber Rudd found that the department missed \u201ccrucial safeguarding opportunities\u201d but that \u201cpolicy guidance was followed\u201d in Stephen Smith\u2019s case. Smith, 64, from Liverpool, had a range of debilitating illnesses including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoarthritis and an enlarged prostate, and used a colostomy bag. His death was reported in April, months after he was forced to get a pass to leave hospital to fight a decision by the department to deny him of crucial benefits. Smith, who could barely walk, was deemed fit for work after a work capability assessment in 2017, which meant his employment support allowance (ESA) payments were stopped. In February the government overturned the decision and agreed to pay back about \u00a34,000 in wrongly denied benefits to Smith. However, he died before he could spend the money and it was used instead to pay for his funeral. After his death, the Liverpool Echo published two letters from two different doctors that had been ignored by the DWP. One note, written by Dr Terence Crowley, stated that Smith \u201ccould not mobilise a distance of 20 metres repeatedly without needing to stop due to pain and breathlessness\u201d. Amid widespread condemnation of the department\u2019s treatment of Smith, the MP for Birkenhead, Frank Field, wrote in April to Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, to call for an official inquiry into the case. Rudd refused to grant a full inquiry and instead ordered the internal review. Writing to Field to reveal its results, Rudd said: \u201cWhilst the policy guidance was followed in Mr Smith\u2019s case, there were crucial safeguarding opportunities which were missed by the department.

A DWP spokesman described the missed safeguarding opportunities surrounding Smith\u2019s case as \u201cfailings\u201d. He said the changes would ensure that if someone\u2019s condition deteriorated while they were appealing against the result of a work capability assessment, they would be able to access the benefit support they needed, and greater links between the department and authorities such as social services would be established. In response to the letter, Field said: \u201cWhat kind of policy guidance is it that fails to recognise that somebody is seriously ill and dying?

      "body": "<p>A citizens\u2019 assembly on the climate emergency will take place this autumn to explore the fastest and fairest ways to end the UK\u2019s carbon emissions.</p> <p>Six House of Commons select committees announced the assembly on Thursday. It is the second of the <a href=\"https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/demands/\">three demands made by the Extinction Rebellion</a> protest group to be addressed.</p> <p>However, the group have criticised the initiative as it wants the assembly\u2019s decisions to be binding, not advisory. Parliament <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/01/declare-formal-climate-emergency-before-its-too-late-corbyn-warns\">declared a climate emergency in May</a>, but the third Extinction Rebellion demand \u2013 action to cut emissions to net zero by 2025 \u2013 has not been met.</p> <p>Theresa May followed official advice and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/theresa-may-commits-to-net-zero-uk-carbon-emissions-by-2050\">set 2050 as the date for the end of greenhouse gas emissions</a> earlier in June, making the UK the first major economy to do so.</p> <p>A citizens\u2019 assembly is a representative group of members of the public who come together to learn about and debate issues, and come to conclusions on the best solutions. Parliament has had such assemblies before, for example to assess social care.

      "bodyText": "A citizens\u2019 assembly on the climate emergency will take place this autumn to explore the fastest and fairest ways to end the UK\u2019s carbon emissions. Six House of Commons select committees announced the assembly on Thursday. It is the second of the three demands made by the Extinction Rebellion protest group to be addressed. However, the group have criticised the initiative as it wants the assembly\u2019s decisions to be binding, not advisory. Parliament declared a climate emergency in May, but the third Extinction Rebellion demand \u2013 action to cut emissions to net zero by 2025 \u2013 has not been met. Theresa May followed official advice and set 2050 as the date for the end of greenhouse gas emissions earlier in June, making the UK the first major economy to do so. A citizens\u2019 assembly is a representative group of members of the public who come together to learn about and debate issues, and come to conclusions on the best solutions. Parliament has had such assemblies before, for example to assess social care. The climate assembly will take place over a series of weekends in the autumn but the people and locations are yet to be determined. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a challenge for just one parliament, one political party, or one generation; to achieve net zero by 2050 we need to build cross-party and cross-generational support for the actions needed to deliver it,\u201d said Rachel Reeves MP, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee.

Sounding the alarm as its nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) voted unanimously to leave interest rates on hold at 0.75%, the central bank said the lack of resolution was weighing on growth. Threadneedle Street slashed its growth forecast for the three months to June to zero, from 0.2%, amid a broader deterioration in the economy since Theresa May extended the Brexit deadline until the autumn. Warning that downside risks to growth had increased as the threat of crashing out without a deal has risen up the agenda, it said that companies expect uncertainty would persist, while there were no clear signs that firms would increase investments in Britain. The Bank said the pound had dropped in value on the foreign exchanges, given \u201cthe perceived likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has risen\u201d, while mounting tensions over international trade amid the US-China tariff dispute had also slowed the economy. \u201cUnderlying growth in the UK appears to have weakened slightly in the first half of the year relative to 2018,\u201d the MPC said. Some companies have begun running down stockpiles built up in the run-up to the original Brexit deadline on 29 March \u2013 now delayed until the end of October \u2013 in a move that is likely to weigh on economic growth in future, the Bank said. The rush to build up emergency supplies of goods and raw materials had previously helped boost GDP growth to 0.5% in the first quarter. However, goods trade with the EU weakened sharply in April, according to the MPC, in a sign companies were running down stock. The majority of businesses surveyed by the Bank\u2019s networks of regional agents across the country believe Brexit uncertainty would not be resolved by the end of the year.

Jim Killock of Open Rights Group, which has campaigned against the law, warned last week that the data protection standards under the proposed system were \u201cpointless, misleading and potentially dangerous as advice to consumers seeking safe products\u201d. Responsibility for checking ages under the system was given to private companies, who would be overseen by the British Board of Film Classification \u2013 an organisation which has limited experience of technical internet regulation.

It also raises questions as to how a similar age-verification system for all mainstream websites \u2013 as proposed by the information commissioner\u2019s office \u2013 could be implemented. The delay is damaging to many British age-verification businesses who invested substantial sums of money in developing systems to provide the tools required to check internet users\u2019 identities. They were relying on the launch going well in order to sell their products around the world and make the UK a hub for global age-verification systems, with many backed by small investors who could lose out in the event of a lengthy delay. Age verification was first proposed in the run-up to the 2015 general election by Sajid Javid, when he was culture secretary in the coalition government.",

An email sent to politicians and media organisations across the country on Tuesday night warned that the alleged murder of the Christian Democratic Union politician Walter L\u00fcbcke, allegedly by a man linked to the far right, was the first in a line of \u201cupcoming purges\u201d and called for terror attacks on left-leaning politicians, refugees and Jews in Germany. The mayors of the city of Cologne and the western town of Altena, who have both been victims of knife attacks because of their pro-refugee stances, were singled out in the letter. Cologne\u2019s mayor, Henriette Reker, narrowly escaped death in 2015 when she was attacked with a hunting knife by a rightwing extremist who said he had wanted to send a signal against the government\u2019s course on the refugee question. Altena\u2019s mayor, Andreas Hollstein, was stabbed in the neck in 2017 by a man who had loudly criticised his liberal asylum policy in the North Rhine-Westphalia town. Both confirmed they had received death threats this week. A police spokesperson would not comment on whether there was a direct link to L\u00fcbcke\u2019s murder. L\u00fcbcke, who was the president of the regional council of Kassel, was found dead on the veranda of his home in Istha just over two weeks ago. Police have arrested a suspect, Stephan Ernst, who has links to rightwing extremists and previous convictions for politically motivated attacks. This week\u2019s death threats were signed by \u201cthe musicians of the Staatsstreichorchester\u201d, a play on the German words for \u201ccoup d\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d and \u201cstring orchestra\u201d. The same pseudonym has been used in hundreds of threatening emails sent to journalists, lawyers, politicians and civil servants since December 2018. A man was arrested in connection with the threats in April, but the latest messages appear to point to a network rather than a lone individual. The president of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency said at a press conference on Tuesday that nearly 13,000 violent rightwing extremists were living in Germany, too many for the security services to be able to monitor. Irene Mihalic, a politician for the German Green party, told the newspaper Taz that the latest death threats signalled \u201ca new escalation of agitation and violence from the extreme right\u201d.",

In short, Trump\u2019s message for 2020 is: \u201cI made America great again, now vote for me so I can Keep America Great.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats will dismiss the speech as lacking ideas and just fearmongering, while reveling in <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2627\">recent polls</a> that have virtually every major primary candidate defeat Trump in 2020, sometimes by a significant margin.

You can add to this mix frontman Geordie Greep, whose peculiar array of vocal mannerisms and tics often leave him sounding remarkably \u2013 if presumably unwittingly \u2013 like noted explorer of the sonic outer limits Shirley Bassey.</p> <p>Based on that description alone, you may well be able to decide whether you\u2019re going to find Schlagenheim a thrilling <em>d\u00e9tournement</em> of tired rock orthodoxy or the kind of thing that you\u2019d prefer to get as far away from as possible. You don\u2019t have to be some kind of parka-sporting, Weller-mopped dumbo, steadfast in the belief that Liam Gallagher\u2019s last album represents the apogee of Real Music, to occasionally understand the latter impulse.</p> <p>At their least appealing, there\u2019s no doubt that Black Midi can sound pretty pleased with themselves. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8BI3Bbpgdk\">Bmbmbm</a> features a one-note bass riff interspersed with propulsive explosions of noise, over which Greep offers variations on the phrase \u201cShe moves with a purpose\u201d in a succession of different voices, from drawl to gibber. It\u2019s the kind of idea that Damo Suzuki-era Can might have fruitfully explored \u2013 indeed, the band have backed him in concert \u2013 and bears a certain resemblance to the early Butthole Surfers track Something, although you struggle to locate any of Can\u2019s warmth, wit, funk or soul here, or the Butthole Surfers\u2019 lysergically enhanced sense of fear and loathing. Or, indeed, what the track is supposed to be communicating. Without any of that, it\u2019s hard to avoid a sensation of po-faced seriousness, of music that exists largely in order to make its authors and fans feel superior to the hoi-polloi with their risible dependence on melodies and lyrics.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-6hI2Mnb3s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A-6hI2Mnb3s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Black Midi: Crow\u2019s Perch \u2013 video (contains strobing effects)</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s a failing, but it\u2019s far from the whole story. The early hype around the band has come replete with a lot of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer-ish stuff about their technical virtuosity and dexterous musicianship. This occasionally finds its expression in showily complex flurries of widdly-woo guitar, but it comes into its own when, led by drummer Morgan Simpson, they lock into a groove that manages to be hypnotically repetitious while constantly shifting and changing, as on opener 953 \u2013 a riff that initially sounds like the needle on a grunge record sticking, subject to a succession of shifts in tempo and style \u2013 or Western, which boasts a vaguely country influence in its circular guitar pattern. There are a succession of moments where the striking juxtapositions deliver a really powerful kick, like a film cutting sharply between contrasting scenes: Of Schlagenheim suddenly divests itself of its angularity and becomes a gently beguiling drift two minutes in; Years Ago shifts from motorik pulse to screaming noise and back again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/04/best-albums-of-2019-so-far\">Best albums of 2019 so far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The best moments are those that feel visceral rather than cerebral: the gradual ratcheting of tension on Reggae, the relentless surges of Near DT, MI. As a whole, Schlagenheim is an imperfect, intriguing debut: behind the overheated prose lurks a young, self-conscious band who clearly aren\u2019t as fully formed as the hype suggests, who are still capable of misdirecting their undoubted talent and haven\u2019t quite clicked that intelligence is best worn lightly in the balance between art and heart.

It views songwriting as a matter of riffs, dynamics and noise rather than verses, choruses and tunes, and inhabits a space where prog rock at its most blaring (very obviously the crunching, metallic version of King Crimson found on 1974\u2019s Red, but also the really skronky bits of Van der Graaf Generator\u2019s Pawn Hearts and Godbluff) meets a lot of stuff appended by the prefix \u201cpost\u201d: the herky-jerky brand of post-punk exemplified by early XTC, the ponderous guitar arpeggios of post-rock, the raw-throated vocals and pummelling guitars of post-hardcore. You can add to this mix frontman Geordie Greep, whose peculiar array of vocal mannerisms and tics often leave him sounding remarkably \u2013 if presumably unwittingly \u2013 like noted explorer of the sonic outer limits Shirley Bassey. Based on that description alone, you may well be able to decide whether you\u2019re going to find Schlagenheim a thrilling d\u00e9tournement of tired rock orthodoxy or the kind of thing that you\u2019d prefer to get as far away from as possible. You don\u2019t have to be some kind of parka-sporting, Weller-mopped dumbo, steadfast in the belief that Liam Gallagher\u2019s last album represents the apogee of Real Music, to occasionally understand the latter impulse. At their least appealing, there\u2019s no doubt that Black Midi can sound pretty pleased with themselves. Bmbmbm features a one-note bass riff interspersed with propulsive explosions of noise, over which Greep offers variations on the phrase \u201cShe moves with a purpose\u201d in a succession of different voices, from drawl to gibber. It\u2019s the kind of idea that Damo Suzuki-era Can might have fruitfully explored \u2013 indeed, the band have backed him in concert \u2013 and bears a certain resemblance to the early Butthole Surfers track Something, although you struggle to locate any of Can\u2019s warmth, wit, funk or soul here, or the Butthole Surfers\u2019 lysergically enhanced sense of fear and loathing. Or, indeed, what the track is supposed to be communicating. Without any of that, it\u2019s hard to avoid a sensation of po-faced seriousness, of music that exists largely in order to make its authors and fans feel superior to the hoi-polloi with their risible dependence on melodies and lyrics. It\u2019s a failing, but it\u2019s far from the whole story. The early hype around the band has come replete with a lot of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer-ish stuff about their technical virtuosity and dexterous musicianship. This occasionally finds its expression in showily complex flurries of widdly-woo guitar, but it comes into its own when, led by drummer Morgan Simpson, they lock into a groove that manages to be hypnotically repetitious while constantly shifting and changing, as on opener 953 \u2013 a riff that initially sounds like the needle on a grunge record sticking, subject to a succession of shifts in tempo and style \u2013 or Western, which boasts a vaguely country influence in its circular guitar pattern. There are a succession of moments where the striking juxtapositions deliver a really powerful kick, like a film cutting sharply between contrasting scenes: Of Schlagenheim suddenly divests itself of its angularity and becomes a gently beguiling drift two minutes in; Years Ago shifts from motorik pulse to screaming noise and back again. The best moments are those that feel visceral rather than cerebral: the gradual ratcheting of tension on Reggae, the relentless surges of Near DT, MI. As a whole, Schlagenheim is an imperfect, intriguing debut: behind the overheated prose lurks a young, self-conscious band who clearly aren\u2019t as fully formed as the hype suggests, who are still capable of misdirecting their undoubted talent and haven\u2019t quite clicked that intelligence is best worn lightly in the balance between art and heart. But it\u2019s still early days. Greep has suggested they\u2019ll be \u201cunrecognisable\u201d in two years\u2019 time: for all its flaws, Schlagenheim is promising enough to suggest that watching them develop could be fascinating. This week Alexis listened to The Humble Bee &amp; Offthesky: For Her Breath Is on All That Hath Life From a forthcoming collaborative album, All Other Voices Gone, Only Yours Remain, ambient experimentation where crackling samples and live instruments conjure up a kind of becalmed eeriness.",

For the uninitiated, Hughes was a firm favourite with fans in 2017 because of his bromance with fellow contestant Kem Cetinay and a onscreen gaffe that <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/love-island-jason-staythumb-chris-hughes-jason-statham_uk_5948e3ede4b07499199e3310\">launch</a><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/love-island-jason-staythumb-chris-hughes-jason-statham_uk_5948e3ede4b07499199e3310\">ed the Jason Staythumb meme</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s hardly the first time the authenticity of the reality show\u2019s couplings have been called into question. Last year, incel icon Dr Alex had a crack at a fauxmance with Ellie Brown, even if she did look like she was in a hostage situation for most of it. The authenticity of Hughes\u2019 own onscreen romance with Olivia Attwood was questioned and they eventually split in a screeching row while the cameras rolled on their spin-off reality show, Crackin\u2019 On.</p> <p>But, even if the Love Island hook-ups are artificial, this art of the \u201cshowmance\u201d is hardly something to get worked up about.

      "bodyText": "The former Love Island contestant Chris Hughes has accused this year\u2019s batch of fame-hungry frottage merchants of faking their romances. For the uninitiated, Hughes was a firm favourite with fans in 2017 because of his bromance with fellow contestant Kem Cetinay and a onscreen gaffe that launched the Jason Staythumb meme. It\u2019s hardly the first time the authenticity of the reality show\u2019s couplings have been called into question. Last year, incel icon Dr Alex had a crack at a fauxmance with Ellie Brown, even if she did look like she was in a hostage situation for most of it. The authenticity of Hughes\u2019 own onscreen romance with Olivia Attwood was questioned and they eventually split in a screeching row while the cameras rolled on their spin-off reality show, Crackin\u2019 On. But, even if the Love Island hook-ups are artificial, this art of the \u201cshowmance\u201d is hardly something to get worked up about. The idea that putting a group of gym-honed mirror-lovers into a luxury villa is enough to make them want to get naked is an unrealistic one.

      "bodyText": "More than 20,000 Christians have signed a petition calling for the cancellation of Good Omens, the television series adapted from Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman\u2019s 1990 fantasy novel \u2013 unfortunately addressing their petition to Netflix when the series is made by Amazon Prime. The six-part series was released last month, starring David Tennant as the demon Crowley and Michael Sheen as the angel Aziraphale, who collaborate to prevent the coming of the antichrist and an imminent apocalypse. Pratchett\u2019s last request to Gaiman before he died was that he adapt the novel they wrote together; Gaiman wrote the screenplay and worked as showrunner on the BBC/Amazon co-production, which the Radio Times called \u201ca devilishly funny love letter to the book\u201d. But Christians marshalled by the Return to Order campaign, an offshoot of the US Foundation for a Christian Civilisation, disagree. More than 20,000 supporters have signed a petition in which they say that Good Omens is \u201canother step to make satanism appear normal, light and acceptable\u201d, and \u201cmocks God\u2019s wisdom\u201d. God, they complain, is \u201cvoiced by a woman\u201d \u2013 Frances McDormand \u2013 the antichrist is a \u201cnormal kid\u201d and, most importantly, \u201cthis type of video makes light of Truth, Error, Good and Evil, and destroys the barriers of horror that society still has for the devil\u201d. They are calling on Netflix to cancel the show. Gaiman responded to the petition on Twitter, writing: \u201cI love that they are going to write to Netflix to try and get #GoodOmens cancelled. Says it all really. This is so beautiful ... Promise me you won\u2019t tell them?\u201d The publisher and science fiction critic Cheryl Morgan tweeted: \u201cMiraculously God has already done it. Don\u2019t tell them She put it on Amazon instead.\u201d Return to Order is based on the writings of the author John Horvat II. It \u201ccalls upon Americans to put principles into actions by working toward what is called an organic Christian society\u201d. Another of its petitions in April called on Walmart to \u201cstop selling Satanic products\u201d following a 2018 protest against a \u201cblasphemous ice cream chain called Sweet Jesus\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The former Interpol president Meng Hongwei confessed to accepting more than $2 million in bribes and expressed regret for his crime, a Chinese court said on Thursday. The No. 1 Intermediate Court in the northeastern port city of Tianjin said Meng read a statement containing the confession at a hearing. Elected president of the international police organisation in 2016, Meng disappeared into custody after traveling to China from France at the end of September. Interpol was not informed of Meng\u2018s detention and was forced to ask China about his whereabouts. In a statement in early October, the Chinese authorities admitted they were holding Meng and China\u2019s ministry of public security said that he was being investigated for accepting bribes. A confession assures a conviction but it was not immediately clear when a verdict and sentence would be handed down. Confessions, which are often televised, have become a hallmark of President Xi Jinping\u2019s rule. Admitting guilt and expressing regret can result in slightly lighter punishment, though China has been quick to hand out life sentences for corruption under a campaign run directly by the president, Xi Jinping. Meng\u2019s wife, Grace, has remained in France, where Meng was stationed for Lyon-based Interpol, and has accused Chinese authorities of creating a \u201cfake case\u201d against him for political reasons. There are suspicions Meng had fallen out of favour with Xi, who has come down hard on corruption and perceived disloyalty in what observers say is calculated to strengthen party control while bringing down potential challengers to his authority. The Tianjin court said Meng had abused his positions, including as a vice minister of public security and maritime police chief, to take bribes. Shown on television wearing a plain brown windbreaker and flanked by two bailiffs, Meng appeared older and grayer than during his time as one of the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officers.

From Rio Branco, the state capital, it\u2019s a few hours\u2019 drive to get to the forest and, on the way, it becomes clear just how big a problem deforestation is. Where once there was forest, there is now field upon field of cattle and the opposition between the forest protectors and cattle farmers here has been an ongoing issue for the last 40 years.</p> <p>The legacy of Chico Mendes, the Brazilian environmentalist and trade union leader who was killed by a rancher in 1988, is still close to the cause. We started working with Bia Saldanha, who could almost be considered one of Mendes\u2019s spiritual daughters, in 2008 and her experience has brought a lot to the Veja project in Amazonia. She has devoted her life to the fight for the forest and we love having her work with us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2b504d1df614613520c9c566a2f6772b73093d55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b504d1df614613520c9c566a2f6772b73093d55/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Veja co-founder S\u00e9bastien Kopp (right) with local anthropologist Marcelo Piedrafita.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Veja co-founder S\u00e9bastien Kopp (right) with local anthropologist Marcelo Piedrafita.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonny Weeks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Veja co-founder S\u00e9bastien Kopp (right) with local anthropologist Marcelo Piedrafita, as they embark on a journey past countless cattle pastures en route to the rainforest.

The rubber is tapped directly from the Hevea trees that grow here. The rubber tappers are increasingly aware of the fact that they can be the guardians of this immensely important forest. Every time we visit, we have open meetings with the community to help us understand how we can do better for them and the forest.</p> <p>On this trip, we discussed a premium cost that we recently added to every kilo of rubber, which specifically goes towards protecting the forest. They told us how a lot of the younger rubber tappers have realised they can now make more money through their work with us than raising cattle. This makes me so happy and I told them that in each pair of our shoes there is a piece of them, there is a piece of the forest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4fb4e44112f561e6d37e7d31e286b7b0f9190a03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fb4e44112f561e6d37e7d31e286b7b0f9190a03/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Veja co-founder S\u00e9bastien Kopp talks to the local seringueiros (rubber tappers) during their community meeting.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Veja co-founder S\u00e9bastien Kopp talks to the local <em>seringueiros</em> (rubber tappers) during their community meeting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonny Weeks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2394bee03fb80386b1a512e9104b98b3dde014e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2394bee03fb80386b1a512e9104b98b3dde014e2/0_0_6114_4076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthropologist Marcelo Piedrafita takes notes during the meeting.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthropologist Marcelo Piedrafita takes notes during the meeting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonny Weeks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49984c70ba074138e0010b69dee354f1109db50f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49984c70ba074138e0010b69dee354f1109db50f/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The local seringueiros listen to Kopp at the community meeting.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The local <em>seringueiros</em> listen to Kopp at the community meeting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonny Weeks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Kopp talks to the local <em>seringueiros</em> (rubber tappers) during their community meeting as Piedrafita takes notes.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2017/apr/divider/\" data-alt=\"divider\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2017/apr/divider/\">divider</a> <figcaption>divider</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Rubber tapping</h2> <p>A typical day for a <em>seringueiro</em> (the Brazilian name for a rubber tapper) usually starts at 4am, when they head out on their forest trails to extract and collect rubber milk from the Hevea trees.</p> <p>A <em>seringueiro</em> normally collects 10 litres of rubber milk a day, which we use for the soles of Veja sneakers. Through this process, we are able to support the working communities here and protect the forest from being cut down.</p> <p>The rubber tappers are the first to see the impact that climate change has on the Amazon rainforest; the rivers that are drying up; fires that didn\u2019t exist before. They share their hopes for a sustainable future here and ask if there are more companies like Veja that can help to avoid deforestation by working with the amazing wealth of the forest without destroying it.</p> <p>The rubber tappers can be the destroyers or the guardians of the forest: we try to push them towards being its guardians.

      "bodyText": "We started working in Amazonia, in the Brazilian state of Acre, in 2004. Acre is a frontier: the last point before the Amazon rainforest begins. From Rio Branco, the state capital, it\u2019s a few hours\u2019 drive to get to the forest and, on the way, it becomes clear just how big a problem deforestation is. Where once there was forest, there is now field upon field of cattle and the opposition between the forest protectors and cattle farmers here has been an ongoing issue for the last 40 years. The legacy of Chico Mendes, the Brazilian environmentalist and trade union leader who was killed by a rancher in 1988, is still close to the cause. We started working with Bia Saldanha, who could almost be considered one of Mendes\u2019s spiritual daughters, in 2008 and her experience has brought a lot to the Veja project in Amazonia. She has devoted her life to the fight for the forest and we love having her work with us. Veja co-founder S\u00e9bastien Kopp (right) with local anthropologist Marcelo Piedrafita, as they embark on a journey past countless cattle pastures en route to the rainforest. All photographs by Jonny Weeks. Environmentalist and fashion entrepreneur Bia Saldanha poses with a picture of Chico Mendes, the Amazon activist who was killed in 1988. The community meeting We buy wild rubber from communities of rubber tappers whom we work with inside the Amazon rainforest. The rubber is tapped directly from the Hevea trees that grow here. The rubber tappers are increasingly aware of the fact that they can be the guardians of this immensely important forest. Every time we visit, we have open meetings with the community to help us understand how we can do better for them and the forest. On this trip, we discussed a premium cost that we recently added to every kilo of rubber, which specifically goes towards protecting the forest. They told us how a lot of the younger rubber tappers have realised they can now make more money through their work with us than raising cattle. This makes me so happy and I told them that in each pair of our shoes there is a piece of them, there is a piece of the forest. Kopp talks to the local seringueiros (rubber tappers) during their community meeting as Piedrafita takes notes. Rubber tapping A typical day for a seringueiro (the Brazilian name for a rubber tapper) usually starts at 4am, when they head out on their forest trails to extract and collect rubber milk from the Hevea trees. A seringueiro normally collects 10 litres of rubber milk a day, which we use for the soles of Veja sneakers. Through this process, we are able to support the working communities here and protect the forest from being cut down. The rubber tappers are the first to see the impact that climate change has on the Amazon rainforest; the rivers that are drying up; fires that didn\u2019t exist before. They share their hopes for a sustainable future here and ask if there are more companies like Veja that can help to avoid deforestation by working with the amazing wealth of the forest without destroying it. The rubber tappers can be the destroyers or the guardians of the forest: we try to push them towards being its guardians. Sebastiao, one of the leaders in the community, insisted on showing us the Hevea tree plantation he has created on previously deforested land that was used for cattle farming. Dionio Araujo Guimar\u00e3es (centre) learning the rubber tappers\u2019 trade. Bia Saldanha eats inga fruit seeds at Sebastiao\u2019s plantation. Homes and hammocks Every time we come to visit, we are welcomed by such amazing people. We sleep in hammocks and are treated to the most beautiful sunsets and delicious breakfasts. On this trip, we were welcomed by Senhora Conda. She told us all about the work she and her husband do as teachers to the children who live in the forest. She talked about what is changing here, both good and bad. They tell us their stories, their dreams and their difficulties. Staying the night with the Conda family, who cooked us dinner and let us sleep in hammocks, which we hung across their living space.

Iran shoots down US drone, as missile hits Saudi Arabia An unmanned US drone has been shot down in the strait of Hormuz by Iran, which accused America of spying in its airspace in the south of the country and attempting to worsen tensions in the region. A US military official confirmed one of its drones was taken down, but said it was in international airspace. Meanwhile, President Trump has been briefed on the details of a missile strike in Saudi Arabia that appeared to come from Yemen. \u2018Harsh response\u2019. The secretary of Iran\u2019s supreme national security council Ali Shamkhani had warned earlier on Wednesday against any state crossing a \u201cred line\u201d and entering into its airspace or maritime borders. Biden criticised for past association with segregationist senators Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden refused to apologise after saying he had worked alongside two southern segregationist senators in Congress with \u201csome civility\u201d despite major disagreements. After fellow contender Cory Booker criticised him for also joking \u201cabout calling black men \u2018boys\u2019\u201d, Biden said: \u201cThere\u2019s not a racist bone in my body.\u201d However, previous remarks made by the former vice-president have emerged, as critics call into question his credentials. Criticism. \u201cBiden\u2019s relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone,\u201d Booker said in a statement. Sea walls to protect US from climate crisis would cost billions Building sea walls to guard US communities against rising sea levels could cost $416bn over the next 20 years, and the figure represents a mere slice of what governments in coastal states will have to fund if they do not wish to just retreat inland. The costs could amass to nearly as much as the initial investment in the interstate highway system, but the report\u2019s publisher said this had likely been overlooked. \u2018Who\u2019s going to pay for that?\u2019 Is it really going to be taxpayers? Asks Richard Wiles, executive director of the Center for Climate Integrity. \u201cThe current position of climate polluters is that they should pay nothing, and that\u2019s just not tenable.\u201d Yemen war death toll approaches 100,000 A comprehensive report has exposed the extent of directly targeted civilian casualties in Yemen as the conflict enters its fourth year. It comes as a UK court declared the British government\u2019s continued supply of weapons to the Saudi-led coalition as unlawful. The deliberate targeting of civilians has been denied by both sides but the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (Acled) has recorded 4,500 direct civilian targeting events that led to approximately 11,700 reported deaths since 2015. Killings. 2018 was \u201cthe war\u2019s deadliest and most violent year on record\u201d, according to Acled, and British Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle warned that \u201ca generation of Yemenis now hate Britain as much as the Saudi royal air force\u201d. Crib sheet Amid warnings of a new age of impunity governing international relations, the US has joined Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Russia in a list of countries perceived as likely to use their influence for bad, according to a poll. Birds are even more affected by human noise than was previously thought, researchers have found, with the interruption of birdsong hindering peace-keeping and the development of normal social behaviour. Campaigners in Michigan are demanding the closure of a controversial pipeline across the Great Lakes which they say is run by a company with a long record of mismanagement, poor safety habits and deception. A new age-verification system for online pornography in the UK is set to be shelved just weeks before it was due to be launched, after officials reportedly failed to notify the European commission about the key details.

In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \u2018stuff\u2019 as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \u2018future high streets\u2019 fund under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2019?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Growth in average pay has remained above inflation for the past 14 months in a row, helping households rebuild their finances after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/oct/10/gig-economy-fuelled-lost-decade-in-wage-growth-bank-economist-andy-haldane\">lost decade for improvements in living standards</a>.

      "bodyText": "Star Wars: The Last Jedi actor Mark Hamill has called for Donald Trump\u2019s Hollywood Walk of Fame star to be replaced by one for Carrie Fisher, his co-star in multiple Star Wars movies. Hamill retweeted an article from August 2018 reporting that West Hollywood City Council had voted to remove Trump\u2019s star. Hamill added: \u201cGood riddance! (and I know just who should replace him...) #AStarForCarrie.\u201d As reported at the time, Trump\u2019s star had seen a number of attempts at vandalism, and it was highlighted that a number of popular industry figures, including Fisher, George Clooney and Denzel Washington, do not have stars on the Walk of Fame. However, Hamill appears to be labouring under a misapprehension that Trump\u2019s star is to be removed, or that the council have any power to enforce a removal. The stars are owned and overseen by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which has stated that stars will not be removed due to misconduct of the people they celebrate.",

      "body": "<p>This is going to sound like a dream I had, but it\u2019s true: I once travelled 200 miles to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/nov/14/zoe-williams-saturday-sketch-doughnut-burger\" title=\"\">taste a \u201cdoughnut burger\u201d</a>. Instead of just one patty of ground meat, there were two, with bacon and untold gunk in between. More to the point, instead of a bun, there was a doughnut. The story was that there were as many calories as you ought to eat in a day, in this single burger, so how would you feel at the end of one of those?</p> <p>The answer is, I felt fine. But the journey of the burger bun mystified me. Every year since the mid-70s, it has got higher, fluffier, more golden \u2013 unless it is charcoal, in which case it has got more sinister. Every year it has looked more like a gourmet item in its own right. And this increasing perfection has gone hand in hand with sweetness, so that you end up with a bun that is basically not very bread-like, that you would hesitate to eat at home because you would be thrown into confusion about whether you were having breakfast or high tea.</p> <p>Most of the buns you find in shops and supermarkets remain old school \u2013 bready, not especially fluffy, extremely yielding in the hand. I love them for madeleine reasons: they remind me of other times I\u2019ve tasted them, very often in a garden, with people I am fond of. Domestically, you mostly serve burgers to people you like. They\u2019re food for intimates, because you\u2019re going to eat them with your hands and they will probably fall apart.</p> <p>In pubs and restaurants, though, buns have gone full million-dollar smile. The original pub buns were highly processed, never went stale, tasted of nothing and were squidgy. I had nothing against these buns; I still don\u2019t mind a Wimpy. But what they didn\u2019t have was integrity: the bread changed composition on contact with the meat, became a kind of slick starchy layer. The old outrage of the 20th century \u2013 how food looked in adverts versus how it looked in real life \u2013 was largely down to these buns. They weren\u2019t pillowy and didn\u2019t gleam. But pubs used them for years, following the not-broke-so-don\u2019t-fix-it module on their MBAs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/shortcuts/2018/nov/19/whats-the-beef-the-dark-side-of-the-quest-for-the-worlds-best-burger\">What's the beef? The dark side of the quest for the world's best burger</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The quest for the perfect bun was always more fevered in the US, possibly because the burgers were bigger. By 2009, they were havering between the potato-starch roll \u2013 still the Shake Shack staple \u2013 and a cross between challah and a breakfast roll, which is basically on its way to the brioche. Over the same period in the UK, Byron Burger was launching and Meat Liquor was finding its feet, and both went through existential self-reflection on the matter of the bun. Brioche seemed very sweet for the everyday palate.</p> <p>Then came Young\u2019s \u201cstandard brioche\u201d, devised by the pub chain and the Bread Factory bakery, and now the staple of most large pub chains. <a href=\"https://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Article/2017/02/09/My-Pub-The-Guinea-Grill-Mayfair\" title=\"\">Oisin Rogers</a>, a long-serving Young\u2019s landlord, describes its traits: glazed top, the colour of an expensive person\u2019s tan, \u201clots of sugar, can\u2019t freeze it, can\u2019t keep it for longer than a day, costs a lot\u201d. Inspired by both challah (whose complication is eggs) and the pretzel bun (which has syrup and butter), it had a ton of ingredients.</p> <p>Two things happened: first, this bumped the price of burgers closer to a tenner than to a fiver; second, they became cosmically delicious to look at, right at the point when people started taking photos of their food. Overnight, the burger became expensive enough to invite discernment, gorgeous enough to be part of your aspirational lifestyle, eventful enough to have on a date.</p> <p>By 2012, the Ship in Wandsworth, which Rogers was then running, was shifting 50,000 burgers in a year. It\u2019s a large boozer, but by any kind of maths, the majority of people who walked in were ordering a burger, and some people had two. The evolution from the 90s \u2013 when a pub burger started entirely in the freezer and popped out whole from the microwave \u2013 had happened mainly in the bun.

      "bodyText": "This is going to sound like a dream I had, but it\u2019s true: I once travelled 200 miles to taste a \u201cdoughnut burger\u201d. Instead of just one patty of ground meat, there were two, with bacon and untold gunk in between. More to the point, instead of a bun, there was a doughnut. The story was that there were as many calories as you ought to eat in a day, in this single burger, so how would you feel at the end of one of those? The answer is, I felt fine. But the journey of the burger bun mystified me. Every year since the mid-70s, it has got higher, fluffier, more golden \u2013 unless it is charcoal, in which case it has got more sinister. Every year it has looked more like a gourmet item in its own right. And this increasing perfection has gone hand in hand with sweetness, so that you end up with a bun that is basically not very bread-like, that you would hesitate to eat at home because you would be thrown into confusion about whether you were having breakfast or high tea. Most of the buns you find in shops and supermarkets remain old school \u2013 bready, not especially fluffy, extremely yielding in the hand. I love them for madeleine reasons: they remind me of other times I\u2019ve tasted them, very often in a garden, with people I am fond of. Domestically, you mostly serve burgers to people you like. They\u2019re food for intimates, because you\u2019re going to eat them with your hands and they will probably fall apart. In pubs and restaurants, though, buns have gone full million-dollar smile. The original pub buns were highly processed, never went stale, tasted of nothing and were squidgy. I had nothing against these buns; I still don\u2019t mind a Wimpy. But what they didn\u2019t have was integrity: the bread changed composition on contact with the meat, became a kind of slick starchy layer. The old outrage of the 20th century \u2013 how food looked in adverts versus how it looked in real life \u2013 was largely down to these buns. They weren\u2019t pillowy and didn\u2019t gleam. But pubs used them for years, following the not-broke-so-don\u2019t-fix-it module on their MBAs. The quest for the perfect bun was always more fevered in the US, possibly because the burgers were bigger. By 2009, they were havering between the potato-starch roll \u2013 still the Shake Shack staple \u2013 and a cross between challah and a breakfast roll, which is basically on its way to the brioche. Over the same period in the UK, Byron Burger was launching and Meat Liquor was finding its feet, and both went through existential self-reflection on the matter of the bun. Brioche seemed very sweet for the everyday palate. Then came Young\u2019s \u201cstandard brioche\u201d, devised by the pub chain and the Bread Factory bakery, and now the staple of most large pub chains. Oisin Rogers, a long-serving Young\u2019s landlord, describes its traits: glazed top, the colour of an expensive person\u2019s tan, \u201clots of sugar, can\u2019t freeze it, can\u2019t keep it for longer than a day, costs a lot\u201d. Inspired by both challah (whose complication is eggs) and the pretzel bun (which has syrup and butter), it had a ton of ingredients. Two things happened: first, this bumped the price of burgers closer to a tenner than to a fiver; second, they became cosmically delicious to look at, right at the point when people started taking photos of their food. Overnight, the burger became expensive enough to invite discernment, gorgeous enough to be part of your aspirational lifestyle, eventful enough to have on a date. By 2012, the Ship in Wandsworth, which Rogers was then running, was shifting 50,000 burgers in a year. It\u2019s a large boozer, but by any kind of maths, the majority of people who walked in were ordering a burger, and some people had two. The evolution from the 90s \u2013 when a pub burger started entirely in the freezer and popped out whole from the microwave \u2013 had happened mainly in the bun. There aren\u2019t that many decisions you can make about meat, beyond good quality or bad, rough chopped or minced, medium or rare. I still wouldn\u2019t choose this bun at home: it\u2019s just too sweet. You might as well put raisins on your meat. But I do admire the statement way it looks, and will often choose the fancy \u2013 sesame seeds or a glaze \u2013 over the plain. On the face of it, bun creativity has ground to a halt: there\u2019s just a lot of monkeying about with colour, to bring us the entirely black charcoal bun or the sort of green avocado bun. Charcoal is actually completely inoffensive, except for its colour, which is its talking point, and the medical claims it makes to alleviate hangovers by soaking up toxins, which are simply \u2026 I don\u2019t even want to dignify them with a word like \u201cwrong\u201d. \u201cA burger in a restaurant has to have a narrative,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cSo fair play to whoever came up with the charcoal bun or the avocado bun, because people need to come out and tell a story about where they spent their 12 quid.\u201d He is convinced that the brioche will have been supplanted in five years, and, if forced to make a prediction, I would bank on the end of sugar and a return to the days when the main thing you could taste was salt \u2013 a bun that reminds you of bread.",

      "bodyText": "The serial sex attacker John Worboys has admitted drugging four more women. The black-cab driver, who was convicted of assaults on 12 women in 2008, had a decision to release him overturned in November after a public outcry. At the Old Bailey on Thursday, Worboys, 62, pleaded guilty to a string of further offences relating to four more women. Appearing via video link from Wakefield prison, Worboys, wearing glasses and a light grey and green shirt, pleaded guilty to two counts of administering a stupefying or overpowering drug with intent to commit rape or indecent assault. He also admitted two counts of administering a substance with intent to commit a sexual offence under the Sexual Offences Act. The court heard the maximum sentence faced by Worboys was life in prison. Mrs Justice McGowan adjourned sentencing to 2 September for a report to be prepared on his history of offending and the danger he posed. \u201cThis is a case on which the public interest is better represented by the probation service putting forward a complete history,\u201d she said. Ordering the defendant to be produced in court at the next hearing, McGowan said: \u201cThis is a case where the public might expect the defendant to be sitting in the dock.\u201d All the women made their allegations to the police in early 2018, shortly after the Parole Board announced it had decided he was fit to leave prison after serving less than nine years of an indeterminate sentence, plus time spent on remand. The offences he admitted on Thursday date back to between 2000 and 2008 in London. Police fear Worboys may have had as many as 100 victims but, despite at least 85 more women making complaints after his 2008 conviction, these are the first to come to court. At an earlier hearing in the latest case, the prosecutor, Jonathan Polnay, said the first of the four victims was told by Worboys, who now goes by the name John Derek Radford, that he had won money on the horses and was celebrating. He offered her champagne to celebrate and drinking it was her last memory that evening. \u201cShe woke up the next day naked with her clothes left in a trail on the way to her bed,\u201d he said. \u201cAll his previous convictions relate to a very particular, identical modus operandi: picking up women in taxis, claiming he had won money gambling \u2026 [offering] alcohol laced with a form of sedative.\u201d After fury from victims and MPs at the Parole Board\u2019s decision to release him, the high court ordered the board to carry out a \u201cfresh determination\u201d into the case and for Worboys to remain in prison in the interim. In the aftermath, Nick Hardwick was forced to resign as Parole Board chair. He then accused the justice secretary, David Gauke, of failing to take responsibility over an inadequate dossier provided by the Ministry of Justice.",

      "bodyText": "Peter Dutton has said women have been \u201ctrying it on\u201d in claiming they were raped and needed an abortion as part of a ploy to get to Australia for medical treatment from refugee centres on Nauru. Speaking to Sky News, the home affairs minister claimed the women then changed their minds on arriving in Australia and sought a legal injunction to prevent their return to offshore detention. Dutton also confirmed a number of medevac cases have been rejected by the immigration minister, with some of those rejection then overturned by the independent medical panel, which includes the government\u2019s chief medical officer. More than 30 people have been brought to Australia for medical treatment, under the recently introduced medevac laws, which were stridently opposed by the Coalition. Another 40 during the same time period have arrived under the original medical transfer process, which has brought about 1,000 people to Australia. Speaking to Sky News on Thursday, Dutton said \u201cyou could question whether people needed medical attention\u201d, and accused them of simply seeking to get to Australia and obtain legal injunctions preventing their return. \u201cSome people are trying it on,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s be serious about this. There are people who have claimed that they\u2019ve been raped and came to Australia to seek an abortion because they couldn\u2019t get an abortion on Nauru. They arrived in Australia and then decided they were not going to have an abortion. They have the baby here and the moment they step off the plane their lawyers lodge papers in the federal court which injuncts us from sending them back.\u201d In 2016 a federal court judge found Dutton had breached his duty of care to a woman who became pregnant as a result of rape, and exposed her to serious medical and legal risks in trying to avoid bringing her to Australia for an abortion. The medevac laws streamline and codify processes for refugees and asylum seekers who require care which they are not receiving in PNG or Nauru, and follow several years of complaints that transfer requests under the previous system were being blocked or ignored by the Australian and Nauruan governments. On Thursday Dutton said he was sure that some of the 1,000 or so people from offshore processing who had come to Australia for medical treatment over the years were of \u201cbad character\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any question about that,\u201d he said. He would not provide details of those cases, nor would he say what \u201cbad character\u201d meant. \u201cI\u2019ll go into those details at the appropriate time.\u201d Asked if any of the 30 people medically evacuated to Australia were not actually sick, Dutton said: \u201cI think you want to have a look at each of the cases.\u201d Dutton told Sky News that the doctors who assessed patients for medical evacuation were not government appointed and many had \u201cadvocacy backgrounds\u201d. The minister also railed against this week\u2019s federal court decision that set a precedent allowing for doctors to assess a medevac applicant\u2019s medical files, without needing to consult the patient in person or remotely. The federal court case noted it was not disputed by the home affairs department that the two doctors in question were acceptable assessors. Dutton suggested the existing transfer processes \u2013 under which the government has been accused of delaying transfers for up to five years for some people \u2013 gave the government greater capacity to return people once they received their medical attention. A number of asylum seekers and refugees have sought legal injunctions to stay in Australia under those processes. He did not explain why it was different under the medevac law. Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, earlier said the government already accepted \u201cdesktop reviews\u201d of medical records for student visas, and in tender documents specifically sought doctors to conduct desktop reviews for the medivac process. Keneally also quoted former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull to say \u201cwe know everything there is to know about these people\u201d. She said every asylum seeker and refugee in offshore processing environments had already gone through a security assessment, although not all have been cleared. She said the government had put forward no evidence for why the legislation should be repealed.",

      "bodyText": "A \u201cdisappointed\u201d Cory Bernardi will shut down his Australian Conservatives party as he considers his future in parliament. The renegade South Australian senator who sensationally quit the Liberal party in 2017 to form a Trump-inspired breakaway conservative movement told supporters on Thursday that he believed it was the \u201cwisest\u201d course of action after the party\u2019s poor showing at the May election. \u201cOur candidates, members and volunteers all did their best but as a party we received a tiny fraction of the votes we needed to be successful,\u201d he said in a note to supporters. \u201cThe inescapable conclusion from our lack of political success, our financial position and the re-election of a Morrison-led government is that the rationale for the creation of the Australian Conservatives is no longer valid.\u201d Bernardi attributed the party\u2019s poor result to Scott Morrison\u2019s success as prime minister, saying many potential voters had returned to the Coalition after Malcolm Turnbull was replaced. \u201cMalcolm Turnbull was leading a Labor-lite Coalition into political oblivion. As they abandoned their supporter base in pursuit of green-left policies, major party politics became an echo chamber rather than a battle of ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the decision to make Scott Morrison prime minister truly changed the political climate and our political fortunes. \u201cRather than punish the Coalition for another new leader, many conservatives breathed a sigh of relief that a man of faith and values was leading the Liberals back to their traditional policy platform.\u201d While his party attracted more than 20,000 supporters in its first year and successfully subsumed the SA-based Family First conservative movement, Bernardi was unable to mobilise sufficient electoral support. At the 18 May election, the party won just over 16,000 first preference votes in his home state of South Australia, compared with 53,000 for One Nation and 33,000 for the United Australia party. Many supporters had been confused about the party running only in the Senate and had wanted Bernardi to \u201cdeliberately court controversy\u201d to gain media attention during the campaign. \u201cWhile that may have worked, it would have undermined the very premise of what we offered to the Australian people: a credible and principled alternative to the political fringe,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately steady and sensible didn\u2019t work and it was frustrating that some single-interest parties gained more votes than we did despite having next to no electoral presence or campaign resources.\u201d He would soon begin the process of formally deregistering the Australian Conservatives as a political party, in what he said would be a \u201cdisappointment\u201d for his supporter base. The decision will stoke further speculation about Bernardi\u2019s future in parliament amid speculation that he could rejoin the Liberal party, despite his former colleagues attacking him for his \u201cbetrayal\u201d when he quit. But Bernardi is also understood to be considering whether he quits the Senate altogether, a move that would open up a Senate vacancy for the Liberals in South Australia because he is only midway through a six-year term. \u201cOn 7 February 2017 I told a journalist that political success for the Australian Conservatives could be loosely described as being no longer necessary because the Coalition had returned to its traditional policy roots and would once again win back the confidence of the Australian people,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that happened I said, \u2018I\u2019ll be gloriously fulfilled and I\u2019ll go fishing at Coffin Bay.\u2019 \u201cI am not quite ready for the fishing but the Morrison government victory and policy agenda suggests we are well on the way to restoring common sense in the Australian parliament. That is all we, as Australian Conservatives, have ever sought to do.\u201d",

There\u2019s the unappealing prospect of forgoing stuff, toning down your social life, or taking on a side hustle. But with a bit of careful planning, and a clear goal to motivate you, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly that.</p> <p><strong>How to save for a mortgage in your 20s<br></strong>Local newspaper journalist and blogger Sarah Howells decided in 2012 that she wanted to get on the property ladder before her 30th birthday \u2013 in May 2019. \u201cMy friends were all buying houses and it felt like the right move,\u201d she says. Sarah\u2019s original goal was to raise 10% of the price of a house in her area as a deposit \u2013 at the time around \u00a315,000. But with a competitive housing market, she eventually had to add an extra \u00a35,000 to her target. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to hit \u00a320,000 in seven years, which I reckon isn\u2019t too bad going,\u201d she says.</p> <p>To overcome the daunting prospect of putting away thousands of pounds, she broke her goal down into setting aside a few hundred pounds from her salary per month. When Sarah eventually started <a href=\"https://theglutenfreeblogger.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Gluten Free Blogger</a> alongside her day job, she set a new goal: to put away all the money she raised from the website. \u201cIt made it easier knowing I didn\u2019t have to sacrifice everything and could still live my life, by funding my savings goal through a side hustle I was passionate about,\u201d she says.

Eventually, she shifted to a savings account that gave her better interest rates.</p> <p>Sarah recommends that anyone trying to save for a mortgage should set a monthly goal and stick to it. \u201cI enjoyed being able to save and spend at the same time, but in hindsight it would have been nicer to commit a set amount each month and perhaps reach my goal a little quicker,\u201d she says. Day-to-day she made small sacrifices, such as eating out less and forgoing takeaway coffees. She also decided to put off some overseas holidays until after she had raised her deposit. \u201cAs the end came nearer, it felt easier to somehow find the money.\u201d Her next goal?

It\u2019s 10 July, 1999, and in the packed stands a partisan crowd looks on as Brandi Chastain makes the long, lonely walk from the centre-circle, catches the ball casually tossed her way and carefully places it on the penalty spot. Anxious not to catch the eye of China\u2019s goalkeeper, Gao Hong, who had psyched her out in similar circumstances earlier that year, Chastain turns away and retreats. One step, two steps, three steps, four steps, five steps, six. She turns back to face the goal, takes a final couple of paces backwards, another two forward and pauses for a breath.</p> <p>She begins her run-up, knowing Gao has done her homework and is expecting her to shoot with her right foot. It is why she has been practising with her left following a chat with the USA\u2019s head coach, Tony DiCicco. It is also why, after a scoreless draw over 90 minutes and an additional 30 of Golden Goal extra-time, he insisted the defender be named as the fifth penalty taker when she was originally down as sixth. It is why, having seen her team\u2019s goalkeeper, Briana Scurry, save China\u2019s third from Liu Ying, she now knows it is all down to her and her untested left peg.

      "bodyText": "The Rose Bowl, Pasadena \u2013 a virtual cauldron on a typically sweltering Californian summer\u2019s day. It\u2019s 10 July, 1999, and in the packed stands a partisan crowd looks on as Brandi Chastain makes the long, lonely walk from the centre-circle, catches the ball casually tossed her way and carefully places it on the penalty spot. Anxious not to catch the eye of China\u2019s goalkeeper, Gao Hong, who had psyched her out in similar circumstances earlier that year, Chastain turns away and retreats. One step, two steps, three steps, four steps, five steps, six. She turns back to face the goal, takes a final couple of paces backwards, another two forward and pauses for a breath. She begins her run-up, knowing Gao has done her homework and is expecting her to shoot with her right foot. It is why she has been practising with her left following a chat with the USA\u2019s head coach, Tony DiCicco. It is also why, after a scoreless draw over 90 minutes and an additional 30 of Golden Goal extra-time, he insisted the defender be named as the fifth penalty taker when she was originally down as sixth. It is why, having seen her team\u2019s goalkeeper, Briana Scurry, save China\u2019s third from Liu Ying, she now knows it is all down to her and her untested left peg. With the World Cup up for grabs, she begins her run-up and the 90,185 fans present hold their breath. Following a successful execution of the decisive spot-kick in a shootout, there is a brief moment when whoever scored it has time to process the magnitude of what they have just achieved. In the six seconds it took the first of Chastain\u2019s jubilant teammates to sprint from the halfway line to swarm her in celebration, she found time to turn an entire sport on its head. In the fleeting second it took one particular TV camera to cut back to the player, having just captured her left-foot drive fizzing beyond Gao, Chastain removed her shirt and swung it in triumph above her head.

I like Dropbox\u2019s interface and ease of use from the mobile app, but \u00a390 seems steep for what I require. What cheaper options do I have for securely storing about 500GB of photos and files? <strong>Kate</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Most of us just evolve the way we do things by making convenient short-term decisions. A price jolt should prompt you to rethink how you are storing your data, where you are storing it, and why. Different people have different devices and different needs, so I can\u2019t pick the best strategy for you or anybody else. However, I can give you a few things the think about.</p> <p>The core question, of course, is why you need to store 500GB of stuff online in the first place. You could buy a 4TB external hard drive for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Seagate-Expansion-Portable-PlayStation-STEA4000400/dp/B017KE8OG0\">less than \u00a390</a>.</p> <p>The first and best reason is that you often need access to the same data from multiple devices, some of which you use while away from home. The second \u2013 very sensible \u2013 reason might be that you want an off-site backup where your data will be safe if you\u2019re burgled, your house burns down, or there is some other catastrophe.</p> <p>A third reason might be that you are sharing your photos and (less likely) data with friends and family, or possibly with the public. Millions of people shared their photos on Flickr, and billions share reduced-quality versions on social networking services such as Facebook and Instagram.</p> <p>A fourth reason might be that you have no way to keep a local backup. If so, you are in trouble. Online storage services are like lobster pots: it\u2019s easy to get into them but hard to get out.</p> <p>In a better world, you would be able to move 500GB of data from one service to any other in a few seconds, without downloading it and re-uploading it. Sadly, that\u2019s not the case today. And if your data only exists in one online storage pot, then you have no backup and your data is at risk. People lose data every day because they forget and can\u2019t recover passwords, their accounts are hacked, or their service provider has a hardware malfunction or makes a mistake.</p> <p>Some people lose data when services change their terms, like Flickr, or go bust, like Streamload. Some people lost data when Megaupload\u2019s servers were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure_of_Megaupload\">seized by the FBI</a>. Some could lose data when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault#The_next_%22Big_One%22\">The Big One</a> hits California. Having only one copy of their data in one online pot is a gamble that many people will lose.</p> <p>You should have local copies and backups of everything, so that you can walk away and just let Dropbox close your account. If you are not in that position, keep paying Dropbox until you are.</p> <h2><strong>Popular cloud services</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c97e888a95f3da8efd956259943d6c8925ca9a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c97e888a95f3da8efd956259943d6c8925ca9a2/1821_450_1679_1008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google offers a variety of cloud services, including Google Drive and Photos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google offers a variety of cloud services, including Google Drive and Photos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters Photographer/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/plans\">Dropbox</a> has increased its starting price to \u00a395.88 a year, which is \u00a37.99 a month if paid annually. However, it also doubled the storage allowance to 2TB, which used to cost about $200 (\u00a3158) a year, and it has added some extra features. It\u2019s still competitive with other leading services that usually don\u2019t store 30 days of revisions or let you easily undo a file deletion.</p> <p><a href=\"https://one.google.com/storage\">Google One</a>, as it\u2019s now called, charges \u00a37.99 a month for 2TB, which drops to an annual fee of \u00a379.99 a year. At that price, I\u2019d stay with Dropbox. It\u2019s better.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/photos/storage\">Amazon Drive</a> costs \u00a379.99 a year for 1TB and \u00a3159.98 a year for 2TB. <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201238\">Apple\u2019s iCloud</a> is relatively cheap at \u00a36.99 a month for 2TB. <a href=\"https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-GB/plans/\">Microsoft OneDrive</a> only goes up to 50GB for storage, at \u00a31.99 a month, but you get 1TB with Office 365 Personal for \u00a35.99 a month or \u00a359.99 a year.</p> <p>Less familiar suppliers are sometimes but not always cheaper. Kim Dotcom\u2019s New Zealand-based <a href=\"https://mega.nz/pro\">Mega</a> charges \u00a38.91 a month for 1TB. Canada\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.sync.com/pricing-personal/\">Sync</a> charges $49 a year for 500GB and $96 a year for 2TB. America\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.idrive.com/pricing\">IDrive</a> charges $69.50 for 2TB. The UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.zoolz.com/home/pricing/\">Zoolz</a> charges \u00a35.49 a month (paid annually) for 500GB or \u00a39.99 a month for a 1TB Family Plus plan, intended to back up 15 computers for up to five users. Like some other online services, Zoolz seems more oriented towards backing up PCs.</p> <p>At the moment, your best bet appears to be Switzerland-based <a href=\"https://www.pcloud.com/cloud-storage-pricing-plans.html\">pCloud</a>, which offers 500GB for \u00a33.59 a month or \u00a342.99 a year, and 2TB for \u00a37.99 a month or \u00a384.99 a year. Better still, pCloud is currently offering a lifetime 500GB for a single payment of \u00a3160 (usually \u00a3430) or 2TB for \u00a3320 (usually \u00a3850). I\u2019ve not used the service, but you could try its free 10GB offering and see if it suits you.</p> <h2><strong>Cheap photo storage</strong></h2> <p>Think about splitting your photo storage and your data storage. If you are like me, you have large image files \u2013 each jpeg from my Nikon D7500 takes up about 12MB \u2013 and relatively small text files. My Work folder holds more than 10,000 files but still consumes less than 3GB. I could zip it, password protect it and store it in any of the free online drives, except Dropbox.</p> <p>Flickr used to be a great place to store 1TB of images for free, but late last year, Verizon sold it to Smugmug. <a href=\"https://www.smugmug.com/plans/basic/\">Smugmug</a> charges $5.99 a month or $48 a year for unlimited photo storage. That\u2019s not a bad deal for a service that works really well with photographs.</p> <p>Both Amazon and Google also offer unlimited photo storage, with slight catches.</p> <p>Amazon Photos is free with an Amazon Prime account, and part of its appeal is that it will accept and display RAW files, not just jpegs. And while it can analyse and tag your photos for search purposes, that\u2019s optional.</p> <p>Google Photos, born out of the wreck that was Google Plus, offers unlimited storage as long as your photos are <a href=\"https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6220791\">less than 16MP</a>. This makes it useless for most serious photographers, at least as a backup service. Google also uses machine learning to analyse your photos so that you can search for people, places and things. Search is a useful feature, but photos give away vast amounts of personal information.</p> <p>If you use an Android phone, your snaps are stored in Google Photos, and you can choose to clear local copies from your phone to save space and pull them down from the cloud on demand \u2013 internet connection required. Amazon Photos can do something similar.</p> <p>Test any photo storage site before you commit to using it. Upload a couple of photos and then download them to make sure they still have the same dimensions in pixels, that the files are the same size, and that they have the same names. This rules out Facebook, Instagram, Imgur and many other services.</p> <h2><strong>SD cards might be an alternative</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0862c70c7be90c710215bff1a4a7dde4ab8593e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0862c70c7be90c710215bff1a4a7dde4ab8593e/266_31_1148_689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MicroSD cards are small and are handy for backing up data on the move.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MicroSD cards are small and are handy for backing up data on the move.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Online storage sites are really handy for storing smartphone pictures until you can download and archive them, and for sharing photos with other people. However, SD cards are getting so much bigger and cheaper that they\u2019re an increasingly attractive alternative.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been buying <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-Mobile-UK-MicroSD-Adapter/dp/B06XFHQGB9\">Samsung EVO Plus</a> micro-SD cards on Amazon, and the current prices are \u00a321.75 for 128GB, \u00a347 for 256GB and \u00a394.88 for 512GB. I\u2019ve also bought a few <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/SanDisk-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter-Performance/dp/B073JYC4XM\">SanDisk Ultra</a> cards, which can be a little more expensive, but pop up on special deals. One week last month, for example, you could buy 128GB SanDisk Ultra cards for \u00a314.99, and in April, 256GB cards dropped to \u00a337.99.</p> <p>All my photos are on three hard drives (each PC is backed up to a 2TB or 3TB drive, and the backups are backed up to an 8TB drive), but SD cards make it easy to create an off-site backup.</p> <p>Also, if you have a laptop with a card slot, you can hide as much data as you\u2019re likely to need while travelling somewhere about your person. Micro-SD cards are tiny. The obvious drawback is that, unless you encrypt the data, they are not secure if you lose them.</p> <p><strong>Have you got a question?

The second \u2013 very sensible \u2013 reason might be that you want an off-site backup where your data will be safe if you\u2019re burgled, your house burns down, or there is some other catastrophe. A third reason might be that you are sharing your photos and (less likely) data with friends and family, or possibly with the public. Millions of people shared their photos on Flickr, and billions share reduced-quality versions on social networking services such as Facebook and Instagram. A fourth reason might be that you have no way to keep a local backup. If so, you are in trouble. Online storage services are like lobster pots: it\u2019s easy to get into them but hard to get out. In a better world, you would be able to move 500GB of data from one service to any other in a few seconds, without downloading it and re-uploading it. Sadly, that\u2019s not the case today. And if your data only exists in one online storage pot, then you have no backup and your data is at risk. People lose data every day because they forget and can\u2019t recover passwords, their accounts are hacked, or their service provider has a hardware malfunction or makes a mistake. Some people lose data when services change their terms, like Flickr, or go bust, like Streamload. Some people lost data when Megaupload\u2019s servers were seized by the FBI. Some could lose data when The Big One hits California. Having only one copy of their data in one online pot is a gamble that many people will lose. You should have local copies and backups of everything, so that you can walk away and just let Dropbox close your account. If you are not in that position, keep paying Dropbox until you are. Popular cloud services Dropbox has increased its starting price to \u00a395.88 a year, which is \u00a37.99 a month if paid annually. However, it also doubled the storage allowance to 2TB, which used to cost about $200 (\u00a3158) a year, and it has added some extra features. It\u2019s still competitive with other leading services that usually don\u2019t store 30 days of revisions or let you easily undo a file deletion. Google One, as it\u2019s now called, charges \u00a37.99 a month for 2TB, which drops to an annual fee of \u00a379.99 a year. At that price, I\u2019d stay with Dropbox. It\u2019s better. Amazon Drive costs \u00a379.99 a year for 1TB and \u00a3159.98 a year for 2TB. Apple\u2019s iCloud is relatively cheap at \u00a36.99 a month for 2TB. Microsoft OneDrive only goes up to 50GB for storage, at \u00a31.99 a month, but you get 1TB with Office 365 Personal for \u00a35.99 a month or \u00a359.99 a year. Less familiar suppliers are sometimes but not always cheaper. Kim Dotcom\u2019s New Zealand-based Mega charges \u00a38.91 a month for 1TB. Canada\u2019s Sync charges $49 a year for 500GB and $96 a year for 2TB. America\u2019s IDrive charges $69.50 for 2TB. The UK\u2019s Zoolz charges \u00a35.49 a month (paid annually) for 500GB or \u00a39.99 a month for a 1TB Family Plus plan, intended to back up 15 computers for up to five users. Like some other online services, Zoolz seems more oriented towards backing up PCs. At the moment, your best bet appears to be Switzerland-based pCloud, which offers 500GB for \u00a33.59 a month or \u00a342.99 a year, and 2TB for \u00a37.99 a month or \u00a384.99 a year. Better still, pCloud is currently offering a lifetime 500GB for a single payment of \u00a3160 (usually \u00a3430) or 2TB for \u00a3320 (usually \u00a3850). I\u2019ve not used the service, but you could try its free 10GB offering and see if it suits you. Cheap photo storage Think about splitting your photo storage and your data storage. If you are like me, you have large image files \u2013 each jpeg from my Nikon D7500 takes up about 12MB \u2013 and relatively small text files. My Work folder holds more than 10,000 files but still consumes less than 3GB. I could zip it, password protect it and store it in any of the free online drives, except Dropbox. Flickr used to be a great place to store 1TB of images for free, but late last year, Verizon sold it to Smugmug. Smugmug charges $5.99 a month or $48 a year for unlimited photo storage. That\u2019s not a bad deal for a service that works really well with photographs. Both Amazon and Google also offer unlimited photo storage, with slight catches. Amazon Photos is free with an Amazon Prime account, and part of its appeal is that it will accept and display RAW files, not just jpegs. And while it can analyse and tag your photos for search purposes, that\u2019s optional. Google Photos, born out of the wreck that was Google Plus, offers unlimited storage as long as your photos are less than 16MP. This makes it useless for most serious photographers, at least as a backup service. Google also uses machine learning to analyse your photos so that you can search for people, places and things. Search is a useful feature, but photos give away vast amounts of personal information. If you use an Android phone, your snaps are stored in Google Photos, and you can choose to clear local copies from your phone to save space and pull them down from the cloud on demand \u2013 internet connection required. Amazon Photos can do something similar. Test any photo storage site before you commit to using it. Upload a couple of photos and then download them to make sure they still have the same dimensions in pixels, that the files are the same size, and that they have the same names. This rules out Facebook, Instagram, Imgur and many other services. SD cards might be an alternative Online storage sites are really handy for storing smartphone pictures until you can download and archive them, and for sharing photos with other people. However, SD cards are getting so much bigger and cheaper that they\u2019re an increasingly attractive alternative. I\u2019ve been buying Samsung EVO Plus micro-SD cards on Amazon, and the current prices are \u00a321.75 for 128GB, \u00a347 for 256GB and \u00a394.88 for 512GB. I\u2019ve also bought a few SanDisk Ultra cards, which can be a little more expensive, but pop up on special deals. One week last month, for example, you could buy 128GB SanDisk Ultra cards for \u00a314.99, and in April, 256GB cards dropped to \u00a337.99. All my photos are on three hard drives (each PC is backed up to a 2TB or 3TB drive, and the backups are backed up to an 8TB drive), but SD cards make it easy to create an off-site backup. Also, if you have a laptop with a card slot, you can hide as much data as you\u2019re likely to need while travelling somewhere about your person. Micro-SD cards are tiny. The obvious drawback is that, unless you encrypt the data, they are not secure if you lose them. Have you got a question? Email it to Ask.Jack@theguardian.com",

Ethical lobbying is a valuable and important element of a healthy democracy. It helps those who have a stake in government policy to convey their views and expertise. There are two broad types of lobbyists: third-party lobbyists, who are engaged as consultants; in-house lobbyists, who work directly for corporations or interest groups.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who hires lobbyists? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For many Australians, lobbying conjures images of powerful corporations working to sway politicians behind the scenes. There is a truth in that. The big banks, mining and energy giants, pharmaceutical companies, casinos, Amazon, Google and Facebook all engage lobbyists. But lobbyists also work on behalf of not-for-profits and community groups, including for veterans, social workers, aged-care staff, school principals and environmental organisations.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the lobbyist register? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The lobbyist register is the public's only window into the world of lobbying. It's a publicly available online list of lobbying firms, individual lobbyists and their clients. The register was a huge step forward when it was introduced in 2008, but remains frustratingly opaque. It doesn't tell us who is lobbying whom, about what, or when. Compare that with the ACT, where lobbyists are required to file quarterly reports on their activities, or NSW, where ministers are required to publish their diaries. The federal register is also completely blind to the activities of in-house lobbyists.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the lobbyist code of conduct?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The code tells lobbyists how they must behave when approaching the government and is designed to maintain ethical standards. But the code is not legislated and has no real teeth. It goes largely unenforced and the punishments are weak. The worst sanction available to authorities is removing a lobbyist from the register. The US and Canada have fines or jail terms for law breaches.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who keeps an eye on lobbyists? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Federally it's the prime minister's&nbsp; department that loosely oversees lobbying. It takes on a largely administrative role, rather than an investigative or regulatory one. Its core job is to maintain the register and communicate the code's requirements to lobbyists. It lacks independence, relies on reports of bad lobbying and rarely, if ever, takes enforcement action.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Taylor, however, said he had met with no lobbyists, either in-house or third-party, in the three months.</p> \n<p>Storer doubted the accuracy of that statement and called on Taylor to reconsider his response.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt would seem to me that minister Taylor and Price have only disclosed meetings they have had with registered third-party lobbyists, despite me specifically asking them to also provide me with details of meetings they had with both in-house and third-party lobbyists,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe response from minister Taylor and Price stands in stark contrast to the comprehensive list provided by Senator Cormann.</p> \n<p>\u201cI encourage minister Taylor and Price to revisit the terms of the question I put to them and return to me with a more accurate list.\u201d</p> \n<p>A spokeswoman for Taylor said he had relied on the definition of lobbyists in the federal lobbying rules.

Outgoing crossbench senator Tim Storer used his last days in Senate estimates to put a series of questions to cabinet ministers about their dealings with lobbyists, both in-house and third-party, between January and April this year. He has received three responses: from Cormann, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, and the then environment minister, Melissa Price. Cormann provided a comprehensive list of 31 groups he had met with, including representatives from Santos, Anglo American, Rio Tinto, Google, Ebay, IBM Global Markets, AmazonPrime, the West Australian hotels lobby and Wesfarmers. The list is far more illuminating than the lobbyist register \u2013 the public\u2019s only real window into lobbying of Australian politicians \u2013 which gives no sense of who ministers are giving access to. Storer has applauded Cormann\u2019s openness and said he hoped it could set a precedent for transparency.

Bossy Group\u2019s clients include Emanuel Exports, the company at the centre of the live export controversy, and the Indian IT consulting conglomerate Infosys.

After weeks of negotiating a fee for the scorer of one of the finest own goals you\u2019ll ever see, they\u2019ve finally done it. Ed Woodward has finally done it! He really has! Hooray for Ed! They\u2019ll be building a statue of him outside Old Trafford any day now! Forget the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand \u2013 how about the Sir Ed Woodward Stand? It has a nice ring to it. Except \u2026 hang on \u2026 hang on a minute \u2026 look here \u2026 oh \u2026 it says here \u2026 \u201ccontrary to earlier reports\u201d \u2026 oh \u2026 oh dear \u2026 Manchester United and Crystal Palace haven\u2019t agreed a \u00a355m fee for Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Oh. Oh dear. Oh Ed. Cancel the statue. Unless, of course, United manage to complete a deal for Bournemouth\u2019s wispy genius David Brooks. Plus they\u2019ve found an alternative to Wan-Bissaka. Only, Norwich City have said that their prodigy Max Aarons is going nowhere. Similarly, West Ham have told United to go away and stop asking them about Issa Diop and Declan Rice. Ask me again, Manuel Pellegrini has said, and I\u2019ll develop an interest in Marcus Rashford. See how you like it. Plans are afoot to end Neymar\u2019s two-year sabbatical from football. The Brazilian has been looking at houses in Barcelona, but he could yet be heading to Real Madrid. Zinedine Zidane\u2019s side are said to have offered Paris Saint-Germain \u00a3115m for the forward and are ready to lob Gareth Bale and James Rodr\u00edguez into the deal as an added treat. However, Madrid will have to be quick if they want to sign Paul Pogba. Juventus remain ahead of them in the race to prise the midfielder away from United. Jorginho is going to follow Maurizio Sarri to Juventus and leave Chelsea for \u00a350m. Phew. That means N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 can get back in his proper position, meaning Proper Football Men everywhere can relax. Arsenal are after Celtic full-back Kieran Tierney, Saint-Etienne\u2019s William Saliba and Red Bull Salzburg\u2019s Dominik Szoboszlai, while they are set to sell David Ospina to Napoli for \u00a34m and could let Carl Jenkinson join West Brom. Tom Heaton has rejected a new contract at Burnley and is set to leave Turf Moor on a free. Newcastle\u2019s Mo Diam\u00e9 is expected to join Al-Gharafa in Qatar when his contract runs out at the end of the month. Sheffield United, Aston Villa and West Brom are fighting over Blackburn\u2019s Bradley Dack. Internazionale and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid want Southampton\u2019s Ryan Bertrand. Lower those eyebrows. How rude.",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hammond, who is currently locked in a battle with Theresa May over spending commitments the prime minister wishes to make as part of her legacy, suggested he had been alarmed at candidates splashing the cash in their campaign promises.</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s plan to raise the 40% tax threshold from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000 is said to cost \u00a314.1bn.

While an eye-popping 16-0 aggregate has been a little surprising, the wins over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/12/usa-thailand-womens-world-cup-soccer\">Thailand</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/17/usa-chile-celebration-carli-lloyd-world-cup\">Chile</a> were expected. Sweden, however, is another story: anything can happen.</p> <p>The team\u2019s coach, Jill Ellis, admits that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/12/usa-lose-womens-football-sweden-olympic-quarter-finals-penalty-kicks\">losing to Sweden in 2016</a> was a wake-up call and she has been trying to figure out how to avoid a similar failure ever since.</p> <p>\u201cThat was the first time we had seen a team like Sweden \u2013 a very established, veteran team \u2013 take an approach to sit low on us and sit in their own half,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cUsually when you play teams that can\u2019t match up with you, they take that approach, but here was a world power in soccer taking that approach. That game made me realize that if teams aren\u2019t going to give us the space, we need make sure we have players who can create space.\u201d</p> <p>Ellis and the US haven\u2019t looked the same since that game. While <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/National-Team-Inside-Changed-Soccer/dp/1419734490/\">the dramatic firing of Hope Solo for calling the Swedish team \u201ccowards\u201d</a> overshadowed the tactics on the day, that loss to Sweden may go down as the single most influential game in Ellis\u2019s tenure.</p> <p>In a quest to make the Americans an even more potent attacking unit \u2013 and better equipped to beat an absorb-and-counter opponent \u2013 Ellis has left no stone unturned. She has given 30 players their first call-ups since the Olympics, and 20 of them have been capped. She has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/05/uswnt-soccer-defense-turnover-united-states\">squeezed veterans out of the picture</a>, tinkered endlessly with new formations and has made defending secondary to a brute-force, relentless all-team attacking style.</p> <p>Whether Ellis\u2019s turn toward a heavier emphasis on scoring goals has been the right one <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/how-the-uswn-ts-biggest-loss-in-recent-memory-exposed-an-issue-it-still-hasnt-solved-012137380.html\">is up for debate</a>, and an answer may only come on 7 July in the World Cup final. But there is no question that Sweden helped mold the US team into what we have seen in France this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/11/usa-thailand-uswnt-womens-world-cup-soccer-match-report\">13-0 scorelines and all</a>.</p> <p>And yet, the oddity is this: as much as Sweden present the first true test of the Americans\u2019 form in this World Cup and may be ultimate benchmark, the smartest option for the US may be to throw their match and let the Swedes win.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89619429c59bf8e07744a5033a1addf9de1bcd5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89619429c59bf8e07744a5033a1addf9de1bcd5c/0_0_1623_1057/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Morgan and Kelley O'Hara\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Morgan, left, and Kelley O\u2019Hara work out during a training session on Wednesday in Touques.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After all, if the Americans were to beat Sweden on Thursday, they\u2019ll top Group F and remain on a path to face hosts France \u2013 most bookies\u2019 favorite to win the tournament \u2013 in the quarter-final. If the Americans were to lose, however, their quarter-final match-up would likely be Germany, who haven\u2019t looked too convincing thus far, especially with star player Dzsenifer Marozsan nursing a toe injury.</p> <p>It is reminiscent of the England v Belgium group match at the men\u2019s World Cup last summer. On paper, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/24/what-next-for-england-world-cup\">neither team wanted to win the game</a> because the winner would have to face Brazil in a tougher path to the final. Belgium won it, beat Brazil in the quarter-finals anyway, and eventually saw England again in the third-place game, which Belgium also won.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t overthink this,\u201d Ellis says. \u201cDeciding to come second or manipulating a score, that can be dangerous.

      "bodyText": "Megan Rapinoe insists that she has moved on from the 2016 Olympics, when Sweden handed the US women\u2019s national team their earliest ever exit from a major tournament. Told by a reporter from Expressen that the Swedish players say they have the mental edge due to that history, Rapinoe shrugged off that notion. \u201cIt was three years ago \u2013 I personally wouldn\u2019t take a lot of confidence from that nor would I feel bad about it or think we\u2019re at a disadvantage from it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve both grown and evolved over that time.\u201d But then Rapinoe laughed. \u201cMaybe I say that because we lost, so I want to put it behind me. It\u2019s not something we don\u2019t remember \u2013 we definitely have that in the back of our minds.\u201d Indeed, the Americans may have bulldozed their way through the Women\u2019s World Cup in France so far \u2013 but they haven\u2019t really been tested yet. While an eye-popping 16-0 aggregate has been a little surprising, the wins over Thailand and Chile were expected. Sweden, however, is another story: anything can happen. The team\u2019s coach, Jill Ellis, admits that losing to Sweden in 2016 was a wake-up call and she has been trying to figure out how to avoid a similar failure ever since. \u201cThat was the first time we had seen a team like Sweden \u2013 a very established, veteran team \u2013 take an approach to sit low on us and sit in their own half,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cUsually when you play teams that can\u2019t match up with you, they take that approach, but here was a world power in soccer taking that approach. That game made me realize that if teams aren\u2019t going to give us the space, we need make sure we have players who can create space.\u201d Ellis and the US haven\u2019t looked the same since that game. While the dramatic firing of Hope Solo for calling the Swedish team \u201ccowards\u201d overshadowed the tactics on the day, that loss to Sweden may go down as the single most influential game in Ellis\u2019s tenure. In a quest to make the Americans an even more potent attacking unit \u2013 and better equipped to beat an absorb-and-counter opponent \u2013 Ellis has left no stone unturned. She has given 30 players their first call-ups since the Olympics, and 20 of them have been capped. She has squeezed veterans out of the picture, tinkered endlessly with new formations and has made defending secondary to a brute-force, relentless all-team attacking style. Whether Ellis\u2019s turn toward a heavier emphasis on scoring goals has been the right one is up for debate, and an answer may only come on 7 July in the World Cup final. But there is no question that Sweden helped mold the US team into what we have seen in France this month, 13-0 scorelines and all. And yet, the oddity is this: as much as Sweden present the first true test of the Americans\u2019 form in this World Cup and may be ultimate benchmark, the smartest option for the US may be to throw their match and let the Swedes win. After all, if the Americans were to beat Sweden on Thursday, they\u2019ll top Group F and remain on a path to face hosts France \u2013 most bookies\u2019 favorite to win the tournament \u2013 in the quarter-final. If the Americans were to lose, however, their quarter-final match-up would likely be Germany, who haven\u2019t looked too convincing thus far, especially with star player Dzsenifer Marozsan nursing a toe injury. It is reminiscent of the England v Belgium group match at the men\u2019s World Cup last summer. On paper, neither team wanted to win the game because the winner would have to face Brazil in a tougher path to the final. Belgium won it, beat Brazil in the quarter-finals anyway, and eventually saw England again in the third-place game, which Belgium also won. \u201cYou can\u2019t overthink this,\u201d Ellis says. \u201cDeciding to come second or manipulating a score, that can be dangerous. You need your team to be in a really good place. Feeling good about your performance is the best confidence-maker out there.\u201d Indeed, if the Americans wanted to game the system, they probably wouldn\u2019t have pummeled Thailand with 13 goals, which was probably about eight more goals than would ever reasonably be necessary. The Americans only seem to have one level they play at, without any margin to scale back. \u201cI struggle to tell my team not to tackle each other in training the day before a game,\u201d Ellis says. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s about making sure your focus is on yourself and making sure we play as well as we possibly can in every game.\u201d For all the Americans changes in the last three years, Sweden aren\u2019t exactly the same team either.

Seventy acres of mangroves are to be preserved in a special reserve, he said, while up to 60 acres of land will be set aside for a nursery to grow 100,000 trees. Browne maintains the project will bring \u201cenormous employment and economic opportunities\u201d and that the manufacturing base will boost GDP, reduce the need for imports and help diversify the country\u2019s tourism-dependent economy. Some locals may take further convincing. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to tout the economic benefits but they\u2019re not weighing up the environmental harm and the economic fallout,\u201d Hill adds. \u201cMany people \u2013 including myself, who grew up near there swimming, fishing and boating \u2013 have strong cultural and heritage ties to the area; it\u2019s part of who we are.\u201d",

Both his wins came when Toyota faced no manufacturer competition and were the class of the field.</p> <p>This is changing, however. For the 2020-21 World Endurance Championship season and Le Mans, the ACO and the FIA, as organisers, announced last weekend that new Hypercar regulations would define the top class. It is designed to cut costs, create a level playing field and encourage participation of both prototypes and entries based on road-going production cars.</p> <p>Toyota have signed up and Aston Martin, on the anniversary of their victory at Le Mans for Roy Salvadori and Carroll Shelby in the DBR1 in 1959, announced they will join them with the Adrian Newey-designed Valkyrie. McLaren are already in the process of investigating entry, as are numerous privateers. The prospects of it developing into a strong, closely matched field are good and one where a win may be hard fought across a range of designs.</p> <p>The hope is to revitalise the front of the grid but for Tandy the strength of Le Mans has always been in the depth. \u201cIt\u2019s our World Cup final,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Le Mans you have all the best teams. The best cars, the best drivers from all over the globe together across classes.\u201d</p> <p>A Porsche factory driver who competes full time for the team in the US Weathertech sportscar championship, Tandy also has class wins at the Daytona 24 and the Sebring 12 hours. In his seventh Le Mans this year he finished third in a highly competitive GTE Pro class and his appetite to return is undiminished.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>After his overall win in 2015, Tandy was disappointed not to defend the title the following year as Porsche cut their entries to two.

Both his wins came when Toyota faced no manufacturer competition and were the class of the field. This is changing, however. For the 2020-21 World Endurance Championship season and Le Mans, the ACO and the FIA, as organisers, announced last weekend that new Hypercar regulations would define the top class. It is designed to cut costs, create a level playing field and encourage participation of both prototypes and entries based on road-going production cars. Toyota have signed up and Aston Martin, on the anniversary of their victory at Le Mans for Roy Salvadori and Carroll Shelby in the DBR1 in 1959, announced they will join them with the Adrian Newey-designed Valkyrie. McLaren are already in the process of investigating entry, as are numerous privateers. The prospects of it developing into a strong, closely matched field are good and one where a win may be hard fought across a range of designs. The hope is to revitalise the front of the grid but for Tandy the strength of Le Mans has always been in the depth. \u201cIt\u2019s our World Cup final,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Le Mans you have all the best teams. The best cars, the best drivers from all over the globe together across classes.\u201d A Porsche factory driver who competes full time for the team in the US Weathertech sportscar championship, Tandy also has class wins at the Daytona 24 and the Sebring 12 hours. In his seventh Le Mans this year he finished third in a highly competitive GTE Pro class and his appetite to return is undiminished. After his overall win in 2015, Tandy was disappointed not to defend the title the following year as Porsche cut their entries to two. He drove instead for them in the GT field. Fiercely loyal to the team whose record as the most successful at the race has perhaps defined the marque more than anything, he just wants to keep coming back to Le Mans and battling for another victory, be it outright or in class. \u201cThe desire to win, to compete remains the same,\u201d Tandy said before this year\u2019s race. Enthusiasm for this grand institution reflects that of so many other drivers and the reason why Le Mans will remain of importance long after the furore around Alonso\u2019s participation has faded.",

      "bodyText": "The sister-in-law of federal MP Angus Taylor has faced questions in the New South Wales parliament over whether she sought to influence the state government\u2019s submissions on the upgrading of an endangered grass species that was prevalent on land part-owned by the federal minister. Bronwyn Taylor, who is a NSW Nationals MP, was asked at question time about the issue that was at the centre of a state investigation and is currently being pursued by the federal environment department. The issue of federal and state protection for Monaro grasslands is the focus of a Guardian Australia investigation. On Wednesday, the Guardian revealed that Angus Taylor had sought briefings on the listing of grasslands in 2017, just a day after a company in which he has an interest met with federal compliance officers over potential illegal clearing charges. The company in question, Jam Land, had bought land near Delegate in 2016 and sprayed 30 hectares around November of that year, killing a critically endangered species. Angus Taylor has an interest in Jam Land as do Bronwyn Taylor and Duncan Taylor, Angus\u2019s brother, via their company Fairross. Richard Taylor, another brother, is a director. The Taylors have other substantial farming interests on the Monaro plains. In NSW parliament on Thursday, the opposition environment spokeswoman, Penny Sharpe, asked Bronwyn Taylor whether she had involved herself in any representations about the NSW government submission about the commonwealth up-listing of Monaro grassland to \u201ccritically endangered\u201d in 2016. The question was ruled out of order because it related to Taylor\u2019s personal actions and not her ministerial responsibilities, so she did not answer. She was also asked about a federal department meeting with the NSW Local Land Services to discuss the listing immediately after Angus Taylor had contacted the federal minister, Josh Frydenberg, in March 2017. Local Land Services are NSW bodies set up to facilitate communication with rural land holders and to \u201cimprove primary production within healthy landscapes\u201d. Their aim is to promote sustainable farming practices. The head of the Local Land Services in the south-east at the time of the alleged poisoning of the grasslands was David Mitchell, who was also a shareholder in Jam Land. Sharpe said there had been \u201ccommunity concern\u201d about the meeting. The NSW and federal environmental authorities both began investigations into Jam Land\u2019s land-clearing in 2017 following complaints from a neighbour. The NSW investigation was dropped by April despite the government\u2019s expert finding that the poisoning site had likely contained slightly more than 50% native grasses, judging by the remaining grassland around it. The NSW Native Vegetation Act protects native grassland if it is more than 50% native species. But it can be cleared without prior approval if it is less than that. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia under state freedom-of-information laws show that Jam Land strongly disputed that the cleared land was more than 50% native and produced it own report from agronomist Stuart Burge. He had made his assessment in October 2016 of a 40-hectare sample area and had concluded that the native ground cover pre-clearing was slightly less than the 50% threshold. The NSW Office of Environment and Heritage then agreed to a further site inspection, by pre-eminent native grassland and remediation expert Kenneth Hodgkinson, of the CSIRO, who concluded that \u201cit is possible there was about 50% or less native grassland cover prior to clearing\u201d, a file note from the department says. However, the federal investigation remained a source of great irritation to Richard Taylor who complained about it in the rural press. Documents obtained under federal FOI laws from the federal bureaucracy reveal that Angus Taylor approached the then environment minister, Frydenberg, who facilitated meetings for him with senior departmental staff in March 2017 . Taylor has said he did not raise the compliance action and the purpose of the meetings was to receive briefings on the grasslands listing. Frydenberg\u2019s minister\u2019s office asked for the head of compliance to attend but the department said in a statement to the Guardian that she did not attend the meeting. The documents reveal the department was aware that the Jam Land investigation involved the Taylor family and the matter was highly sensitive. The FOI also revealed that Frydenberg\u2019s office sought advice from the department about whether it could water down the listing and go against its own Threatened Species Scientific Committee advice. They wanted to know whether the decision would need to be published or whether it could be kept secret.",

On Thursday, Charteris joined McLaren\u2019s victims in questioning where that money was. \u201cEven James Bond would have trouble spending $900,000 a year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary sum of money [and] no real explanation has been given for where it is. \u201cI cannot conclude that some of the money is not still in this country or overseas, all I can say is the endeavours of police have not been able to locate it but I simply cannot say he spent it all.\u201d Outside the court, some of his victims said they felt \u201chappy and sad\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change what\u2019s happened \u2026 the next question is where is the money,\u201d one said. A number of his victims said they were sure McLaren had money hidden off shore but that finding it would be \u201clike tracking a flock of pigeons\u201d. McLaren will be eligible for parole in July 2029.",

      "bodyText": "The Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, has ruled out the government buying the copyright of the Aboriginal flag from its designer following a dispute that has affected businesses and two major football codes. After what Wyatt called a \u201cwarm and friendly\u201d meeting with designer Harold Thomas in Darwin on Thursday, the minister said the government would not be buying the rights to the flag. \u201cMr Thomas shared his and his family\u2019s deep concern to protect the integrity of the flag for all Australians, and reiterated his creative rights to his artwork,\u201d the minister said in a statement. \u201cThe Australian government is not seeking to buy the rights to the flag,\u201d Wyatt said, noting that it is one of our national flags and can be flown freely by anyone. \u201cIt resonates strongly and binds people together and Mr Thomas holds the exclusive copyright to the flag. It tells his story as both an artist and an Indigenous person. \u201cHis main concern is to protect the integrity of the flag and I stand with him on this.\u201d Copyright of the flag rests with Thomas, after the federal court found he was the sole copyright owner in 1997. Since then, he has entered into a number of licensing arrangements, most recently with the non-Indigenous-owned company Wam Clothing in November 2018. Wam Clothing sent notice to at least one company, the Aboriginal-owned social enterprise Spark Health, to stop producing clothing featuring the design and is in \u201congoing discussions\u201d with the NRL and the AFL to licence the flag on their jerseys. A spokesperson for Wam Clothing said the company \u201chas been actively inviting any organisations, manufacturers and sellers who wish to use the Aboriginal flag on clothing to contact us and discuss their options\u201d. Wam Clothing is part-owned by Queensland businessman Ben Wooster, who has had a long association with Thomas as a licensee of the flag. Wooster was sole owner of Birubi Art, a now-defunct company found by the federal court to have \u201cmade false or misleading representations that products it sold were made in Australia and hand-painted by Australian Aboriginal persons, in breach of the Australian consumer law\u201d. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is seeking a $2m to $2.5m penalty against Birubi Art, to signify the \u201cserious cultural harm\u201d done by fake Aboriginal art. But the minister said Thomas\u2019s concerns \u201clie with the unethical use of the flag on souvenirs and in other situations where the flag is not reproduced in a faithful or professional manner, without the knowledge or agreement of him or his family\u201d. \u201cMr Thomas made clear that he has not signed away his rights and does not intend to, despite some claims in the media.\u201d Both Thomas and Wam Clothing have publicly indicated their willingness to talk about options for using or reproducing the image of the flag, the minister said.",

      "body": "<p>Fans of the unfilmable novel must be having a terrible time of it now. In the last three weeks alone, two of the most notorious examples have made their way to screen. Admittedly one \u2013 Amazon\u2019s Good Omens \u2013 functions as a pretty watertight argument for never trying to adapt an unfilmable book. But the other is Catch-22, and that functions as an equally watertight argument to the contrary.</p> <p>I have to admit that I didn\u2019t see this coming. Throughout its gestation, the Catch-22 series seemed like an almighty act of hubris; as if Hulu, still drunk on the success of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, went out of its way to adapt an even more knotty work. Catch-22\u2019s unfilmable reputation came about in part because someone did try to film it once, in the form of Mike Nicholls\u2019 1970 feature, and the results were patchy at best.

      "bodyText": "Fans of the unfilmable novel must be having a terrible time of it now. In the last three weeks alone, two of the most notorious examples have made their way to screen. Admittedly one \u2013 Amazon\u2019s Good Omens \u2013 functions as a pretty watertight argument for never trying to adapt an unfilmable book. But the other is Catch-22, and that functions as an equally watertight argument to the contrary. I have to admit that I didn\u2019t see this coming. Throughout its gestation, the Catch-22 series seemed like an almighty act of hubris; as if Hulu, still drunk on the success of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, went out of its way to adapt an even more knotty work. Catch-22\u2019s unfilmable reputation came about in part because someone did try to film it once, in the form of Mike Nicholls\u2019 1970 feature, and the results were patchy at best. A similar fate of smug, too wacky mediocrity seemed inevitable. And yet somehow they have pulled it off. The Catch-22 series is successful in almost every way. It is beautifully shot, thoughtfully written and incredibly well acted. It takes plenty of liberties with Joseph Heller\u2019s book \u2013 there are approximately 25 fewer characters, almost no flashbacks and the ending is entirely different \u2013 but, having seen the series, I have come to the conclusion that these changes are exactly what make it sing.

      "body": "<p>I made the mistake of buying some Lancashire Tea bags recently. It seemed like the right thing to do at the time. I was born in Lancaster \u2013 and they were on offer in Morrisons.</p> <p>What a disappointment. We Lancastrians may have won the Wars of the Roses* and be vastly better at football than our transpennine rivals, but, by \u2019eck, the brew bearing my county\u2019s name is an insipid affair. More than once I had to go back to the cupboard and check I hadn\u2019t picked up a decaf bag in error. Lancashire Tea is <em>murky.</em> It has a sinister tinge of that slightly bruised purple you get when suffering a tea with the good stuff removed.</p> <p>Chances are, you have never tried Lancashire Tea. You probably didn\u2019t even know it was a thing. It has only existed since 2002, when Paul Needham and Lynn Hitchen looked enviously at the success of Yorkshire Tea and decided to copy the gimmick over on the rainy side of the M62.</p> <p>It is, I would argue, a bit of a swizz. The website gives little away, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/nov/13/foodanddrink\" title=\"\">moderate sleuthing</a> reveals it is not even boxed in Lancashire. They blend it in Newton-le-Willows, St Helens, which hasn\u2019t been in Lancashire since 1974. I guess Merseyside Tea doesn\u2019t carry convey quite the same romance.</p> <p>Of course pretty much all British tea is a con. <a href=\"https://www.yorkshiretea.co.uk/brew-news/why-is-it-called-yorkshire-tea\" title=\"\">Yorkshire Tea</a>, like most of its rivals, is grown in various plantations in Assam, India, and east Africa \u2013 a fact that occasionally surprises devotees, such as <a href=\"https://www.indy100.com/article/brexit-yorkshire-tea-not-grown-in-england-africa-india-tea-trade-twitter-viral-funny-8200416\" title=\"\">the Twitter user</a> who called for a boycott after discovering his favourite brew was not as homegrown as he thought. \u201cYORKSHIRE SOIL MAKES THE BEST TEA [three union jack emojis]\u201d tweeted @FleetwoodTerryO, a self-declared \u201cpatriot\u201d last year. When the truth was pointed out, he was not amused: \u201cWHY CALL IT YORKSHIRE TEA IF IT\u2019S NOT GROWN IN YORKSHIRE. WONT BE BUYING FROM YOU AGAIN.\u201d</p> <p>It was all excellent viral marketing for Yorkshire Tea, which used the resulting publicity to clarify that the tea is in fact only blended in Yorkshire, before being shipped around the country.</p> <p>Despite living in Stockport (the west, correct, side of the Pennines), I drink Yorkshire Tea. It\u2019s strong and northern, like me. We don\u2019t even keep it local in the Guardian\u2019s Manchester office, despite the paper\u2019s 198-year foundations in the historic county of Lancashire. We too buy the Tykes\u2019 tea, in 3kg sacks from our stationery supplier.</p> <p>But is Yorkshire Tea really the nation\u2019s finest mass-produced regional chai? I decided to find out, with the help of Jimmy Green, an ex-military man who became addicted to tea when serving in Hong Kong alongside teetotal Gurkhas. He runs <a href=\"https://teafromthemanor.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Tea from the Manor</a>, which blends loose-leaf teas for hotels across the north-west.</p> <p>He invites me to his office, in an unpromising oblong building on an industrial estate in Denton, Greater Manchester. Appearances deceive. Inside is a tea lover\u2019s paradise. His desk is made of tea chests and two walls are packed floor-to-ceiling with his blends, which include everything from traditional oolong (a superstrong Chinese number only for the hardcore) to a gin and tonic concoction he had made recently for some Cheshire hipsters.</p> <p>Glancing up at a framed glossary of tea terms, I realise I have a lot to learn. There\u2019s \u201cCrepy: a term used to describe tea which is crimped in appearance, usually a BOP [Broken orange pekoe] grade\u201d and \u201cBaggy: an undesirable taint found in both dry leaf and liquor of tea withered on inferior hessian.\u201d Help! Despite drinking at least seven cups a day, I don\u2019t speak tea.</p> <p>A brew with Green is a formal affair. I immediately feel underdressed. He is wearing a dickie bow and pristine white shirt and boils water not in a kettle but in a shiny samovar. Cups are china, naturally, and he has put on a tantalising spread of chocolate eclairs and slices of Victoria sponge that he forbids me from touching until after the tasting, lest I sully my palate.</p> <p>He has laid out some tea leaves on a saucer. One pile, fine brown shavings, he dismisses as \u201cdust\u201d.

      "bodyText": "I made the mistake of buying some Lancashire Tea bags recently. It seemed like the right thing to do at the time. I was born in Lancaster \u2013 and they were on offer in Morrisons. What a disappointment. We Lancastrians may have won the Wars of the Roses* and be vastly better at football than our transpennine rivals, but, by \u2019eck, the brew bearing my county\u2019s name is an insipid affair. More than once I had to go back to the cupboard and check I hadn\u2019t picked up a decaf bag in error. Lancashire Tea is murky. It has a sinister tinge of that slightly bruised purple you get when suffering a tea with the good stuff removed. Chances are, you have never tried Lancashire Tea. You probably didn\u2019t even know it was a thing. It has only existed since 2002, when Paul Needham and Lynn Hitchen looked enviously at the success of Yorkshire Tea and decided to copy the gimmick over on the rainy side of the M62. It is, I would argue, a bit of a swizz. The website gives little away, but moderate sleuthing reveals it is not even boxed in Lancashire. They blend it in Newton-le-Willows, St Helens, which hasn\u2019t been in Lancashire since 1974. I guess Merseyside Tea doesn\u2019t carry convey quite the same romance. Of course pretty much all British tea is a con. Yorkshire Tea, like most of its rivals, is grown in various plantations in Assam, India, and east Africa \u2013 a fact that occasionally surprises devotees, such as the Twitter user who called for a boycott after discovering his favourite brew was not as homegrown as he thought. \u201cYORKSHIRE SOIL MAKES THE BEST TEA [three union jack emojis]\u201d tweeted @FleetwoodTerryO, a self-declared \u201cpatriot\u201d last year. When the truth was pointed out, he was not amused: \u201cWHY CALL IT YORKSHIRE TEA IF IT\u2019S NOT GROWN IN YORKSHIRE. WONT BE BUYING FROM YOU AGAIN.\u201d It was all excellent viral marketing for Yorkshire Tea, which used the resulting publicity to clarify that the tea is in fact only blended in Yorkshire, before being shipped around the country. Despite living in Stockport (the west, correct, side of the Pennines), I drink Yorkshire Tea. It\u2019s strong and northern, like me. We don\u2019t even keep it local in the Guardian\u2019s Manchester office, despite the paper\u2019s 198-year foundations in the historic county of Lancashire. We too buy the Tykes\u2019 tea, in 3kg sacks from our stationery supplier. But is Yorkshire Tea really the nation\u2019s finest mass-produced regional chai? I decided to find out, with the help of Jimmy Green, an ex-military man who became addicted to tea when serving in Hong Kong alongside teetotal Gurkhas. He runs Tea from the Manor, which blends loose-leaf teas for hotels across the north-west. He invites me to his office, in an unpromising oblong building on an industrial estate in Denton, Greater Manchester. Appearances deceive. Inside is a tea lover\u2019s paradise. His desk is made of tea chests and two walls are packed floor-to-ceiling with his blends, which include everything from traditional oolong (a superstrong Chinese number only for the hardcore) to a gin and tonic concoction he had made recently for some Cheshire hipsters. Glancing up at a framed glossary of tea terms, I realise I have a lot to learn. There\u2019s \u201cCrepy: a term used to describe tea which is crimped in appearance, usually a BOP [Broken orange pekoe] grade\u201d and \u201cBaggy: an undesirable taint found in both dry leaf and liquor of tea withered on inferior hessian.\u201d Help! Despite drinking at least seven cups a day, I don\u2019t speak tea. A brew with Green is a formal affair. I immediately feel underdressed. He is wearing a dickie bow and pristine white shirt and boils water not in a kettle but in a shiny samovar. Cups are china, naturally, and he has put on a tantalising spread of chocolate eclairs and slices of Victoria sponge that he forbids me from touching until after the tasting, lest I sully my palate. He has laid out some tea leaves on a saucer. One pile, fine brown shavings, he dismisses as \u201cdust\u201d. That, he says, is what we will find inside all the tea bags we are to test today \u2013 blends, he suggests, that are fine only in texture. Cheap and tawdry, lowest common denominator stuff. He wants me to compare the dust with the much bigger dried tea leaves he puts into Tea from the Manor blends, which he insists will impart vastly more flavour. I line up the teas we are to taste: Yorkshire Tea, Lancashire Tea, Cornish Tea, West Country Tea, Welsh Tea and Ringtons (which trades heavily on its Newcastle-upon-Tyne origins), plus the only tea I could find that is grown wholly in Britain: Kinnettles Gold, propagated and hand-rolled on a farm in Angus, north-east Scotland, in such tiny quantities that they produce no more than 2kg a year. Green is not keen to taste these heathen teas: \u201cIt\u2019s like asking someone used to drinking fine wines to have a bottle of cheap cider.\u201d Nonetheless, he forces down a few mouthfuls, grimacing as if I have made him drink meths.

      "body": "<p><strong>What is happening to Qantas frequent flyer points?</strong></p> <p>Economy seats are going to be cheaper and easier to get. But premium economy, business and first class tickets will cost more.</p> <p>And upgrades will up to 9% dearer.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s getting cheaper?</strong></p> <p>The points needed to earn an economy seat on international and domestic flights will be up to 10% lower \u2013 effective immediately.</p> <p>Qantas is also cutting something known as the carrier charge. This is the extra cash payment you need to make when buying seats with points. The airline estimates that on average this will save you $200 a flight.</p> <p>For example, an economy flight from Melbourne to Los Angeles (return) used to cost 90,000 points and $513 in cash.</p> <p>Now it will cost 83,800 points (6,200 fewer) and $393 cash ($120 less).</p> <p>Sydney to Tokyo, economy one way, used to cost 35,000 points and $182. Now it will be 31,500 points and $147, a saving of 3,500 points and $35.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s getting more expensive?</strong></p> <p>Everything else.</p> <p>A return premium economy flight from Melbourne to LA used to cost 144,000 points and $793. Now it will cost 162,600 points and $603. That\u2019s 18,600 more points but $190 less cash.</p> <p>Business class for that same flight will go from 192,000 points and $943 cash to 216,800 points (24,800 extra) and $703 cash ($240 less).</p> <p>This will come into effect on 18 September.</p> <p><strong>What about upgrades?</strong></p> <p>The news is purely negative.</p> <p>Upgraders will cop an up to 9% increase in their points but without that discount on the cash charge of the carrier fee. That\u2019s because the carrier fee applies only to new bookings.</p> <p>From Sydney to LA, one way, it used to cost 56,500 points to upgrade from economy to premium economy. After the change it will cost 61,600.</p> <p>To upgrade to business on the same flight, it used to cost 90,000 points. Soon it will cost 98,100.</p> <p>David Flynn, the editor of Australian Business Traveller, says upgrades used to be \u201cthe best way to use your points\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to using points, anecdotally, most people go for buying an economy seat, when in fact upgrading is much better value. When we advise people, we usually say upgrades are better value for money.\u201d</p> <p>Under the new rules, though, Flynn says that has changed.</p> <p>\u201cThey are still a good deal \u2013 but one of the problems with economy seats before was you used a lot of points and got a surcharge.

      "bodyText": "What is happening to Qantas frequent flyer points? Economy seats are going to be cheaper and easier to get. But premium economy, business and first class tickets will cost more. And upgrades will up to 9% dearer. What\u2019s getting cheaper? The points needed to earn an economy seat on international and domestic flights will be up to 10% lower \u2013 effective immediately. Qantas is also cutting something known as the carrier charge. This is the extra cash payment you need to make when buying seats with points. The airline estimates that on average this will save you $200 a flight. For example, an economy flight from Melbourne to Los Angeles (return) used to cost 90,000 points and $513 in cash. Now it will cost 83,800 points (6,200 fewer) and $393 cash ($120 less). Sydney to Tokyo, economy one way, used to cost 35,000 points and $182. Now it will be 31,500 points and $147, a saving of 3,500 points and $35. What\u2019s getting more expensive? Everything else. A return premium economy flight from Melbourne to LA used to cost 144,000 points and $793. Now it will cost 162,600 points and $603. That\u2019s 18,600 more points but $190 less cash. Business class for that same flight will go from 192,000 points and $943 cash to 216,800 points (24,800 extra) and $703 cash ($240 less). This will come into effect on 18 September. What about upgrades? The news is purely negative. Upgraders will cop an up to 9% increase in their points but without that discount on the cash charge of the carrier fee. That\u2019s because the carrier fee applies only to new bookings. From Sydney to LA, one way, it used to cost 56,500 points to upgrade from economy to premium economy. After the change it will cost 61,600. To upgrade to business on the same flight, it used to cost 90,000 points. Soon it will cost 98,100. David Flynn, the editor of Australian Business Traveller, says upgrades used to be \u201cthe best way to use your points\u201d. \u201cWhen it comes to using points, anecdotally, most people go for buying an economy seat, when in fact upgrading is much better value. When we advise people, we usually say upgrades are better value for money.\u201d Under the new rules, though, Flynn says that has changed. \u201cThey are still a good deal \u2013 but one of the problems with economy seats before was you used a lot of points and got a surcharge. Now you are using fewer points and have fewer surcharges. Buying an economy seat with points is marginally better value.\u201d How many more miles, or how many more purchases, will I have to get? Using the Melbourne to LA, premium economy, new booking example, the changes mean you will need to find 18,600 more points. That is the equivalent of three one-way flights from Melbourne to LA, in standard economy, on the lowest bronze membership level (which is 6,750 points). But Flynn says the extra points needed could be easily achieved. \u201cAlmost every Qantas-partnered credit card on the market today will give you a sign-up bonus of 50,000 to 80,000 points,\u201d he says. \u201cYour credit card can give you a mountain of points. I know people who earn 100,000s of points a year.\u201d \u201c18,000 is not hard to get at all. If you\u2019re flying it\u2019s a lot of miles, but there are much more fun ways to earn points than flying.\u201d What else is being offered? There will be more seats available to get in the first place. Qantas\u2019s chief executive, Alan Joyce, said on Thursday that the most frequent complaint about the old program wasn\u2019t about the number of points you need but rather about the lack of frequent flyer seats available on popular routes, or at key holiday times. Now Qantas will boost the number of seats by over a million, focusing on routes like London, Singapore, LA and Tokyo. It has also signed on with new partner airlines \u2013 such as Air New Zealand, Bangkok Airways and Air France \u2013 to get those extra seats. Is it a good deal? It depends who you are. Families looking for a lot of economy seats, and people who earn points through spending, are the big winners, Flynn says. And that\u2019s most of Qantas point owners. \u201cWe understand that over three-quarters of the membership base basically earn their points through shopping rather than flying,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a play for them. Qantas are trying to appeal to the larger part of its frequent flyer base. \u201cThese frequent buyers \u2013 they have got all of these points, but they have trouble finding seats. They are not looking for a flight for themselves \u2013 they have a partner or kids, and you want those seats during school holidays. \u201cThen it becomes painful. You are looking for four frequent flyer seats at the same time of year. I think Qantas has addressed the main pain points their customers had.\u201d But he stresses you should still think twice before emptying your points to go straight for new seats. \u201cKeep in mind a lot of these seats are the ones you can already get on discount in sales. So if you can pick up an economy seat at a good price, it might be better holding on to your points. \u201cSometimes fares to Hong Kong drop to $500. Why use frequent flyer points \u2013 just use cash.\u201d And high-end flyers who want those upgrades and premium seats are the ones losing out. \u201cI would say for the average punter, it is a good deal,\u201d says Flynn. \u201cThe average punter is not the super frequently flyer who is always looking to fly in business, or upgrade. Those people will find it less appealing.\u201d What is Points Club? The airline is creating a membership club for those who earn their points through purchases and credit cards rather than flights. It\u2019s a program for frequent buyers, rather than frequent flyers. Joining the club means you will get flight benefits and lounge access and other rewards \u2013 similar to the existing club for flyers. There will be two tiers to the club, and the lowest will need you to earn 150,000 points to reach it. More details of this will be released later on.",

      "body": "<p>On 20 April 1945, Adolf Hitler\u2019s birthday, 21-year-old Friederike Grensemann said goodbye to her father, who had been called up to the Volkssturm, the \u201cPeople\u2019s Storm\u201d, a hastily assembled, motley crew of men who had up to this point been excused from military service. A last-ditch attempt to shore up the Third Reich in the face of allied invasions on all sides, it was neither properly uniformed nor adequately equipped. Most of those who served in it were doomed to failure, and they knew it. As her father left the house, he turned to his daughter and handed her his pistol. \u201cIt\u2019s all over, child,\u201d he said. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll shoot yourself when the Russians come, otherwise I won\u2019t have another moment\u2019s peace.\u201d He told her to put the barrel in her mouth and pull the trigger. Then he left. Ten days later, as she saw the first Red Army soldiers walking down the street, she took the weapon out, released the safety catch and pressed the barrel into her mouth as instructed. Looking out into the backyard, however, she saw a rubbish bin full of discarded weapons. Maybe the Russians wouldn\u2019t get her, she thought. Perhaps they weren\u2019t as bad as Nazi propaganda had made them out to be. She went down to the rubbish bin and threw the pistol in. She had decided to live.</p> <p>She was one of the lucky ones. All over the eastern parts of Germany, people killed themselves to avoid being shot or captured by the Red Army troops, who were rampaging through the region looting, raping and killing. This was a suicide wave on a gigantic scale, people ending their lives in myriad ways. An estimated 10,000 women in Berlin alone took their own lives after being raped by Red Army soldiers. Many more killed themselves, as Grensemann had contemplated doing, in anticipation of the Soviet troops\u2019 brutal revenge on the Germans for the millions of deaths inflicted by Hitler\u2019s armies on their own population. Often a father would kill his entire family before taking his own life.</p> <p>The writer and documentary film-maker Florian Huber begins his account of these events with a gripping narrative set in the small Pomeranian town of Demmin, where it is estimated that more than 1,000 people perished out of a total population of 15,000, a number swollen further by thousands of refugees fleeing from areas to the east. Terrified at the approach of the Red Army, whose atrocities had already been widely reported by propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels\u2019s media, inhabitants began the wave of suicide, many whole families walking into one of the surrounding rivers to drown. Enraged by fierce resistance from fanatical members of the Hitler Youth, the Soviet troops set light to the town centre, looted inns and liquor stores, and launched an orgy of rape and destruction, triggering a second wave of suicides. Demmin was perhaps an extreme example, but in April and early May similar events were taking place everywhere in the path of the Red Army.</p> <p>But fear of the Soviet troops, or, for women, shame and despair after being raped by them, were not the only reasons Germans killed themselves in what was undoubtedly one of the greatest mass suicides in history. Huber also notes the many suicides of committed members of the Nazi elite, starting of course with Hitler himself, and encompassing not only his immediate subordinates such as Goebbels and Martin Bormann but also government ministers, <em>gauleiters </em>(district officials), army generals (53 of them), SS officers and hundreds more. It was not so much fear that drove them as despair and disorientation \u2013 the movement that had given their lives meaning and purpose was crashing into ruins around them. The French sociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim, in his classic study of suicide, called this phenomenon \u201canomie\u201d, the loss of a framework of values that left people without any sense of a moral basis, however warped, for their lives. As Magda Goebbels, who killed her six children before she and her husband killed themselves, wrote: \u201cThe world that will come after the F\u00fchrer and National Socialism won\u2019t be worth living in, so I have taken the children with me.\u201d</p> <p>Huber does not make it clear enough that many leading Nazis saw the act of self-destruction as a message, demonstrating to future generations of Germans their willingness to sacrifice themselves for a cause they believed was certain to be resurrected. Like the Romans of old, they were dying an honourable death, rather than face ignominy and humiliation at the hands of the victorious allies. The head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, took cyanide when he was captured by the British, while the \u201csecond man in the Third Reich\u201d, Hermann Goering, killed himself after being condemned to death by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg to avoid undergoing the dishonouring ritual of hanging. All of these beliefs were utter illusions, of course: the Nazi party never did revive, and those who had led or served it have earned nothing but scorn and contempt from subsequent generations of Germans.</p> <p>Huber tells the shocking stories of ordinary German suicides with literary power and skill, making excellent use of unknown material in the admirable, privately run German Diary Archive at Emmendingen, in south-western Germany. But after the first 130 pages or so, the book comes badly unstuck. Instead of setting these stories more deeply in their context, and exploring the less immediate factors that lay behind Germans\u2019 decision whether or not to kill themselves, such as religion, gender, age, generation, political beliefs and so on \u2013 factors that determined the widely varying incidence of suicide between different groups of people \u2013 he launches into more than 100 pages of a banal, unvarying narrative of the Nazi years. This is designed to show \u201cthe Germans\u2019 unbounded admiration for Hitler\u201d and their happiness and fulfilment under his rule. Only in this way, he says, can we understand why so many of them killed themselves when the dream fell so spectacularly into ruins.</p> <p>If this was really the case, then why weren\u2019t there more German suicides, especially in the western parts of the country, which was overrun not by the Red Army but by the western allies? Just as significant, he paints a portrait of an entire nation seduced by Hitler and overwhelmed at the end of the war by \u201ccomplicity, culpability, guilt\u201d and fear of the victors\u2019 revenge. This is not only seriously inaccurate \u2013 millions of Germans were longing for the end of the ruinous regime of the Nazis by the last months of the war \u2013 but also seems designed to let the Germans, or those who supported the Nazis, off the hook by portraying them as innocents who were seduced by a charismatic leader and paid for it with their lives. In the end, this is another narrative of Germans between 1933 and 1945 as victims; which is perhaps why this book has been a bestseller in Germany.</p> <p>Nor is it as original as the publishers claim; the assertion that this is \u201cone of the last untold stories of the Second World War\u201d is very much wide of the mark. In particular, Christian Goeschel\u2019s <em>Suicide in Nazi Germany</em>, published by Oxford University Press in 2009, and translated into German two years later, covers much of the same ground and does so with proper attention to the many and varied factors that lay behind the wave of self-destruction at the end of the war. Among the many noteworthy features of Goeschel\u2019s fine book is its painstaking compilation of statistics, on which Huber seems to have drawn without proper acknowledgment. And one of Goeschel\u2019s chapters, on the suicides of Jews in Germany between 1933 and 1945, points to an egregious omission from Huber\u2019s book. After all, they were Germans too.</p> <p><em> \u2022 Promise Me You\u2019ll Shoot Yourself: The Downfall of Ordinary Germans, 1945, by Florian Huber, translated by Imogen Taylor, is published in the UK by Allen Lane (RRP \u00a320) and in Australia by Text.

Nor is it as original as the publishers claim; the assertion that this is \u201cone of the last untold stories of the Second World War\u201d is very much wide of the mark. In particular, Christian Goeschel\u2019s Suicide in Nazi Germany, published by Oxford University Press in 2009, and translated into German two years later, covers much of the same ground and does so with proper attention to the many and varied factors that lay behind the wave of self-destruction at the end of the war. Among the many noteworthy features of Goeschel\u2019s fine book is its painstaking compilation of statistics, on which Huber seems to have drawn without proper acknowledgment. And one of Goeschel\u2019s chapters, on the suicides of Jews in Germany between 1933 and 1945, points to an egregious omission from Huber\u2019s book. After all, they were Germans too. \u2022 Promise Me You\u2019ll Shoot Yourself: The Downfall of Ordinary Germans, 1945, by Florian Huber, translated by Imogen Taylor, is published in the UK by Allen Lane (RRP \u00a320) and in Australia by Text.

When he went to hit her again, I grabbed his arm and said: \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 He said: \u2018I\u2019m just disciplining her because she is my wife and she is lying to me\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cPhilip Jones Griffiths, my then partner and president of Magnum photos, said: \u2018Donna, I\u2019ve never seen anything like this, just keep doing it.

I was at a domestic violence conference and all of a sudden I saw this woman, Millie Bianco, with a picture of her daughter, Lisa Bianco. Lisa was a very badly beaten woman. She took out a protection order and filed charges against her husband. He went to prison because the abuse was horrific.

She put me in here; I\u2019m going to kill her.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cOne day, the prison gave him a day furlough, with a car, to supposedly go and see his mother. Instead, he went to Lisa\u2019s house. She had a beeper that would tell her when he came close, because he had to have a tag on his ankle. She was in the shower, the beeper went off, she went running out into the street naked. He was there with a sawn-off shotgun, and he beat her to death.</p> <p>\u201cHe got the death penalty and was executed, but for the mother, that\u2019s nothing.

      "bodyText": "For nearly four decades, the photojournalist Donna Ferrato has documented the effects of domestic violence on abused women and their families. Her book and series Living with the Enemy is one of the most important works on the subject. She launched a campaign in 2014 called I Am Unbeatable, which features women who have left their abusers. In 1981, Ferrato was commissioned by Playboy magazine in Japan to document the supposedly hedonistic lifestyle of Elisabeth and Bengt, a couple of New Jersey swingers. Ferrato\u2019s pictures told a different story \u2013 the most famous of which, below, is included in Time magazine\u2019s 100 most influential images of all time. Here, she tells the stories behind some of the most potent images in the collection. Bengt Hits Elisabeth, 1982 \u201cThis is the moment that changed my life. It changed Elisabeth\u2019s life. I don\u2019t know what it did to her husband \u2013 I don\u2019t think he cared at all. But for the two of us women, it changed our lives. I\u2019d never seen a woman being hit; I didn\u2019t grow up with violence. I didn\u2019t know he would ever hit her,\u201d Ferrato said. \u201cLate that night, I heard her screaming. I picked up my camera and went running to the bathroom. This was the very first picture I took in that room. When he went to hit her again, I grabbed his arm and said: \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 He said: \u2018I\u2019m just disciplining her because she is my wife and she is lying to me\u2019. \u201cPhilip Jones Griffiths, my then partner and president of Magnum photos, said: \u2018Donna, I\u2019ve never seen anything like this, just keep doing it. Keep going.\u2019 \u201cI continued to spend time with them. He never hit her in front of me again. She became strong and got him out of her life after one more near-fatal incident.\u201d Six-year-old child Diamond shouts at his father as the police arrest him for domestic violence, Minneapolis, 1986 \u201cPeople are always very shocked by this.

He had just shown the police where his father had hidden the screwdriver. \u201cIt was pitch dark at nine o\u2019clock in the morning, I was bouncing the flash off the ceiling \u2013 I didn\u2019t even know how to bounce flash, but I was experimenting. That\u2019s shooting in the dark \u2013 that\u2019s like Jedi shooting!\u201d Soldier getting ready for guard duty during the Gulf war, Hafar al-Batin, Saudi Arabia, 1991 \u201cI went to Saudi Arabia to document women who were fighters, soldiers.

A credit report doesn\u2019t show whether you were refused credit, only that you\u2019ve requested it and your score is affected by how recently you applied.</p> <p>The credit search performed by the lender, in this case mobile phone companies, remains on your report for up to two years, although most lenders are only interested in the last three to six months. One new contract can temporarily reduce your score by a small amount.</p> <p>\u201cThis is why we always encourage people to fully investigate any credit refusal before trying again,\u201d says James Jones of credit reference agency Experian. \u201cWith credit provided through a store, you will usually need to get details of the finance provider\u2019s underwriting department and ask them to reveal the main reason. They have to tell you and once you know, you\u2019re in a much better position to work out what to do.\u201d</p> <p>Check your free credit report at all three credit reference agencies (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) to make sure there are no errors, then continue tracking the guide scores and wait three to six months until your scores recover.</p> <p>Report checks count as soft searches and don\u2019t affect your score. In future, leave gaps of around three months between credit applications.</p> <p><strong>If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

      "bodyText": "I ordered two new smartphone contracts for myself and my wife. My wife decided to go for a different handset, so I cancelled her contract and reapplied. On the delivery day, I called to find out when it was coming, only to be told the order had been cancelled. No one could tell me why. I ordered again with a different company, and was told I\u2019d receive delivery the next day. Soon afterwards, they called to say I\u2019d failed a credit check. I immediately tried another online company only to be refused again. I think my credit score immediately dropped because of these applications. My biggest problem now is how do I have all of this reversed so that I can get a new phone, and will it now affect my credit report? SH, London Several applications in quick succession can compromise your credit rating because it could signify desperation or fraud. A credit report doesn\u2019t show whether you were refused credit, only that you\u2019ve requested it and your score is affected by how recently you applied. The credit search performed by the lender, in this case mobile phone companies, remains on your report for up to two years, although most lenders are only interested in the last three to six months. One new contract can temporarily reduce your score by a small amount. \u201cThis is why we always encourage people to fully investigate any credit refusal before trying again,\u201d says James Jones of credit reference agency Experian. \u201cWith credit provided through a store, you will usually need to get details of the finance provider\u2019s underwriting department and ask them to reveal the main reason. They have to tell you and once you know, you\u2019re in a much better position to work out what to do.\u201d Check your free credit report at all three credit reference agencies (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) to make sure there are no errors, then continue tracking the guide scores and wait three to six months until your scores recover. Report checks count as soft searches and don\u2019t affect your score. In future, leave gaps of around three months between credit applications.

      "bodyText": "For the last thirty to forty years China has been undergoing one of the great religious revivals of our time. Alongside the country\u2019s rapid pace of development, the search for meaning and celebration of the Sacred are shaping China\u2019s future in new and significant ways. Fire ceremony gathering (2016) With more than 24 million residents, Shanghai is China\u2019s largest city and the 10th wealthiest in the world. It is famous for economic dynamism and architectural daring, and has become synonymous with consumerism. At the same time, it is at the forefront of religious resurgence. Rooted in history, this revival has swept in on the tide of globalisation, fed by the inventiveness of the Chinese people. Xu Guangqi Memorial Hall \u2013 A memorial for the Chinese scholar, statesman and Catholic convert Xu Guangqi (1562-1633) is located in a small park named after him After decades of suppression during the Mao era, the number of followers of China\u2019s five official religions \u2013 Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism \u2013 are steadily rising alongside a rich range of unofficial groups and alternative spiritual practices. It is a remarkable recovery, especially considering the destruction of religious infrastructure and knowledge, and continued political suppression. Noodles for Shanghai Shabbat (2016) Shanghai Sacred explores the spaces, rituals and communities \u2013 in official, unofficial, public and private forms \u2013 that together weave the spiritual fabric of the city. Intimate photographs document the creativity of the faithful when creating \u2018sacred space\u2019 in a dense and restless urban environment. Fang Sheng gathering, Changning district (2015) The traditional east Asian Buddhist practice of freeing captive animals to accrue good karma has flourished dramatically in recent years in Shanghai, in step with the rise of social media and online money donation, which keeps the practice afloat. Here hundreds of inhabitants gather to liberate $3,000 (\u00a32,400) worth of fish bought from the market that morning. Monks or devout lay people organise weekly devotional gatherings, performing the ritual throughout the public space, thus creating a new economy for fishermen and a sense of belonging in an ever-changing urban environment. Fang Sheng gathering, Shanghai Ferry Port (2015) Memorial Hall of the First Congress of the Chinese Communist party, Xintiandi area (2015) In 1921, the Chinese Communist party (CCP) was founded in Shanghai. This museum venerates the party and preserves the \u201cofficial\u201d memories of this occasion with a waxwork of Mao Zedong at the founding meeting. This space is part of the sacred geography of the city and a place that Chinese tourists visit in a reverent manner. The Longhua Revolutionary Martyrs\u2019 Memorial (2015) The Longhua Revolutionary Martyrs\u2019 cemetery commemorates the CCP members and other activists who died during the revolutionary struggles of 1928-37. Located on a former section of the grounds of the Longhua Buddhist temple, it is part of the \u201csacred geography\u201d of Shanghai. Shanghai Daoist College at Dongyue temple (2015) Dongyue temple hosts one of China\u2019s three official Taoist learning centres and has seen a resurgence of students in recent years. The male students are trained in academic subjects, such as English and history, as well as in Taoist doctrine and ritual practice. Daily meditation time in a state-of-the-art, climate-controlled room has been tacked on to the curriculum. Baiyun temple (2014) Baiyun (white clouds) Taoist temple was originally built in 1863 just outside the walled city. In 2004, the entire temple was relocated to within the former walled city. Moving temple buildings is not uncommon in China\u2019s radical redevelopments. Bowl singing therapy session with Jasmine, Tibetan Buddhist centre (2014) Jasmine left her job as a doctor to study traditional Tibetan Buddhist therapies. She offers Tibetan bowl singing therapy to her Chinese clients at a members\u2019 club in the centre of Shanghai. With a growing interest in different forms of Buddhist practice, her business has proved lucrative. Thai Buddhist shrine, Super Brand mall, Pudong (2016) Super Brand Mall is one of the largest shopping centres in Asia. The Chia Tai Group, its Thai developer, set up a Buddhist shrine outside the entrance. A flow of passersby perform rituals at the shrine, which are believed to have improved the mall\u2019s business. Diwali festival (2013) Throughout history migrants and traders from afar have brought new ideas, language and lifestyles to Shanghai and integrated them with local customs to form distinct, syncretic cultures. A young boy of mixed Chinese and Indian parentage celebrates Diwali in the luxurious Shimao Riviera garden compound. Procession, Jinze town (2016) Twice a year people come to join the residents of Jinze Town on the outskirts of Shanghai to celebrate the birthdays of local gods. Members of devotional groups of the region show their skills at inserting gongs, incense burners or fishing hooks into their forearms. Fushouyuan Cemetery Park, Qingpu district (2015) Fushouyuan is a luxury cemetery park. Most Shanghainese cannot afford to buy a funerary slot here. However, another option is available: a tower in the centre of the cemetery contains cabinets, which are sold as containers for ashes. Joss paper house, Shanghai Old City (2015) Elaborate items are made out of paper as offerings for the dead. They also reflect the values of the living. Among these offerings, the omnipresence of joss paper houses speaks of both the scarcity of housing that Shanghai experienced in the past and the rapid pace of urban transformation from the 1990s onwards. Migrant workers\u2019 church, Pudong (2016) On the coldest day in Shanghai for more than 40 years, migrant workers share a hot lunch offered by the Protestant church after the Sunday service held in a factory. The dedication to their faith and sense of community, as well as the promise of a hearty bowl of noodle soup, fuelled the congregation as they stood for two hours in -8C. The church, located in an old factory, was soon after moved to make way for the construction of Shanghai Disneyland. Pastor Dai in her room, Hongde church compound (2014) Pastor Dai Lizen, born in 1918, is the oldest female pastor in Shanghai. In 1981, she became the first woman to be ordained in the city. She trained as a pastor before the Cultural Revolution and retrained afterwards to serve a flourishing church community. She lives in one room within the church compound. Orthodox Easter service, Russian Consulate (2016) Orthodox Christianity is not one of the five recognised religions in China. Services are held in the Russian Consulate due to its extraterritoriality status. The Easter 2016 service was the first one that both foreigners and Chinese were allowed to attend. Catholic couple, Saint Michael Church (2013) A couple practise singing before a Taiz\u00e9 prayer evening at a Catholic church. Such events have become popular among young Catholics, who often meet partners there. A regular singles\u2019 day is held to encourage matchmaking within the church. Candlestickmaker\u2019s workshop, St Teresa\u2019s Catholic church (2015) St Teresa\u2019s church is located within one of the biggest lilong (lane house compound) of Shanghai, comprising of about 700 houses. In recent years a major relocation project has left many of these structures empty. The remaining church complex contains a number of artists\u2019 workshops, including that of a nationally renowned stained-glass artist. Women at Koran class, Fuyou Road Mosque (2013) The Fuyou Road Mosque is the smallest of Shanghai\u2019s mosques, constructed in 1870 during the Qing Dynasty and re-established as a thriving centre of Islamic education and prayer after the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). Faithful at Jing\u2019an temple The faithful put their hand over a nephrite stone invested with \u201cspiritual efficacy\u201d at Jing\u2019an temple. Nephrite jade was highly prized by the imperial court and thought more precious than silver or gold. It is a mineral of both secular and spiritual import. Ancestor worship, Chinese New Year, Chuansha New Town, Pudong (2013) On New Year\u2019s Eve, the Jiang family set a table in their kitchen with food and wine for their ancestors. After burning three incense sticks, leaving time for the ancestors to eat, they perform a worship ceremony (jizu) by burning handmade tin-leaf ingots (xibo). Sanskrit reading class (2015) Indian Hindu woman lead an active spiritual life in Shanghai that includes Sanskrit reading classes and devotional singing groups in their homes in the Shimao Riviera garden compound. The community chose this compound because of its close proximity to the Huangpu River, channelling the pivotal role of holy waterways to Indians. The first thorough investigation of religious practices in a Chinese city, Shanghai Sacred was created collaboratively over four years by photographer and anthropologist Liz Hingley, alongside Professor Beno\u00eet Vermander, of the Xu-Ricci Dialogue Center at Fudan University and Liang Zhang, a researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.

Given the continued lack of central government funding, councils have turned to a more entrepreneurial model, usually including a substantial number of flats for private sale to subsidise the council accommodation.

      "bodyText": "A broad arched entranceway leads into a tree-lined courtyard where a playground is overlooked by balconies full of plants. Banded brick walls frame stone stairwells with deep oxblood and creamy white tiles. These connect to spacious decks of homes, each identified with a numbered tile. This splendour is just what you would expect to see in the Bourne Estate in Holborn, which boasts some of the finest public tenement housing of Edwardian London. Yet these blocks are not part of the 1905, Grade II-listed estate but a recent addition built by Camden as part of its new generation of council housing. Designed by architect Matthew Lloyd, the buildings exude a quality rarely found in developer-built flats \u2013 handsome proportions and crafted details mirroring the love and care that went into the surrounding estate, only brought up-to-date with bigger windows, higher ceilings and more generous spaces. It might sound like an anomaly, but this group of 75 homes is one of many such developments now appearing across London, as local authorities have begun to build their own housing again. They are mostly doing so for the first time in four decades, since Margaret Thatcher took away their powers to build. These were only returned in 2012 and, in the seven years since, London councils have built over 2,000 homes \u2013 compared to only 70 in the seven years before that. But it\u2019s not quite social housing as we once knew it. Given the continued lack of central government funding, councils have turned to a more entrepreneurial model, usually including a substantial number of flats for private sale to subsidise the council accommodation. Hackney recently built a pair of David Chipperfield-designed towers, the sale of which helped pay for the regeneration of the Colville estate next door. In Camden\u2019s case, its boutique apartments are marketed as the Camden Collection, with the breathless marketing spiel you would expect from a luxury developer. At the Bourne Estate there are 31 such flats \u2013 including two-bedroom ones on sale for \u00a31.3m \u2013 in order to fund 35 new council flats and 10 at intermediate rent, leased below market rates. \u201cPeople might think it\u2019s strange for a council to be behaving like a developer,\u201d says councillor Danny Beales. \u201cBut with the current constraints, it\u2019s one of the only ways of funding investment.\u201d Beales is cabinet member for Camden\u2019s Community Investment Programme (CIP), an ambitious 15-year plan to pump over \u00a31bn into schools, homes and community facilities across the borough, funded in large part by the sale of flats built on public land. Exploiting the high value of its central London location \u2013 described by the Labour council as its \u201cNorth Sea oil\u201d strategy \u2013 Camden has one of the biggest house-building programmes of all, with over 3,000 homes planned, 862 of which have been completed so far, around half for social and intermediate rent. CIP aims to build on the bold architectural heritage of the borough, which saw some of the most innovative housing of the postwar era \u2013 built under council architect Sydney Cook \u2013 from Neave Brown\u2019s work at Fleet Road and Alexandra Road to Benson and Forsyth\u2019s Corbusian Branch Hill and Maiden Lane. There may no longer be a borough architect, but Camden has tried to put design at the forefront, holding competitions for each site and involving residents in selecting the winning architects and developing their schemes. The results are diverse, ranging from Lloyd\u2019s contemporary Edwardian tenements, to a clumsy attempt to emulate the white modernist language of Maiden Lane, by PRP architects, who have pumped up the low-rise concrete blocks to a steroidal scale. Peter Barber, king of quirky curvy rooflines, has injected a dose of fun with his Holmes Road Studios, providing housing for homeless people around an allotment garden, while Burd Haward have conducted agile urban dentistry in Gospel Oak, inserting a handful of homes into small infill sites. The biggest project of all is at Agar Grove, where a maligned 1960s estate is being overhauled by Hawkins Brown and Mae architects, in a long-term scheme that will see almost 500 new homes built to low-energy Passivhaus standards, responding to the crippling fuel poverty faced by many residents. The masterplan aims to reconfigure the site with streets and squares, introducing new routes through the currently inward-looking estate, including rows of maisonettes by Mae that take inspiration from the split-section layout of Neave Brown\u2019s beloved Fleet Road estate. Ferdinand Daludado, who recently moved into one of the first new blocks, clad in dark purplish brick, couldn\u2019t be more pleased with his airy flat at the top of the building, where he has transformed his big south-facing balcony into a lush hanging garden. \u201cIt is so much bigger and brighter than my previous flat on the estate,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it only has one radiator, which I barely need to turn on in winter.\u201d With an overall increase of 244 homes, the final tenure mix on the estate will be 216 homes for social rent, 37 at intermediate rent and 240 for private sale \u2013 which, in terms of proper council housing, represents an increase of just six homes. The council is quick to point out, however, that the flats are much bigger than those they are replacing, with the overall masterplan representing a third more social rented floor space than before. But the fact that the estate\u2019s central tower block will be reincarnated as solely private flats is an unfortunate symbol of funding realities.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s largest energy companies have withheld support for a legally binding target to reduce the EU\u2019s emissions to net zero by 2050, even while publicly backing the plans. Royal Dutch Shell, BP and British Gas\u2019s owner, Centrica, have all publicly thrown their weight behind more ambitious EU emissions cuts, but none supported the Brussels proposals for a tougher target in an official consultation. The new target, to be debated by EU leaders in Brussels on Friday, would increase the bloc\u2019s carbon-cutting ambitions from 80%-95% below 1990 levels by 2050, to a carbon neutral target. The European commission said a climate-neutral future is in line with the Paris climate agreement objective to keep the global temperature increase to well below 2C and pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5C. Although BP and Shell have both voiced public support for the Paris commitments, neither backed the EU\u2019s plans for a net zero carbon target by 2050 in their response to an official consultation. The companies\u2019 decision to withhold support for the target has reignited criticism that major polluters are \u201cgreenwashing\u201d their plans for the future while remaining opposed to ambitious climate action. \u201cYou can\u2019t claim to be playing your part in tackling the climate emergency and then refuse to back the legislation we need to succeed,\u201d said John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK. \u201cWhile Big Oil CEOs proclaim their support for climate action, their rigs are still heading out to drill for more oil and their lobbyists are still busy undermining climate action.\u201d Official documents, compiled by the investigative journalism arm of Greenpeace, Unearthed, show that BP used the consultation to warn against \u201cpromoting any one fuel as the answer\u201d, because the world \u201cwill need all forms of energy for a long time to come\u201d. It made no reference to a 2050 carbon target. Shell told Brussels it supports a net zero carbon goal, but shied away from a specific timeline for the emissions cuts. It has previously proposed a global net zero carbon target of 2070, but is understood to be wary about committing to date for an EU target. A company spokesman said Shell is committed to reducing carbon emissions in line with the Paris agreement but also declined to give a target date for a carbon neutral future. A spokesman for BP said it supports a carbon neutral future \u201cin the decades to come\u201d. Utility groups \u2013 including Centrica, RWE and E.On \u2013 lobbied for the EU to stick with existing plans to reduce emissions by between 80% to 95%, despite concerns that these cuts do not go far enough to limit severe global heating. A spokesman for Centrica said the energy company\u2019s view \u201chas evolved since our response to the consultation\u201d, which was submitted last September. \u201cAs a result of new evidence being provided to us, we support the view that a net zero emissions target will be a challenging target to meet, but it is the right thing for the UK \u2013 and the EU \u2013 to aim for.\u201d The UK became the first major economy to enshrine in law plans to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 earlier this month.

      "bodyText": "Chris Dawson has been charged with having a relationship with an underage girl while working as a teacher on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches in the 1980s. Police said the 70-year-old had been arrested by detectives just after midday on Thursday after earlier entering a not guilty plea in relation to the murder of his former wife Lynette at the Downing Centre local court in Sydney. Dawson has been charged with one count of \u201ccarnal knowledge by teacher of a girl between the ages of 10 and 17\u201d. Detective Superintendent John Kerlatec, commander of the New South Wales police child abuse and sex crimes squad, said Dawson had been arrested in relation to a woman \u201cwho in 1980 was 16\u201d. \u201cAll sexual assaults are treated very seriously and we seek to find justice for each and every victim,\u201d he said. A former rugby league player and teacher, Dawson was charged with murder in December over the disappearance of his then wife, Lynette, on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches in 1982. His arrest followed the case\u2019s re-examination in a global podcast phenomenon, The Teacher\u2019s Pet. The podcast, which was created by the News Corp-owned Australian newspaper and which has been downloaded more than 28m times around the world, uncovered fresh witnesses which police say helped lead to Dawson\u2019s arrest in relation to Lynette\u2019s disappearance. Kerlatec said the arrest was a result of Strike Force Southwood, established last year to investigate allegations of sexual assault and student-teacher relationships at high schools on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches during the 1970s and 80s.",

It was like learning about these entities all over again, from a position that privileged our knowing and being. We learned about the origins of words, as you would a word based on Latin or Greek, only their origins were here. This provided insight into the founding ontology (being) and epistemology (thinking). Poetic and lyrical, our languages are not just a reflection of the English translation of one reality but more insight into our ways of being and knowing within multiple realities. At the end of our second semester, we were taught songs. Although short, these songs were layered with meaning. One particular song was associated with a story that took 30 minutes to tell. Within these songs and stories were the lessons about day-to-day activities and philosophy. If learning single words was like learning about the stars in the sky again, then learning through songs and stories was like connecting the stars and realising full constellations. I have learnt so little of Mabuiag language \u2013 this would take years of dedicated learning. However I have a more profound understanding about the imperative of harnessing language as a tool to understanding and privileging our ways of knowing and being. The United Nations has declared 2019 the year of Indigenous languages. Language is not a neutral form of expression that centres English as normal. To translate from and to. Language makes accessible our ontologies and epistemologies because our languages in turn are realised by them. We must remember and reconnect, not just through speaking our languages, but through reconnecting with our ways of knowing and being. \u2022 Ali Drummond, a Meriam and Wuthathi man who grew up on Torres Strait, is a PhD candidate, a nursing lecturer and a director of Indigenous health at QUT.

The findings shatter the myth of millennials wasting their disposable income on fripperies.</p> <p>In its first ever national audit on the subject, the Resolution Foundation\u2019s new Intergenerational Centre concludes that compared with people the same age at the turn of the millennium, today\u2019s 18- to 29-year-olds are 7% poorer in real terms after paying rent, or if they can afford it, mortgage dues. Much of their spare cash goes on groceries, utilities and education \u2013 while baby boomers splash out more as a proportion on recreation, restaurants, hotels and culture. \u201cThe clear picture in terms of day-to-day living standards as measured through household consumption is of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2019/jun/20/young-adults-have-less-to-spend-on-non-essentials-study-says\">generational progress for older generations, and generational decline for younger ones</a>,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>Claire Turner, a director at the Centre for Ageing Better, urged caution, blaming \u201cdecades of political short-termism and a failure by successive governments to respond to Britain\u2019s changing population structure\u201d. But a spokesman for Generation Rent said \u201cresentment is growing\u201d and the co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation accused older people of \u201cbreaking the social contract\u201d. Angus Hanton said older voters allowed policies that have financially hobbled the young: \u201cWhen asked to ease the pressure on the intergenerational contract by contributing a little more if they have it, older generations demand intergenerational solidarity and universal benefits for their generation, but not for others.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Chancellor\u2019s lunge to stop Johnson \u2013 </strong>As Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/19/the-franco-german-tussle-at-the-heart-of-who-will-lead-the-eu-commission\">heads to the EU summit</a>,<strong> </strong>Philip Hammond is staying back to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/19/hammond-no-deal-brexit-will-quash-new-pms-spending-plans\"> launch a broadside at Boris Johnson</a> who is today expected to become one of the final two Tory leadership candidates.

Wednesday saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/19/tory-leadership-race-stewart-out-as-johnson-extends-lead\">Rory Stewart knocked out</a>. After a YouGov poll of Conservative party members found they are willing to lose Scotland and Northern Ireland from the union and accept \u201csignificant\u201d economic damage to bring about Brexit, Hammond, the chancellor, is to say he will fight for an outcome that \u201cprotects the union and the prosperity of the United Kingdom\u201d. Johnson\u2019s backers are saying that in the final vote by party members they would prefer to face Hunt, rather than Gove, who triggered Johnson\u2019s exit from the 2016 leadership race. But they are being warned any tactical voting operation against Gove, like the one that eliminated Dominic Raab, would \u201cgo down very badly with Tory MPs and members\u201d. After Johnson failed on the BBC to guarantee Brexit by 31 October, members of the ERG group of hard Brexiter Tory MPs have warned the frontrunner that not sticking to the leave date will earn him the same fate as Theresa May, \u201conly a lot quicker\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Global heating devours glaciers \u2013 </strong>The<strong> </strong>Himalayas have lost more than a quarter of glacial ice lost over the last four decades, scientists have revealed.

There are some 20 Cricket World Cup group games still to run but after New Zealand\u2019s Kane Williamson produced an epic unbeaten 106 to overcome South Africa in a tense finale at Edgbaston, the identity of the four semi-finalists is already taking shape. Eoin Morgan claimed his six-hitting spree against Afghanistan went beyond his wildest dreams but, for Joe Root, who watched all but one of the 17 record-breaking blows from the non-striker\u2019s end, the captain\u2019s assault came as no surprise. Global rugby union is braced for fresh turmoil after the governing body announced it had discontinued plans to introduce a Nations Championship for the leading Test nations. And Feliciano L\u00f3pez sought to restore some injured pride on Wednesday when he denied any suggestion that he and his regular doubles partner, Marc L\u00f3pez, had been involved in an alleged betting scam at Wimbledon in 2017. Business The strong hints by the US Federal Reserve that it will begin cutting rates next month to head off growing global and domestic economic risks have encouraged investors to bid up stock markets in Asia overnight. They were following the increasingly optimistic mood on Wall Street where stock prices are near an all-time high. Futures trading suggests the FTSE100 will rise 0.4% at the opening this morning. The Fed\u2019s words pushed down the US dollar and yields on US 10-year bonds sank below 2%. The moves helped the pound lift a bit to $1.268 and \u20ac1.125. The papers The battle for the Tory leadership and Tuesday\u2019s BBC debate dominate the front pages today, and the adjectives are out in force. \u201cBiased Brazen Contemptible\u201d screams the Mail, complaining that leadership hopefuls were subjected to a \u201cdisgraceful debate\u201d involving \u201cnakedly anti-Tory\u201d guests. The Express sings a similar tune with \u201cStorm over Tory TV debate\u201d. The fight to be the next leader of the Conservative party, and the country, features heavily in other papers. The Times predicts \u201cJavid \u2018wants to be the next chancellor\u2019\u201d, while the i leads with \u201cGove momentum builds but Tories fear dirty tricks.\u201d The Telegraph is also worried about the chances of the environment minister: \u201cJohnson hatches plot to knock out Gove\u201d. The Guardian splashes on the ramifications of the end of an insurgent campaign: \u201cStewart exists Tory leadership race as Johnson pushes further ahead\u201d. Away from the Tory party maelstrom, the FT leads on the Fed holding rates steady, while the Mirror is outraged about an NHS hospital charging \u201c\u00a318k for hip op\u201d.

In the case of Ester, it\u2019s a young, African American trans woman in a rough part of New Orleans who feels invisible compared to cis women, and who is struggling to realize everything she offers to the world. While Razor Tongue\u2019s<em> </em>Belle is also a person of color, her very different background and current circumstances necessitate vastly different intersectional questions.

Although much of the attention on trans culture has been directed toward binary transitions, gender identities that embrace fluidity and/or points on the spectrum that are not identifiably male or female are an emergent \u2013 and now essential \u2013 part of the trans landscape. Taking a refreshing perspective on the confusion and discovery that is an inherent part of any transgender life, Zen in the Ice Rift touches on territory that the trans genre will hopefully map out in greater depth in coming years.</p> <p>The festival also explores trans lives around the world. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/313807194\">Brief Story from the Green Planet</a><em> </em>is a surreal Argentine sci-fi road trip, where trans characters share screen space with extraterrestrials. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwnm_mXlOA0\">The Garden Left Behind</a><em> </em>explores life for undocumented trans people when Tina, a cab driver in New York, makes the difficult decision to transition. And <a href=\"https://www.frameline.org/festival/film-guide/unsettled-seeking-refuge-in-america\">Unsettled</a><em> </em>documents the lives of four asylum-seekers who have fled homophobic violence from Africa and the Middle East.</p> <p>Frameline43\u2019s trans selections take seriously a core responsibility of cinema: to be aware that who and what it shows to audiences will become sources of role models and cultural understanding. This power is seen in another film playing at the festival, <a href=\"https://www.frameline.org/festival/film-guide/queering-the-script\">Queering the Script</a>, which documents the many facets of LGBTQ fandom and showcases droves of viewers who have been inspired to lead authentic lives by the characters they watch onscreen. </p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.frameline.org/festival\">Frameline43</a> runs from 20-30 June</p></li> </ul>",

While Razor Tongue\u2019s Belle is also a person of color, her very different background and current circumstances necessitate vastly different intersectional questions. Films and shows such as Razor Tongue and King Ester are welcome for the sophistication with which they navigate longstanding questions of discrimination and update them for a new generation. Exploring the struggles of a character assigned female at birth who doesn\u2019t fit into either pole of the gender binary, the stylish coming-of-age film Zen in the Ice Rift gestures at the one notable exclusion from Frameline43\u2019s trans movies: nonbinary identities. Although much of the attention on trans culture has been directed toward binary transitions, gender identities that embrace fluidity and/or points on the spectrum that are not identifiably male or female are an emergent \u2013 and now essential \u2013 part of the trans landscape. Taking a refreshing perspective on the confusion and discovery that is an inherent part of any transgender life, Zen in the Ice Rift touches on territory that the trans genre will hopefully map out in greater depth in coming years. The festival also explores trans lives around the world. Brief Story from the Green Planet is a surreal Argentine sci-fi road trip, where trans characters share screen space with extraterrestrials. The Garden Left Behind explores life for undocumented trans people when Tina, a cab driver in New York, makes the difficult decision to transition. And Unsettled documents the lives of four asylum-seekers who have fled homophobic violence from Africa and the Middle East. Frameline43\u2019s trans selections take seriously a core responsibility of cinema: to be aware that who and what it shows to audiences will become sources of role models and cultural understanding. This power is seen in another film playing at the festival, Queering the Script, which documents the many facets of LGBTQ fandom and showcases droves of viewers who have been inspired to lead authentic lives by the characters they watch onscreen. Frameline43 runs from 20-30 June",

      "bodyText": "Peter Dutton has indicated he will appeal a federal court\u2019s decision to allow doctors to assess a patient\u2019s need for a medical transfer from Nauru based on their medical file. The home affairs minister, who hopes to have the medevac legislation repealed by the parliament, has warned the ruling sets a precedent which could encourage people smugglers to restart the boats. But what does the medevac legislation actually say, what will Bromberg\u2019s ruling mean, and what has happened since the legislation passed. What was the court case about? Justice Mordecai Bromberg was examining the case of a 29-year-old Iraqi refugee who had spent six years on Nauru, and had his application for a medical transfer to Australia blocked by Dutton\u2019s department. It centred on whether doctors needed to speak to, or engage, with a patient directly, either through teleconference or in person, as set down in the legislation, or whether it would be enough for doctors to make an assessment based on medical files. Bromberg found that doctors could make do with a patient\u2019s medical history \u2013 much like they do if a patient is unconscious or based remotely. Dutton claims the ruling will make it easier for doctors to make recommendations for transfers, creating \u201ca situation where Australia has been compelled to take people, even of bad character\u201d. But that ignores the department\u2019s ability to veto cases, which can be overturned only by an independent panel picked by the government, if the minister has rejected the transfer on medical grounds. It is understood that about seven cases have been rejected by the immigration minister, David Coleman, of which just two are thought to have been overturned by the government\u2019s panel. The federal court decision does nothing to change the minister\u2019s ability to reject any applications on medical, security or character grounds and does not change the role of the independent health advice panel which reviews those rejections. Why can\u2019t doctors see them in person? Shortly after the 45th parliament passed the medevac legislation, Nauru banned teleconferences for residents, making it impossible to meet that part of the legislation. As the Guardian reported at the time that was most likely a response to M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res launching a telehealth service after it was kicked off the island by the government. The only exceptions are those who have had their application for a telehealth conference approved by the Nauruan cabinet. While aimed at MSF, the Nauru legislation affected the medevac laws as refugees and asylum seekers held on the island are also banned from teleconferencing with doctors when seeking medical transfer to the Australian mainland. What is the medevac bill? For a refresher, take a look at this piece from Katharine Murphy. Can criminals be brought to Australia? The Coalition-threatened influx of rapists, murderers and paedophiles seeking medical treatment if the medevac bill passed has not materialised. The only alleged criminals we have heard of entering Australia were two Rwandans accused of murder who were accepted as part of the US refugee swap deal struck by the Coalition. Under the legislation, a substantial criminal record, as applicable to the character test, is based on section 501(7) of the Migration Act. It is defined as a death or life imprisonment sentence, someone who has been sentenced to more than a year in jail, or has spent a cumulative period in prison of 12 months or more. You\u2019ll find more on that here. Leaving aside the fact that anyone found guilty of a crime, even a particularly heinous one, is still entitled to medical treatment, and someone charged with a crime is not considered automatically guilty, the medevac bill includes a final veto for the minister on security grounds. That includes cases in which the person has a substantial criminal record. Anyone brought to Australia for medical treatment is not released into the community. They remain in detention and are escorted to medical appointments, remaining under guard while receiving treatment. Why is Dutton saying it will lead to boats starting up again? Because he never stopped saying the boats would start up again.

Labor\u2019s home affairs spokeswoman, Kristina Keneally, has called Dutton\u2019s warnings about the boats \u201cscaremongering\u201d, because nothing has changed and the medevac legislation still applies only to people already on Nauru and Manus Island. \u201cThe government has cried wolf on medevac before, and they\u2019ll cry wolf again,\u201d she said. \u201cThis legal action was always about a clarification of the law, and provides certainty that people on Nauru can submit an application to trigger the medevac legislation and process \u2026 Applicants will still be assessed by doctors, both in Nauru and Australia.\u201d Dutton, however, repeated his warnings on Thursday, telling the ABC that smugglers would \u201cspin and twist\u201d the ruling to entice people into paying for illegal passages to Australia.

Jack Seale Sewermen 9pm, 5Spike The first in a grim but insightful series about the challenges faced by staff at United Utilities, one of the UK\u2019s biggest water companies, who battle \u201cunflushables\u201d, bursts and 100-tonne fatbergs, at the same time as constructing one of Britain\u2019s biggest new fresh water pipelines. Who knew dealing with \u201ca tankful of turds\u201d could be so fascinating? MB The Other Two 10pm, E4 It really is a family affair this week in this wry comedy as \u201cCare Bear\u201d Cary feebly pumps iron in preparation for a dire TV chatshow also scheduled to feature mum Pat. Chase is exercising, too, for a new music video, while Brooke confronts her past as a professional dancer. MB Film choice The Stranger (Orson Welles, 1946) 3.40am, Talking Pictures TV After The Magnificent Ambersons, this is Orson Welles in a more conventional, studio-pleasing guise. The war has ended and Nazi Franz Kindler (Welles) is hiding out in a Connecticut town, posing as the spouse of an innocent Loretta Young. But war crimes investigator Edward G Robinson is on the trail. Paul Howlett Sport choice Tennis: Queen\u2019s 1pm, BBC Two. The concluding second-round singles matches.

It was my home town and I spent the first eight years of my life there, but it stopped receiving financial support and fell into neglect. In 1993, my family became part of the mass exodus. Tiksi was built on the coast of the Arctic Ocean as an outpost on the northern sea route, a port town and a military base during the cold war. When I was growing up, there was a whole secret part of town that even had its own schools where nobody was allowed to go. Tiksi was also really important in the history of Russian Arctic exploration \u2013 it\u2019s where the icebreakers set off from. But today it\u2019s struggling. I\u2019d been away almost 20 years before I went back. Returning felt more like stepping into a dream than back into my childhood. When we\u2019re little our memories merge with dreams. The Tiksi I went back to was nothing like the place I left. I found it really depressing. I didn\u2019t have any relatives or friends, and the state of the town shocked me.

The vehicle was travelling at speed when it collided head-on with a truck loaded with tomatoes.</p> <p>After the crash, you could see contorted limbs through the smashed windows. The entire front third of the vehicle was concertinaed and the roof was ripped open. Bags and clothing spilled out on to the road, and there were large patches of blood on the asphalt. Twelve of the 14 labourers died. Only two days before, also in Foggia, four labourers had died in a similar accident: 16 dead in 48 hours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--thumbnail\" data-alt=\"pulitzer and FIRE credit\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;meta content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt; &lt;link href=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/gia/fonts/v1/fonts.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; &lt;style&gt;   STEP TWO paste all this into the code box within the snippet, then change weighting to 'thumbnail'  &lt;meta content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt; &lt;link href=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/gia/fonts/v1/fonts.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; &lt;style&gt;  .wrapper{  padding: 0;  position: relative;  border-top: 1px solid #dcdcdc;}  h1{  font-family: &quot;Guardian Text Sans Web&quot;,&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,&quot;Lucida Grande&quot;,sans-serif;  font-weight: 900;  color: #121212; }  .boxout-primary-content{  padding-top: 3px;  margin-top: 6px;  margin-bottom: 24px;  font-family: &quot;Guardian Text Sans Web&quot;,&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,&quot;Lucida Grande&quot;,sans-serif;  color: #121212;  font-size: 12px;  line-height: 1.3; }  a {  color: #ad0006;  border-bottom: 1px solid #dcdcd; }  a:hover {  border-bottom-color: #ad0006; }  .logo {  max-width: 175px;  width: 100%;  margin-top: 12px; }  &lt;/style&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;boxout-primary-content&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;This piece was produced with support from the &lt;a href='https://pulitzercenter.org/about-us/'target=&quot;_parent&quot;&gt;Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting&lt;/a&gt; in association with &lt;a href='http://www.firenewsroom.org/'target=&quot;_parent&quot;&gt;Freelance Investigative Reporters and Editors (FIRE)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In the Italian south, the lives of foreign agricultural labourers are so cheap that many NGOs have described their conditions as a modern form of slavery. They live in isolated rural ruins or shanty towns. Some have Italian residency permits, but many don\u2019t. A few have work contracts, although union organisers often find they are fake. Desperate for work, these labourers will accept any job in the fields even if the wages are far below, and the hours far above, union standards. The produce they pick regularly ends up on the shelves of Italian, and international, supermarkets, bought by consumers who have no idea of the suffering involved.</p> <p>Although some of the workers are eastern Europeans, most of those picking crops in the Italian fields come from Africa, mainly \u2013 at the moment \u2013 from Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria, Sudan and Somalia. The number of arrivals has been growing exponentially in recent years: the number of boat people landing in Italy peaked at <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/italy/italy-sea-arrivals-dashboard-january-december-2016\" title=\"\">181,436 in 2016</a>.</p> <p>The largest migrant reception centres are almost all in the south \u2013 in Sicily and Calabria \u2013 where mafia organisations exert greatest control and where agriculture requires a constant supply of labour. That supply is organised by gangmasters: agents who recruit seasonal workers and who are tasked with squeezing extra work out of them at the lowest possible cost.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a few factors on which modern slavery thrives,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.antislavery.org/author/jakubs/\" title=\"\">Jakub Sobik</a>, of the British NGO Anti-Slavery International: \u201cVulnerability, discrimination and a lack of the rule of law.\u201d In Italian agriculture, all of these conditions are present.</p> <p>There is no question that the migrant workers are vulnerable to exploitation, but Yvan Sagnet, a Cameroonian anti-slavery activist who once worked picking tomatoes in Puglia, explains that the vulnerability is mental as much as physical. \u201cWhen you have been enslaved,\u201d Sagnet says, \u201cit\u2019s such a strong thing that your head begins to reason differently. It\u2019s not the slavery of hundreds of years ago, when you were deprived of your liberty. Slavery in the 21st century doesn\u2019t need chains, because they exploit a continual sense of intimidation that the most vulnerable people, like immigrants, feel.\u201d</p> <p>Discrimination and violence against African workers gets worse in Italy with every passing day. In 2018, there were 126 racially motivated attacks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/28/italys-intelligence-agency-warns-of-rise-in-racist-attacks\" title=\"\">recorded</a> in the country, some fatal: in May last year a neo-fascist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/03/driver-opens-fire-african-migrants-italian-city-macerata\" title=\"\">shot and wounded</a> six black people in Macerata, near the central city of Ancona. A Cameroonian was shot in the city of Aprilia, an hour\u2019s drive from Rome. A few weeks before, in July, a Moroccan man was beaten to death there. The problem is so severe that the Italian intelligence agency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/28/italys-intelligence-agency-warns-of-rise-in-racist-attacks\" title=\"\">warned</a> earlier this year about the rise in far-right groups and \u201ca real risk of an increase in episodes of intolerance towards foreigners\u201d.</p> <p>But it\u2019s the absence of the rule of law \u2013 Sobik\u2019s third prerequisite for modern slavery \u2013 that is most evident in Italian agriculture. Labourers without papers are considered outside the law, so they can expect no protection. \u201cYou know that what you\u2019re suffering isn\u2019t right,\u201d says Sagnet, \u201cbut you can\u2019t denounce it because they\u2019ll report you as an illegal immigrant.\u201d</p> <p>In the Italian deep south, where the mafia runs a parallel system of local rule with its own violent enforcement, the law holds little sway. Workplace inspectors are \u201cvery few and very corrupt\u201d, according to Rocco Borgese, secretary of the FLAI-CGIL union (which represents agricultural workers) in Gioia Tauro, Calabria.</p> <p>In 2018, Global Slavery Index, an organisation providing a country-by-country ranking of the number of people currently enslaved, estimated there are 50,000 enslaved agricultural workers in Italy (the Index claims <a href=\"https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2018/findings/country-studies/italy/\" title=\"\">a total of 145,000 people</a> are enslaved in the country as a whole, forced into prostitution and domestic services). The UN\u2019s special rapporteur on slavery <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">said last autumn</a> that 400,000 agricultural workers in Italy are at risk of being exploited and almost 100,000 are forced to live in inhumane conditions.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a form of exploitation which, in some ways, exceeds what happened in the past, when slave-owners at least cared about the health of their slaves because they needed them,\u201d said an Italian-Ivorian trade-unionist and campaigner, Aboubakar Soumahoro. \u201cToday, there\u2019s not even that care.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than denying the situation, the country\u2019s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/14/merde-alors-matteo-salvini-african-slaves-remarks-draw-angry-outburst\" title=\"\">said</a> immigrants are the \u201cnew slaves\u201d. The observation isn\u2019t sympathetic but strategic: publicising their destitution is a calculated attempt to dissuade more from coming to Italy. It serves his political purpose to perpetuate their ghettoisation, and also shores up the far-right narrative that immigrants can never integrate.</p> <p>Salvini and his allies have turned logic on its head. For them, the victims aren\u2019t the people who have been enslaved, but the Italian people. In their view, the criminals aren\u2019t gangmasters who exploit the workers, but immigrants (\u201cevery day in Italy\u201d, Salvini has tweeted, \u201cimmigrants commit 700 crimes\u201d). One of his most familiar slogans is \u201c<em>la pacchia \u00e8 finita</em>\u201d (\u201cthe free ride is over\u201d) \u2013 echoing the popular myth that refugees and pro-immigration leftists have somehow got rich at the expense of ordinary Italians. When you speak to rightwing politicians in Italy, almost all reiterate the conspiracy theory that mass immigration has been financed by dark forces. </p> <p>It is true, however, that some people are making money off the backs of the displaced and desperate. Italy\u2019s agricultural sector is booming, with food products making up 8.7% of Italy\u2019s flagging GDP. The tomato industry alone is worth \u00a32.8bn. Mass immigration is chaotic and uncontrolled, but the exploitation of immigrant workers is systematic.</p> <p>\u201cThe criminal economy is far better organised than the ordinary one,\u201d says Leonardo Palmisano, sociologist and author of Mafia Caporale (\u201cGangmaster Mafia\u201d), a study of the illegal exploitation of workers in Italy.</p> <p>Supermarkets and their suppliers cite their use of certifications that are intended to reassure consumers that the goods we buy are produced under legal labour practices. But as these stories demonstrate, such figleaves are totally unreliable, and simply make the consumer unwittingly complicit: those purchasing Italian produce are unaware that their healthy Mediterranean diet is, sometimes, the fruit of 21st-century slavery.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Rosarno, in Calabria, on the toe of the Italian boot, is an ugly town full of unfinished buildings and uncollected rubbish. It is notorious as a stronghold of the \u2019Ndrangheta, the Calabrian mafia, whose principal sources of income are drug trafficking, protection rackets, construction and agriculture. Nothing moves here, it\u2019s said, without their assent.</p> <p>Thousands of immigrants head here every winter to work on the orange harvest, and end up staying in shanty towns three miles west of Rosarno. This cluster of temporary shelters, near a town called San Ferdinando, has grown up on the far side of the dual carriageway, the railway, and an industrial estate. Close by are the red-and-white cranes of Gioia Tauro port, the entry point for much of the cocaine sold in Europe. As you approach, you see dozens of young black men riding old bikes, plastic bags dangling from their handlebars. All the bushes for miles around have been coppiced by labourers for twigs and sticks to build their shacks.</p> <p>There are three shanty towns in San Ferdinando. Testa dell\u2019Acqua is a horseshoe of 20 leaking mobile homes. The white walls have turned black with mould. Old freezers have been refashioned into chicken houses and TV aerials are tied to long branches. There\u2019s even a small cultivation of maize. Nearby, 700 more people live in 54 blue tents (more than a dozen per tent) supplied by the Italian Ministry of the Interior, which were put up in August 2017.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"65afe28c3adc27a7c0b0f0ef6a4807353658deb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65afe28c3adc27a7c0b0f0ef6a4807353658deb4/0_267_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the San Ferdinando camps for migrant labourers near the Gioia Tauro port in southern Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the San Ferdinando camps for migrant labourers near the Gioia Tauro port in southern Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KONTROLAB/LightRocket via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The main shanty town has the mud and improvised paths of a very edgy music festival. Stray dogs, cats and rodents pick through piles of rubbish. Police cars prowl outside day and night. You can still see the shack that was left uncompleted by a 29-year-old Malian, Soumaila Sacko, who <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.it/20180604/migrant-workers-in-southern-italy-strike-mali-man-soumaila-sacko-shot-dead\" title=\"\">was killed</a> while he was in the process of constructing it: he had arranged 15 vertical sticks, five by three. About a quarter of the roof of sheet metal had been hammered in place. He was shot dead last summer by an Italian while he was trying to find some more metal in a nearby abandoned warehouse.</p> <p>The encampment, though, is strangely vibrant. There\u2019s music and laughter. You feel as if you could find anything here: there\u2019s a bar, a hairdresser, an ironmonger, a butcher, a bike-repair guy, a mosque and a church. There\u2019s even a football team, called Qui Bosco (\u201cHere\u2019s the Wood\u201d). The resourcefulness is evident: old inner-tubes have been knotted to tie down a tarp, an old shelf has become a bridge over a ditch of plastic bottles, a metal bed base is used as a screen door.</p> <p>This area is of Calabria is known for its orange groves, and in late autumn, as the fruit turns, like traffic lights, from green to amber, young men turn up carrying all their worldly goods, and negotiate with someone to buy an old, damp mattress (\u20ac5) and rent a patch in a shack on which to sling it (often \u20ac30 a month). Nothing is dry.</p> <p>Here, the nationalities are mostly Nigerian, Gambian, Ghanaian, Sudanese, Somali and Burkinab\u00e9. About 5% are women. There is one tap, but the water isn\u2019t drinkable. Toilets are nothing more than holes in the ground. There are a few generators and various gas bottles for cooking. Nobody knows how many people live in these conditions around San Ferdinando, but at the height of the season, there are probably 2,000 people.</p> <p>A charity offering medical support in these shanty towns, MEDU, says 21% of those it sees have intestinal ailments, 17% respiratory problems, and 22% osteoarticular pains. Many have mental health problems, and the horrors they have suffered on their journey here have left them with PTSD. As we walk round, a young Nigerian woman called Honour shouts: \u201cYou must help us.\u201d She shows the rashes up her arms; she doesn\u2019t know if the skin irritation is due to constant contact with pesticides in the fields, or mosquitoes and horseflies. One of the many microbusinesses here is a trade in painkillers, especially ketoprofen. Sometimes they have to cycle for one or two hours to get to work, and most people are so exhausted that all they do when not working is sleep.</p> <p>Life expectancy in slums such as this is very low. Jacob, a Ghanaian who keeps chickens in the disused freezers, shows us where Nigerian migrant worker <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.it/20180129/migrant-workers-calabria-protest-rosarno-fire\" title=\"\">Becky Moses</a> used to live before she died in a fire in 2018. Fire is a constant danger: it is the only way to keep warm, and people will burn anything: old car seats, tyres, cardboard. Three others have died in fires on this site alone in the last six months.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>There are dozens of slums like San Ferdinando across southern Italy, swelling and contracting according to the season. Often, the labourers are driven from one remote shanty town to another by gangmasters. After a winter in Calabria picking oranges and kiwis, they go north in the spring to Campania to pick strawberries, melons and shallots. In summer, they cross to Puglia, the heel of Italy, to pick tomatoes and peppers, before moving to the Veneto or Piemonte to pick grapes in early autumn. There are variants: some will go to Cassibile, in the south-east corner of Sicily, for the new potatoes, or stay behind in the slums once the workers have moved on to pick through the detritus and try and sell off scrap metal and sodden mattresses.</p> <p>A major draw for tomato-pickers is Borgo Mezzanone, near Foggia. One of the men who died in the carminibus crash last summer had a brother, Sid, who was living in London but came to Italy when he heard the news. Sid shows us around the camp. He says he couldn\u2019t believe his brother had been living in such misery. \u201cIt\u2019s not real,\u201d he says.</p> <p>We enter the camp through a man-sized hole in a fence. \u201cWelcome to Africa,\u201d says Sid ruefully. Smoke is billowing from makeshift homes. Everywhere there are plastic bottles, smashed concrete, planks of wood, torn clothing, old brick phones and empty bottles of whisky and vodka. Abandoned mattresses act as walls and roofs to the shacks, bungied together with the swelling chipboard of kitchen worktops.<strong> </strong>Someone has painted on a wall in white: \u201cshut up becaus is rule\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"890cefe88c6a0957709204cfb99dafd8c3fadac8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/890cefe88c6a0957709204cfb99dafd8c3fadac8/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tomato pickers near Foggia, Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tomato pickers near Foggia, Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Gentile/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Migrants usually arrive in Italy with nothing but debts, after borrowing money from relatives back home to finance their journey to Europe. They usually know nobody when they reach their destination, and have no one to appeal to when in difficulty. Few even reveal to relatives back home the desperate situation in which they find themselves. In an abandoned warehouse, not far from the shanty town of Borgo Mezzanone in Puglia, an immigrant worker called Njobo tells us: \u201cThe Africans that are living here, most of them are living a fake life. They look for beautiful pictures and put them on Instagram. None of us would take a picture from this place and send it back.\u201d He gestured around his makeshift home, revealing the dilapidation of his surroundings, the room dotted with shredded plastic rags and broken glass.</p> <p>These immigrants don\u2019t only have debts to relatives, they are also desperate to obtain residency permits. The so-called Bossi-Fini law of 2002 (named after the two party leaders who drafted it) grants a residency permit only to those who have work contracts, meaning immigrants will put up with exploitation in order to obtain one. Those without residency permits are even more vulnerable. Two of the people who died in fires in the San Ferdinando shanty town had drifted there to hide from authorities because their permits had recently expired.</p> <p>Pay, already low, is even lower for \u201cclandestines\u201d. Many of the labourers we spoke to say gangmasters regularly withhold their identity documents and pay. Even if, in theory, they are free to leave, circumstances force them to stay put. \u201cIf you have worked for a week or for two weeks and they haven\u2019t paid you,\u201d says Sagnet, \u201cand they have your documents, of course you don\u2019t leave.\u201d</p> <p>Many migrants have reported being beaten by employers, who also make sexual demands. Violence, especially against women, is alarmingly common. Beauty, a Nigerian woman in a purple wig who lives in the San Ferdinando shanty town, told us: \u201cYou never feel safe. Even when you sleep, you have one eye open.\u201d</p> <p>Tayo, a 22-year-old Nigerian, was assaulted when she tried to defend a friend. Sexual violence is a constant in these bleak places: in 2015, in Ragusa, Sicily, a labourer living in a shanty town was killed and his wife raped. In 2011, an investigation revealed dozens of Romanian labourers had been forced into prostitution. </p> <p>Inside the camp, there are shops selling everything: iPhone chargers, bracelets, sim cards, bread, crisps, hair extensions, bike pumps and shoes. Vendors are roasting pieces of meat coated in a thick marinade and heckling passers-by. There\u2019s a group of men intently watching a game of draughts. Restaurants in shacks advertise their menus: \u201cThe best taste of The Gambia\u201d. There\u2019s a club lined with discoloured sofas and afrobeat blaring from the stereo. Another restaurant doubles as a brothel. But there is no running water or formal sanitation facilities anywhere.</p> <p>\u201cIf, when I was in Africa, you had told me this is what Europe was like, I would insult you,\u201d Njobo says. \u201cI would never have believed it.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The men and women living in these shanty towns are exploited from the moment they arrive on Italian soil. The sociologist and author Leonardo Palmisano, who investigates agricultural slavery and organised crime, says: \u201cThe mafia in the south controls the reception of immigrants. Centres for asylum-seekers have processed hundreds of thousands of immigrants, and the mafia is often part of the management.\u201d</p> <p>The Italian state pays \u20ac35 per immigrant per day (and \u20ac45 for minors) to reception centres that house them. During the mass migrations of recent years, the government contracted out the housing and feeding of migrants, which became a billion-euro industry. The largest reception centres in Italy are called Caras (<em>centri di accoglienza per richiedenti asilo</em>, or \u201cwelcome centres for asylum-seekers\u201d), each in command of multi-million euro contracts for providing food and other services. One investigation in 2017 into the Cara Sant\u2019Anna (based in an abandoned military airport in Isola di Capo Rizzuto in Calabria) estimated that, over 10 years, the Arena mafia clan had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39922085\" title=\"\">embezzled a third</a> of the \u20ac100m state funding. Tiny portions of out-of-date food were served. The number of residents was exaggerated to increase cashflow. The asylum centre had become, in the words of the investigating magistrate, \u201ca cashpoint for the mafia\u201d. The running of Cara Sant\u2019Anna has now been taken over by the Red Cross.</p> <p>Something similar was happening all over the country. The Roman mafioso, Salvatore Buzzi, whose consortium repeatedly won contracts to arrange housing for migrants, was heard in a 2014 police wiretap <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/07/june-29-co-operative-italy-rome\" title=\"\">boasting</a>: \u201cHave you got any idea how much I earn through immigrants? I make more from immigrants than I do from drugs.\u201d His consortium enjoyed annual revenues of \u20ac55m.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/14/italy-rejects-record-number-of-asylum-applications\" title=\"\">political wind</a> was turning against those refugees even before Matteo Salvini became the Italian interior minister in June 2018. In 2017, 58% of asylum requests were turned down. The appeals process, too, was abolished. Those so-called <em>diniegati</em> \u2013 men and women denied asylum \u2013 invariably preferred to disappear into the nearby agricultural slums than risk deportation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1bf70065cc36f6e80b767c46868ee1a7fe8ca391\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bf70065cc36f6e80b767c46868ee1a7fe8ca391/0_0_5976_3984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Migrant labourers at an abandoned cement factory in Sicily.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Migrant labourers at an abandoned cement factory in Sicily.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There, the migrants continue to be exploited for profit, through a system called <em>caporalato</em>. This is the practice through which the recruitment and payment of day-labourers is subcontracted to a gangmaster, the <em>caporale</em>. An ancient and sinister figure in Italian history, the <em>caporale</em> was \u2013 throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries \u2013 a proto-mafioso, the enforcer of the landlord\u2019s will. The difference now is that the mafioso himself is likely to be a landowner, and it\u2019s his orders that are being enforced by a usually non-Italian <em>caporale</em>.</p> <p>The practice of <em>caporalato</em> has been illegal since a 2016 law banned intermediaries from exploiting vulnerable agricultural labourers (thanks, largely, to the courageous campaigning of Yvan Sagnet), and yet it is still ubiquitous. At 4am, you see hundreds of labourers cycling on main roads, without lights, to reach the pick-up points for transport to the fields. There, at crossroads and in lay-bys, the black labourers wait for a <em>caporale</em> and his minibus. No one knows if there will be work. \u201cWork yes, work no,\u201d says one phlegmatic man, moving his hands as if he were juggling invisible balls. The only certainty is that anyone who has agitated for fair pay or better conditions will be automatically excluded.</p> <p>Costs vary, but in general the labourers have to pay around \u20ac3 for transportation to and from the fields. The vehicles usually carry double the legal limit of passengers, with men and women sitting on top of each other. The fields are so remote that, once there, the workers are obliged to buy sandwiches and water for \u20ac3-4. It costs 50 cents to charge a phone or, if anyone falls ill or has an accident, \u20ac20 to be taken to hospital.</p> <p>Although piecework in agriculture is illegal, that is how all labourers are paid: the going rate is \u20ac3.50 to fill a chest with 300kg of tomatoes, or \u20ac5.50 if they are cherry tomatoes; workers receive \u20ac1 for a huge case of tangerines or 50 cents for one of oranges. The going rate for 100kg of grapes is \u20ac13. Even if you work at top speed, it is hard to make much more than \u20ac30 a day, and that\u2019s before all those deductions. Contracts are essentially worthless: local unionists try to intervene, checking online to see if the correct social security payments have been made on behalf of workers. They very rarely have. Union representative Rocco Borgese shakes his head glumly: \u201cWe have lost our humanity,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Because the Bossi-Fini law ties residency to the possession of a work contract, many purchase a contract for hundreds of euros. Other times, the contract is issued in the name, not of the immigrant, but of a local man or woman who doesn\u2019t work and has probably never been to the fields. This guarantees the local person agricultural unemployment benefit if, on paper, it looks as if they have worked for more than 53 days in the year. In 2015, 3,000 of these \u201cfalse labourers\u201d were discovered in Calabria.</p> <p>For the labourers dropped off at dawn in the fields, the work is relentless. In December 2018, we went out with five Africans cutting broccoli. They were wearing ill-fitting gloves and cracked wellington boots. Their clothing was frayed and encrusted with dry mud. They were each given a small knife. A green John Deere tractor crawled forward, and the five men crouched down, cutting the thick stems and chucking the broccoli heads in a crate behind the tractor. The stems, in the winter dawn, were covered in icy shards, and their knives often broke against them. By the end of the day, broken blades lay in a small pile just inside the tractor. With inadequate footwear, it was easy to slice your foot open. It was so cold we could see steam rising off the mens\u2019 bent backs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0ee98946783a9ac8a548b6131745bf6b88c5542d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ee98946783a9ac8a548b6131745bf6b88c5542d/0_0_5976_3992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man\u2019s hands calloused from relentless farm labour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man\u2019s hands calloused from relentless farm labour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the space of seven hours, these five men managed to fill 110 crates of broccoli. They were owed around \u20ac30, but nobody knew when they would be paid. When they are, they have nowhere to store their wages, so they carry cash \u2013 sometimes a month or two\u2019s savings \u2013 at all times. This makes them targets for muggers and vulnerable to violent attacks.</p> <p>After a long shift, the men were driven back to an abandoned farmhouse. Eleven people shared the two-bedroom ruin. There were no windows, running water or electricity. They each paid a rent of \u20ac20 euros per month. The only heat came from burning scrap wood. Many don\u2019t survive these punishing conditions. In the summer of 2015 alone, 15 labourers died, including Paola Clemente, in the fields of Andria in Apulia, and Abdullah Muhammed, a 47-year-old Sudanese, in Nard\u00f2, further south in Puglia. In October 2017, a Ghanaian man, Daniel Mensah, died of hypothermia. In an article in the British Medical Journal in March, doctors representing another Italian medical charity, Doctors With Africa, <a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2019/03/27/stop-the-exploitation-of-migrant-agricultural-workers-in-italy/\" title=\"\">wrote</a>: \u201cOver the past six years the number of agricultural workers who have died as a result of their work is more than 1,500.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On 2 October last year, a Calabrian mayor, Mimmo Lucano, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/02/pro-refugee-italian-mayor-arrested-suspicion-aiding-illegal-migration-domenico-lucano-riace\" title=\"\">was arrested</a>. He stood accused of abetting illegal immigration and public-contract crimes, allegedly arranging a sham marriage for a Nigerian woman and improperly awarding refuse collection contracts to a local cooperative. For years, Lucano had been the mayor of Riace, a hilltop town 20km east of Rosarno.</p> <p>The town first became famous in 1972 when a snorkeller discovered the so-called Riace bronzes, a pair of stunning statues of bearded, naked Greek warriors dating from 450BC. Now, though, Riace is renowned throughout Italy as one of the only places to have attempted true, revolutionary integration of migrants. The town, which was underpopulated, welcomed migrants and opened schools and businesses to them. Lucano\u2019s arrest represented a crackdown on anyone offering an alternative to the deliberate marginalisation of migrant workers. (The investigation which led to his arrest was ironically code-named \u201c<em>Xenia</em>\u201d, the ancient Greek word for hospitality.)</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nothing,\u201d Matteo Salvini said of Lucano after his arrest.</p> <p>When we wandered around the streets of Riace last autumn, it was hard to imagine a sharper contrast to the agricultural slums. There were black toddlers singing in English from a balcony (\u201crain, rain, go away \u2026 \u201d). A veiled woman laughed with an elderly Italian man on a street corner. Bottles of water were left on park benches in case anyone was in need. The recycling bins were tidy wooden rectangles. Since the steep streets are too narrow for trucks, the binmen in recent years have been immigrants using donkeys.</p> <p>The place felt like a pre-industrial Italian village with an international twist: there were small workshops \u2013 a ceramicist, a seamstress and so on \u2013 but those artisans were from Afghanistan, from Kabul and Herat. The whole village (there are fewer than 2,000 inhabitants) was colourful: the steps of a modern amphitheatre were rainbowed, and around every corner were murals of peasant workers. There were plenty of political messages too: the slogan \u201cWe raise our hands against the \u2019Ndrangheta\u201d, painted on a wall, was surrounded with children\u2019s handprints. There were tributes to Desaparecidos and Zapatistas, and the names of many mafia victims.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ca60e81fd640b6595be4544b8ca001e5441c1356\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca60e81fd640b6595be4544b8ca001e5441c1356/0_0_4697_3134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sign in Riace reading \u2018Welcome to the Global Village\u2019, put up before Italy\u2019s new far-right government cracked down on the town\u2019s pro-immigration model.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign in Riace reading \u2018Welcome to the Global Village\u2019, put up before Italy\u2019s new far-right government cracked down on the town\u2019s pro-immigration model.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The story began in 1998 when 175 Kurds (including 72 children) arrived in Riace\u2019s nearby stretch of seaside. Mimmo Lucano, then a 40-year-old teacher, decided everything possible should be done to welcome the refugees. He was soon given the nickname \u201cMimmo the Kurd\u201d as he tried to find accommodation and work for them. Riace, back then, was empty and crumbling. Many residents had moved to the cities or the north, looking for work, and local businesses were being obliterated by the arrival of shopping malls and chain stores. Lucano had a vision of immigrants not only being helped, but helping bring Riace back to life. \u201cThe migrant is a resource, not something to be used for profit,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In 1999, Lucano founded an association, City of the Future (inspired by the Calabrian utopianist Tommaso Campanella). The village of Riace applied for funding for a new government programme called \u201cdiffused welcome\u201d, which would later become <a href=\"https://www.sprar.it/english\" title=\"\">a model called SPRAR</a> (system of protection for asylum-seekers and refugees). In this model, rather than using huge detention centres, local councils accept immigrants and are given the funding and responsibility to integrate them. Unlike the many dysfunctional models used in the Italian immigration system, SPRARs are widely admired.</p> <p>Lucano successfully stood as mayor in 2004, 2010 and 2014. He used the \u20ac35-a-day state funding for migrants not for personal enrichment but to employ 70 \u201ccultural mediators\u201d (teachers, therapists, careers advisers etc) who helped those migrants become part of the social fabric. Funds were also used to renovate empty buildings, to create cottage industries and give migrants small salaries, bringing the cobbled streets back to life in the process. In the last 20 years, Riace has received 6,000 immigrants from 20 different countries. \u201cRiace\u201d, the road sign now says when you arrive, \u201cA town of welcome\u201d.</p> <p>There was something so enchanting about what Lucano had achieved in a remote Calabrian village that he became a national figure. RAI, the Italian state broadcaster, began filming a docudrama about Riace and its mayor. Lucano <a href=\"http://fortune.com/worlds-greatest-leaders/2016/domenico-lucano-40/\" title=\"\">was listed</a> in Fortune magazine\u2019s 50 most influential leaders in the world.</p> <p>\u201cI define our utopia as normality,\u201d he said in 2016. Lucano remained refreshingly scornful of worldly success and power, and his speeches were simple: \u201cWe unite our weaknesses with many other desperate people from all parts of the world. We share a dream of a new humanity free of mafias, racism, fascism and all injustices.\u201d</p> <p>Nobody doubted his sincerity: when Becky Moses died in a San Ferdinando fire last year \u2013 she had been living in Riace until her residency permit had been denied \u2013 a grieving Lucano brought her back to Riace for burial.</p> <p>But his bluntness and visibility made Lucano some powerful enemies. Funds from central government became ever-more delayed, forcing Lucano to create Riace\u2019s own currency of IOUs (the \u201cbanknotes\u201d had the faces of Mahatma Gandhi, Che Guevara and anti-mafia campaigner Peppino Impastato). The RAI docudrama was blocked under pressure from Italy\u2019s new far-right government. Last summer, Lucano went on hunger strike when he learned that the Ministry of the Interior had suspended payment for the accommodation of asylum seekers for the second half of 2017, suddenly creating a \u20ac650,000 black hole in the town\u2019s budget. Since his arrest, Lucano has been banned from his town. His trial began this month, in the aftermath of a Salvini-allied mayor being elected as his replacement in May.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"225b34affb9cf32d60607131eff78dcc7a5223f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/225b34affb9cf32d60607131eff78dcc7a5223f3/0_0_3072_2047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Riace\u2019s former mayor, Mimmo Lucano.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riace\u2019s former mayor, Mimmo Lucano.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cesare Abbate/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The scorn of Italy\u2019s new government for the Riace model reveals a convergence of interests, both ideological and economic. Salvini\u2019s electoral base doesn\u2019t want to see immigrants at all, let alone witness them becoming part of the social fabric. In terms of the local economy, the more helpless and homeless immigrants are, the cheaper it is to employ them.</p> <p>The so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/24/italian-government-approves-bill-anti-migrant-measures-matteo-salvini\" title=\"\">Salvini decree</a>\u201d, which passed into law last autumn, was promoted as a tightening-up of security and law enforcement, but it was also a bid to combat immigration and remove humanitarian protection for an estimated 100,000 refugees. Many have since been evicted from refugee centres.</p> <p>The sight of bulldozers flattening illegal settlements has become common on the evening news: in March, at the end of the orange-picking season, the main San Ferdinando shanty town was eradicated: tarpaulins, sticks and scrap metal snapped under the bulldozers\u2019 jagged teeth. In April, the same happened \u2013 for the third time \u2013 to part of the Borgo Mezzanone shanty town.</p> <p>Many activists believe this modern form of slavery is not a perversion of 21st-century capitalism, but the logical result of putting profit before every other consideration. \u201cUnless you counter the huge power of the multinationals,\u201d Yvan Sagnet told us, \u201cit will be difficult to resolve the problem of working conditions. Because <em>caporalato</em> and modern slavery are the effect of a system, not the cause of it: the effect of ultraliberalism applied to agriculture.\u201d</p> <p>If the victims are obvious, so too are the beneficiaries: food corporations, supermarkets and we, the consumers.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The enslavement of immigrant workers in the Italian south has been an open secret for years. But although the gangmaster system, in which workers are exploited and poorly paid, was outlawed in 2016, law enforcement has not caught up: a recent report by the agricultural workers\u2019 union, FLAI-CGIL, suggested that \u201cabout 100,000 (mostly foreign) workers are forced to suffer workplace blackmail and dilapidated living conditions\u201d.</p> <p>A system of certification for Italian and international supermarkets to say that their produce is not the fruit of slavery has also failed to eradicate the practice. On the contrary: for decades, organised crime and discount supermarkets have forced down the price of raw products, reducing payment along the food supply chain and creating a system that inevitably punishes the most vulnerable.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a comfortable message for supermarkets\u201d, says Rachel Wilshaw, ethical trade manager at Oxfam, \u201cbut in squeezing their suppliers so hard commercially that they can only make a profit by exploiting workers, supermarkets themselves are driving the conditions that can result in modern slavery in their supply chain.\u201d</p> <p>The story of price reduction for agricultural produce in the Italian deep south began 40 years ago, in January 1979, when two lorry drivers headed south from Verona to purchase oranges. They were in Rizziconi, next to Rosarno, when they were stopped and shot dead. Their mistake had been to purchase the oranges not too cheaply, but at a fair price. The \u2019Ndrangheta intended to be the sole purchaser of oranges, and any competition had to be eradicated. As Giuseppe Lavorato \u2013 Rosarno\u2019s anti-mafia mayor from 1994 to 2002 \u2013 wrote in his memoir: \u201cIn the 1970s, the \u2019Ndrangheta kept away from our towns any trader who paid an equitable price [for oranges] in order to remain the only buyer and impose its own low price.\u201d</p> <p>According to Lavorato, the \u2019Ndrangheta wasn\u2019t content simply to be the sole purchaser of Calabrian oranges. It wanted to become the \u201cexclusive protagonist\u201d in the entire commercial chain, obliging farmers to go through them for every stage of production \u201cfor the labourers at harvest time, for the companies selling crates, for the lorries to transport the produce\u201d.</p> <p>Throughout the 1980s, oranges were increasingly profitable. Fizzy orangeades were becoming popular, and companies sourced juice from Calabria, where the oranges were of lower quality, and thus sold for concentrates rather than as whole fruits. With the arrival of subsidies from the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy in the 1980s, the \u2019Ndrangheta saw another source of income. It took over the titular ownership of what are called \u201cproducers\u2019 organisations\u201d (farmers\u2019 cooperatives) and invoiced the EU billions of lire for \u201cpaper oranges\u201d (fruit that existed only on documents).</p> <p>\u201cThey were weighing the same lorry two, four, six times\u201d, says Don Pino de Masi, an anti-mafia priest in Rosarno, meaning that they were receiving far more subsidies than they were entitled to. It is estimated as much as \u20ac75m was embezzled in this way in 2007 alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5756de65ea8c832729ae5eca219fe5d0ed363489\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5756de65ea8c832729ae5eca219fe5d0ed363489/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An orange processing factory in southern Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An orange processing factory in southern Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Di Lauro/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It meant Calabrian farmers were extremely vulnerable to international competition when Brazil and other countries began undercutting the Calabrian juicers. As the mafia cut corners, always looking for maximum returns, the laborious tasks that the EU subsidies were intended to finance \u2013 protecting or improving production through pruning, replanting, fencing, scientific research and infrastructure \u2013 simply hadn\u2019t been carried out.</p> <p>Throughout the 1980s and 90s, the Italian mafia bought land. Cash-rich from drug trafficking, and from embezzling public funds for construction, the mafia saw the land grab as an easy way to launder profits. When garbage-disposal contracts were privatised, land offered an opportunity to dump refuse, including toxic waste. The building in San Calogero (near Rosarno) where the young Malian, Soumaila Sacko, was shot dead last summer had been used to dump 127 tonnes of industrial by-products.</p> <p>But the mafia\u2019s purchase of agricultural land received a new impetus when, in 2008, the EU\u2019s subsidy system was changed: there was now a fixed sum of \u20ac1,500 per year per hectare, regardless of production. It was a further incentive to buy land, with the result that many of the orange groves of Calabria are now controlled by some of most powerful families in the Italian underworld: the Pesce, Piromalli and Mancuso clans.</p> <p>\u201cThe mafia now governs the agro-industry,\u201d Leonardo Palmisano, the anti-mafia author, told us. \u201cYou only need to look at the properties confiscated from the mafia. In recent years, they are almost all in the agricultural sector. And organised crime doesn\u2019t just control agricultural production, but also transport, commercialisation and the fruit markets.\u201d</p> <p>Recent investigations have supported Palmisano\u2019s assertion: in one, codenamed \u201cAll Clean\u201d, magistrates discovered that almost every aspect of the supply chain for oranges was dominated by the \u2019Ndrangheta: cooperatives for the harvest and sales of oranges, five different transport firms, a company involved in plastic packaging and another in cardboard packaging. In one wiretapped conversation, a member of the notorious Pesce family even boasted that he himself had created the transportation network for the Cedi Sisa supermarket in Calabria.</p> <p>Many of the huge fruit-and-vegetable markets throughout Italy have also become bases for criminal organisations. With the constant coming-and-going of lorries, those permanent markets offer a good cover for drug-running: an investigation in 2007 revealed that the Morabito clan from Africo, just south of Rosarno, had taken control of the Milanese fruit-and-vegetable market, fixing prices and dealing cocaine from inside the market\u2019s administrative offices (207kg were confiscated in one raid alone).</p> <p>The situation was the same 10 years later: in an investigation called <em>Provvidenza</em>, the Piromalli clan was revealed to have wrested control of the Milan fruit-and-vegetable market from the Morabitos. The same clan was also alleged to have influence over an agricultural cooperative, Copam, near Rosarno, which had, between 2012 and 2016, received \u20ac2.6m from the EU.</p> <p>Italy\u2019s Agromafia Observatory, an organisation that analyses criminal incursions into the food chain, estimates that the value of food-related business to organised crime has risen 12.4% in the last year, making it now worth \u20ac24.5bn. The Observatory suggests that agriculture now makes up 15% of the mafias\u2019 total income. In the period from 1 January 2017 to 30 June 2018, the Guardia di Finanza confiscated 800 tonnes of tomato concentrate that were believed to be the product of criminal activity.</p> <p>Large sections of Italian agriculture are untainted by organised crime, but the mafia has contaminated parts of the food supply chain in a way that makes it difficult to isolate. <strong> </strong></p> <p>\u201cYou have to understand\u201d, says Don Pino De Masi, the anti-mafia priest, \u201cthat in Calabria, the black economy is bigger than the real one. There are no workers\u2019 rights. You take on who you can pay the least and the gangmaster oils this \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 mechanism. Above the immigrant gangmaster is the Calabrian one, the expression of the will of those who command here.\u201d</p> <p>What happens to brave farmers who try and escape that \u201ccommand\u201d is telling. The GOEL Association unites 27 farms in Calabria, as well as many businesses and cooperatives that refuse all contact with the \u2019Ndrangheta. Its president, Vincenzo Linarello, says he is trying to persuade farmers that they can get richer by fighting the mafia: \u201cWe pay 40 cents per kilo of oranges to our farmers. That\u2019s almost six times what others receive,\u201d he says. But the consequence of taking a stand is that his farmers are constantly suffering vandalism and arson, while sheep and goats have been repeatedly released on to their crops.</p> <p>\u201cWe have continuous thefts, bombings and damage,\u201d says Linarello. \u201cThey never hurt people, only objects. But you are brought to a point of absolute exasperation, such that eventually a farmer [without a supporting association] seeks them out to understand why they are being attacked. The farmer almost has a perverse sense of gratitude to the person [who can stop the attacks].\u201d From then on, says Linarello, all the farm\u2019s contracts \u2013 for employment, transportation, sales and so on \u2013 will slowly come under the control of organised crime.</p> <p>Last summer, at the height of Italy\u2019s tomato-picking season, there was a robbery at a biodynamic farm in Molise, just north of Puglia. The manager, Paola Santi, employed a number of migrants, and made sure they were paid a fair wage and worked in a healthy environment. Eager to share this good practice, she made a video and uploaded it to the business\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cWe just wanted to set a good example,\u201d she told us, \u201cto show that some of our workers had been with us for 10 years.\u201d Within three days, the company\u2019s four tractors \u2013 worth \u20ac250,000 \u2013 had been stolen.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Every year, before the harvest is in, certain supermarkets invite a supply price for their fresh produce. Because the order, for the winning bidder, will be very large, producers compete to outdo each other with the lowest price. This is the supermarkets\u2019 \u201cdouble-down\u201d auction, infamous for reducing prices on all produce. After opening offers are called in, the lowest bid from that first round is then used as the starting point for this second round, hence \u201cdouble down\u201d.</p> <p>In April 2014, an auction for tomatoes was in progress. In Naples, a manufacturer of tomato products called Francesco Franzese stared at his computer screen in consternation as the price dropped. He was managing director of La Fiammante, a company based on the slopes of Vesuvius, which sold tinned tomatoes, passata and pur\u00e9e. What he saw shocked him. The tomato-growing season hadn\u2019t even begun, but a supermarket chain was inviting a supply price for 20m tins of tomatoes. Franzese was logged on to the online portal, and every time a rival company lowered their price, a two-minute timer started.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like a game,\u201d he told us, \u201cand you had to keep going lower to stay in it. It was the only auction that I had seen going downwards. You didn\u2019t even know if the other bids were real, or just a way to force down the price.\u201d</p> <p>Franzese knew the figures didn\u2019t add up. The prices rival companies were offering to sell for had to be, he calculated, below their costs. \u201cTo produce a tin of tomatoes,\u201d he told us, \u201ccertain expenses are out of your control: the price of tin, energy and water costs and so on. The only place you can squeeze savings are in labour costs. The only place.\u201d He decided not to participate in the auction. \u201cIn accepting these industrial prices,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re actually selling the skin of the farm-workers.\u201d</p> <p>Franzese\u2019s refusal to play the game, however, was an isolated protest. Given the parlous state of the Italian economy in recent years, the double-down auction has, since 2014, become more common. Discount supermarkets \u2013 the main perpetrators \u2013 now account for almost 20% of the Italian market, and in Germany (a major consumer of Italian produce) the figure is at 40%. Between 2014 and 2017, while the Italian economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/31/italy-slips-into-recession-for-third-time-in-a-decade-economy\" title=\"\">has been stagnant</a>, the major discount supermarkets have grown.</p> <p>Activist Fabio Ciconte and journalist Stefano Liberti have been campaigning for a decade for a fairer food industry, and recently published a book: Big Trolley: Who Decides What We Eat? \u201cThe supermarkets,\u201d they wrote, \u201chave created a war between the poor: on the one side the farmers, who are struggling to survive, and on the other consumers, who want to spend less and less.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a3400a3f40e4607a1f72370e5f1a79eaf22c2139\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3400a3f40e4607a1f72370e5f1a79eaf22c2139/0_0_3470_2313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A trade union demonstration against the exploitation of migrant labourers in Italy, June 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A trade union demonstration against the exploitation of migrant labourers in Italy, June 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The result is that tomatoes, oranges and other agricultural produce are now sold with no relation to how much they cost from the ground up, but solely how little the super-powerful supermarkets are prepared to pay from the top down. Many supermarkets also charge a \u201clisting fee\u201d for the privilege of being on their shelves. In their book, Ghetto Italia, Yvan Sagnet and Leonardo Palmisano describe it as a race to the bottom. \u201cThe link between the cost of work and the price of the product has broken,\u201d they wrote.</p> <p>Prices paid to tomato-processing companies, which turn the raw fruit into tins of tomatoes, concentrates, sauces and ketchups, are constantly forced down. Those processors, in turn, readjust the prices they pay to farmers, in order to maintain their profit margin. A recent \u201cfair price\u201d campaign (launched last December by the environmental charity Legambiente, and the ethical Italian supermarket NaturaS\u00ec) highlighted just how low prices have fallen: farmers now receive an eye-wateringly low 7.5 cents for a kilo of tomatoes. The per-kilo price for oranges hovers around the 7 cents mark (there are regional and seasonal variations).</p> <p>In that context, it is hardly surprising if corners are cut. Farmers use gangmasters to provide the cheapest, most vulnerable labour, and don\u2019t ask questions about the workers\u2019 conditions. \u201cThe farmers make up for [diminishing margins]\u201d, Sagnet and Palmisano wrote, \u201cthrough the gangmasters \u2026 everyone makes money on the ones below, except for the very last in the chain, the labourers.\u201d</p> <p>Such purchasing practices are irresponsible, says Cindy Berman, head of the London-based Ethical Trading Initiative\u2019s modern slavery strategy. While she noted this is common across all industries globally, ETI\u2019s position on the matter is clear: \u201cIt is a practice we abhor, and we discourage. Responsible companies shouldn\u2019t be doing it.\u201d</p> <p>The power of supermarkets is exacerbated in Italy by the producers\u2019 relative weakness. In the Italian south, the average size of a farm is seven hectares. There is often little consolidation or cooperation between them, and they remain powerless compared with the national supermarket chains. There is also an almost total absence of employment agencies for the agricultural sector in Calabria and Puglia, to act as alternatives to gangmasters. \u201cThere\u2019s a complete lack of organisation,\u201d says Stefano Liberti. \u201cIf you need labourers quickly, there\u2019s no efficient way to find them. That\u2019s the intermediary role that <em>caporali</em> [gangmasters] provide.\u201d</p> <p>The price pressure is even more acute on tomatoes than on other products, because they are often used by supermarkets, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/06/dairy-farmers-call-for-supermarkets-boycott-as-milk-price-falls\" title=\"\">milk in the UK</a>, as what they call \u201c<em>un prodotto civetta</em>\u201d, a \u201closs leader\u201d. Tomatoes are so fundamental to Italian cuisine that shops sell them at a loss, knowing the customer will purchase other products while shopping and make up the difference.</p> <p>But the downward squeeze on prices is only part of the story of the supply chain, because it\u2019s also apparent that someone, somewhere, is making huge profits. Although farmers were paid 7.5 cents per kg for their tomatoes last year, the consumer was charged, roughly, \u20ac2 per kg for them. That represents a price increase of 2,567%.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Given that supermarkets are sourcing their oranges and tomatoes from crime-ridden areas of southern Italy, one might expect them to be circumspect about their suppliers. But they lack the instruments, or willingness, to probe deeply into where their products are sourced. Both UK and Italian supermarkets defend themselves by the blanket use of Certification Bodies (CBs): these are companies paid by supermarket suppliers to provide an ethical audit of their businesses, thereby offering assurance that their goods meet environmental or humanitarian standards.</p> <p>But CBs perform an arm\u2019s-length box-ticking exercise, and rarely visit the farms. Besides, many farms are so remote that it is hard to launch a raid or surprise inspection. We spoke to one volunteer medic, working in the fields in Sicily, who says that to avoid any surprises, big farms have lookouts on mopeds at the ends of very long tracks. Some inspectors can be paid off, and those who do their job with integrity have been threatened with violence.</p> <p>Global Gap (an inspectorate for good agricultural practice founded in 1997 by retailers) is an organisation that has patented one methodology for such audits. But under the Global Gap method, only the square root of the total number of farms used by a processing plant is inspected (ie if there are 100 farms supplying a plant, only 10 will be inspected). There\u2019s no element of surprise \u2013 the general regulations of Global Gap state that \u201cThe following is true for unannounced inspections: the CB may inform the producer in advance of the intended visit.\u201d</p> <p>Almost all CBs attract business by boasting that they provide \u201creputational preservation\u201d or \u201crisk awareness\u201d. They exist primarily to shore up a good name rather than root out and reveal bad practice. There is a conflict of interest, since the cost of certification is met not by the supermarkets, but by the clients \u2013 an agricultural producer or processor. \u201cWhen the person being inspected is the same person paying the inspector\u2019s fee, 99.9% of the time the inspector will say: \u2018No, you\u2019re not exploiting anyone\u2019,\u201d said Aboubakar Soumahoro, of the USB grassroots union. It is, he says, a racket: \u201cThe story just doesn\u2019t stand up.\u201d One major CB told us, off the record:<strong> </strong>\u201cWe audit remotely. We rely on the documentation our customers supply.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement of inspections provides ample room for suppliers to cheat the system. \u201cAudits are often announced in advance, which allows employers to deceive auditors [by making sure] exploited workers are not present on the day of the audit,\u201d says chair of the Yale university working group on slavery, Genevieve LeBaron.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9d003471fc35e299a7cc56a28fb4b64f2bf6f1d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d003471fc35e299a7cc56a28fb4b64f2bf6f1d8/0_290_6272_3763/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Various vegetables on shelves grocery store\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Farmers of the Italian deep south who are trying to do things differently and put some kind of reform in place are scathing about the inspection process. Vincenzo Linarello,<strong> </strong>from GOEL, calls CBs \u201cthe original sin\u201d of the modern slavery system. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not true that supermarkets are sourcing from farms that don\u2019t exploit labourers,\u201d he says. \u201cHow do they check? They make their suppliers sign contracts in which they simply self-certify.\u201d Lucio Cavazzoni, the president of Good-Land, a company campaigning for rural and community regeneration, says that certifications \u201care trustworthy on paper, but absolutely unreliable for [knowledge of] the fields\u201d.</p> <p>Even some of the most powerful voices in the food industry express doubt that the certification process does anything to protect against gangmasters. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t swear by it,\u201d Francesco Mutti, the CEO of one of Italy\u2019s biggest and oldest tomato-processing firms, told us. Mario Gasbarrino, CEO of the Unes supermarket chain, who disdains aggressive discounting practices, is equally blunt: \u201cI put little faith in certifications.\u201d</p> <p>The absurdity of the certification process was revealed in 2015, when a 47-year-old Sudanese immigrant, Abdullah Muhammed, was working on a tomato farm in Nard\u00f2 in Puglia. Labouring without breaks, and with limited water, he suffered a heart attack and died. No medical assistance was available. It was his first day of work; he had arrived from Sicily the day before.</p> <p>The farm was owned by Giuseppe Mariano, who had previously been caught up in an investigation into <em>caporalato</em>, and who had been using a Sudanese gangmaster. Using drones and wiretaps, an investigating magistrate, Paola Guglielmi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/24/the-terrible-truth-about-your-tin-of-italian-tomatoes\" title=\"\">discovered</a> that the farm was supplying processing plants owned by two of the biggest names in the Italian tomato industry, Mutti and Cirio.</p> <p>The arrest warrant issued by Guglielmi for the farmer and his gangmaster spoke of \u201cconditions of absolute exploitation\u201d on the farm. (Thanks to the glacial pace of Italian justice, the case against the farmer and his gangmaster is yet to reach court.) The farm supposedly had anti-slavery certification, Guglielmi told us, with a humourless laugh. \u201cBut they never really checked.\u201d</p> <p>Princes (the food conglomerate owned by Mitsubishi, and maker of Napolina brand tomatoes) has been sourcing tomatoes from the Nard\u00f2 farm, now under new ownership, since 2016. A spokesman said they are confident the new management is proactive in improving conditions. When questioned by food campaigners Liberti and Ciconte, Princes said that its \u201cown audits\u201d and \u201cdue diligence \u2026 did not reveal any evidence of illegality\u201d. Mutti was so aghast at the damage to its reputation that it decided, in future, to purchase only mechanically harvested tomatoes in the south. (Mechanisation reduces the working crews to four or five people, bar the driver.)</p> <p>Cirio, which is owned by Conserve Italia, told the Guardian: \u201c[We] would like to assure all \u2026 consumers that it will continue to process tomatoes supplied by its 14,000 cooperators through the collaboration of its 3,000 employees in complete respect of ethical principles and environmental sustainability.\u201d</p> <p>The other problem of the supply chain is its astonishing secrecy. Of the 15 CBs we contacted, only two replied to our questions. The addresses of agricultural cooperatives supplying international brands are often nondescript suburban offices, and, when you visit, they refuse to divulge which farms they work with.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in this business for 40 years, and I\u2019ve never understood why the fruit-and-vegetable supply chain [in Italy] is so long,\u201d says Gasbarrino. \u201cThere\u2019s something nebulous there.\u201d</p> <p>If the traceability is tricky on produce that is tinned or boxed, it\u2019s even harder, of course, on loose fruit. If you attempt to trace where Calabrian oranges, picked by enslaved labourers, end up, everyone goes silent. The processing plant in Rosarno owned by Gaetano Rao, a businessman and politician, doesn\u2019t reply. San Benedetto, an Italian orangeade producer, says it is too busy to comment. Only Fanta, which is owned by Coca-Cola, offers a complete list of all its suppliers and transporters. Since 2012, Fanta has stopped sourcing its oranges in Calabria.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking lectures in morality from Coca-Cola,\u201d says one Calabrian activist.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The continued use of slave labour in Italian agriculture has been made possible by a combination of factors: a migrant crisis in which hundreds of thousands of people with minimal rights have arrived in areas dominated by organised crime, just as the country\u2019s economy is flatlining and discount supermarkets are using all means possible to push down prices.</p> <p>But small victories have been won. The window of time to harvest most produce is narrow, so strategic industrial action can threaten the entire crop. In the last decade, strikes have sometimes brought results.</p> <p>In 2011, Yvan Sagnet, who came to Italy from Cameroon on a scholarship to study engineering four years earlier, was at university in Turin when his scholarship was suspended. To get by, he went to pick tomatoes in Nard\u00f2 with other African migrants. A sudden change in working conditions (the men were told they could no longer shake tomatoes off the vine, but had to pick them off by hand) infuriated the labourers, who downed tools. Sagnet, in his mid-20s, was chosen as strike leader.</p> <p>Despite violent threats (\u201cStop this strike or else consider yourself dead,\u201d one gangmaster told him), he denounced the gangmasters to police. \u201cWe showed the whole of Italy what was really going on,\u201d Sagnet told us.</p> <p>He has now set up his own business making tomato produce under the NoCap label, which he is hoping will raise consumer consciousness. (It follows the model of the successful Libera label, displayed by Italian producers who have refused to pay protection money to the mafia.) It\u2019s one of a number of products that are militantly anti-gangmaster.</p> <p>A recent survey suggested that 11% of Italian adults are so concerned about the provenance of food products that they now use an alternative form of shopping. There are <em>gruppi d\u2019acquisto solidale</em> (\u201csupportive purchasing groups\u201d), and all sorts of other buying options: <em>altromercato</em> (\u201canother market\u201d), <em>fuori mercato </em>(\u201coutside the market\u201d), <em>sfrutta zero</em> (\u201czero exploitation\u201d) and Funky Tomato. These demonstrate that consumers can influence the conditions for agricultural workers. \u201cIf there are corporals [gangmasters]\u201d, says Cavazzoni, \u201cthere are also generals, and the generals aren\u2019t only the supermarkets, but their customers.\u201d</p> <p>One of the few uplifting aspects of this dark story is that it may be immigrant labourers themselves who end this 21st-century slavery by standing up for their rights. Repeatedly in recent years, those with nothing to lose have revolted against gangmasters and the mafia. In December 2008, when an Ivorian in Rosarno was robbed of his entire savings and two more men were later shot, the labourers did something very rare for Rosarno: they organised a protest and denounced the criminals to the police.</p> <p>In January 2010, after a Togolese man was shot in Rosarno, the immigrant labourers rebelled. Cars were burned and shop windows smashed in the so-called \u201crevolt of Rosarno\u201d before a savage counter-revolt was organised by the mafia and neo-fascist organisations. Four people were badly injured and the labourers\u2019 temporary quarters were razed to the ground. The story was made into a brilliant, if harrowing film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/21/mediterranea-review-jonas-carpignano-cannes-critics-week-sidebar\" title=\"\">Mediterranea</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/feb/01/migrants-more-profitable-than-drugs-how-mafia-infiltrated-italy-asylum-system\">\u2018Migrants are more profitable than drugs\u2019: how the mafia infiltrated Italy\u2019s asylum system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was Sagnet\u2019s protest that, in part, led to the creation of an anti-gangmaster law in 2016, with custodial sentences of one to six years (or five to eight years if accompanied by violence and threats) for those exploiting vulnerable labourers. A total of 561 people were arrested under the gangmaster legislation in the 18 months since the beginning of 2017, showing not only how widespread the problem is, but also the fact that Italian law enforcement is beginning to take the problem seriously.</p> <p>Italian justice, however, isn\u2019t only excruciatingly slow; it\u2019s also rarely punitive. In April this year, the court of appeal cleared 11 of the 13 accused of \u201creducing their workers to a state of slavery\u201d.

In May\u2019s EU elections, Matteo Salvini gained 34.3% of the vote, thanks largely to his incessant anti-immigrant rhetoric.</p> <p>Central to his message is the branding of modern slaves as criminals \u2013 saying nothing about slavery itself.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 June 2019 to add a comment from a spokesman for Princes.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "On 6 August last year, 14 immigrant farmhands in Foggia, on the ankle of the Italian boot, were coming home from a 12-hour shift picking tomatoes in 40C heat. The minibus carrying them was registered in Bulgaria; the driver didn\u2019t have a licence or insurance. The seats inside were wooden planks, and it was so crowded that passengers couldn\u2019t even see out. The vehicle was travelling at speed when it collided head-on with a truck loaded with tomatoes. After the crash, you could see contorted limbs through the smashed windows. The entire front third of the vehicle was concertinaed and the roof was ripped open. Bags and clothing spilled out on to the road, and there were large patches of blood on the asphalt. Twelve of the 14 labourers died. Only two days before, also in Foggia, four labourers had died in a similar accident: 16 dead in 48 hours. In the Italian south, the lives of foreign agricultural labourers are so cheap that many NGOs have described their conditions as a modern form of slavery. They live in isolated rural ruins or shanty towns. Some have Italian residency permits, but many don\u2019t. A few have work contracts, although union organisers often find they are fake. Desperate for work, these labourers will accept any job in the fields even if the wages are far below, and the hours far above, union standards. The produce they pick regularly ends up on the shelves of Italian, and international, supermarkets, bought by consumers who have no idea of the suffering involved. Although some of the workers are eastern Europeans, most of those picking crops in the Italian fields come from Africa, mainly \u2013 at the moment \u2013 from Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria, Sudan and Somalia. The number of arrivals has been growing exponentially in recent years: the number of boat people landing in Italy peaked at 181,436 in 2016. The largest migrant reception centres are almost all in the south \u2013 in Sicily and Calabria \u2013 where mafia organisations exert greatest control and where agriculture requires a constant supply of labour. That supply is organised by gangmasters: agents who recruit seasonal workers and who are tasked with squeezing extra work out of them at the lowest possible cost. \u201cThere are a few factors on which modern slavery thrives,\u201d says Jakub Sobik, of the British NGO Anti-Slavery International: \u201cVulnerability, discrimination and a lack of the rule of law.\u201d In Italian agriculture, all of these conditions are present. There is no question that the migrant workers are vulnerable to exploitation, but Yvan Sagnet, a Cameroonian anti-slavery activist who once worked picking tomatoes in Puglia, explains that the vulnerability is mental as much as physical. \u201cWhen you have been enslaved,\u201d Sagnet says, \u201cit\u2019s such a strong thing that your head begins to reason differently. It\u2019s not the slavery of hundreds of years ago, when you were deprived of your liberty. Slavery in the 21st century doesn\u2019t need chains, because they exploit a continual sense of intimidation that the most vulnerable people, like immigrants, feel.\u201d Discrimination and violence against African workers gets worse in Italy with every passing day. In 2018, there were 126 racially motivated attacks recorded in the country, some fatal: in May last year a neo-fascist shot and wounded six black people in Macerata, near the central city of Ancona. A Cameroonian was shot in the city of Aprilia, an hour\u2019s drive from Rome. A few weeks before, in July, a Moroccan man was beaten to death there. The problem is so severe that the Italian intelligence agency warned earlier this year about the rise in far-right groups and \u201ca real risk of an increase in episodes of intolerance towards foreigners\u201d. But it\u2019s the absence of the rule of law \u2013 Sobik\u2019s third prerequisite for modern slavery \u2013 that is most evident in Italian agriculture. Labourers without papers are considered outside the law, so they can expect no protection. \u201cYou know that what you\u2019re suffering isn\u2019t right,\u201d says Sagnet, \u201cbut you can\u2019t denounce it because they\u2019ll report you as an illegal immigrant.\u201d In the Italian deep south, where the mafia runs a parallel system of local rule with its own violent enforcement, the law holds little sway. Workplace inspectors are \u201cvery few and very corrupt\u201d, according to Rocco Borgese, secretary of the FLAI-CGIL union (which represents agricultural workers) in Gioia Tauro, Calabria. In 2018, Global Slavery Index, an organisation providing a country-by-country ranking of the number of people currently enslaved, estimated there are 50,000 enslaved agricultural workers in Italy (the Index claims a total of 145,000 people are enslaved in the country as a whole, forced into prostitution and domestic services). The UN\u2019s special rapporteur on slavery said last autumn that 400,000 agricultural workers in Italy are at risk of being exploited and almost 100,000 are forced to live in inhumane conditions. \u201cThere\u2019s a form of exploitation which, in some ways, exceeds what happened in the past, when slave-owners at least cared about the health of their slaves because they needed them,\u201d said an Italian-Ivorian trade-unionist and campaigner, Aboubakar Soumahoro. \u201cToday, there\u2019s not even that care.\u201d Rather than denying the situation, the country\u2019s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has repeatedly said immigrants are the \u201cnew slaves\u201d. The observation isn\u2019t sympathetic but strategic: publicising their destitution is a calculated attempt to dissuade more from coming to Italy. It serves his political purpose to perpetuate their ghettoisation, and also shores up the far-right narrative that immigrants can never integrate. Salvini and his allies have turned logic on its head. For them, the victims aren\u2019t the people who have been enslaved, but the Italian people. In their view, the criminals aren\u2019t gangmasters who exploit the workers, but immigrants (\u201cevery day in Italy\u201d, Salvini has tweeted, \u201cimmigrants commit 700 crimes\u201d). One of his most familiar slogans is \u201cla pacchia \u00e8 finita\u201d (\u201cthe free ride is over\u201d) \u2013 echoing the popular myth that refugees and pro-immigration leftists have somehow got rich at the expense of ordinary Italians. When you speak to rightwing politicians in Italy, almost all reiterate the conspiracy theory that mass immigration has been financed by dark forces. It is true, however, that some people are making money off the backs of the displaced and desperate. Italy\u2019s agricultural sector is booming, with food products making up 8.7% of Italy\u2019s flagging GDP. The tomato industry alone is worth \u00a32.8bn. Mass immigration is chaotic and uncontrolled, but the exploitation of immigrant workers is systematic. \u201cThe criminal economy is far better organised than the ordinary one,\u201d says Leonardo Palmisano, sociologist and author of Mafia Caporale (\u201cGangmaster Mafia\u201d), a study of the illegal exploitation of workers in Italy. Supermarkets and their suppliers cite their use of certifications that are intended to reassure consumers that the goods we buy are produced under legal labour practices. But as these stories demonstrate, such figleaves are totally unreliable, and simply make the consumer unwittingly complicit: those purchasing Italian produce are unaware that their healthy Mediterranean diet is, sometimes, the fruit of 21st-century slavery. * * * Rosarno, in Calabria, on the toe of the Italian boot, is an ugly town full of unfinished buildings and uncollected rubbish. It is notorious as a stronghold of the \u2019Ndrangheta, the Calabrian mafia, whose principal sources of income are drug trafficking, protection rackets, construction and agriculture. Nothing moves here, it\u2019s said, without their assent. Thousands of immigrants head here every winter to work on the orange harvest, and end up staying in shanty towns three miles west of Rosarno. This cluster of temporary shelters, near a town called San Ferdinando, has grown up on the far side of the dual carriageway, the railway, and an industrial estate. Close by are the red-and-white cranes of Gioia Tauro port, the entry point for much of the cocaine sold in Europe. As you approach, you see dozens of young black men riding old bikes, plastic bags dangling from their handlebars. All the bushes for miles around have been coppiced by labourers for twigs and sticks to build their shacks. There are three shanty towns in San Ferdinando. Testa dell\u2019Acqua is a horseshoe of 20 leaking mobile homes. The white walls have turned black with mould. Old freezers have been refashioned into chicken houses and TV aerials are tied to long branches. There\u2019s even a small cultivation of maize. Nearby, 700 more people live in 54 blue tents (more than a dozen per tent) supplied by the Italian Ministry of the Interior, which were put up in August 2017. The main shanty town has the mud and improvised paths of a very edgy music festival. Stray dogs, cats and rodents pick through piles of rubbish. Police cars prowl outside day and night. You can still see the shack that was left uncompleted by a 29-year-old Malian, Soumaila Sacko, who was killed while he was in the process of constructing it: he had arranged 15 vertical sticks, five by three. About a quarter of the roof of sheet metal had been hammered in place. He was shot dead last summer by an Italian while he was trying to find some more metal in a nearby abandoned warehouse. The encampment, though, is strangely vibrant. There\u2019s music and laughter. You feel as if you could find anything here: there\u2019s a bar, a hairdresser, an ironmonger, a butcher, a bike-repair guy, a mosque and a church. There\u2019s even a football team, called Qui Bosco (\u201cHere\u2019s the Wood\u201d). The resourcefulness is evident: old inner-tubes have been knotted to tie down a tarp, an old shelf has become a bridge over a ditch of plastic bottles, a metal bed base is used as a screen door. This area is of Calabria is known for its orange groves, and in late autumn, as the fruit turns, like traffic lights, from green to amber, young men turn up carrying all their worldly goods, and negotiate with someone to buy an old, damp mattress (\u20ac5) and rent a patch in a shack on which to sling it (often \u20ac30 a month). Nothing is dry. Here, the nationalities are mostly Nigerian, Gambian, Ghanaian, Sudanese, Somali and Burkinab\u00e9. About 5% are women. There is one tap, but the water isn\u2019t drinkable. Toilets are nothing more than holes in the ground. There are a few generators and various gas bottles for cooking. Nobody knows how many people live in these conditions around San Ferdinando, but at the height of the season, there are probably 2,000 people. A charity offering medical support in these shanty towns, MEDU, says 21% of those it sees have intestinal ailments, 17% respiratory problems, and 22% osteoarticular pains. Many have mental health problems, and the horrors they have suffered on their journey here have left them with PTSD. As we walk round, a young Nigerian woman called Honour shouts: \u201cYou must help us.\u201d She shows the rashes up her arms; she doesn\u2019t know if the skin irritation is due to constant contact with pesticides in the fields, or mosquitoes and horseflies. One of the many microbusinesses here is a trade in painkillers, especially ketoprofen. Sometimes they have to cycle for one or two hours to get to work, and most people are so exhausted that all they do when not working is sleep. Life expectancy in slums such as this is very low. Jacob, a Ghanaian who keeps chickens in the disused freezers, shows us where Nigerian migrant worker Becky Moses used to live before she died in a fire in 2018. Fire is a constant danger: it is the only way to keep warm, and people will burn anything: old car seats, tyres, cardboard. Three others have died in fires on this site alone in the last six months. * * * There are dozens of slums like San Ferdinando across southern Italy, swelling and contracting according to the season. Often, the labourers are driven from one remote shanty town to another by gangmasters. After a winter in Calabria picking oranges and kiwis, they go north in the spring to Campania to pick strawberries, melons and shallots. In summer, they cross to Puglia, the heel of Italy, to pick tomatoes and peppers, before moving to the Veneto or Piemonte to pick grapes in early autumn. There are variants: some will go to Cassibile, in the south-east corner of Sicily, for the new potatoes, or stay behind in the slums once the workers have moved on to pick through the detritus and try and sell off scrap metal and sodden mattresses. A major draw for tomato-pickers is Borgo Mezzanone, near Foggia. One of the men who died in the carminibus crash last summer had a brother, Sid, who was living in London but came to Italy when he heard the news. Sid shows us around the camp. He says he couldn\u2019t believe his brother had been living in such misery. \u201cIt\u2019s not real,\u201d he says. We enter the camp through a man-sized hole in a fence. \u201cWelcome to Africa,\u201d says Sid ruefully. Smoke is billowing from makeshift homes. Everywhere there are plastic bottles, smashed concrete, planks of wood, torn clothing, old brick phones and empty bottles of whisky and vodka. Abandoned mattresses act as walls and roofs to the shacks, bungied together with the swelling chipboard of kitchen worktops. Someone has painted on a wall in white: \u201cshut up becaus is rule\u201d. Migrants usually arrive in Italy with nothing but debts, after borrowing money from relatives back home to finance their journey to Europe. They usually know nobody when they reach their destination, and have no one to appeal to when in difficulty. Few even reveal to relatives back home the desperate situation in which they find themselves. In an abandoned warehouse, not far from the shanty town of Borgo Mezzanone in Puglia, an immigrant worker called Njobo tells us: \u201cThe Africans that are living here, most of them are living a fake life. They look for beautiful pictures and put them on Instagram. None of us would take a picture from this place and send it back.\u201d He gestured around his makeshift home, revealing the dilapidation of his surroundings, the room dotted with shredded plastic rags and broken glass. These immigrants don\u2019t only have debts to relatives, they are also desperate to obtain residency permits. The so-called Bossi-Fini law of 2002 (named after the two party leaders who drafted it) grants a residency permit only to those who have work contracts, meaning immigrants will put up with exploitation in order to obtain one. Those without residency permits are even more vulnerable. Two of the people who died in fires in the San Ferdinando shanty town had drifted there to hide from authorities because their permits had recently expired. Pay, already low, is even lower for \u201cclandestines\u201d. Many of the labourers we spoke to say gangmasters regularly withhold their identity documents and pay. Even if, in theory, they are free to leave, circumstances force them to stay put. \u201cIf you have worked for a week or for two weeks and they haven\u2019t paid you,\u201d says Sagnet, \u201cand they have your documents, of course you don\u2019t leave.\u201d Many migrants have reported being beaten by employers, who also make sexual demands. Violence, especially against women, is alarmingly common. Beauty, a Nigerian woman in a purple wig who lives in the San Ferdinando shanty town, told us: \u201cYou never feel safe. Even when you sleep, you have one eye open.\u201d Tayo, a 22-year-old Nigerian, was assaulted when she tried to defend a friend. Sexual violence is a constant in these bleak places: in 2015, in Ragusa, Sicily, a labourer living in a shanty town was killed and his wife raped. In 2011, an investigation revealed dozens of Romanian labourers had been forced into prostitution. Inside the camp, there are shops selling everything: iPhone chargers, bracelets, sim cards, bread, crisps, hair extensions, bike pumps and shoes. Vendors are roasting pieces of meat coated in a thick marinade and heckling passers-by. There\u2019s a group of men intently watching a game of draughts. Restaurants in shacks advertise their menus: \u201cThe best taste of The Gambia\u201d. There\u2019s a club lined with discoloured sofas and afrobeat blaring from the stereo. Another restaurant doubles as a brothel. But there is no running water or formal sanitation facilities anywhere. \u201cIf, when I was in Africa, you had told me this is what Europe was like, I would insult you,\u201d Njobo says. \u201cI would never have believed it.\u201d * * * The men and women living in these shanty towns are exploited from the moment they arrive on Italian soil. The sociologist and author Leonardo Palmisano, who investigates agricultural slavery and organised crime, says: \u201cThe mafia in the south controls the reception of immigrants. Centres for asylum-seekers have processed hundreds of thousands of immigrants, and the mafia is often part of the management.\u201d The Italian state pays \u20ac35 per immigrant per day (and \u20ac45 for minors) to reception centres that house them. During the mass migrations of recent years, the government contracted out the housing and feeding of migrants, which became a billion-euro industry. The largest reception centres in Italy are called Caras (centri di accoglienza per richiedenti asilo, or \u201cwelcome centres for asylum-seekers\u201d), each in command of multi-million euro contracts for providing food and other services. One investigation in 2017 into the Cara Sant\u2019Anna (based in an abandoned military airport in Isola di Capo Rizzuto in Calabria) estimated that, over 10 years, the Arena mafia clan had embezzled a third of the \u20ac100m state funding. Tiny portions of out-of-date food were served. The number of residents was exaggerated to increase cashflow. The asylum centre had become, in the words of the investigating magistrate, \u201ca cashpoint for the mafia\u201d. The running of Cara Sant\u2019Anna has now been taken over by the Red Cross. Something similar was happening all over the country. The Roman mafioso, Salvatore Buzzi, whose consortium repeatedly won contracts to arrange housing for migrants, was heard in a 2014 police wiretap boasting: \u201cHave you got any idea how much I earn through immigrants? I make more from immigrants than I do from drugs.\u201d His consortium enjoyed annual revenues of \u20ac55m. The political wind was turning against those refugees even before Matteo Salvini became the Italian interior minister in June 2018. In 2017, 58% of asylum requests were turned down. The appeals process, too, was abolished. Those so-called diniegati \u2013 men and women denied asylum \u2013 invariably preferred to disappear into the nearby agricultural slums than risk deportation. There, the migrants continue to be exploited for profit, through a system called caporalato. This is the practice through which the recruitment and payment of day-labourers is subcontracted to a gangmaster, the caporale. An ancient and sinister figure in Italian history, the caporale was \u2013 throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries \u2013 a proto-mafioso, the enforcer of the landlord\u2019s will. The difference now is that the mafioso himself is likely to be a landowner, and it\u2019s his orders that are being enforced by a usually non-Italian caporale. The practice of caporalato has been illegal since a 2016 law banned intermediaries from exploiting vulnerable agricultural labourers (thanks, largely, to the courageous campaigning of Yvan Sagnet), and yet it is still ubiquitous. At 4am, you see hundreds of labourers cycling on main roads, without lights, to reach the pick-up points for transport to the fields. There, at crossroads and in lay-bys, the black labourers wait for a caporale and his minibus. No one knows if there will be work. \u201cWork yes, work no,\u201d says one phlegmatic man, moving his hands as if he were juggling invisible balls. The only certainty is that anyone who has agitated for fair pay or better conditions will be automatically excluded. Costs vary, but in general the labourers have to pay around \u20ac3 for transportation to and from the fields. The vehicles usually carry double the legal limit of passengers, with men and women sitting on top of each other. The fields are so remote that, once there, the workers are obliged to buy sandwiches and water for \u20ac3-4. It costs 50 cents to charge a phone or, if anyone falls ill or has an accident, \u20ac20 to be taken to hospital. Although piecework in agriculture is illegal, that is how all labourers are paid: the going rate is \u20ac3.50 to fill a chest with 300kg of tomatoes, or \u20ac5.50 if they are cherry tomatoes; workers receive \u20ac1 for a huge case of tangerines or 50 cents for one of oranges. The going rate for 100kg of grapes is \u20ac13. Even if you work at top speed, it is hard to make much more than \u20ac30 a day, and that\u2019s before all those deductions. Contracts are essentially worthless: local unionists try to intervene, checking online to see if the correct social security payments have been made on behalf of workers. They very rarely have. Union representative Rocco Borgese shakes his head glumly: \u201cWe have lost our humanity,\u201d he says. Because the Bossi-Fini law ties residency to the possession of a work contract, many purchase a contract for hundreds of euros. Other times, the contract is issued in the name, not of the immigrant, but of a local man or woman who doesn\u2019t work and has probably never been to the fields. This guarantees the local person agricultural unemployment benefit if, on paper, it looks as if they have worked for more than 53 days in the year. In 2015, 3,000 of these \u201cfalse labourers\u201d were discovered in Calabria. For the labourers dropped off at dawn in the fields, the work is relentless. In December 2018, we went out with five Africans cutting broccoli. They were wearing ill-fitting gloves and cracked wellington boots. Their clothing was frayed and encrusted with dry mud. They were each given a small knife. A green John Deere tractor crawled forward, and the five men crouched down, cutting the thick stems and chucking the broccoli heads in a crate behind the tractor. The stems, in the winter dawn, were covered in icy shards, and their knives often broke against them. By the end of the day, broken blades lay in a small pile just inside the tractor. With inadequate footwear, it was easy to slice your foot open. It was so cold we could see steam rising off the mens\u2019 bent backs. In the space of seven hours, these five men managed to fill 110 crates of broccoli. They were owed around \u20ac30, but nobody knew when they would be paid. When they are, they have nowhere to store their wages, so they carry cash \u2013 sometimes a month or two\u2019s savings \u2013 at all times. This makes them targets for muggers and vulnerable to violent attacks. After a long shift, the men were driven back to an abandoned farmhouse. Eleven people shared the two-bedroom ruin. There were no windows, running water or electricity. They each paid a rent of \u20ac20 euros per month. The only heat came from burning scrap wood. Many don\u2019t survive these punishing conditions. In the summer of 2015 alone, 15 labourers died, including Paola Clemente, in the fields of Andria in Apulia, and Abdullah Muhammed, a 47-year-old Sudanese, in Nard\u00f2, further south in Puglia. In October 2017, a Ghanaian man, Daniel Mensah, died of hypothermia. In an article in the British Medical Journal in March, doctors representing another Italian medical charity, Doctors With Africa, wrote: \u201cOver the past six years the number of agricultural workers who have died as a result of their work is more than 1,500.\u201d * * * On 2 October last year, a Calabrian mayor, Mimmo Lucano, was arrested. He stood accused of abetting illegal immigration and public-contract crimes, allegedly arranging a sham marriage for a Nigerian woman and improperly awarding refuse collection contracts to a local cooperative. For years, Lucano had been the mayor of Riace, a hilltop town 20km east of Rosarno. The town first became famous in 1972 when a snorkeller discovered the so-called Riace bronzes, a pair of stunning statues of bearded, naked Greek warriors dating from 450BC. Now, though, Riace is renowned throughout Italy as one of the only places to have attempted true, revolutionary integration of migrants. The town, which was underpopulated, welcomed migrants and opened schools and businesses to them. Lucano\u2019s arrest represented a crackdown on anyone offering an alternative to the deliberate marginalisation of migrant workers. (The investigation which led to his arrest was ironically code-named \u201cXenia\u201d, the ancient Greek word for hospitality.) \u201cHe\u2019s a nothing,\u201d Matteo Salvini said of Lucano after his arrest. When we wandered around the streets of Riace last autumn, it was hard to imagine a sharper contrast to the agricultural slums. There were black toddlers singing in English from a balcony (\u201crain, rain, go away \u2026 \u201d). A veiled woman laughed with an elderly Italian man on a street corner. Bottles of water were left on park benches in case anyone was in need. The recycling bins were tidy wooden rectangles. Since the steep streets are too narrow for trucks, the binmen in recent years have been immigrants using donkeys. The place felt like a pre-industrial Italian village with an international twist: there were small workshops \u2013 a ceramicist, a seamstress and so on \u2013 but those artisans were from Afghanistan, from Kabul and Herat. The whole village (there are fewer than 2,000 inhabitants) was colourful: the steps of a modern amphitheatre were rainbowed, and around every corner were murals of peasant workers. There were plenty of political messages too: the slogan \u201cWe raise our hands against the \u2019Ndrangheta\u201d, painted on a wall, was surrounded with children\u2019s handprints. There were tributes to Desaparecidos and Zapatistas, and the names of many mafia victims. The story began in 1998 when 175 Kurds (including 72 children) arrived in Riace\u2019s nearby stretch of seaside. Mimmo Lucano, then a 40-year-old teacher, decided everything possible should be done to welcome the refugees. He was soon given the nickname \u201cMimmo the Kurd\u201d as he tried to find accommodation and work for them. Riace, back then, was empty and crumbling. Many residents had moved to the cities or the north, looking for work, and local businesses were being obliterated by the arrival of shopping malls and chain stores. Lucano had a vision of immigrants not only being helped, but helping bring Riace back to life. \u201cThe migrant is a resource, not something to be used for profit,\u201d he says. In 1999, Lucano founded an association, City of the Future (inspired by the Calabrian utopianist Tommaso Campanella). The village of Riace applied for funding for a new government programme called \u201cdiffused welcome\u201d, which would later become a model called SPRAR (system of protection for asylum-seekers and refugees). In this model, rather than using huge detention centres, local councils accept immigrants and are given the funding and responsibility to integrate them. Unlike the many dysfunctional models used in the Italian immigration system, SPRARs are widely admired. Lucano successfully stood as mayor in 2004, 2010 and 2014. He used the \u20ac35-a-day state funding for migrants not for personal enrichment but to employ 70 \u201ccultural mediators\u201d (teachers, therapists, careers advisers etc) who helped those migrants become part of the social fabric. Funds were also used to renovate empty buildings, to create cottage industries and give migrants small salaries, bringing the cobbled streets back to life in the process. In the last 20 years, Riace has received 6,000 immigrants from 20 different countries. \u201cRiace\u201d, the road sign now says when you arrive, \u201cA town of welcome\u201d. There was something so enchanting about what Lucano had achieved in a remote Calabrian village that he became a national figure. RAI, the Italian state broadcaster, began filming a docudrama about Riace and its mayor. Lucano was listed in Fortune magazine\u2019s 50 most influential leaders in the world. \u201cI define our utopia as normality,\u201d he said in 2016. Lucano remained refreshingly scornful of worldly success and power, and his speeches were simple: \u201cWe unite our weaknesses with many other desperate people from all parts of the world. We share a dream of a new humanity free of mafias, racism, fascism and all injustices.\u201d Nobody doubted his sincerity: when Becky Moses died in a San Ferdinando fire last year \u2013 she had been living in Riace until her residency permit had been denied \u2013 a grieving Lucano brought her back to Riace for burial. But his bluntness and visibility made Lucano some powerful enemies. Funds from central government became ever-more delayed, forcing Lucano to create Riace\u2019s own currency of IOUs (the \u201cbanknotes\u201d had the faces of Mahatma Gandhi, Che Guevara and anti-mafia campaigner Peppino Impastato). The RAI docudrama was blocked under pressure from Italy\u2019s new far-right government. Last summer, Lucano went on hunger strike when he learned that the Ministry of the Interior had suspended payment for the accommodation of asylum seekers for the second half of 2017, suddenly creating a \u20ac650,000 black hole in the town\u2019s budget. Since his arrest, Lucano has been banned from his town. His trial began this month, in the aftermath of a Salvini-allied mayor being elected as his replacement in May. The scorn of Italy\u2019s new government for the Riace model reveals a convergence of interests, both ideological and economic. Salvini\u2019s electoral base doesn\u2019t want to see immigrants at all, let alone witness them becoming part of the social fabric. In terms of the local economy, the more helpless and homeless immigrants are, the cheaper it is to employ them. The so-called \u201cSalvini decree\u201d, which passed into law last autumn, was promoted as a tightening-up of security and law enforcement, but it was also a bid to combat immigration and remove humanitarian protection for an estimated 100,000 refugees. Many have since been evicted from refugee centres. The sight of bulldozers flattening illegal settlements has become common on the evening news: in March, at the end of the orange-picking season, the main San Ferdinando shanty town was eradicated: tarpaulins, sticks and scrap metal snapped under the bulldozers\u2019 jagged teeth. In April, the same happened \u2013 for the third time \u2013 to part of the Borgo Mezzanone shanty town. Many activists believe this modern form of slavery is not a perversion of 21st-century capitalism, but the logical result of putting profit before every other consideration. \u201cUnless you counter the huge power of the multinationals,\u201d Yvan Sagnet told us, \u201cit will be difficult to resolve the problem of working conditions. Because caporalato and modern slavery are the effect of a system, not the cause of it: the effect of ultraliberalism applied to agriculture.\u201d If the victims are obvious, so too are the beneficiaries: food corporations, supermarkets and we, the consumers. * * * The enslavement of immigrant workers in the Italian south has been an open secret for years. But although the gangmaster system, in which workers are exploited and poorly paid, was outlawed in 2016, law enforcement has not caught up: a recent report by the agricultural workers\u2019 union, FLAI-CGIL, suggested that \u201cabout 100,000 (mostly foreign) workers are forced to suffer workplace blackmail and dilapidated living conditions\u201d. A system of certification for Italian and international supermarkets to say that their produce is not the fruit of slavery has also failed to eradicate the practice. On the contrary: for decades, organised crime and discount supermarkets have forced down the price of raw products, reducing payment along the food supply chain and creating a system that inevitably punishes the most vulnerable. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a comfortable message for supermarkets\u201d, says Rachel Wilshaw, ethical trade manager at Oxfam, \u201cbut in squeezing their suppliers so hard commercially that they can only make a profit by exploiting workers, supermarkets themselves are driving the conditions that can result in modern slavery in their supply chain.\u201d The story of price reduction for agricultural produce in the Italian deep south began 40 years ago, in January 1979, when two lorry drivers headed south from Verona to purchase oranges. They were in Rizziconi, next to Rosarno, when they were stopped and shot dead. Their mistake had been to purchase the oranges not too cheaply, but at a fair price. The \u2019Ndrangheta intended to be the sole purchaser of oranges, and any competition had to be eradicated. As Giuseppe Lavorato \u2013 Rosarno\u2019s anti-mafia mayor from 1994 to 2002 \u2013 wrote in his memoir: \u201cIn the 1970s, the \u2019Ndrangheta kept away from our towns any trader who paid an equitable price [for oranges] in order to remain the only buyer and impose its own low price.\u201d According to Lavorato, the \u2019Ndrangheta wasn\u2019t content simply to be the sole purchaser of Calabrian oranges. It wanted to become the \u201cexclusive protagonist\u201d in the entire commercial chain, obliging farmers to go through them for every stage of production \u201cfor the labourers at harvest time, for the companies selling crates, for the lorries to transport the produce\u201d. Throughout the 1980s, oranges were increasingly profitable. Fizzy orangeades were becoming popular, and companies sourced juice from Calabria, where the oranges were of lower quality, and thus sold for concentrates rather than as whole fruits. With the arrival of subsidies from the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy in the 1980s, the \u2019Ndrangheta saw another source of income. It took over the titular ownership of what are called \u201cproducers\u2019 organisations\u201d (farmers\u2019 cooperatives) and invoiced the EU billions of lire for \u201cpaper oranges\u201d (fruit that existed only on documents). \u201cThey were weighing the same lorry two, four, six times\u201d, says Don Pino de Masi, an anti-mafia priest in Rosarno, meaning that they were receiving far more subsidies than they were entitled to. It is estimated as much as \u20ac75m was embezzled in this way in 2007 alone. It meant Calabrian farmers were extremely vulnerable to international competition when Brazil and other countries began undercutting the Calabrian juicers. As the mafia cut corners, always looking for maximum returns, the laborious tasks that the EU subsidies were intended to finance \u2013 protecting or improving production through pruning, replanting, fencing, scientific research and infrastructure \u2013 simply hadn\u2019t been carried out. Throughout the 1980s and 90s, the Italian mafia bought land. Cash-rich from drug trafficking, and from embezzling public funds for construction, the mafia saw the land grab as an easy way to launder profits. When garbage-disposal contracts were privatised, land offered an opportunity to dump refuse, including toxic waste. The building in San Calogero (near Rosarno) where the young Malian, Soumaila Sacko, was shot dead last summer had been used to dump 127 tonnes of industrial by-products. But the mafia\u2019s purchase of agricultural land received a new impetus when, in 2008, the EU\u2019s subsidy system was changed: there was now a fixed sum of \u20ac1,500 per year per hectare, regardless of production. It was a further incentive to buy land, with the result that many of the orange groves of Calabria are now controlled by some of most powerful families in the Italian underworld: the Pesce, Piromalli and Mancuso clans. \u201cThe mafia now governs the agro-industry,\u201d Leonardo Palmisano, the anti-mafia author, told us. \u201cYou only need to look at the properties confiscated from the mafia. In recent years, they are almost all in the agricultural sector. And organised crime doesn\u2019t just control agricultural production, but also transport, commercialisation and the fruit markets.\u201d Recent investigations have supported Palmisano\u2019s assertion: in one, codenamed \u201cAll Clean\u201d, magistrates discovered that almost every aspect of the supply chain for oranges was dominated by the \u2019Ndrangheta: cooperatives for the harvest and sales of oranges, five different transport firms, a company involved in plastic packaging and another in cardboard packaging. In one wiretapped conversation, a member of the notorious Pesce family even boasted that he himself had created the transportation network for the Cedi Sisa supermarket in Calabria. Many of the huge fruit-and-vegetable markets throughout Italy have also become bases for criminal organisations. With the constant coming-and-going of lorries, those permanent markets offer a good cover for drug-running: an investigation in 2007 revealed that the Morabito clan from Africo, just south of Rosarno, had taken control of the Milanese fruit-and-vegetable market, fixing prices and dealing cocaine from inside the market\u2019s administrative offices (207kg were confiscated in one raid alone). The situation was the same 10 years later: in an investigation called Provvidenza, the Piromalli clan was revealed to have wrested control of the Milan fruit-and-vegetable market from the Morabitos. The same clan was also alleged to have influence over an agricultural cooperative, Copam, near Rosarno, which had, between 2012 and 2016, received \u20ac2.6m from the EU. Italy\u2019s Agromafia Observatory, an organisation that analyses criminal incursions into the food chain, estimates that the value of food-related business to organised crime has risen 12.4% in the last year, making it now worth \u20ac24.5bn. The Observatory suggests that agriculture now makes up 15% of the mafias\u2019 total income. In the period from 1 January 2017 to 30 June 2018, the Guardia di Finanza confiscated 800 tonnes of tomato concentrate that were believed to be the product of criminal activity. Large sections of Italian agriculture are untainted by organised crime, but the mafia has contaminated parts of the food supply chain in a way that makes it difficult to isolate. \u201cYou have to understand\u201d, says Don Pino De Masi, the anti-mafia priest, \u201cthat in Calabria, the black economy is bigger than the real one. There are no workers\u2019 rights. You take on who you can pay the least and the gangmaster oils this \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 mechanism. Above the immigrant gangmaster is the Calabrian one, the expression of the will of those who command here.\u201d What happens to brave farmers who try and escape that \u201ccommand\u201d is telling. The GOEL Association unites 27 farms in Calabria, as well as many businesses and cooperatives that refuse all contact with the \u2019Ndrangheta. Its president, Vincenzo Linarello, says he is trying to persuade farmers that they can get richer by fighting the mafia: \u201cWe pay 40 cents per kilo of oranges to our farmers. That\u2019s almost six times what others receive,\u201d he says. But the consequence of taking a stand is that his farmers are constantly suffering vandalism and arson, while sheep and goats have been repeatedly released on to their crops. \u201cWe have continuous thefts, bombings and damage,\u201d says Linarello. \u201cThey never hurt people, only objects. But you are brought to a point of absolute exasperation, such that eventually a farmer [without a supporting association] seeks them out to understand why they are being attacked. The farmer almost has a perverse sense of gratitude to the person [who can stop the attacks].\u201d From then on, says Linarello, all the farm\u2019s contracts \u2013 for employment, transportation, sales and so on \u2013 will slowly come under the control of organised crime. Last summer, at the height of Italy\u2019s tomato-picking season, there was a robbery at a biodynamic farm in Molise, just north of Puglia. The manager, Paola Santi, employed a number of migrants, and made sure they were paid a fair wage and worked in a healthy environment. Eager to share this good practice, she made a video and uploaded it to the business\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cWe just wanted to set a good example,\u201d she told us, \u201cto show that some of our workers had been with us for 10 years.\u201d Within three days, the company\u2019s four tractors \u2013 worth \u20ac250,000 \u2013 had been stolen. * * * Every year, before the harvest is in, certain supermarkets invite a supply price for their fresh produce. Because the order, for the winning bidder, will be very large, producers compete to outdo each other with the lowest price. This is the supermarkets\u2019 \u201cdouble-down\u201d auction, infamous for reducing prices on all produce. After opening offers are called in, the lowest bid from that first round is then used as the starting point for this second round, hence \u201cdouble down\u201d. In April 2014, an auction for tomatoes was in progress. In Naples, a manufacturer of tomato products called Francesco Franzese stared at his computer screen in consternation as the price dropped. He was managing director of La Fiammante, a company based on the slopes of Vesuvius, which sold tinned tomatoes, passata and pur\u00e9e. What he saw shocked him. The tomato-growing season hadn\u2019t even begun, but a supermarket chain was inviting a supply price for 20m tins of tomatoes. Franzese was logged on to the online portal, and every time a rival company lowered their price, a two-minute timer started. \u201cIt was like a game,\u201d he told us, \u201cand you had to keep going lower to stay in it. It was the only auction that I had seen going downwards. You didn\u2019t even know if the other bids were real, or just a way to force down the price.\u201d Franzese knew the figures didn\u2019t add up. The prices rival companies were offering to sell for had to be, he calculated, below their costs. \u201cTo produce a tin of tomatoes,\u201d he told us, \u201ccertain expenses are out of your control: the price of tin, energy and water costs and so on. The only place you can squeeze savings are in labour costs. The only place.\u201d He decided not to participate in the auction. \u201cIn accepting these industrial prices,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re actually selling the skin of the farm-workers.\u201d Franzese\u2019s refusal to play the game, however, was an isolated protest. Given the parlous state of the Italian economy in recent years, the double-down auction has, since 2014, become more common. Discount supermarkets \u2013 the main perpetrators \u2013 now account for almost 20% of the Italian market, and in Germany (a major consumer of Italian produce) the figure is at 40%. Between 2014 and 2017, while the Italian economy has been stagnant, the major discount supermarkets have grown. Activist Fabio Ciconte and journalist Stefano Liberti have been campaigning for a decade for a fairer food industry, and recently published a book: Big Trolley: Who Decides What We Eat? \u201cThe supermarkets,\u201d they wrote, \u201chave created a war between the poor: on the one side the farmers, who are struggling to survive, and on the other consumers, who want to spend less and less.\u201d The result is that tomatoes, oranges and other agricultural produce are now sold with no relation to how much they cost from the ground up, but solely how little the super-powerful supermarkets are prepared to pay from the top down. Many supermarkets also charge a \u201clisting fee\u201d for the privilege of being on their shelves. In their book, Ghetto Italia, Yvan Sagnet and Leonardo Palmisano describe it as a race to the bottom. \u201cThe link between the cost of work and the price of the product has broken,\u201d they wrote. Prices paid to tomato-processing companies, which turn the raw fruit into tins of tomatoes, concentrates, sauces and ketchups, are constantly forced down. Those processors, in turn, readjust the prices they pay to farmers, in order to maintain their profit margin. A recent \u201cfair price\u201d campaign (launched last December by the environmental charity Legambiente, and the ethical Italian supermarket NaturaS\u00ec) highlighted just how low prices have fallen: farmers now receive an eye-wateringly low 7.5 cents for a kilo of tomatoes. The per-kilo price for oranges hovers around the 7 cents mark (there are regional and seasonal variations). In that context, it is hardly surprising if corners are cut. Farmers use gangmasters to provide the cheapest, most vulnerable labour, and don\u2019t ask questions about the workers\u2019 conditions. \u201cThe farmers make up for [diminishing margins]\u201d, Sagnet and Palmisano wrote, \u201cthrough the gangmasters \u2026 everyone makes money on the ones below, except for the very last in the chain, the labourers.\u201d Such purchasing practices are irresponsible, says Cindy Berman, head of the London-based Ethical Trading Initiative\u2019s modern slavery strategy. While she noted this is common across all industries globally, ETI\u2019s position on the matter is clear: \u201cIt is a practice we abhor, and we discourage. Responsible companies shouldn\u2019t be doing it.\u201d The power of supermarkets is exacerbated in Italy by the producers\u2019 relative weakness. In the Italian south, the average size of a farm is seven hectares. There is often little consolidation or cooperation between them, and they remain powerless compared with the national supermarket chains. There is also an almost total absence of employment agencies for the agricultural sector in Calabria and Puglia, to act as alternatives to gangmasters. \u201cThere\u2019s a complete lack of organisation,\u201d says Stefano Liberti. \u201cIf you need labourers quickly, there\u2019s no efficient way to find them. That\u2019s the intermediary role that caporali [gangmasters] provide.\u201d The price pressure is even more acute on tomatoes than on other products, because they are often used by supermarkets, like milk in the UK, as what they call \u201cun prodotto civetta\u201d, a \u201closs leader\u201d. Tomatoes are so fundamental to Italian cuisine that shops sell them at a loss, knowing the customer will purchase other products while shopping and make up the difference. But the downward squeeze on prices is only part of the story of the supply chain, because it\u2019s also apparent that someone, somewhere, is making huge profits. Although farmers were paid 7.5 cents per kg for their tomatoes last year, the consumer was charged, roughly, \u20ac2 per kg for them. That represents a price increase of 2,567%. * * * Given that supermarkets are sourcing their oranges and tomatoes from crime-ridden areas of southern Italy, one might expect them to be circumspect about their suppliers. But they lack the instruments, or willingness, to probe deeply into where their products are sourced. Both UK and Italian supermarkets defend themselves by the blanket use of Certification Bodies (CBs): these are companies paid by supermarket suppliers to provide an ethical audit of their businesses, thereby offering assurance that their goods meet environmental or humanitarian standards. But CBs perform an arm\u2019s-length box-ticking exercise, and rarely visit the farms. Besides, many farms are so remote that it is hard to launch a raid or surprise inspection. We spoke to one volunteer medic, working in the fields in Sicily, who says that to avoid any surprises, big farms have lookouts on mopeds at the ends of very long tracks. Some inspectors can be paid off, and those who do their job with integrity have been threatened with violence. Global Gap (an inspectorate for good agricultural practice founded in 1997 by retailers) is an organisation that has patented one methodology for such audits. But under the Global Gap method, only the square root of the total number of farms used by a processing plant is inspected (ie if there are 100 farms supplying a plant, only 10 will be inspected). There\u2019s no element of surprise \u2013 the general regulations of Global Gap state that \u201cThe following is true for unannounced inspections: the CB may inform the producer in advance of the intended visit.\u201d Almost all CBs attract business by boasting that they provide \u201creputational preservation\u201d or \u201crisk awareness\u201d. They exist primarily to shore up a good name rather than root out and reveal bad practice. There is a conflict of interest, since the cost of certification is met not by the supermarkets, but by the clients \u2013 an agricultural producer or processor. \u201cWhen the person being inspected is the same person paying the inspector\u2019s fee, 99.9% of the time the inspector will say: \u2018No, you\u2019re not exploiting anyone\u2019,\u201d said Aboubakar Soumahoro, of the USB grassroots union. It is, he says, a racket: \u201cThe story just doesn\u2019t stand up.\u201d One major CB told us, off the record: \u201cWe audit remotely. We rely on the documentation our customers supply.\u201d The announcement of inspections provides ample room for suppliers to cheat the system. \u201cAudits are often announced in advance, which allows employers to deceive auditors [by making sure] exploited workers are not present on the day of the audit,\u201d says chair of the Yale university working group on slavery, Genevieve LeBaron. Farmers of the Italian deep south who are trying to do things differently and put some kind of reform in place are scathing about the inspection process. Vincenzo Linarello, from GOEL, calls CBs \u201cthe original sin\u201d of the modern slavery system. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not true that supermarkets are sourcing from farms that don\u2019t exploit labourers,\u201d he says. \u201cHow do they check? They make their suppliers sign contracts in which they simply self-certify.\u201d Lucio Cavazzoni, the president of Good-Land, a company campaigning for rural and community regeneration, says that certifications \u201care trustworthy on paper, but absolutely unreliable for [knowledge of] the fields\u201d. Even some of the most powerful voices in the food industry express doubt that the certification process does anything to protect against gangmasters. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t swear by it,\u201d Francesco Mutti, the CEO of one of Italy\u2019s biggest and oldest tomato-processing firms, told us. Mario Gasbarrino, CEO of the Unes supermarket chain, who disdains aggressive discounting practices, is equally blunt: \u201cI put little faith in certifications.\u201d The absurdity of the certification process was revealed in 2015, when a 47-year-old Sudanese immigrant, Abdullah Muhammed, was working on a tomato farm in Nard\u00f2 in Puglia. Labouring without breaks, and with limited water, he suffered a heart attack and died. No medical assistance was available. It was his first day of work; he had arrived from Sicily the day before. The farm was owned by Giuseppe Mariano, who had previously been caught up in an investigation into caporalato, and who had been using a Sudanese gangmaster. Using drones and wiretaps, an investigating magistrate, Paola Guglielmi, discovered that the farm was supplying processing plants owned by two of the biggest names in the Italian tomato industry, Mutti and Cirio. The arrest warrant issued by Guglielmi for the farmer and his gangmaster spoke of \u201cconditions of absolute exploitation\u201d on the farm. (Thanks to the glacial pace of Italian justice, the case against the farmer and his gangmaster is yet to reach court.) The farm supposedly had anti-slavery certification, Guglielmi told us, with a humourless laugh. \u201cBut they never really checked.\u201d Princes (the food conglomerate owned by Mitsubishi, and maker of Napolina brand tomatoes) has been sourcing tomatoes from the Nard\u00f2 farm, now under new ownership, since 2016. A spokesman said they are confident the new management is proactive in improving conditions. When questioned by food campaigners Liberti and Ciconte, Princes said that its \u201cown audits\u201d and \u201cdue diligence \u2026 did not reveal any evidence of illegality\u201d. Mutti was so aghast at the damage to its reputation that it decided, in future, to purchase only mechanically harvested tomatoes in the south. (Mechanisation reduces the working crews to four or five people, bar the driver.) Cirio, which is owned by Conserve Italia, told the Guardian: \u201c[We] would like to assure all \u2026 consumers that it will continue to process tomatoes supplied by its 14,000 cooperators through the collaboration of its 3,000 employees in complete respect of ethical principles and environmental sustainability.\u201d The other problem of the supply chain is its astonishing secrecy. Of the 15 CBs we contacted, only two replied to our questions. The addresses of agricultural cooperatives supplying international brands are often nondescript suburban offices, and, when you visit, they refuse to divulge which farms they work with. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this business for 40 years, and I\u2019ve never understood why the fruit-and-vegetable supply chain [in Italy] is so long,\u201d says Gasbarrino. \u201cThere\u2019s something nebulous there.\u201d If the traceability is tricky on produce that is tinned or boxed, it\u2019s even harder, of course, on loose fruit. If you attempt to trace where Calabrian oranges, picked by enslaved labourers, end up, everyone goes silent. The processing plant in Rosarno owned by Gaetano Rao, a businessman and politician, doesn\u2019t reply. San Benedetto, an Italian orangeade producer, says it is too busy to comment. Only Fanta, which is owned by Coca-Cola, offers a complete list of all its suppliers and transporters. Since 2012, Fanta has stopped sourcing its oranges in Calabria. \u201cWe\u2019re taking lectures in morality from Coca-Cola,\u201d says one Calabrian activist. * * * The continued use of slave labour in Italian agriculture has been made possible by a combination of factors: a migrant crisis in which hundreds of thousands of people with minimal rights have arrived in areas dominated by organised crime, just as the country\u2019s economy is flatlining and discount supermarkets are using all means possible to push down prices. But small victories have been won. The window of time to harvest most produce is narrow, so strategic industrial action can threaten the entire crop. In the last decade, strikes have sometimes brought results. In 2011, Yvan Sagnet, who came to Italy from Cameroon on a scholarship to study engineering four years earlier, was at university in Turin when his scholarship was suspended. To get by, he went to pick tomatoes in Nard\u00f2 with other African migrants. A sudden change in working conditions (the men were told they could no longer shake tomatoes off the vine, but had to pick them off by hand) infuriated the labourers, who downed tools. Sagnet, in his mid-20s, was chosen as strike leader. Despite violent threats (\u201cStop this strike or else consider yourself dead,\u201d one gangmaster told him), he denounced the gangmasters to police. \u201cWe showed the whole of Italy what was really going on,\u201d Sagnet told us. He has now set up his own business making tomato produce under the NoCap label, which he is hoping will raise consumer consciousness. (It follows the model of the successful Libera label, displayed by Italian producers who have refused to pay protection money to the mafia.) It\u2019s one of a number of products that are militantly anti-gangmaster. A recent survey suggested that 11% of Italian adults are so concerned about the provenance of food products that they now use an alternative form of shopping. There are gruppi d\u2019acquisto solidale (\u201csupportive purchasing groups\u201d), and all sorts of other buying options: altromercato (\u201canother market\u201d), fuori mercato (\u201coutside the market\u201d), sfrutta zero (\u201czero exploitation\u201d) and Funky Tomato. These demonstrate that consumers can influence the conditions for agricultural workers. \u201cIf there are corporals [gangmasters]\u201d, says Cavazzoni, \u201cthere are also generals, and the generals aren\u2019t only the supermarkets, but their customers.\u201d One of the few uplifting aspects of this dark story is that it may be immigrant labourers themselves who end this 21st-century slavery by standing up for their rights. Repeatedly in recent years, those with nothing to lose have revolted against gangmasters and the mafia. In December 2008, when an Ivorian in Rosarno was robbed of his entire savings and two more men were later shot, the labourers did something very rare for Rosarno: they organised a protest and denounced the criminals to the police. In January 2010, after a Togolese man was shot in Rosarno, the immigrant labourers rebelled. Cars were burned and shop windows smashed in the so-called \u201crevolt of Rosarno\u201d before a savage counter-revolt was organised by the mafia and neo-fascist organisations. Four people were badly injured and the labourers\u2019 temporary quarters were razed to the ground. The story was made into a brilliant, if harrowing film, Mediterranea. It was Sagnet\u2019s protest that, in part, led to the creation of an anti-gangmaster law in 2016, with custodial sentences of one to six years (or five to eight years if accompanied by violence and threats) for those exploiting vulnerable labourers. A total of 561 people were arrested under the gangmaster legislation in the 18 months since the beginning of 2017, showing not only how widespread the problem is, but also the fact that Italian law enforcement is beginning to take the problem seriously. Italian justice, however, isn\u2019t only excruciatingly slow; it\u2019s also rarely punitive. In April this year, the court of appeal cleared 11 of the 13 accused of \u201creducing their workers to a state of slavery\u201d. Only the two immigrant gangmasters, and none of the Italians, were convicted. In May, another agricultural labourer died in a car crash in Foggia (he had no documents, so his nationality is unknown). In April, a Gambian asylum-seeker died in a fire in the reconstructed slum of Borgo Mezzanone. If anything, the plight of immigrant labourers is getting worse, rather than better. In May\u2019s EU elections, Matteo Salvini gained 34.3% of the vote, thanks largely to his incessant anti-immigrant rhetoric. Central to his message is the branding of modern slaves as criminals \u2013 saying nothing about slavery itself. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 June 2019 to add a comment from a spokesman for Princes. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here",

      "bodyText": "Every week it seems there is something new to protest about. If we are now in the Anthropocene age \u2013 where human effects on the globe take precedence over nature \u2013 we are also in the age of activism, one of protesting against our damaging impact on the world. This dissent has moved beyond the fringes of political engagement to packing our streets with people and placards bearing slogans that range from seeking to stave off climate change to stopping Donald Trump and staying in the EU. Protests are increasingly taking in wider age ranges and demographics, too, but for those grassroots organisers for whom this is a long-term mission, the toll of such responsibility can be a heavy one. Activism comes with all the stresses of any job \u2013 long hours, \u201coffice\u201d politics and overflowing inboxes. Couple this with the fact that activism is in a sense defined by its marginality and the job sits firmly between a rock and a hard place. How, then, do activists stay motivated when the odds are against them? Spend time outside Bill McKibben, environmentalist and author \u201cTry to spend a little time outdoors, whether it is in a city park or out in the woods or mountains. One of the things we are fighting for is a world where nature still has some place and so it\u2019s good to get out and remind ourselves of that. I try to get outside every day, just for a few minutes. If I can just see the sky, that\u2019s good; sometimes I only want to see the stars for a few minutes and that makes me feel worthwhile.\u201d Seek out pleasure Eve Ensler, playwright and feminist activist \u201cIt is important to realise that the struggle is long, so you have to take care of your body. You have to have pleasure, joy and humour in your life, otherwise you just become bitter and full of sadness. Nature is critical, dance is critical, sex is critical. \u201cPleasure is what fuels us. Sometimes when we are doing this work, it can feel like we are not allowed to feel anything but pain, yet having done this work for a long time, if you want to keep going you need to have joy, as that\u2019s what will keep you motivated to go back.\u201d Exercise for distraction Bisi Alimi, LGBT activist \u201cI can get a lot of online abuse for the work that I do, as well as often seeing a lot of trauma from fellow LGBT people who reach out to me. That used to give me very intense anxiety. I have started going to the gym regularly for my mental health and sometimes, when I am really angry, I will go to a boxing class, which helps me get it out of my system. This allows me to see whatever has upset me less personally. I go to the gym five times a week and I also run at least twice a week, so every day I am doing something active that allows me to disconnect.\u201d Stay angry Harry Gay, campaigns manager at the Outside Project \u201cAnger is an important motivator and it is important we don\u2019t shy away from it as a driver for change. It is natural to be angry about the state of the world and at the things we see that are unjust. We\u2019re often told that anger is a negative emotion and that we should shy away from it; perhaps interpersonally that is true, but on a structural level it is important to not get sad about what is happening around you but to get angry and then to channel it in the right way, through action. That is what keeps us going and fighting for migrant rights and for all those who are discriminated against; we cannot get despondent.\u201d Get some therapy Patrisse Cullors, founder of Black Lives Matter \u201cI\u2019m a big proponent of therapy and always tell activists and organisers that they should be seeing a therapist to get them through. We are on the frontlines hearing so many painful stories from so many people that we become therapists ourselves, but we are not trained, so it creates an unfortunate environment for burnout. \u201cI have been doing activism since I was 16 years old, but I soon found out that it was triggering difficult memories from my childhood and was having an impact on how I saw myself \u2013 I couldn\u2019t separate myself from the people I was organising. I have been doing this for 20 years now and the only reason I have been able to do it for so long is because I have been relying on other people\u2019s skill sets to help me take care of myself and be a better person. \u201cPeople forget that activists are human beings and that there is a lot at stake for us. Often we do this work because it\u2019s what we have experienced ourselves.\u201d Don\u2019t be afraid to cry Gina Miller, anti-Brexit campaigner and lobbyist \u201cWhat can stop me in my tracks are those who attack my family and do it premeditatively, those who rant to my children, put it in an envelope and send it to my address. To get a letter which says, \u2018We know where your children are, we\u2019ll be taking them today,\u2019 is truly shocking. \u201cWhen that happens, I have to cry and let it out because you can\u2019t hold it all in. There is a temptation that as activists we have to be strong all the time, but in private you have to look after yourself and let your emotions come out when they arise. I will cry it out, I will hug my family and then refocus on what I am doing and get ready to keep going again. I will take the negative energy and redirect it into something positive.\u201d Understand your history Miqdaad Versi, anti-Islamophobia campaigner \u201cMy parents sacrificed so much as immigrants coming to this country and working all hours to send me to a private school, which they thought would give me the best chance in life. While I might not agree with private schools as an institution, I understand how important it was for my parents that I succeed in life, so I have a responsibility to them to not only do well but to stand up for others like them and to make society a better place for everyone. \u201cI have been lucky that my parents worked so hard for me and that means I can and should take the time to continue my activism. Knowing what they went through pales in comparison to my struggles and that keeps me going.\u201d Remember the wider movement Owen Jones, Guardian columnist and activist \u201cIt is important to feel that you are part of a broader movement for justice and that you are not just some isolated individual in fear. I spend a lot of time with LGBT activists, socialists, feminists and anti-racism activists, and this reminds me that I am part of a collective struggle. The attacks I receive aren\u2019t personal and I am not the only person who gets them \u2013 these people just hate the things we are fighting for and believe in. It should never become background noise but, equally, I wouldn\u2019t want to be intimidated by it because that would be giving them a victory they don\u2019t deserve. We have to maintain our solidarity in the face of the far right.\u201d Keep your perspective and stay in school Lucy Gavaghan, 17, environmental campaigner \u201cYou have to realise that, as one person, you can\u2019t change everything and do it all. If you start feeling guilty that you are not doing all the right things it can really set you back and mean that you are not making progress. You need to give yourself time to step back from your cause and what you are fighting for because then, when you go back to it, you are ready and not exhausted. \u201cIn a way, school work can be a good way to step back and it doesn\u2019t become too pressurised if I stay on top of it. Through the campaigning I can keep a wider perspective on changing the world and through school I can also focus on my own future.\u201d Keep talking Sam Knights, Extinction Rebellion \u201cFinding people to talk to and support you is incredibly important.

It\u2019s easy to feel like we are alone but there are thousands of people who feel like this and they want to talk to you, too. So please, as a first step, start talking to people about it.\u201d Look after your dogs Ryan Hart, domestic abuse campaigner \u201cMy brother Luke and I campaign against domestic abuse because our mother and sister Charlotte were killed by our father. That means that we spend all day speaking about our trauma. It gets very emotional. However, the dogs that we share have really helped us. They have shown us how to live in the moment and they are always happy as long as we are there. Luke and I were at university for most of the dogs\u2019 early years and Mum and Charlotte were the ones who raised them. The dogs have mannerisms which remind me of them and it keeps their memory alive.\u201d Take a cold shower Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, cook and environmental campaigner \u201cI have a cold shower every morning to wake me up and get me going. I have a blast of cold water for a minute or two and that is a real shock to the system when you first start, but it helps you go through the day with a spring in your step.

No matter how hard things have been in the days before, that cold water is a \u2018reset\u2019; it means each day starts anew.\u201d Keep your (Twitter) agency Ash Sarkar, journalist and activist \u201cI quite enjoy that feeling of sparring with someone online. It is a reclamation of your agency. Twitter is also a little crucible for comedy; it trains the bit of your brain that puts together things that are incongruous or funny. \u201cIt is important to remember that a lot of activists aren\u2019t at the sharp end of this politics.

There is no way that I or any other activist in the world can solve all of its problems, but we have to keep sight of the small victories; those are the ones that keep us going. \u201cIf any of the people we work with get granted asylum, it is a huge victory for me and shows us that we are doing good. Although there is a lot that we still need to change, it gives me satisfaction that we are moving in the right direction.

      "body": "<p>Substantial rain has at last soaked into the dry earth. Gangs of jackdaws flock and peck over cut silage fields and, in the vacated pasture opposite home, swallows wheel low behind the tractor-drawn topper that is cutting off ungrazed thistle and dock plants, leaving a mulch to be absorbed into the soil, promoting new growth and thickening of the grass keep.</p> <p>Throughout the summer grazing season, the pedigree South Devon suckler herd will rotate from field to field. Cows and their offspring were brought from winter quarters in mid-April, joined by the new bull a month later. He arrived by truck, strolled down the ramp and sauntered between the alert and attentive cows and calves who then followed on as he patrolled new territory; an inquisitive calf touched noses with him and since then the bull has been in charge.</p> <p>Grassland thrives in this parish where free-draining, shallow soils are usually watered by regular doses of rainfall.

      "bodyText": "Substantial rain has at last soaked into the dry earth. Gangs of jackdaws flock and peck over cut silage fields and, in the vacated pasture opposite home, swallows wheel low behind the tractor-drawn topper that is cutting off ungrazed thistle and dock plants, leaving a mulch to be absorbed into the soil, promoting new growth and thickening of the grass keep. Throughout the summer grazing season, the pedigree South Devon suckler herd will rotate from field to field. Cows and their offspring were brought from winter quarters in mid-April, joined by the new bull a month later. He arrived by truck, strolled down the ramp and sauntered between the alert and attentive cows and calves who then followed on as he patrolled new territory; an inquisitive calf touched noses with him and since then the bull has been in charge. Grassland thrives in this parish where free-draining, shallow soils are usually watered by regular doses of rainfall. There are no longer any dairy herds, and grass is used for beef and lamb production; farmers aim to become self-sufficient in winter fodder, concentrating on home-grown silage instead of cereals that need ever dearer pesticides and artificial fertilisers.

      "bodyText": "Labor has called on the prime minister to investigate what it calls \u201cshocking allegations of misconduct\u201d involving Angus Taylor and Josh Frydenberg\u2019s office. A Guardian Australia investigation has revealed Taylor met with environment officials about an issue at the centre of a compliance action involving a company he part-owns. Following those talks, the office of the then environment and energy minister, Frydenberg, canvassed whether protections for a critically endangered grassland at the centre of the compliance action could be watered down and if it could be kept secret. Labor\u2019s environment spokeswoman, Terri Butler, said Scott Morrison \u201cmust investigate the serious matter of a potential breach of the ministerial code of conduct\u201d. The Greens\u2019 leader, Richard Di Natale, said the episode showed the \u201curgent need\u201d for a national integrity commission and said the party would move a Senate motion demanding the government explain the actions of both ministers when parliament returns next month. Guardian Australia has sought comment from Morrison. \u201cToday\u2019s shocking allegations of misconduct against senior Liberal government ministers are an indictment on the Morrison government,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIt appears that Angus Taylor breached the ministerial code and met with the environmental department while it was investigating the company to which he has links. \u201cIt also appears that Josh Frydenberg\u2019s office sought advice as to whether he had the ministerial powers to weaken grasslands protections in secret, then sought to conduct a review into agriculture and the EPBC Act.\u201d Butler said Taylor and Frydenberg needed to explain exactly what had occurred. \u201cIt is not good enough that Mr Frydenberg was considering deploying ministerial powers to weaken environmental protections in secret, after arranging meetings for his colleague who has a conflict of interest in the matter,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not the first time questions have been asked in relation to Angus Taylor\u2019s conduct and potential conflicts of interest. \u201cAustralians will not let them get away with it, and neither should Scott Morrison. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that Australians can trust their representatives not to interfere in matters that relate to their personal financial interests.\u201d Di Natale said: \u201cIt is appalling to consider that Angus Taylor would use his privileged position to approach departmental staff and government ministers about an issue that directly affects his business interests. \u201cWe will be ensuring that Angus Taylor and Josh Frydenberg explain their actions to the parliament when it resumes next month. \u201cThis whole episode demonstrates again how urgently we need a federal Icac that can investigate these sorts of behaviours that undermine faith in democracy.\u201d Guardian Australia\u2019s investigation, published on Wednesday and Thursday, revealed that Taylor, then the minister for cities and digital transformation, sought meetings with departmental officials to discuss the 2016 listing that protects the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands as a critically endangered community under federal environment law. The meetings were requested in 2017 via Frydenberg\u2019s office. At the same time federal and state investigations were under way into the alleged poisoning of 30 hectares that contained the grass species on a property in New South Wales\u2019s Monaro region owned by Jam Land Pty Ltd. One of the directors of that company is Richard Taylor, the minister\u2019s brother, and the minister himself holds an interest in the firm via his family investment company, Gufee. Taylor has denied making any representations regarding the compliance action and said he received a briefing in his capacity as the member for Hume for the purpose of understanding the technical aspects of the revised listing and its impact on those affected, which included many constituents. The critically endangered grasslands are mainly found on the Monaro plains, which are not in Hume. However, some communities of the grassland are found in Taylor\u2019s electorate. Following lobbying by Taylor, Frydenberg\u2019s office sought advice on the full extent of his ministerial powers and whether he could override scientific advice and remove the \u201ccritically endangered\u201d listing. Environment groups said the revelations raised serious questions about the integrity of Australia\u2019s national environment laws. \u201cThe Australian Conservation Foundation calls on the parliament to investigate these serious questions relating to the actions of Josh Frydenberg and Angus Taylor,\u201d Basha Stasak, the ACF\u2019s nature program manager, said. \u201cAustralians need to be sure breaches of environmental law are investigated free from political interference and that scientific listing decisions are not tampered with.\u201d Evan Quartermain, the head of programs at the Australian arm of Humane Society International, said investigations by federal environment officials into illegal agricultural land clearing were extremely rare. He said both ministers needed to \u201cexplain their conduct\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s atrocious that we have ministers seeking to remove protections while an investigation mysteriously drags on for years,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a single incident on land owned by very well-connected people who seem to believe they are above the law, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that an EPBC Act agricultural review was launched shortly after the meetings, or that other threatened habitat listings have been avoided since they occurred.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden responded with defiance after a day of sharp criticism from fellow Democrats, after he named two southern segregationist senators as people he had managed to work with during his career. In comments at a Wall Street fundraising event on Monday, Biden said that, despite major disagreements, he had worked with the senators with \u201csome civility\u201d. When reporters asked Biden late on Wednesday if he would apologize for his comments, the former vice-president responded, dismissively: \u201cApologize for what?\u201d \u201cCory [Booker] should apologize,\u201d Biden told reporters, referring to the senator from New Jersey who was among those attacking Biden for his comments. \u201cHe knows better.

Among those issues is criticism that his handling of the Clarence Thomas supreme court confirmation hearings in 1991 was tantamount to giving Republicans the opportunity to ignore sexual harassment allegations levelled by Thomas\u2019 former assistant, Anita Hill. During the 2007 presidential campaign, Biden made headlines for calling Barack Obama, then one of his rivals in the Democratic primary, \u201cthe first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy\u201d.

The corridor is jam packed with people, overwhelmingly African American, hoping to grab one of the public seats for the first congressional hearing to be held in 12 years on what has become this year\u2019s hot topic \u2013 reparations for slavery.</p> \n  <p><strong>The exceptional turnout for the event which has just started is a sign of passions running high ahead of the 2020 presidential elections </strong>in which many of the 23 Democratic candidates have embraced the idea of atoning for America\u2019s original sin. </p> \n  <p>A couple of the presidential candidates are likely to speak too: Cory Booker, the US senator from New Jersey, who has introduced a senate bill calling for the creation of a government commission, is at the hearing, as is Eric Swalwell, a California congressman who is a member of the sub-committee that has called the hearing. </p> \n  <p>I\u2019ve just been speaking to people standing in line in the packed corridor, asking them what they are hoping to hear today. Kenniss Henry, a member of one of the oldest pro-reparations groups, the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, said she was hoping that the hearing would give enough of a push in Congress that the reparations bill, HR 40, would finally get a full debate on the floors of both the House and Senate \u2013 something that has proved elusive for the past 30 years.</p> \n  <p>The most touching comment came from Khalab Blagburn, aged 13. He recently spoke at a debate at his local high school in which he argued all black people in America today and not just the descendants of slaves should be compensated, because the fall-out of slavery had impacted them all.</p> \n  <p>I asked him whether, as a teenager, he was confident he would have a fair chance of realizing his dreams in America when he grows up.

There\u2019s not a racist bone in my body. I\u2019ve been involved in Civil Rights my whole career.

You don\u2019t have to like the people in terms of their views,\u201d Biden told reporters. \u201cBut you just simply make the case, and you beat them.

Today, he was confirmed by the Senate to a lifetime appointment as a federal judge. Whatever happens in 2020, Trump and the Republican Party have used his first term years to remake the federal judiciary at every level. As context, the Huffington Post reported today, 1 in 5 of all of the nation\u2019s current circuit judges was nominated by Trump. More on Kacsmaryk from the Huffington Post.

Commissions like his own in Caricom have formed and opened negotiations in Columbia, Costa Rica and Venezuela as well as the European Union and several West African countries from where slaves originally came. Beckles said that reparations was about making amends for nothing less than genocide. In his native Barbados, 600,000 slaves were imported to work in the sugar plantations but at the point of emancipation only 84,000 people of African descent remained. \u201cWhat else can you call that other than genocide?\u201d The historian said that the 21st century would be the century of reparations. \u201cIt took us 300 years to fight to end slavery. It took us a further 100 years to get civil rights written into law. It may take us all of the 21st century to do this, but we will not stop because slavery is not done until reparations are paid.\u201d \u201cLawmakers and their witnesses ranged over the legacy of slavery, the Jim Crow segregation that followed and modern scourges of mass incarceration, inequality and poverty that still plague African Americans,\u201d writes the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington, who attended a Congressional hearing on reparations in Washington DC today. Ed\u2019s full report is here: Federal authorities are investigating whether Deutsche Bank complied with laws meant to stop money laundering and other crimes, according to the New York Times: The investigation includes a review of Deutsche Bank\u2019s handling of so-called suspicious activity reports that its employees prepared about possibly problematic transactions, including some linked to President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, according people close to the bank and others familiar with the matter. The criminal investigation into Deutsche Bank is one element of several separate but overlapping government examinations into how illicit funds flow through the American financial system, said five of the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the inquiries. Several other banks are also being investigated. Congress is also investigating Deutsche Bank because of its close relationship with Donald Trump and his family. \u201cDeutsche Bank has said that it is cooperating with government investigations and that it had been taking steps to improve its anti-money-laundering systems,\u201d the Times said. Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden is under fire for recalling his \u201ccivil\u201d working relationship with two segregationist and racist lawmakers: James Eastand, a Senator from Mississippi and Herman Talmadge, a Senator from Georgia. \u201cI was in a caucus with James O Eastland,\u201d Biden said at a fundraiser in New York on Tuesday. \u201cHe never called me \u2018boy\u2019; he always called me \u2018son.\u2019 \u201c Biden\u2019s competitors criticized the comments: New Jersey senator Cory Booker, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and California senator Kamala Harris. \u201cYou don\u2019t joke about calling black men \u2018boys,\u2019\u201d Booker said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cVice President Biden\u2019s relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone. I have to tell Vice President Biden, as someone I respect, that he is wrong for using his relationships with Eastland and Talmadge as examples of how to bring our country together.\u201d Lawmakers have criticized the Trump adminstration\u2019s plans to roll back the US government\u2019s only direct efforts to curb coal-fired power plant pollution as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and a \u201cmajor setback.\u201d California attorney general, Xavier Becerra: President Trump\u2019s Dirty Power Plan is more than just disgraceful and immoral, it is unlawful. There is no justification for gutting a law that would have significantly reduced emissions and prevented thousands of premature deaths per year. While the Trump Administration might lack the necessary courage, we\u2019re prepared to confront the climate crisis head-on. The independent US senator from Maine, Angus King: There is a seemingly very boring, but very important, hearing tomorrow about the state of the Congressional Research Service, a public policy branch in the government that creates non-partisan reports for Congress. CRS has a positive reputation, but for the first time in more than a decade, the House will hold an oversight hearing to examine issues within the agency. According to Roll Call: Andie Wyatt worked at CRS from 2015 to 2018 as a legislative attorney in the American Law Division, with a focus on environmental law. She said there was a culture of management avoiding pushback at all costs without any accounting for whether the pushback was accurate. \u201cFrom the perspective of an attorney working on climate matters in 2017 and 2018, there was a lot of pressure not to imply too directly that the Trump administration, and Republican position against climate science, was wrong,\u201d Wyatt said. She added that clear statements about climate risks and science were \u201cwatered down\u201d either in the editing process or preemptively by authors who anticipated their language would be diluted... ... Stephen Dagadakis, a CRS spokesman, said in a statement that \u201cCRS is committed to providing Congress with research and analysis of the highest quality. We address the full range of issues before Congress, including topics that are controversial, and believe the work stands for itself.\u201d The author and professor of history and international relations at American University, Ibram X Kendi, writes for the Atlantic on the Americans who oppose reparations: Americans who prefer gradual approaches that do not radically disrupt inequality and who label their approaches \u201cplain, peaceful, generous, just,\u201d to use Lincoln\u2019s words, carelessly ignore or understate the complex, violent, stingy, and unjust damage wrought by inequality. These Americans care more about responding to political expediency than the emergency of inequality, care more about repairing alienated white Americans than repairing pillaged black coffers, and claim to be horrified by slavery and \u201cnot racist\u201d but end up, knowingly or unknowingly, compensating the white beneficiaries of slavery and racism. These Americans claim they oppose racism and reparations. They support the drive for economic equality between the races at the same time they are pumping the breaks on the only foreseeable policy that can dramatically close the growing racial wealth gap between the races. Only an expansive and expensive compensation policy for the descendants of the enslaved and relegated of the scale Lincoln proposed for the enslavers and subsidized could prevent the racial wealth gap from compounding and being passed onto another generation. The New York Times put the same 18 questions to 21 Democratic presidential hopefuls, including \u201cDoes anyone deserve to have a billion dollars?\u201d \u201cWould there be American troops in Afghanistan at the end of your first term?\u201d and \u201cWhat is your comfort food on the campaign trail?\u201d On the billionaire question, Kirsten Gillibrand was the only person to definitively say \u201cno.\u201d The Afghanistan questioned saw all candidates say they would pull back troops, with only Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker vowing a full exit. Turns out a few candidates are vegan (Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard) and Bernie Sanders put on some weight the last time he was on the campaign trail so he says: \u201cthere\u2019s too much comfort food.\u201d Rally recap The Guardian\u2019s Washington bureau chief, David Smith, was in Orlando last night for Donald Trump\u2019s rally to formally launch his 2020 presidential re-election bid. Smith writes: Trump spent little effort offering a vision of the future. He and his supporters were most energised by his greatest hits: grievance politics, demonising opponents, raging against perceived injustices. There was even a reprise of attacks on Hillary Clinton, his defeated rival in 2016, complete with furious chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d His vicious, often fabricated, attacks implied that while a referendum on his record would likely end in defeat, his campaign believes that whipping up fear of a Democrat in the White House could yet save his skin. Outside the rally, Richard Luscombe kept watch on the supporters and protestors, who came out in droves: A happy crowd danced and sang to live music in the rain, but the carnival atmosphere was marred by the appearance of several dozen of apparent members of the Proud Boys, a far-right organization deemed by the Southern Poverty Law Center to be a hate group. Marching from the Amway Center chanting, many wearing Maga hats and some making white power gestures, the group was intercepted by City of Orlando police officers outside the bar. The officers spread their bicycles across the road as a barricade. And Adam Gabbatt, reporting from Orlando, has got the top takeaways from the rally, including \u201cTrump has no plans to turn forward the clock\u201d and \u201cA big crowd in Orlando \u2026 but early departures.\u201d The judiciary sub-committee hearing in Washington on reparations has just wrapped up. It\u2019s been a lively debate - at times heated - with the full hearing room echoing occasionally with cheers for those advocating for making amends for slavery and at other times loud booing when Republican lawmakers and their witnesses dismissed the idea. The final word came from the Democratic sponsor of HR 40, the House bill calling for a government study of reparations, and her key witness. Sheila Jackson Lee, representative from Texas who has sponsored HR 40 since 2017, said that the debate around reparations was real and very much rooted in the present day. \u201cWe are not here on a temporary pass doing temporary work,\u201d she said. The job was to correct the errors of the past and enshrine that correction into law. Her key witness, the author Ta-Nehisi Coates, said that the common theme through all this morning\u2019s discussion was theft. Slavery was theft of black labor, Jim Crow segregation was theft of black property, and today \u201cif you deny my ability to vote and participate in the political process you have effectively stolen from me\u201d. None of this was a passive process, he said as the debate closed. \u201cIt was a conscious taking from one group to give to another by the state.\u201d In the wake of Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 appearance at the reparations hearing, it\u2019s worth looking back at his interview with The New Yorker about reparations published earlier this month. Several Democratic presidential candidates have issued support for reparations, and Cory Booker was at the hearing, but Coates said in the interview that Elizabeth Warren was the candidate he thought was most serious when they talk about reparations. An excerpt from that interview: The New Yorker: In what way? Coates: I think she means it. I mean\u2014I guess it will break a little news\u2014after \u201cThe Case for Reparations\u201d came out, she just asked me to come and talk one on one with her about it. TNY: This is five years ago, when your piece came out in The Atlantic? C: Yeah, maybe it was a little later than that, but it was about the time. It was well before she declared anything about running for President. TNY: And what was your conversation with Elizabeth Warren like? C: She had read it. She was deeply serious, and she had questions. And it wasn\u2019t, like, Will you do X, Y, and Z for me? It wasn\u2019t, like, I\u2019m trying to demonstrate I\u2019m serious. I have not heard from her since, either, by the way. TNY: Have you talked to any candidates about it? C: No. For the first time in a decade, Congress today is holding a hearing on reparations, the idea of providing financial compensation to descendants of the enslaved. Trump\u2019s administration is finalizing its plans to roll back the US government\u2019s only direct efforts to curb coal-fired power plant pollution that is heating the planet House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would not censure Donald Trump, a move that is a step down from launching impeachment proceedings. The crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, should be investigated over the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi because there is \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that he and other senior officials are liable for the killing, according to a UN report published this morning. Hope Hicks, former White House communications director, is the first witness in the House investigation into the Mueller report\u2019s findings on whether President Donald Trump tried to obstruct a probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Hope Hicks is refusing to answer questions related to her time in the White House in an interview with the House Judiciary Committee, according to Democrats in the closed-door meeting. \u201cShe\u2019s objecting to stuff that\u2019s already in the public record,\u201d California Representative Karen Bass, told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty ridiculous.\u201d Pramila Jayapal, a representative from Washington, called it \u201ca farce.\u201d In a letter to Nadler, White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote that Trump directed Hicks not to answer questions \u201crelating to the time of her service as a senior adviser to the president.\u201d California representative, Ted Lieu, who is tweeting his personal highlights from the interview, is not impressed: An inside look at Coates\u2019 testimony from the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington, who is at the reparations hearing: Before I get into Coates\u2019s criticism, a quick word about where we\u2019re sitting. Coates delivered his address in front of the assembled members of the sub-committee on the constitution, civil rights and civil liberties. Half the bench of lawmakers consists of Democrats, and their seats are all full. Half the bench consists of Republicans, and their seats are almost entirely empty. Which speaks volumes about how the modern conservative movement views the subject of making amends for slavery. Yesterday the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell made a statement in which he dismissed in curt terms the very idea of reparations. \u201cI don\u2019t think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago for whom none of us currently living are responsible is a good idea,\u201d McConnell said. That clearly made Coates see red. His address grew angrier and angrier, his disdain for McConnell\u2019s posture more pointed and personal. The Republican leader may not have been around 150 years ago, but he was around for the aftermath, he said. \u201cFor a century after the Civil War black people were subjected to a relentless campaign of terror, a campaign that extended well into the lifetime of majority leader McConnell.\u201d McConnell may not have been there for the Battle of Appomattox at the end of the Civil War, \u201cbut he was alive for the execution of George Stinney, he was alive for the blinding of Isaac Woodard.\u201d Stinney was aged 14 when he was executed by electric chair in 1944 after a trial for the murder of two white girls that was later overturned as unfair. Woodard was blinded in an attack by South Carolina police in 1946 \u2013 he was still in uniform having recently been honorably discharged from the US Army as a World War 2 veteran. Coates went on to say of McConnell: \u201cHe was alive for the red-lining of Chicago and the looting of black homeowners of some $4bn. Victims of their plunder are very much alive today \u2013 I\u2019m sure they would love a word with the majority leader.\u201d Back to the reparations hearing, where Sheila Jackson Lee, a congresswoman from Texas who is the current sponsor of the House reparations bill HR 40, delivered sober statistics on why she supports reparations. Number of Africans who were transported by force across the Atlantic in the slave trade: 10 to 15m Number of slaves who died during the Middle Passage: 2m For every 100 slaves who reached the New World, another 40 died on route Then the congresswoman went on to give a set of equally chilling statistics from today: 1m African Americans are incarcerated Black unemployment stands at 6.6%, more than double the national rate 31% of black children live in poverty, also more than twice the national average \u201cI am not here in anger, I am not seeing to encourage hostilities,\u201d Jackson Lee said. But she added: \u201cThe role of the federal government in supporting the institution of slavery is an injustice that must be formally acknowledged and addressed.\u201d She said that today\u2019s debate was not symbolic. It was the first step towards legislative action that should see her bill, HR 40, move to the floor of the House and the Senate and eventually be signed into law by the US president. Donald Trump has raised nearly $25m for his re-election in less than 24 hours, according to the Republican National Committee. He is also planning to use US military planes fly over the mall for the Fourth of July celebrations, according to the Washington Post: Under the arrangements, Trump would not be on board the presidential Boeing jetliner as it flew overhead, the people familiar with the plans said. The White House, which declined to comment Tuesday, has provided few details on how it plans to change the long-standing celebration of Independence Day in the nation\u2019s capital. The Washington Post reported in May that the president plans to speak on July 4 at the Lincoln Memorial in an event dubbed \u201cSalute to America,\u201d a move that has shifted the National Park Service\u2019s fireworks launch from the reflecting pool area to West Potomac Park. Emily Holden, an environment reporter at the Guardian, has the full story on Donald Trump\u2019s administration finalizing its plans to roll back the US government\u2019s only direct efforts to curb coal-fired power plant pollution that is heating the planet: Joe Goffman, a Harvard professor and former EPA general counsel, called EPA\u2019s legal arguments \u201ctortured\u201d and \u201cdeceptive\u201d. Goffman said the rule \u201cdemonstrates the Trump administration\u2019s determination not only to avoid taking action to address climate change but also to obstruct current and future efforts by states and successors to cut greenhouse gas pollution\u201d. Democratic-led states and environment advocates are expected to challenge the rule in lawsuits. Trump\u2019s agency argues it does not have legal authority to regulate climate change. If the courts agree, future US climate efforts could be in jeopardy. Coal plant air pollution \u2013 from tiny particles that enter the lungs \u2013 cause breathing problems and early deaths. According to an earlier estimate from EPA, the new rule could lead to 1,400 more deaths each year. Coleman Hughes, a columnist at the online magazine Quillette, is now testifying against reparations. \u201cWe\u2019re spending our time debating a bill that mentions slavery only 25 times and incarceration only once,\u201d Hughes says, noting that there are no slaves and more than 2 million black people incarcerated. Hughes said he was encouraged by nearly everyone else he knew not to testify today, because he would anger both Republicans and Democrats. \u201cIf we were to pay reparations today, we would only divide the country further,\u201d Hughes said. He advocates for reparations to people who lived under Jim Crow, but not for descendants of slaves. \u201cPeople who are owed for slavery are no longer here,\u201d Hughes said. At the end of his testimony, he is met with a few boos from the crowd, prompting the committee chair to call on people to be respectful to all those testifying. At the reparations hearing, Ta-Nehisi Coates begins his testimony by quoting senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky who said Tuesday that he opposes reparations, telling reporters: \u201cI don\u2019t want reparations for something that happened 150 years ago.\u201d Coates notes that the families of Civil War veterans received payments well after the war and that the US honors treaties that date back 200 years. \u201cMany of us would love to be taxed for the things we are solely and individually responsible for,\u201d Coates says, noting that is not how the American project works. His testimony is impassioned and directed at McConnell. He lists the myriad, systemic crimes against black people that have happened in McConnell\u2019s lifetime and notes that people impacted would surely \u201clove a word with the majority leader. \u201c Donald Trump\u2019s administration is taking another big step on Wednesday in rolling back the US government\u2019s only direct efforts to curb coal-fired power plant pollution that is heating the planet. Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency will replace an Obama-era climate change rule with a regulation that academic and health experts warn could help some of the oldest, dirtiest coal plants keep running. Obama\u2019s rule, the Clean Power Plan, would have pushed power companies to shift away from coal and toward natural gas and renewable power. Trump\u2019s rule lays out ways states could direct coal plants to increase their efficiency, with hardware fixes or operational changes. Trump\u2019s rule will not significantly address the heat-trapping gases entering the atmosphere and causing more extreme heat waves, floods and other disasters. And it will lead to higher levels of air pollution, compared with the Clean Power Plan. But the Trump administration is defending the change, arguing it is limited by law in how it can regulate the emissions that cause rising temperatures. The Guardian\u2019s chief reporter, Ed Pilkington, is at the Congressional hearing on reparations, which takes place on Juneteenth, the holiday celebrating the emancipation of slaves in the US. I\u2019m in a House judiciary committee room in the Rayburn building in Washington and already the setting is buzzing. The corridor is jam packed with people, overwhelmingly African American, hoping to grab one of the public seats for the first congressional hearing to be held in 12 years on what has become this year\u2019s hot topic \u2013 reparations for slavery. The exceptional turnout for the event which has just started is a sign of passions running high ahead of the 2020 presidential elections in which many of the 23 Democratic candidates have embraced the idea of atoning for America\u2019s original sin. A couple of the presidential candidates are likely to speak too: Cory Booker, the US senator from New Jersey, who has introduced a senate bill calling for the creation of a government commission, is at the hearing, as is Eric Swalwell, a California congressman who is a member of the sub-committee that has called the hearing. I\u2019ve just been speaking to people standing in line in the packed corridor, asking them what they are hoping to hear today. Kenniss Henry, a member of one of the oldest pro-reparations groups, the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, said she was hoping that the hearing would give enough of a push in Congress that the reparations bill, HR 40, would finally get a full debate on the floors of both the House and Senate \u2013 something that has proved elusive for the past 30 years. The most touching comment came from Khalab Blagburn, aged 13. He recently spoke at a debate at his local high school in which he argued all black people in America today and not just the descendants of slaves should be compensated, because the fall-out of slavery had impacted them all. I asked him whether, as a teenager, he was confident he would have a fair chance of realizing his dreams in America when he grows up. He replied: If I work hard and continue to pursue my passions I think I can be successful. But I know I face greater obstacles in the road in front of me than my white school friends. That, in a nutshell, is what today\u2019s historic hearing is all about. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would not censure Donald Trump, a move that is a step down from launching impeachment proceedings. Some Democrats floated censure as an alternative to impeachment because of Pelosi\u2019s firm stance against holding such proceedings. \u201cNo. I think censure is just a way out,\u201d Pelosi told reporters at a breakfast briefing. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna go, you gotta to go. In other words, if the goods are there, you must impeach, and censure is nice, but it is not commensurate with the violations of the Constitution should we decide that\u2019s the way to go.\u201d She said she doesn\u2019t feel pressure from Democratic House members \u201cto do anything.\u201d The crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, should be investigated over the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi because there is \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that he and other senior officials are liable for the killing, according to a UN report published this morning. The 100-page analysis concludes Saudia Arabia is responsible under international human rights law for the extrajudicial killing of Khashoggi at the Istanbul consulate in October 2018. Agnes Callamard, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur, asked the US to make a determination under the US law on the responsibility of the crown prince for Khashoggi\u2019s death. This is complicated for the US because Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has close ties with the crown prince. Hope Hicks, former White House communications director, is the first witness in the House investigation into the Mueller report\u2019s findings on whether President Donald Trump tried to obstruct a probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Hicks is named 184 times in the Mueller report. She arrived at the closed-door hearing about 20 minutes ago and reporters said she ignored questions from reporters. For the first time in a decade, Congress today is holding a hearing on reparations, the idea of providing financial compensation to descendants of the enslaved. Among those testifying today is writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, whose seminal piece for the Atlantic, The Case for Reparations, re-invigorated the push for reparations alongside the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement. Congress will also hold a closed-door hearing with Hope Hicks, the former White House official and Trump campaign official, to discuss Russian interference in the 2016 election. House Judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler said a transcript of the meeting will be made public. Speaking of the Trump campaign, the president held a rally last night to mark the official launch of his re-election bid. The Florida rally contained the president\u2019s usual mix of falsehoods and anger - we\u2019ll have reactions to that later this morning and a recap is here.",

      "bodyText": "Qantas frequent flyer point users will spend less getting economy seats but more getting business and first class upgrades under changes announced on Thursday. In what the airline described as the \u201csingle biggest overhaul\u201d to the frequent flyer point system since it was established, the national airline has rebalanced the scales in favour of the cheap seats. International economy seats will cost up to 10% less in points, effective immediately. But more points will be needed soon to get business class seats \u201cto better reflect the value of this premium experience\u201d. Premium bookings will cost 15% more, and upgrades will cost 9% more. These changes will come into effect on 18 September. Qantas\u2019s chief executive, Alan Joyce, defended the increase: \u201cIt is the first increase in 15 years and the product has improved a lot in that time. We still think this is good value for money.\u201d The complaints from members under the old system were not about point requirements being too high, but about the extra cash fee of the carrier charge, and the lack of availability of seats for busy dates and routes. Joyce said this was what the changes targeted. Qantas is also cutting the cash payment you have to pay when booking a flight using points \u2013 known as the carrier charges \u2013 by up to 50%. This would save an average $200 in cash for an international flight, modelling shows. For example, an economy flight from Melbourne to Los Angeles previously would have required 90,000 points and $513. Now it will cost 83,800 points and $393. But premium economy on the same flight will cost 18,600 points extra. That flight used to cost 144,000 points and $793. From September it will cost 162,600 points and $603. Business class from Melbourne to LA used to cost 192,000 points and $943. Under the changes it will cost 216,800 points and $703. The chief executive of the loyalty program, Olivia Worth, said the 18,600 increase was still in reach of average \u201cbronze and silver flyers\u201d. \u201cMany of our members are in the high hundreds of thousands, so these flights are very attainable for them,\u201d she said. Qantas\u2019s frequent-flyer program has 12.7 million members and it processes four redemption flights and one upgrade a minute. Thirty-six per cent of all credit card expenditure is on a Qantas-branded or affiliated card. Joyce said the changes would cost the airline $25m a year. There will be also more options to book economy seats using points, with more seats available and across more routes, by partnering with new airlines. \u201cMore seats, fewer fees and better value,\u201d Joyce said. The airline will also launch a new system, Points Club, that gives membership based solely on points earned \u201con the ground\u201d through purchases. This would be for people who earn points when \u201cthey shop at Woolworths or go see a movie at Hoyts\u201d rather than flying, Olivia Wirth said. Currently 70% of frequent flyer points are earned through purchases and bookings, Joyce said, rather than flying. The airline will also introduce \u201clifetime platinum\u201d, reached when a person accrues 75,000 status credits. Wirth said this would take roughly two decades of flying at platinum one, but it was \u201caspirational\u201d and a \u201chigh bar\u201d.",

In reality the flowing, fluid front-third movement that the Matildas launched against the world\u2019s best team pre-tournament, turning them inside out time and time again, has not been evident in France so far. Australia\u2019s chief attacking threat against Jamaica came from crosses from deep \u2013 but even with Sam Kerr\u2019s prodigious aerial talent this won\u2019t be nearly as effective against disciplined, compact, well-organised defences.

Not a natural No 6, Emily van Egmond has played well when afforded space and time, but when pressed has been guilty of cheap turnovers \u2013 as have many of her midfield colleagues \u2013 a point highlighted by Milicic due to the poor selection of passes from the back third into congested areas. It\u2019s an area of the field crying out for the team\u2019s most natural holder, Elise Kellond-Knight, who has seen limited minutes in recent months amid niggling fitness concerns. At the back, across three Group C games, Australia have started with three different left-backs. Given the shortage centrally following the withdrawal of Laura Alleway and injury to Clare Polkinghorne, the team\u2019s most experienced left-back Steph Catley is needed centrally. And Kellond-Knight, who started there against Brazil is also sorely needed in midfield. It could mean another baptism of fire for young Karly Roestbakken \u2013 only called into squad a fortnight ago and having seen just one minute in the national shirt before being handed her starting debut against Jamaica. If Australia have impressed in patches in all three games so far, now that they\u2019ve arrived at the knockout stage of the tournament nothing but a complete performance \u2013 in defence, in midfield, in attack \u2013 will be enough against Norway on Saturday evening. It is a challenge that is as much mental as technical. \u201cAt times we need to realise we don\u2019t have to score from every attack,\u201d said Milicic. \u201cWe need to keep it, go on one side, come back out and go the other way and be patient.
