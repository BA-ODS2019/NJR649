      "bodyText": "A millionaire businessman has been granted a secrecy order preventing the disclosure of his identity over allegations of sexual harassment, assault and bullying in an employment case, it has been reported. In the latest case of controversy over non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), the Times reported that it was not allowed to identify a man who had agreed financial settlements with two women before their accusations were scheduled to be heard at an employment tribunal. The settlement reportedly required the two alleged victims to withdraw their sexual harassment and discrimination claims and sign NDAs prohibiting them from discussing their allegations in public. The newspaper said it had fought a legal battle for more than a year for the right to report the case but Mr Justice Soole, sitting at the employment appeal tribunal, ruled last month the protection of the millionaire\u2019s \u201chonour and reputation\u201d took precedence over the principle of open justice. The judge said the case involved \u201callegations of sexual offences\u201d against \u201ca public figure with a well-known family name\u201d, which are \u201centirely denied\u201d, the Times reported, with Soole arguing that the public might not be able to \u201cdistinguish between allegation and proof\u201d and that publication of the name would have \u201cpersonal consequences\u201d. It comes amid controversy over the use of NDAs by the rich and powerful, such as celebrities and tycoons. The Commons women and equalities committee recently called for radical reform of NDAs to end the \u201ccover-up culture and employment tribunal failures\u201d. The MPs\u2019 report said: \u201cEmployers and their legal advisers should not be complicit in using NDAs to cover up allegations of unlawful acts.\u201d The use of similar gagging orders by the film producer Harvey Weinstein following allegations of sexual harassment and assault emerged as part of the 2017 revelations that sparked the #MeToo movement. Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. In May it was reported that the American producer reached a $44m settlement to resolve several lawsuits and compensate women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, according to reports. Last October ministers brought forward a consultation on the use of NDAs in employment disputes after the Daily Telegraph was prevented by a temporary court injunction from naming a businessman accused of paying off employees who had accused him of bullying, sexual harassment and racial abuse. Theresa May told the Commons it was important the government tightened up the use of NDAs, saying \u201cit is clear that some employers are using them unethically\u201d. The businessman was later named as Sir Philip Green, who has denied the claims made against him.",

      "bodyText": "The South Australian Labor party has pledged to introduce a state-based version of the Uluru statement, including establishing a representative body to act as a voice to parliament, if it wins the next election. The proposal has been welcomed by Aboriginal leaders who say they are not prepared to abandon the resolutions of the 2017 First Nations National Constitutional Convention at Uluru despite a lack of support from the federal government. Opposition leader Peter Malinauskas told Guardian Australia that the policy reaffirmed SA Labor\u2019s support for negotiating with Aboriginal nations, a process that began in February 2017 but was halted when the Marshall Liberal government was elected just over a year later. \u201cEnacting a state-based version of the Uluru Statement from the Heart is an opportunity for Aboriginal South Australians to finally have their aspirations realised,\u201d Malinauskas said. The Uluru Statement from the Heart called for a constitutionally-enshrined Indigenous voice to federal parliament and the establishment of a Makarrata Commission to undertake a process of truth-telling about Australian history, and oversee a process of treaty-making. Malinauskas made the announcement ahead of Naidoc week, which begins on Sunday and this year has the theme \u201cVoice. Treaty. Truth.\u201d He said Labor would convene an Aboriginal working group to design the proposed voice to state parliament, with the model to be taken to the 2022 state election. Elections for the First Peoples Assembly of Victoria, an elected body of 33-representatives that will negotiate the framework for the treaty with the Victorian government, will be held in September, with enrolment open now to all Victorian traditional owners, whether they live in the state or not, and to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who have lived in Victoria for at least five years. The federal government oppose the Indigenous voice to parliament, which former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull dismissed as \u201cundesirable\u201d and a \u201cthird chamber of parliament\u201d. Delegates from Uluru say that is not how they described or intended the proposal. Federal Labor promised to hold a referendum on the Uluru statement, but lost the federal election in May. SA opposition Aboriginal affairs spokesman Kyam Maher said that failure to implement the Uluru Statement would be unacceptable. \u201cIt is evident the status quo is not working,\u201d Maher said. \u201cThe gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people is widening in almost every tangible measurement. \u201cThe time has come to stop telling Aboriginal South Australians, from the heights of the State Administration Centre, what is right for them.\u201d SA premier Steven Marshall, who has given himself responsibility for Aboriginal affairs and reconciliation, has continued negotiations with some Aboriginal nations around agreements for better service delivery but will not progress those agreements to treaties. Narungga elder professor Peter Buckskin said he hoped Labor\u2019s policy would receive bipartisan support. \u201cI would like to see all of the Uluru statement implemented,\u201d Buckskin told Guardian Australia. \u201cIf we are ever going to achieve true reconciliation we have got to actually have a process for the truth telling in this state.\u201d Buckskin said his people were currently working toward an agreement with the Marshall government despite the formal halt to treaty talks, with Marshall himself visiting Narungga land to meet with elders. \u201cIt\u2019s not called a treaty like Labor would have called it but it\u2019s still moving forward and building on a stronger, more responsive relationship with government in terms of delivering on agreed outcomes,\u201d he said. Adnyamathanha elder Vince Coulthard said his people were also in discussions with the Marshall government with a view to striking an agreement. \u201cBut that\u2019s all treaties are, an agreement between two or more parties,\u201d he said. He said Labor\u2019s policy was \u201ca great idea\u201d but warned that First Nations people in South Australia would not accept lip service toward implementing the Uluru statement. \u201cIf they are serious about it, it can happen and it can be a good thing,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>It started with a mundane observation, but one made possible by years of being attentive to, studying and writing about human-animal domestication relationships.</p> \n<p>I was walking my dogs to a park not far from my house. To do so, I have to cross the main road. On the other side was a man who had his dog on a leash. My dogs are trained to stop at the pedestrian red light without needing a leash. The green light appears with a rattling noise that they recognise as a sign to get ready. I say \u201cGo!\u201d as an extra prompt and they cross. When this happens, I not only believe that unlike many others I don\u2019t need a leash, I also feel superior to them.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/20/indigenous-deaths-in-custody-report-largely-worthless-academics-say\">Indigenous deaths in custody report 'largely worthless', academics say</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That day, things were no different. I looked at the man and his leashed dog coming towards me and immediately felt that sense of superiority. But for the first time, I started thinking about the significance of that feeling: Why on earth? \u201cYou\u2019re so ridiculous,\u201d I told myself. Nevertheless, it was still a pleasing sensation to realise I was in full control of my dogs without the need for physical restraints. </p> \n<p>From almost out of nowhere, the words <em>Regarde! Sans mains!</em> popped into my consciousness. Here I was \u2013 a kid riding my bike \u201cwith no hands\u201d for the first time, and screaming for my friend to watch me. My unconscious mind was inviting me to make a link between the two situations. The lines from a French-Belgian song from the early 90s intrude into the mental mix: <em>le bonheur c\u2019est comme faire/ du v\u00e9lo sans les mains </em>(Happiness is like riding / your bike with no hands).</p> \n<p>My mind was racing: what was it about dominating your surrounding without using your hands that made it so enjoyable? Was I touching a dimension that was the essence of power and control? I started thinking of the unlimited, mundane, everyday joy the remote control device has brought into our lives. Despite being scientifically explainable, does not the sentiment of power generated by the remote control to affect things at a distance have its genealogy in the sentiments generated by the practices of magic and voodoo? I curse you and you develop a fever. I put a pin in this doll and I paralyse your arm. <em>Regarde! Sans mains!</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ca525fa2-24e4-46ce-bd43-efcd3733223b\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Guardian Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/28/national-shame-147-indigenous-people-die-in-custody-in-australia-in-a-decade\">investigation into 10 years of deaths in custody cases</a> found serious systemic failings:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>407 Indigenous people have died since the end of a royal commission that outlined ways to prevent Indigenous deaths in custody almost 30 years ago.</li>\n     <li>Indigenous people are dying in custody from treatable medical conditions and are much less likely than non-Indigenous people to receive the care they need.</li>\n     <li>Agencies such as police watch-houses, prisons and hospitals failed to follow all of their own procedures in 34% of cases where Indigenous people died, compared with 21% of cases for non-Indigenous people.</li>\n     <li>Mental health or cognitive impairment was a factor in 41% of all deaths in custody.

It is certainly at the heart of our most common understanding of domestication as a mode of dominating other natural species. Unlike \u201ccapturing\u201d, which needs visible restraints such as cages, and \u201ctaming\u201d, which involves easing an individual of a species from a state of being caged to coming under human control without a cage, \u201cdomesticating\u201d involves species reproducing themselves as always being ready to accept the state of domination they are born into without being caged: <em>sans mains!</em></p> \n<p>So what is it about this proliferation of cages and the process of caging in inter-human relations today, such as the rise in incarceration, the caging of refugees, building walls to mark borders, gated communities and so on? If invisible domination is a sign of strength, is this proliferation of visible cages a sign of weakness? A sign that the invisible modes of domination that kept the dominant in power and made the dominated \u201cknow their place\u201d are no longer working? That the dominant have lost all legitimacy, and need more and more hands-on modes of control to maintain their rule? If so, this can only be a hopeful sign of the decline of the powerful.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/13/who-is-accountable-for-our-deaths\">Who is accountable for our deaths? | Latoya Aroha Rule</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There is, however, a more sinister explanation and it is probable that the two go hand in hand. One of the earliest design problems in the history of caging presented itself in bird cages, and had to do with the over-visibility of the cage. Birds in highly visible cages, where the bars were too thick, for instance, kept trying to break free by flying straight into them, and ended up hurting themselves and dying. Technically then, the history of refining cages is one of creating something strong enough to ensure the encaged does not break free, while also ensuring that this search for strength does not result in a more \u201cin your face\u201d over-visibility that creates a highly claustrophobic feeling of \u201cencagement\u201d in the encaged.</p> \n<p>This technical problem is very old: if you want the caged to live as healthy a life as possible in their cages, you aim to avoid such over-visibility. If you don\u2019t care about them experiencing such claustrophobia as a result of over-visibility, it means you have no interest in them staying alive. When the caged die, it cannot be a case of \u201cOops, we didn\u2019t know\u201d.</p> \n<p>Those who erect such death-inducing cages have to assume responsibility for the resulting loss of life. Today, as we witness Aboriginal deaths in custody, asylum seekers immolating themselves for finding their caging intolerable, people dying while trying to break free from claustrophobic national borders behind which they are kept against their will, we also face the fact that the caging of mainly black and brown people has become a racist technique of extermination. Those responsible for legitimising and deploying such a technique need to be held accountable for the impact of their actions.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>This is an edited extract of a keynote address presented at this week\u2019s Technologies of Bordering conference at the University of Melbourne.</p></li> \n <li><p>Ghassan Hage is a professor of anthropology and social theory at the University of Melbourne</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p><br> </p>",

      "bodyText": "It started with a mundane observation, but one made possible by years of being attentive to, studying and writing about human-animal domestication relationships. I was walking my dogs to a park not far from my house. To do so, I have to cross the main road. On the other side was a man who had his dog on a leash. My dogs are trained to stop at the pedestrian red light without needing a leash. The green light appears with a rattling noise that they recognise as a sign to get ready. I say \u201cGo!\u201d as an extra prompt and they cross. When this happens, I not only believe that unlike many others I don\u2019t need a leash, I also feel superior to them. That day, things were no different. I looked at the man and his leashed dog coming towards me and immediately felt that sense of superiority. But for the first time, I started thinking about the significance of that feeling: Why on earth? \u201cYou\u2019re so ridiculous,\u201d I told myself. Nevertheless, it was still a pleasing sensation to realise I was in full control of my dogs without the need for physical restraints. From almost out of nowhere, the words Regarde! Sans mains! popped into my consciousness. Here I was \u2013 a kid riding my bike \u201cwith no hands\u201d for the first time, and screaming for my friend to watch me. My unconscious mind was inviting me to make a link between the two situations. The lines from a French-Belgian song from the early 90s intrude into the mental mix: le bonheur c\u2019est comme faire/ du v\u00e9lo sans les mains (Happiness is like riding / your bike with no hands). My mind was racing: what was it about dominating your surrounding without using your hands that made it so enjoyable? Was I touching a dimension that was the essence of power and control? I started thinking of the unlimited, mundane, everyday joy the remote control device has brought into our lives. Despite being scientifically explainable, does not the sentiment of power generated by the remote control to affect things at a distance have its genealogy in the sentiments generated by the practices of magic and voodoo? I curse you and you develop a fever. I put a pin in this doll and I paralyse your arm. Regarde! Sans mains! The more I thought about and researched this, the more I became convinced that the idea of a domination that does not require excessively visible physical restraint was a dimension of all fantasies of domination. It is certainly at the heart of our most common understanding of domestication as a mode of dominating other natural species. Unlike \u201ccapturing\u201d, which needs visible restraints such as cages, and \u201ctaming\u201d, which involves easing an individual of a species from a state of being caged to coming under human control without a cage, \u201cdomesticating\u201d involves species reproducing themselves as always being ready to accept the state of domination they are born into without being caged: sans mains! So what is it about this proliferation of cages and the process of caging in inter-human relations today, such as the rise in incarceration, the caging of refugees, building walls to mark borders, gated communities and so on? If invisible domination is a sign of strength, is this proliferation of visible cages a sign of weakness? A sign that the invisible modes of domination that kept the dominant in power and made the dominated \u201cknow their place\u201d are no longer working? That the dominant have lost all legitimacy, and need more and more hands-on modes of control to maintain their rule? If so, this can only be a hopeful sign of the decline of the powerful. There is, however, a more sinister explanation and it is probable that the two go hand in hand. One of the earliest design problems in the history of caging presented itself in bird cages, and had to do with the over-visibility of the cage. Birds in highly visible cages, where the bars were too thick, for instance, kept trying to break free by flying straight into them, and ended up hurting themselves and dying. Technically then, the history of refining cages is one of creating something strong enough to ensure the encaged does not break free, while also ensuring that this search for strength does not result in a more \u201cin your face\u201d over-visibility that creates a highly claustrophobic feeling of \u201cencagement\u201d in the encaged. This technical problem is very old: if you want the caged to live as healthy a life as possible in their cages, you aim to avoid such over-visibility. If you don\u2019t care about them experiencing such claustrophobia as a result of over-visibility, it means you have no interest in them staying alive. When the caged die, it cannot be a case of \u201cOops, we didn\u2019t know\u201d. Those who erect such death-inducing cages have to assume responsibility for the resulting loss of life. Today, as we witness Aboriginal deaths in custody, asylum seekers immolating themselves for finding their caging intolerable, people dying while trying to break free from claustrophobic national borders behind which they are kept against their will, we also face the fact that the caging of mainly black and brown people has become a racist technique of extermination. Those responsible for legitimising and deploying such a technique need to be held accountable for the impact of their actions.

At the 104th RSL Victoria state conference in Melbourne, there was a heated generational showdown between the the league\u2019s top brass \u2013 predominately ex-Vietnam servicemen \u2013 and younger veterans who served in Iraq, Afghanistan and East Timor. A day after Woolworths announced it was offloading its pokies and pubs business, the RSL leadership faced questions about the merits of gambling revenue as a way to fund veterans\u2019 welfare services. Former army captain Dave Petersen, who served in Afghanistan, seized on the recent moves by Woolworths, Coles and some Victorian AFL clubs to quit the pokies business. \u201cMaybe we could speak to Geelong Football Club to figure out how they divested from poker machines instead of buying poker machines off them,\u201d Petersen said. The North Melbourne Kangaroos pulled out of pokies in 2008, and the Melbourne Demons have vowed to do the same by 2022. The Geelong Cats and the Western Bulldogs have also signalled that they are getting out of the business and Collingwood Magpies sold two pokies venues last year. The RSL Victoria state president, Robert Webster, said there had been significant debate on the matter at an executive level. He said RSL Victoria\u2019s 52 gaming sub-branches produced $11m a year towards welfare services compared with $6.8m from fundraising appeals. Webster acknowledged the need to move away from gaming because revenue from it was declining. He said the organisation was looking to diversify its income stream but declined to make a specific commitment to divesting. \u201cAt the moment, they are providing money that we don\u2019t have, to help veterans,\u201d he said.

The 52 RSL sub-branches that have gaming operations are contracted to continue them until at least 2032, the league said in a statement. Lucas Moon, a young veteran in the group pushing for reform, was upset that RSL Victoria had scuttled a proposed veterans hub at a site in Collingwood, after being offered 100-year peppercorn rent from a local council. The proposed hub included employment, health, psychological, legal and social inclusion services. The state conference was told that no independent feasibility study or business case had been prepared before the management knocked the idea on the head and pulled out of the expression-of-interest process.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s midwinter in the South Island city of Dunedin but the sun is high and the thermostat has just pushed past 10C. Settled by the Scots and known as \u201cthe Edinburgh of the south\u201d, Dunedin has long had a reputation in New Zealand as the country\u2019s avant garde student haven, a gritty post-industrial city now home to artists, musicians, academics and more than a handful of eccentrics. Odd is acceptable in Dunedin \u2013 applauded, even. The small city of 120,000 sprawls around the pristine Otago peninsula, which hosts significant threatened populations of sea lions, penguins, seals and rare birds, including the world\u2019s only mainland albatross colony. Cars and trucks routinely stop for wildlife crossing the city\u2019s main thoroughfares, while a gothic city aesthetic contrasts with the golden beaches, sheep-dotted paddocks and bucolic harbour views. No one\u2019s ever in much of a rush in Dunedin, and locals have time to give in spades. Expect to be invited to join communal tables of strangers if you turn up at the local pub and people don\u2019t know your face. Locals will probably want to buy you a drink too and hear your story. Food and drink Locals enjoy the sunshine at the Esplanade on the St Clair beachfront, a favourite for casual, flavourful Italian dining. When we visit, we order large glasses of sauvignon blanc, a capricciosa pizza and steaming bowls of Italian pork sausage pasta. With uninterrupted sea views of the Pacific Ocean, a classy yet relaxed interior and reliably delicious food, the Esplanade is always packed, buzzy and good fun. Up on M\u0101ori Hill, the neighbourhood bistro No 7 Balmac has just reopened with a new, Middle Eastern-influenced menu. Specialising in wood-fired cooking and local produce, the food here is perfection. We start with octopus skewers in turmeric oil and coriander, and local clams in spicy \u2019nduja butter with a carafe of house red, followed by confit duck leg, tender wild venison and pork belly that is so more-ish we order seconds. A favourite with Dunedin locals for special occasions, No 7 also has great bar seating and an extensive wine and cocktail list. Glenfalloch Garden is a 10-minute drive out of town on the Otago peninsula and, despite it being the middle of winter, the 30-acre garden is already blooming with early rhododendrons, pink camellias and late, lilac hydrangeas. My friend and I have no plans for the afternoon so we settle in and order the popular \u201ctrust the chef\u201d degustation menu. This four-course feast makes extensive use of local, organic and seasonal produce and is cooked with finesse by the German chef, Hannes Bareiter. Three hours pass before we call it a day then take a meandering stroll through the gardens. This is a must for a luxurious weekend lunch or dinner. Music and nightlife The city is the home of the Dunedin sound; a fervent period of musical innovation in the 1980s which produced the locus of the emerging New Zealand punk and post-punk scene. The Verlaines, the Clean, Straightjacket Fits and the Chills all started off in Dunedin, and the city\u2019s musical roots continue to produce and nurture artists today. A night out at a live gig is almost obligatory in Dunedin, but ease into it with a pint of local Emerson\u2019s beer at Albar or Dog with Two Tails, before heading to the Cook in the student quarter of town for whatever gig is on. The Cook\u2019s publican, Mike McLeod, is a musician himself and reliably scoops up the best bands. Post-gig, if you have the stamina, you could continue on to the Crown for another gig and a round of pool. Otherwise head back into the city for a nightcap at Pequeno, a darkly lit wine bar with a roaring fire and a snug, late-night vibe. To enjoy the city\u2019s well-established hipster scene, drop into the New New New brewery on a Friday night for a pint and snacks from one of the food trucks parked out front. Activities Dunedin\u2019s wildlife and beaches are unforgettable \u2013 and no visit would be complete without a brisk walk along Allans beach, Long beach, Sandfly Bay or Blackhead. Depending on the season and weather conditions, you can expect to see wildlife roaming free in these areas. Head up to the Orokonui wildlife sanctuary above Port Chalmers to catch a rare glimpse of New Zealand\u2019s vulnerable native bird population, and expect to see k\u0101k\u0101, takah\u0113 and bellbirds in their natural habitat. World-famous albatross can be viewed at the Royal Albatross Centre or from the Monarch, an elegant wooden boat that meanders up and down the harbour. A southern skies stargazing tour will give you goosebumps of delight and, in the right conditions, the aurora australis may be visible. As a university town and a Unesco city of literature, Dunedin has a thriving secondhand book scene. Check out Dead Souls Books, Scribes and Hard to Find, or head to UBS for new reads. The staff are well-read and can be trusted for excellent recommendations. Dunedin is New Zealand\u2019s oldest city and boasts a rich architectural history, including the country\u2019s best collection of Edwardian baroque-style buildings. A ghost tour of Larnarch Castle will raise the hairs on the back of your neck, and guests can stay overnight at the castle\u2019s lodge to complete the experience. (I was visited by a ghost. Really.) A tour of the genteel Olveston House evokes Dunedin\u2019s time as the commercial and social capital of gold-rush New Zealand, when money poured into the port city from the central Otago goldfields. A stroll down the once industrial, now increasingly edgy Vogel Street showcases the city\u2019s austere beauty. It\u2019s also an excellent place for coffee aficionados to begin their morning. Check out Heritage, Good Good and Wolf at the Door. Stay For a modern edge and creature comforts, try the four-star Distinction hotel.

The new head coach is conscious of the limitations that have been placed on Chelsea by Fifa\u2019s transfer ban, which could extend to 2020, and has told the players he has inherited that they start with a clean slate. \u201cEverybody will have the opportunity to show what they can do and [demonstrate] their attitude, the way they play and train in pre-season onwards,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be a fool to come here with ideas about freezing anybody out. I want to get the best out of the squad. Everybody has an opportunity, I have no preconceived ideas about anybody. I have got good knowledge of the squad but I need to see them over the next month.\u201d Drinkwater is one of only five Chelsea players whom Uefa deems to qualify as homegrown for the Champions League. Another of those, England\u2019s Ruben Loftus-Cheek, is in long-term rehabilitation after rupturing an achilles tendon in May. Charly Musonda has returned to Vitesse Arnhem on loan but Morata, once the record signing, appears to have played his last game for Chelsea having reported back for pre-season training at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. The Spanish club are expected to submit a bid of around \u00a350m to secure the Spain striker on a permanent basis, allaying fears Chelsea could trigger a recall clause written into the 26-year-old\u2019s 18-month loan deal agreed in January. The London club opted against signing Gonzalo Higua\u00edn from Juventus, a decision which left them with a senior strike-force of Olivier Giroud, Tammy Abraham and Batshuayi. However, Morata, who scored six goals for Atl\u00e9tico in the second half of the season, has made clear his preference is to remain in Spain and Chelsea expect the Spanish club to sign him.",

For the next three years they prepared for the 1999 World Cup, which the USA was hosting, by going on the road to drum up support, meeting fans, hosting open training sessions and attracting publicity for the women\u2019s game. Their relentless drive paid off, culminating in a penalty shootout win over China in front of a crowd of 90,000 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. The famous image of Brandi Chastain\u2019s shirt-waving celebration brought women\u2019s football to the attention of the world. But that USA team, dubbed the \u201899ers, kept striving. They leveraged their fame into setting up the first-ever professional women\u2019s football league in the world, the WUSA. The best players in the world, such as China\u2019s Sun Wen and England\u2019s Kelly Smith, came to play. When the league was about to fold a few years later, it was the \u201899ers who took a pay cut to try and keep it alive. The US women\u2019s players, with their endeavor and generosity, pretty much single-handedly carved out the professional game from nothing. The success of the current league, the seven-year-old NWSL, is still intertwined with the success of the US women\u2019s team; every member of the current squad plays in the league. It has survived on their victories, a total of four Olympic gold medal wins and three World Cups to date, including the most recent, in 2015. Yet if this World Cup has showed anything, it\u2019s that Europe is catching up, as traditional powers in the men\u2019s game put their weight behind their women\u2019s teams. The Netherlands have made it to their first World Cup final on the strength of performances from Arsenal\u2019s Vivianne Miedema and Barcelona\u2019s Lieke Martens. \u201cI think this could be a tipping point, unfortunately,\u201d says Wyant. \u201cFor the US, it should motivate us to think about our women\u2019s professional league, about how we\u2019re going to keep these women playing after college in a very competitive environment. Because when I think about teams in England and Spain, they can invest in these players from a very young age and it could make a big difference moving forward as to how it shakes up the world power structure.\u201d Much has been made of the US team\u2019s attitude throughout this World Cup: the so-called arrogance, the pointed celebrations. But to label this team, or any women\u2019s team, as arrogant is to misunderstand women\u2019s sports entirely and the daily struggle for recognition and recompense. Still paid according to an archaic Fifa bonus structure that seriously undervalues the women\u2019s game, the US women\u2019s team is engaged in a federal lawsuit with US Soccer to demand equal pay with their counterparts on the men\u2019s team. These are players who believe that women\u2019s rights are human rights and that equality is achievable and worth fighting for. This is a team for our time. So, if the sovereigns of women\u2019s soccer are to be deposed in years to come, may their reign end in scenes of triumph.",

Your prize? This match, of course! It\u2019s got the makings of a corker. Uganda have been one of the most entertaining teams in the tournament so far and, having achieved their ambition of reaching the knockout stages for the first time since 1978, will throw themselves at star-studded Senegal without fear. Not that they showed any inhibitions in their group games, when, after trouncing DR Congo, they came mighty close to shocking hosts Egypt on their own turf. </p> <p> In fact, perhaps the Senegalese are the ones with the complex? That, at least, is what Kenya\u2019s manager, S\u00e9basiten Mign\u00e9, offered before their last match by way of explanation for the Teranga Lions\u2019 failure to ever win a continental title. Mign\u00e9 would probably have been better off keeping his thoughts to himself because his jabs succeeded only in provoking the Senegalese into drubbing Kenya. Today they\u2019ll be looking to carry on where they left off, which means a humdinger could be brewing. </p> <p> One of the most pleasing aspects of this tournament so far has been the way relatively unheralded players have matched \u2013 or even outshone \u2013 some of the brightest stars. So while Senegal will today field one of the world\u2019s best forwards (Sadio Man\u00e9) and best defenders (Kalidou Koulibaby), the Cranes can point to several players whose claims for a place in a Tournament XI So Far would be at least as strong, such as the forwards Emmanuel Okwi (who plays his club football for Simba in Tanzania) and Patrick Kaddu (Kampala CCC), centreback Hassan Wasswa (El Geisha, Egypt) and, most of all, slinky midfielder Farouk Miya (HNK Gornica, Croatia). Add in a fine goalkeeper, Dennis Onyango (Mamelodi Sundowns), the buccaneering Abdu Lumala (Kalmar FC, Sweden) and defender Godfrey Walusimbi (currently without a club!), and there\u2019s ample to reason to believe Senegal are going to have to demonstrate their class to come out on top here. This could be a treat. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-05T18:16:18.975Z\">at 7.16pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s first-half goal is enough to send Senegal into a quarter-final meeting with Benin. Man\u00e9 also had a penalty saved by Onyango in the second half but that never really looked like mattering, as Uganda, so thrilling in the group stages, could not summon the ingenuity needed to penetrate Aliou Cisse\u2019s solid, conservative side. 90+2 min: Peep! Peep! Peep! No, not the final whistle, just a description of a period of non-play littered with freekicks. 90 min: Uganda have three more minutes to find the inspiration that has so far eluded them. 87 min: Senegal file back and defend en masse. Uganda can\u2019t break through and are soon dispossessed. Senegal are grinding their way to the quarter-finals ... 85 min: Bald\u00e9 seeks to make an immediate impact with a searing run through the middle, then a dainty through-ball for Man\u00e9 ... who treads on it! Senegal substitutions: Bald\u00e9 and Diagne on, Niang and Sarr off 82 min: \u201cGee willikers, Paul, a lot of yellow cards in this game but arguably the most crucial one, the second against Uganda\u2019s keeper, was not given,\u201d chirps Scott Bassett. \u201cSenegal should be further out front and it has the feel of one of those games where Uganda could get a goal and be right back in it. I sense little or no urgency from Senegal here. Hard to figure out.\u201d Aye, as I said, they may find themselves ruing their conservatism. I\u2019m certainly lamenting it. 80 min: Another long-range freekick for Uganda. Will they try another improbable shot or come up with something more inventive? They go for the former. It\u2019s a useful effort by Kateregga but Gomis gets both hands to it and pushes it to safety. 79 min: Uganda are still plugging away, mainly down the flanks. Senegal are looking a little edgy... Uganda substitution: Kateregga on, Aucho off 77 min: A cute through-ball by Sabaly finds Diatta, who pulls it back towards Niang from the byline. But Awany steps in to put an end to the attack. 76 min: Wasulimbi does well to dispossess Sarr as the winger tried to go on a run down the right. 74 min: Sarr and Niang have had remarkably little impact so far. 72 min: Azira blems a daisy-cutter several yards wide from long range. 70 min: Koulibaly booked for a dicey sliding tackle on Okwi. He won the ball. Senegal substitution: Diatta on, Saivet on. The youngster has the ability to knit things together nicely in midfield. Senegal need to find more fluency. They could also do with more urgency and enterprise. 67 min: Dinky interplay by Aucho and Miya in midfield. Lumala makes a smart dash forward in the hope of being supplied with a through-ball. Miya tries to oblige but it\u2019s fractionally off. 65 min: Aucho makes a mess of his clearance, sending it out for a corner rather than in the other direction. But Awany heads the setpiece away near the penalty spot. 63 min: Lumala, who has been Uganda\u2019s best attacker (along with Okwi, in fairness) wins a corner down the right. Miya\u2019s delivery is flicked on at the near post, provoking panic in the Senegalese box. That is relieved, eventually, by an offside decision. Having been reprieved by a hitherto severe referee, Onyango flings himself to his left to push away the penalty! That\u2019s the second spotkick Man\u00e9 has missed in this tournament. As I was saying... Uganda\u2019s attempt to play out from the back was foiled by a canny press by Senegal. Onyango charged off his line and threw himself recklessly at Man\u00e9, who shifted the ball wide of him and got clobbered. It\u2019s stonewall penalty, and the keeper is extremely lucky not to get a second yellow card. 58 min: Senegal are supremely confident in their ability to keep Uganda at bay but you can\u2019t help thinking they may regret that: they are a little too conservative here, I reckon. They\u2019re well capable of scoring again and again if they go for it. Uganda substitution: Kyambadde on, Kaddu off. 55 min: Gomes jogs off his line to claim a hopeful pass into the Senegalese box. 52 min: Niang gives away a freekick with a wild sliding tackle on Azira, who goes down, but not holding his face. 51 min: Niang seems to have developed an unusual tic whereby often when he is tackled he goes down holding his face. 50 min: Gueye gives the ball away and then fouls Owki in his eagerness to get it back. That gives Uganda a freekick about 25 yards out. It\u2019s central. A trio of Cranes discusses what to do while Senegal build a wall. Miya goes for a shot. He curls it over the wall, but over the bar, too. 48 min: It\u2019s been a scrappy start to the second half. Man\u00e9 gets a little kick in the calves from Mugabi. No call for Yeovil Town players bringing dirty stuff to Afcon matches... 46 min: Off we go again. No personnel changes during the break. Benin\u2019s victory against Morocco today seems to have gone down well back home ... Some news for fans of African football: Huddersfield have loaned Ramadan Sobhi to Al Ahly for the 2019-20 season. It hasn\u2019t been the humdinger we hoped for, but it\u2019s been acceptable. Uganda will be kicking themselves with the way they helped Senegal take the lead, giving the ball away in midfield before Sadio Man\u00e9 finished tidily. Since then Senegal have been quite conservative, apparently feeling little need to take risks, especially with three Ugandans on yellow cards and the referee looking like he might dish out a few more. It\u2019s up to Uganda to change something here. Expect to see Allan Kyambadde, a speedy agent of chaos, some time soon. 45+2 min: Gassama goes down as if clattered, but the replays do not suggest Okwi is guilty of anything untoward. A little surprisingly, the ref doesn\u2019t think so either, so no card for Okwi. 45 min: There will be only two minutes of additional time. Apparently the referee is not as fastidious about time-keeping as he is about physical contact. 43 min: A snapshot by Okwi from 20 yards brings an awkward save from Gomis. It wasn\u2019t the most convincing piece of goalkeeping and may encourage Uganda to try from distance again. 41 min: Miya sends the freekick towards the back post. Gomis tips it out for a corner. But none of the officials spotted that touch and have awarded a goalkick instead. 39 min: Sabaly bodychecks Lumala to concede a freekick near the right-hand corner of his own box. Lumala requires treatment before it can be taken because he took the force of the full-backs shoulder in his face. 37 min: Gueye canters down the left before hoisting up a high cross to the back post. Sarr jumps well but can\u2019t guide his header on to the target. 35 min: For the second time in the game Onyango charges out of his box to challenge Niang. This time he stays on his feet and pokes the ball away from the attacker as he tries to go around him! A corner is all it costs his team in the end. But the corner should have produced a goal! Instead Koulibaly made a mess of a clear header from 10 yards. Most uncharacteristic of him. 33 min: The Cranes are becoming vexed at being penalised nearly every time they go in for a tackle, especially as some of Senegal\u2019s players appear to be playing to the referees\u2019 austere approach to officiating. Also, and as previously mentioned, the Squirrels are on the march. Read all about it. 31 min: Aucho becomes the latest name in the fussy ref\u2019s book for clunking into Niang from behind. Saivet takes the freekick, mid-way inside the Ugandan half, a little to the right. Ugand defend it well. 29 min: Corner to Uganda from the right. Miya with the outswinger. Okwi leaps above Gassama and sends a header just wide from eight yards! 26 min: Uganda have steadied themselves to an extent and are having a fair bit of possession, with which they are typically enterprising. But Senegal still look far sharper when they move forward. 24 min: Ndiaye overhits a crossfield pass. Gassama had made a good run into space down the right but wasn\u2019t able to get on the end of a poor delivery. 23 min: Miya\u2019s cross from the right is headed to the edge of the area. Okwi collects and then fires a powerful, swirling shot at goal from 18 yards. Gomis bats it away with one hand! 21 min: Mugabi and Lumala are looking like Uganda\u2019s best hopes at the moment. Another attack led by them down the right has yielded a corner. It\u2019s delivered to Aucho beyond the back post. Rather than go for a header, he tries to take it down on his chest with a view to unleashing a blaster with his left foot. But he doesn\u2019t have the space for such elaborate plans, and now he doesn\u2019t have the ball, either. 19 min: Senegal are hungry for more, and Uganda are struggling to keep track of their passing and movement. The Cranes need to weather this storm or their hopes will be blown away early doors. Uganda substitution: Awany on, Wasswa off 17 min: Following that partly self-inflicted setback, things are getting worse for Uganda: Wasswa has to leave the pitch on a stretcher after picking up a strain of some sort. Uganda give the ball away in midfield and Senegal take swift advantage, playing a couple of quick passes to send Man\u00e9 scampering clear. The keeper charges out to meet him but Man\u00e9 steers it past him with his left foot. 13 min: Lumala and Mugabi swap zippy passes down the right. Mugabi then tries to catch out the keeper but shooting from way out wide rather than crossing. But Gomis is wide awake. 11 min: After prolonged treatment, Kouyat\u00e9 douses himself with water and vows to continue. Within seconds of play resuming there\u2019s another kerfuffle, this time as Ugandans surround Ndiaye to berate him for a shove on Lumala. Ndiaye cops a booking for that. It\u2019s been very scrappy and tetchy so far and it it continues like that, it\u2019s unlikely to end with 22 players on the pitch. 8 min: Another yellow for Uganda, this time for Okwi, who is deemed to have been too careless in his use of an elbow while challenging for an aerial ball with Kouyat\u00e9. 6 min: Saivet drills a low freekick towards the crowded penalty spot, but Miya whacks it clear. It was a sorry delivery, to be fair. 5 min: Yellow card for Onyango, who breathes a sigh of relief. 3 min: Oh. That was a rather less clever decision by Onyango. He came hurtling out of the left-hand side of the box and slid into a tackle on Niang, missing the ball entirely and chopping down the forward. Senegal players immediately converge on the referee to demand a red card, but will it be interpreted as a clear goalscoring chance given that it was so wide and close to the byline? The ref allows the medics to come on and receive treatment while he ponders his verdict. 2 min: Saivet curls over an inswinging corner. Onyango decisively takes it at the edge of his six-yard box, then hurls a long ball forward for Okwi to chase. It comes to nothing but it\u2019s more evidence of the Cranes\u2019 eagerness to launch counter-attacks. 1 min: Senegal get the game going, wearing the green kit that some of their fans consider to be unlucky. Uganda are clad in their usual red and black number. The winners of this match now know they will face Benin in the quarter-finals: the Squirrels have just sensationally beaten Morocco on a penalty shootout following a 1-1 draw. That came after an extraordinary end to the game, with Hakim Ziyech missing a penalty in stoppage time before Benin were reduced to 10 players after Khaled Ad\u00e9non got one of the oddest red cards you\u2019ll ever see. Benin have still never won a match (in regulation time) at the Africa Cup of Nations, yet they are into the 2019 quarter-finals! Go Squirrels! The excellent Ismaila Sarr returns to the starting lineup for Senegal, with Kr\u00e9pin Diatta slightly unlucky to be sacrificed. Mbaye Niang, on the other hand, is very fortunate to be given another start bearing in mind how many chances he has blown in this tournament so far. Uganda: Onyango; Mugabi, Walusimbi, Wassawa, Juuko; Lumala, Azira, Aucho - Okwi, Kaddu, Miya. Senegal: Gomis; Gassama, Kouyat\u00e9, Koulibaly, Sabaly; Saivet, B Ndiaye, Gueye; Sarr, Niang, Man\u00e9. Referee: M Ghorbal (Algeria) Hello, and congratulations on choosing to be here. Your prize? This match, of course! It\u2019s got the makings of a corker. Uganda have been one of the most entertaining teams in the tournament so far and, having achieved their ambition of reaching the knockout stages for the first time since 1978, will throw themselves at star-studded Senegal without fear. Not that they showed any inhibitions in their group games, when, after trouncing DR Congo, they came mighty close to shocking hosts Egypt on their own turf. In fact, perhaps the Senegalese are the ones with the complex? That, at least, is what Kenya\u2019s manager, S\u00e9basiten Mign\u00e9, offered before their last match by way of explanation for the Teranga Lions\u2019 failure to ever win a continental title. Mign\u00e9 would probably have been better off keeping his thoughts to himself because his jabs succeeded only in provoking the Senegalese into drubbing Kenya. Today they\u2019ll be looking to carry on where they left off, which means a humdinger could be brewing. One of the most pleasing aspects of this tournament so far has been the way relatively unheralded players have matched \u2013 or even outshone \u2013 some of the brightest stars. So while Senegal will today field one of the world\u2019s best forwards (Sadio Man\u00e9) and best defenders (Kalidou Koulibaby), the Cranes can point to several players whose claims for a place in a Tournament XI So Far would be at least as strong, such as the forwards Emmanuel Okwi (who plays his club football for Simba in Tanzania) and Patrick Kaddu (Kampala CCC), centreback Hassan Wasswa (El Geisha, Egypt) and, most of all, slinky midfielder Farouk Miya (HNK Gornica, Croatia). Add in a fine goalkeeper, Dennis Onyango (Mamelodi Sundowns), the buccaneering Abdu Lumala (Kalmar FC, Sweden) and defender Godfrey Walusimbi (currently without a club!), and there\u2019s ample to reason to believe Senegal are going to have to demonstrate their class to come out on top here. This could be a treat.",

      "body": "<p>Four women joined a major pay gap case against the Walt Disney Company, accusing the entertainment giant of gender discrimination at its Hollywood Records music label, its world-famous theme parks and other divisions.</p> <p>The complaint filed in Los Angeles on Friday, alleges that Disney routinely compensates women less than men, denies women promotions, and classifies female employees in lower job titles that don\u2019t match their responsibilities.

She has not received a formal promotion since then, the complaint said, even though she was asked to oversee the marketing department\u2019s creative campaigns for the entire roster of Hollywood Records\u2019 artists in 2017.</p> <p>Disney has refused to promote her to vice-president \u2013 the job classification of the man previously in Joo\u2019s role, the suit says. And yet Joo has received \u201cexemplary performance reviews\u201d, in which Joo was described as a \u201creal leader\u201d who is \u201cworking at the top of her game\u201d and manages to \u201cjuggle a very heavy, often very taxing workload with grace and intelligence\u201d.</p> <p>Ginia Eady-Marshall, another plaintiff, is a senior manager for Disney Music Publishing and has been at the company for 15 years. In 2013, she was promoted to a manager role, responsible for overseeing music research, and although the man who previously had the job was classified as a director, Eady-Marshall was not given that title or salary, the suit says.</p> <p>She also later learned that she was earning $25,000 less than some men with her same title, according to the complaint.</p> <p>Becky Train, a media producer in the theme parks division, said she recently learned of at least one other male media producer earning more than $10,000 more than her, despite them doing the same job.</p> <p>The fourth plaintiff, Amy Hutchins, has worked for Disney\u2019s direct-to-consumer business division for 14 years, and as a production supervisor for more than 10 years. Although her boss acknowledged she was doing manager-level work, she has been unfairly passed over for promotions, the complaint alleges.</p> <p>\u201cIt is totally crazy that someone who has been with the company for 15 years can be making tens of thousands of dollars less than her male counterparts,\u201d said Andrus.</p> <p>Some of the women only learned of their unequal salaries because they had male friends at the company who disclosed their wages, the attorney said.</p> <p>\u201cMen are more frequently judged on their potential and not on their performance,\u201d Andrus added. \u201cThe woman is told, \u2018Well you just need to prove yourself,\u2019 even though she\u2019s already been there for 20-something years.\u201d</p> <p>Four of the six named plaintiffs in the case are women of color, though the attorneys have not alleged racial discrimination. The lawyers have now proposed a class-action case that would cover all women employed full-time by the company in California since April 2015.</p> <p>\u201cI love my job,\u201d Eady-Marshall said in a statement. \u201cBut when Disney refuses to reward the hard work of its female employees, and when Disney allows unconscious bias to hold us back, I cannot stand by and do nothing.\u201d</p> <p>The complaint follows high-profile pay gap litigation at Silicon Valley corporations such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/07/google-pay-disparities-women-labor-department-lawsuit\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/22/oracle-lawsuit-discrimination-against-women-minorities\">Oracle</a> and comes as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/21/metoo-revolution-times-up-roberta-kaplan\">Time\u2019s Up movement</a> has increased scrutiny of discrimination in Hollywood.</p> <p>In the UK, Disney <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/disney-nbc-gender-pay-gap-uktv-all3media-1202740354/\">revealed</a> earlier this year that it has paid men 22% more on average than women.</p> <p>Disney has also faced growing pressure over its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/27/disneyland-minimum-wage-increase-15-an-hour-worker-poverty-homelessness\">pay of low-wage workers</a> at its Disneyland resort.

The four plaintiffs who filed on Friday allege discrimination at Disney\u2019s music label, which has signed pop singers such as Demi Lovato, Zendaya and Miley Cyrus; Walt Disney Imagineering, a division that does projects for the company\u2019s theme parks, resorts, cruises and venues; Disney Music Publishing, a recording arm of the company; and a business division responsible for ESPN and Hulu streaming services. The allegations expand a class-action suit filed in April to the corporation\u2019s Hollywood Records music label, its world-famous theme parks and other divisions. \u201cThe unequal pay infects the entirety of Disney,\u201d attorney Lori Andrus told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an isolated incident \u2026 The gap is pretty dramatic.\u201d Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment , but previously said the corporation has \u201crobust pay equity practices and policies\u201d supported by a \u201cspecialized team of compensation professionals and lawyers\u201d. Enny Joo, one of the new plaintiffs, has worked for Disney since 1998 and was promoted to a creative director role in 2000. She has not received a formal promotion since then, the complaint said, even though she was asked to oversee the marketing department\u2019s creative campaigns for the entire roster of Hollywood Records\u2019 artists in 2017. Disney has refused to promote her to vice-president \u2013 the job classification of the man previously in Joo\u2019s role, the suit says. And yet Joo has received \u201cexemplary performance reviews\u201d, in which Joo was described as a \u201creal leader\u201d who is \u201cworking at the top of her game\u201d and manages to \u201cjuggle a very heavy, often very taxing workload with grace and intelligence\u201d. Ginia Eady-Marshall, another plaintiff, is a senior manager for Disney Music Publishing and has been at the company for 15 years. In 2013, she was promoted to a manager role, responsible for overseeing music research, and although the man who previously had the job was classified as a director, Eady-Marshall was not given that title or salary, the suit says. She also later learned that she was earning $25,000 less than some men with her same title, according to the complaint. Becky Train, a media producer in the theme parks division, said she recently learned of at least one other male media producer earning more than $10,000 more than her, despite them doing the same job. The fourth plaintiff, Amy Hutchins, has worked for Disney\u2019s direct-to-consumer business division for 14 years, and as a production supervisor for more than 10 years. Although her boss acknowledged she was doing manager-level work, she has been unfairly passed over for promotions, the complaint alleges. \u201cIt is totally crazy that someone who has been with the company for 15 years can be making tens of thousands of dollars less than her male counterparts,\u201d said Andrus. Some of the women only learned of their unequal salaries because they had male friends at the company who disclosed their wages, the attorney said. \u201cMen are more frequently judged on their potential and not on their performance,\u201d Andrus added. \u201cThe woman is told, \u2018Well you just need to prove yourself,\u2019 even though she\u2019s already been there for 20-something years.\u201d Four of the six named plaintiffs in the case are women of color, though the attorneys have not alleged racial discrimination. The lawyers have now proposed a class-action case that would cover all women employed full-time by the company in California since April 2015. \u201cI love my job,\u201d Eady-Marshall said in a statement. \u201cBut when Disney refuses to reward the hard work of its female employees, and when Disney allows unconscious bias to hold us back, I cannot stand by and do nothing.\u201d The complaint follows high-profile pay gap litigation at Silicon Valley corporations such as Google and Oracle and comes as the Time\u2019s Up movement has increased scrutiny of discrimination in Hollywood. In the UK, Disney revealed earlier this year that it has paid men 22% more on average than women. Disney has also faced growing pressure over its pay of low-wage workers at its Disneyland resort. Earlier this year, Abigail Disney, the great-niece of Walt Disney, publicly criticized the company\u2019s chief executive, Bob Iger, for his $65.6m salary, saying it \u201cdeepened wealth inequality\u201d and was \u201cinsane\u201d.",

So, as a country, we need to keep focused on this.\u201d So to summarise: Lowe is saying the government needs to deliver stimulus beyond the tax cuts, which people might spend, or might save, depending on how worried they are about the economy tanking, taking their job with it. That stimulus could be more infrastructure spending than has already been announced, or it could be something else. He\u2019s also nudging the government on pursuing structural reform. In the event that deteriorating economic circumstances becomes its own mandate, it is relatively easy for governments to start laying down cash to pump prime the economy. Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan went down that path during the global financial crisis, although it pays to remember that Malcolm Turnbull baulked at some of the stimulus during the GFC. It\u2019s at least possible there could be some internal argy bargy if Morrison suddenly flipped to contemplating a cash splash. The other more obvious brake on pump priming is the Coalition\u2019s oft-repeated commitment to delivering a surplus, which means fiscal policy is tightening when the governor says it should be loosening. The point to make next is obvious. At some point Morrison might have to choose between stimulus and a surplus. But back to structural reform, which was Lowe\u2019s point beyond stepping up fiscal support. Structural reform is something this government has really struggled with. This government has always lacked real policy grunt; it\u2019s one of their hallmarks. Tony Abbott lobbed an austerity agenda that collapsed after he won in 2013 because he had no mandate for it, because he\u2019d concealed it from the public on the basis that had he disclosed it he would never have been elected. Turnbull replaced Abbott to clean up the mess, but colleagues didn\u2019t trust him to clean up the mess. The vacancy of the Coalition\u2019s agenda has been largely concealed from public view, hidden in plain sight, in part because Labor over the last two terms in opposition styled itself as a government in exile. Labor generated a lot of attention in policy terms by shaping a whole program, leaving the government free to lurch between bouts of regicide and managerialism without facing much blowback about its own inadequacy. The unexpected outcome of the May election has killed the prospect of any opposition developing a big target strategy for at least a decade. I was never one for big predictions, and if I needed to be cured of a predictive predilection, the election season of 2019 has certainly sorted me right out.

However amid all the focus on Gauff, it\u2019s easy to forget this would be a great achievement for Hercog, reaching the fourth round of a slam for the first time at the age of 28. A heavily-tattooed Hercog, who also has a sleeve on her right arm like Kyrgios and Raonic of old, takes the first point. 0-15. Gauff steadies herself for 15-all. And then 30-all. But <strong>Hercog has a match point at 30-40</strong>. A rallying cry from the stands for Gauff.

It\u2019s been several years since Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Nadal\u2019s next opponent, has done any damage at a major, Sam Querrey may make it through to a quarter-final against the Spaniard, while Federer\u2019s seeded to meet Kei Nishikori in the last eight, a player who\u2019s never done much damage on grass.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-05T17:00:00.900Z\">at 6.00pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d1f64dc8f08d0b6ca52abb7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-05T14:55:31.918Z\">3.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Wimbledon/status/1147154740779859968\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2018: Beats last year\u2019s finalist<br>2019: Beats last year\u2019s finalist<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guido_pella?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@guido_pella</a> provides another shock, defeating Kevin Anderson to reach the last 16 of a Grand Slam for the first time<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Wimbledon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Wimbledon</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5BIa9ZpLLU\">pic.twitter.com/5BIa9ZpLLU</a></p>\u2014 Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wimbledon/status/1147154740779859968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 5, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d1f64668f08d0b6ca52abb3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-05T14:53:32.194Z\">3.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tumcarayol/status/1147154491948580864\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Guido Pella gets a huge scalp two years running at Wimbledon, defeating Kevin Anderson 6-4 6-3 7-6(4) (oddly) on centre court.<br><br>A nice full circle moment considering Pella has risen 60+ ranking spots since his upset of Cilic last year.</p>\u2014 Tumaini Carayol (@tumcarayol) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tumcarayol/status/1147154491948580864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 5, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d1f63308f08d0b6ca52ab94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-05T14:48:47.727Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to describe this moment,\u201d says a beaming Pella. \u201cThis was unbelievable.

A 15-year-old prodigy headlining the bill later on Centre Court in only the third test of her grand slam career. And a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/03/andy-murray-serena-williams-wimbledon\">first-round mixed doubles match</a> yet to even be assigned a court being the most talked-about on today\u2019s schedule. </p> \n  <p>These are no ordinary times at Wimbledon, but then these are no ordinary protagonists (or in Nick Kyrgios\u2019s case, perhaps that should be antagonist). With the dust yet to fully settle on Kyrgios\u2019s acrimonious arm-wrestle with a victorious Rafael Nadal, the Coco Gauff show arrives on Centre Court as the star of this year\u2019s tournament makes her debut there, while Andy Murray\u2019s courtship with Serena Williams begins.<br></p> \n  <p>Gauff, having already accounted for the five-times champion Venus Williams and the 2017 semi-finalist Magdalena Rybarikova, now has her sights set on the Slovenian world No 60, Polona Hercog. Win this and a mouthwatering last-16 meeting with Simona Halep or Victoria Azarenka awaits. Halep and Azarenka meet on Centre before Gauff in a battle of former world No 1s that could turn out to be the most absorbing contest of the day, even though Murray\u2019s link-up with Serena may well be the most entertaining.</p> \n  <p>The returning two-times home champion and the 23-times grand slam singles winner join forces in what Murray has described as potentially a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. \u201cWith everything that has gone on the last couple of years, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming next,\u201d says Murray nearly six months after his near-retirement. \u201cTo play with Serena, one of the best tennis players of all time and one of the greatest female athletes ever \u2013 it\u2019s something that I may never get another chance to do. It\u2019s brilliant.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Novak Djokovic, having made such smooth progress in his title defence so far, is also on the day-five schedule, as is the man he beat up in last year\u2019s final, Kevin Anderson. Other names include Karolina Pliskova, Caroline Wozniacki and Elina Svitolina, along with the rising talents Felix Auger-Aliassime, Karen Khachanov and Daniil Medvedev. </p> \n  <p>And hopefully the Court 12 spectators are busy putting on their body armour because first up it\u2019s the serving showdown between Reilly Opelka, the 6ft 11in giant giantkiller of Stan Wawrinka, and the 2016 runner-up Milos Raonic. <strong>Play will be getting underway there and around the outside courts at 11am BST, with show time on the show courts at 1pm BST</strong>. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-05T09:59:17.840Z\">at 10.59am BST</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s curtains for Auger-Aliassime, who has lost in straight sets to Humbert, whose \u201creward\u201d for that win is a fourth-round match against Novak Djokovic. Meanwhile, here\u2019s the scene in Coco Gauff\u2019s home town: Auger-Aliassime and Humbert are still going on No 1 in the only remaining third-round match, with Humbert well in control, 6-4, 7-5, 4-2. Here\u2019s the story of the rest of today\u2019s action: Sure, Hercog blinked in that second set, but this is still a remarkable achievement. To put it into context, Gauff\u2019s ranked 313th in the world. This is her first Wimbledon and her first grand slam. She\u2019s the talk not only of Wimbledon but also the United States. And just in case it passed you by, she\u2019s ONLY 15. She\u2019s the youngest player to reach the fourth round here since Jennifer Capriati in 1991. Capriati was defeated at that stage by Steffi Graf. Up next for Gauff: the former world No 1 Simona Halep. Here comes Coco: Right now I\u2019m just super relieved it\u2019s over. People say Court 1 is my court but maybe Centre could be now. I always knew I could come back, I just went for my shots. I\u2019m just happy that slice down the line went in. even when I was down match point, the crowd were still cheering me on. I\u2019m not going to think about [the next round]. I think I have a mixed doubles match tomorrow so I\u2019m going to focus on that.\u201d Felix Auger-Aliassime, the other new kid on the block making headlines here, is in trouble on No 1 Court. He trails Ugo Humbert 6-4, 7-5. No such problems for Gauff, though, who moves to 30-all on Hercog\u2019s serve. Will it be match point? No, because Gauff blazes a backhand out. 40-30. Deuce. Again, Gauff is potentially two points from victory. Can she carve out a first match point? Yes, with plenty of help from Hercog, who tamely nets! Hercog\u2019s drop shot draws Gauff forward, Hercog attempts the lob ... and it\u2019s out! Gauff jumps up and down repeatedly, her parents do the same in the players\u2019 box, almost every spectator is on their feet, and the only way for Coco continues to be up! The 15-year-old\u2019s through to the second week of Wimbledon having saved two match points, as her dream debut continues! Gauff\u2019s dad is on his feet for the 623rd time today when his daughter claims another love hold. It\u2019s 6-5 ... You wouldn\u2019t know Gauff is playing only the third three-set match of her career on Tour given the way she races out of the blocks in the ninth game. It may as well be the first game of the match, given the energy she has as she charges through to love. It leaves Hercog serving to stay in the match. The Slovenian looks set to hold at 40-30 when she sets up the point perfectly ... but plants her volley into the net! Deuce. Gauff celebrates the mistake as though it were her own winner. But then it\u2019s her turn to make an unforced error. Hercog\u2019s advantage. Deuce. Hercog\u2019s advantage. And the Slovenian\u2019s first ace of the set makes it game. 5-5. Hercog holds for 4-4. Meanwhile one Murray did at least make it on to court in the mixed doubles this evening. Jamie Murray has reached round two with his American partner Bethanie Mattek-Sands, defeating Britain\u2019s Joe Salisbury and Katy Dunne 7-5, 7-6 (8). Gauff is indeed bothered by Hercog\u2019s more carefree approach, and there\u2019s another twist to this absorbing plot when the American slides 0-40 down. Gauff nets with a backhand on the second break point and we\u2019re back on serve! Hercog treats herself to a massage from the trainer at the changeover, while Gauff is left to ponder how the pressure of being the frontrunner got to her. Hercog, with almost nothing to lose now, has decided to chisel that concrete out of her trainers and have a few free swings at the ball. She holds to love to at least plant a seed of doubt in Gauff\u2019s mind. It\u2019s 3-6, 7-6 (7), 4-2 Gauff. Gauff has a break point at 2-1, 30-40. She can\u2019t take it. Gauff has another break point at her advantage. She does take it! Hercog\u2019s shoes look as if they\u2019re filled with concrete as the Slovenian\u2019s forehand goes long. Gauff then backs up the break in double quick time for 3-6, 7-6 (7), 4-1. For the first time in this match she is very much in the ascendancy. But back to current matters. There\u2019s little giving at the start of the decider, in which Gauff is serving first. Gauff leads 2-1. Meanwhile on No 1, the other most-talked about teen in tennis, Felix Auger-Aliassime, having lost the first set, 6-4, to France\u2019s Ugo Humbert (who\u2019s a positively ancient 21), has stormed back in the second and leads 3-0. We\u2019re hearing that Andy Murray and Serena Williams will now not play tonight. A sensible decision to cancel given that Williams is up first on No 1 Court in the singles tomorrow. \u201cI agree with you about being able to better than Serandy... It simply sounds like Ser (Sir) Andy,\u201d emails Aditi Modi. We knew Gauff had the talent, now we know she\u2019s got the fight. Hercog did give her a little hand but the teenager will have won even more fans with the way she came from 5-2 down, saving those two match points. Though she may have also upset a few spectators, because a third set means Andy Murray and Serena Williams will be detained in the locker room for a little longer. And Serena, I imagine, is someone who doesn\u2019t like to be kept waiting, especially when she\u2019s playing singles at 1pm tomorrow. ... and Hercog breaks again for 4-3, before strengthening her grip at 5-3. But again, the Slovenian is overcome by anxiety. Hercog jumps up and down on the spot, trying to shake out those nerves. It doesn\u2019t work. From 5-3 down, Gauff brings up a set point at 6-5 with the overhead! Hercog\u2019s first serve is long ... she lands the second and proceeds to slice Gauff into submission! 6-6. Hercog stops mid-rally to challenge when she thinks Gauff\u2019s shot has drifted long. Big mistake. Hawk-Eye shows it got the line. 7-6, a second set point. A never-ending rally, in which neither player wants to pull the trigger, ends when Gauff goes long. 7-7. 8-7, a third set point. Hercog is slicing every shot right now, this is so cagey, and Gauff eventually, eventually pulls the trigger! The 15-year-old takes the tie-break 9-7. We\u2019re going the distance! This is the first tie-break Gauff has played in her six matches on Tour. With so much on the line, both players are struggling to hit through their shots, and their feet look heavy. At 2-2 a bird decides to interrupt proceedings, just to add to the drama. A gruelling fifth point is won by Gauff with a fortunate net cord, which she celebrates by raising her arms in the air. That\u2019s the first mini-break, but Gauff concedes it immediately. 3-3 at the change of ends ... Hercog holds to stem the tide, stopping a run of three games against her. The Slovenian leads 6-5. Maybe that\u2019ll shake away the nerves. But an absolute howler from Hercog on the first point of Gauff\u2019s serve suggests she\u2019s still struggling. However Gauff\u2019s feeling the pressure too. At 40-30 it looks as if she\u2019s hit a double fault and, although Hawk-Eye comes to her rescue, she then smacks her forehand into the net! Deuce. The teenager scrambles through from there and this absorbing set will be settled by a tie-break. Hercog is alternating between the tightest of shots and terrific winners. Error. 15-0. Winner. 15-all. Gauff then decides to become the dictator, moving to 30-15, 40-15 and game. It\u2019s 5-5. Belgium\u2019s David Goffin, meanwhile, has defeated Daniil Medvedev, the 11th seed and rising Russian who goes the way that his fellow hotly tipped talents Alex Zverev and Stefanos Tsitsipas did before him. The score was 4-6, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5. Goffin plays Verdasco in the last 16. However Hercog is serving for the match at 6-3, 5-3. Gauff, in two minds on the return, hits long and it\u2019s 30-0. Hercog then overcooks a shot too. 30-15. Hercog has Gauff moving right and left and right and left and right on the next point, Gauff chases every ball down before punishing the short ball. 30-all. If Gauff could break here they\u2019d be back on serve. But Hercog\u2019s timing is impeccable. She comes up with an ace to secure a second match point. But then balances it out with a double fault! Deuce. Some superb retrieving from Gauff combined with an awful, edgy error from Hercog and it\u2019s break point, Gauff\u2019s first of the match! This time Hercog keeps her nerves in check with a forehand winner down the line. But Gauff comes back at her with another break point ... and this one she takes when Hercog nets! Gauff has saved two match points and somehow they\u2019re back on serve! Thanks Niall. There\u2019s an almost funereal atmosphere on Centre as Gauff steps up to serve with new balls to stay in the match. Did no one give Hercog the script? However amid all the focus on Gauff, it\u2019s easy to forget this would be a great achievement for Hercog, reaching the fourth round of a slam for the first time at the age of 28. A heavily-tattooed Hercog, who also has a sleeve on her right arm like Kyrgios and Raonic of old, takes the first point. 0-15. Gauff steadies herself for 15-all. And then 30-all. But Hercog has a match point at 30-40. A rallying cry from the stands for Gauff. It does the trick \u2013 just \u2013 as the American\u2019s backhand swerving slice clips the line. Deuce. Advantage Gauff. Game Gauff. Gutsy. No signs of a wobble from Hercog, who holds with the minimum of fuss to move one game away. She has been very solid, and now leads 6-3, 5-2. Time to hand back to Katy... At 30-all on serve, Gauff moves into the net to close out a point. Gutsy stuff, and she closes out the game when Hercog\u2019s return drifts long. Jamie Murray and Mattek-Sands are trailing 4-3 in the first set against Salisbury and Dunne, who sound like an upmarket furniture shop. Hercog rattles through another service for her sixth game on the spin. Gauff has to get back on the board and does so, holding to cut the gap to 3-1 in the second set. Will Hercog feel the nerves at any stage? She struggles a touch with her first serve, but finds a big second serve to close out the game. 4-1, and closing in on victory. The defending champion drops his first set of the tournament but still eases through to the second week. Felix Auger-Aliassime will pose an interesting test if he gets through his third-round match, but beyond that, it\u2019s hard to see who could stop him returning to the final. Hercog is doing everything right, though, just keeping the ball in court, knowing that her young opponent is struggling to find her rhythm. Gauff takes her to deuce on her serve, but a couple of forced errors let her off. Hercog then cranks up the pressure, racing to two break points on Gauff\u2019s serve. She saves the first, but nets a forehand as the ball sits up, and drops her racket in frustration. From Gauff to Goffin, and the Belgian has broken back against Daniil Medvedev. Djokovic is getting there on No 1 court \u2013 he\u2019s about to serve for the match at 5-4 in the fourth. \u201cDo you have a comment on Cilic and Anderson losing during the first week despite being bumped up in their rankings here?\u201d asks Olga Grkavac. I don\u2019t know if I can offer much, beyond the fact that Wimbledon should probably just stick with the rankings these days. Players who perform well on grass should have an advantage anyway, and the depth of quality means moving up a few places isn\u2019t likely to compensate for a lack of form or match fitness. Hercog takes the first set! That set unravelled quickly for Coco Gauff after being broken. Hercog immediately held to love, before a disastrous ninth game where Gauff double-faulted three times, and was broken to love. Let\u2019s remember that she\u2019s 15 years old \u2013 playing on Centre Court is understandably causing some nerves. A couple more potentially decisive breaks \u2013 Djokovic has moved 3-1 up on Hurkacz in the fourth set, and Medvedev has edged ahead against Goffin. Jamie Murray is just starting his mixed doubles first-round match alongside US player Bethanie Mattek-Sands. They\u2019re playing two Brits in Joe Salisbury and Katy Dunne. Gauff looks in a spot of bother on her serve, but an air shot from Hercog at 30-all lets her off. She nets on the next point, though, and her opponent dominates the next rally. A drifting slice from Hercog is called out, but Hawkeye shows it clipped the line, and on the next point, Gauff hangs on in a long rally but is undone by a forehand that lands plum on the baseline. Hercog breaks to lead 4-3! Back on Centre, a correct challenge on Hercog\u2019s serve keeps Gauff in the game, but the Slovenian finds another winner to hold. It\u2019s 3-3 in the first set. This is, of course, a big occasion for Hercog too \u2013 she\u2019s never reached the second week of a slam. Thanks Katy. Let\u2019s take a quick trip around the grounds: On No 3 Court, Fernando Verdasco has followed up his win over Kyle Edmund with a straight-sets win over Thomas Fabbiano. Verdasco will play the winner of a blockbuster on No 2, where Daniil Medvedev and David Goffin are locked in a deciding set. I\u2019m off for a break. I\u2019ll leave you in the very capable hands of Niall McVeigh ... Gauff has taken no time at all to adapt to her new surroundings and is enjoying being the Centre of attention. She\u2019s soon 2-1 up on serve. Meanwhile Djokovic has poured water on Hurkacz\u2019s fire, reacting to losing that second-set tie-break by charging 5-1 up in the third in a matter of minutes. Djokovic has two set points at 40-15. Hurkacz makes little effort to get his return back into play. Drama? What drama? Says Djokovic, the man who stares adversity in the face and laughs right back at it. He\u2019s restored his lead and it\u2019s 7-5, 6-7 (5), 6-1. And here comes Coco. The 15-year-old sensation arrives for her first and certainly not last visit to Centre Court and is greeted by big cheers. Though she may not have heard them given she\u2019s got her headphones on. Gauff, having accounted for the five-times champion Venus Williams in the first round and the 2017 semi-finalist Magdalena Rybarikova in the second, now has her sights set on the Slovenian world No 60, Polona Hercog, as she aims to become the youngest player to reach the fourth round here since Jennifer Capriati in 1991. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been as easy as the score shows,\u201d says Halep after her win over Azarenka. \u201cI felt really great on court. She is a tough opponent. I gave everything I had and was confident. The first two games were not easy but I feel better and I\u2019m looking forward to the next one. \u201cMy coach is going to watch this match [between Coco Gauff and Polona Hercog]. I will recover my body and just chill. I have a day off. I don\u2019t look at the draw. I just take it match by match.\u201d Halep\u2019s timing is good because we can get back to Djokovic v Hurkacz and that second-set tie-break. Hurkacz pulls off some more acrobatics at the net to get the mini-break for 2-1. The crowd are loving his style. Djokovic breaks back. They change ends at 3-3 ... another mini-break or two or three follow \u2013 I make that seven for the breaker so far \u2013 and Hurkacz has a set point at 6-5, on his serve ... he serves out wide ... and then thunders away a winner at the net! A massive set from the 6ft 5in Pole. He\u2019s taken it 7-5 in the tie-break and is level with Djokovic at one set all. A match that promised so much on Centre Court has sadly failed to deliver. Halep is hurtling towards the finish line, leading Azarenka 6-3, 5-1 and serving at 15-0. 30-0. 40-0. Three match points. Azarenka unleashes a forehand winner \u2013 before putting her next in the net. Halep, having been 3-1 down, won 11 of the next 12 games and is through to the last 16, where she\u2019ll face the winner of the next match between Coco Gauff and Polona Hercog! Azarenka hit 33 unforced errors. Karolina Pliskova says it how it is: Hurkacz has got himself at least a tie-break in this second set. The world No 48 leads the world No 1 6-5 on serve. Djokovic quickly moves 30-0 ahead in the next game. But look here, it\u2019s now 30-all. Can Hurkacz get himself a set point? Yes, when Djokovic drills wide! After all those break points Djokovic had earlier in this set, Hurkacz now has the chance to level this match. But he can\u2019t take it. Deuce. Hurkacz then dives Boris Becker-style at the net and here\u2019s another set point! Hurkacz gets tight on the forehand. Deuce. Advantage Djokovic. Double fault! Deuce. Advantage Djokovic, after a draining exchange. Game Djokovic. Phew. So Halep has the first set 6-3. Djokovic, meanwhile, who many probably thought would pull away against Hurkacz after that tight first set, is level at 4-4 in the second. He\u2019s had his chances to break, though. Elsewhere Daniil Medvedev, the Russian 11th seed, is tied at a set all against Belgium\u2019s David Goffin, while Fernardo Verdasco is a set up, 6-4, in the match of the shot-makers with Italy\u2019s Thomas Fabbiano. It was Fabbiano who took out Stefanos Tsitsipas in the first round; Verdasco was the villain of the piece on Wednesday when he came from two sets down to defeat the tiring British No 1, Kyle Edmund. This from Serena Williams\u2019s coach. Surely we can do better than Serandy? Nothing is going Azarenka\u2019s way right now. Serving to stay in the set, she receives a warning from the umpire for whacking her racket into the grass after her 18th unforced error. She promptly slumps 0-30 down. The Belarusian probably deserves a bit of a luck when a net cord gets her back to 30-all. But she inexplicably fires a forehand into the net when she should have put it away for the winner. Set point, 30-40. And Azarenka again misfires. Halep, having weathered that early storm, is getting everything back and tying Azarenka up in knots. Azarenka, a former semi-finalist here as is Halep, seems to struggle for consistency these days, probably because she\u2019s not playing as many matches, and after that superb start the errors are piling up. Halep breaks back \u2013 and then breaks again to go ahead for the first time in this match. It\u2019s 4-3. Halep shows her tremendous athleticism as she\u2019s dragged out wide and pulls off the forehand winner. 40-0. Game. It\u2019s now 5-3 and Azarenka must hold serve to detain Halep for any longer in this set. Over on Centre the battle of the former world No 1s and potential match of the day has begun, between the 2018 French Open champion Simona Halep and the 2012 and 2013 Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka. Halep won when they last played each other here in 2017 but that was only six months after Azarenka had given birth to her son. Azarenka\u2019s second career has yet to fully catch fire but victory over Halep would perhaps provide the ignition she needs to go deep at a grand slam once more. It\u2019s Azarenka who\u2019s the aggressor from the start, pushing in Halep\u2019s opening service game and then grabbing the break in the Romanian\u2019s second. Azarenka leads 3-1. Djokovic, at 5-5 in the first set against Hurkacz, decides he\u2019s had his fun and that it\u2019s time to get serious. He breaks after a lengthy exchange and will serve to secure the set, which he does from deuce. The No 1 leads 7-5 on No 1. That point in the Pella-Anderson tie-break: That result throws that section of the draw wide open and means either Pella, Milos Raonic, Roberto Bautista Agut or Benoit Paire will reach the semi-final. Which seems like a good moment to bring in Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cOutside the trio of usual suspects who has the best chances of winning the men\u2019s singles?\u201d Um. Can I say no one?! There\u2019s much talk about Felix Auger-Aliassime, of course, but he could play Djokovic in the last 16, and you feel that match would come too soon for the 18-year-old. Daniil Medvedev could take a set or two off Djokovic in the quarters, perhaps, but I can\u2019t see him winning. Raonic, a possible last-four opponent for Djokovic, is the only remaining player outside the Big Three to have reached a Wimbledon final, but has had injury problems this year. And over in the other half of the draw, I\u2019m really struggling to look beyond a Nadal v Federer semi-final. It\u2019s been several years since Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Nadal\u2019s next opponent, has done any damage at a major, Sam Querrey may make it through to a quarter-final against the Spaniard, while Federer\u2019s seeded to meet Kei Nishikori in the last eight, a player who\u2019s never done much damage on grass. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to describe this moment,\u201d says a beaming Pella. \u201cThis was unbelievable. I was focused the entire match. It was amazing. That point [at 5-4 in the tie-break] belonged to me. It was an unbelievable point.\u201d An absolutely ridiculous point between Kevin Anderson and Guido Pella on Centre Court, and it comes at a crucial moment! With Anderson fighting for his life, two sets to love and 5-4 down in the tie-break to Pella, the pair fire volley after volley after volley after volley at each other, with Pella prevailing! 6-4, two match points. And again Pella emerges victorious at the net! Anderson, last year\u2019s finalist is out, and Pella is through to the second week at a grand slam for the first time! Novak Djokovic has advanced with the minimum of fuss so far as he chases a fifth Wimbledon title that would draw him level with Bjorn Borg. Arguably the biggest challenge he\u2019s faced this week is dealing with the current turmoil at the ATP player council, of which he is the president. Today the world No 1 and defending champion\u2019s victim sorry opponent is the young Pole Hubert Hurkacz, who Djokovic defeated for the loss of only eight games at the French Open five weeks ago. Four games in Hurkacz is already a quarter of a way towards that his Roland Garros total. It\u2019s 2-2 on No 1 Court. When the draw for the men\u2019s doubles was made, talk was of the Murray brothers meeting in the third round. But it\u2019s not meant to be. Jamie and his fellow Brit Neal Skupski have gone out in the first round, losing 2-6, 7-6 (2), 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 in a match that was suspended in the gloam last night and ended in the 28-degree heat of this afternoon. Pliskova will next take on Karolina Muchova in an all-Czech battle on Manic Monday, when all the last 16 matches, as is tradition, will take place. Muchova had defeated Anett Kontaveit, the 20th seed who beat Britain\u2019s Heather Watson two days ago, 7-6 (7), 6-3. We\u2019re hearing that Ashleigh Barty, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer will play on Centre, with Serena Wiliams, Johanna Konta and Dan Evans on No 1. So Barty, the world No 1 and French Open champion, finally gets her moment on Centre. Up steps Pliskova to serve for a place in the fourth round, which would match her best performance here. And the tall Czech produces the perfect game, starting with a one-two punch, backing it up with an unreturned serve and then her 14th ace, and then finishing it with a forehand down the line that Hsieh can\u2019t get back! Conchita Martinez, Pliskova\u2019s coach and the Wimbledon champion 25 years ago, looks mightily impressed with her charge, as she should; Hsieh was a tricky test who chased down every ball, but Pliskova\u2019s power proved decisive. Martinez coached Garbine Muguruza to the Wimbledon title in 2017. Could she do the same with Pliskova this year? Roberto Bautista Agut, the Spaniard who we all thought had put Andy Murray into retirement at the Australian Open in January, has taken out the 10th seed, Karen Khachanov, ruthlessly dismissing the dangerous Russian 6-3, 7-6 (3), 6-1. Bautista Agut didn\u2019t face a single break point and will play Benoit Paire next. Also through: Over on No 1 Court, Pliskova is holding on to that break in the decider. Leading 4-3, she seems determined to avoid the fate that has befallen her in Wimbledons gone by, when she lost to a succession of lower-ranked opponents. She may be the third seed here but she\u2019s never been beyond the last 16, despite possessing what seems to be the perfect game for grass. In more hilarity: Thanks John. No Pimm\u2019s for me, only salad. My body is a temple, you know. News of Benoit Paire\u2019s win makes me think of his epic racket-smashing rampage in Washington last year. They don\u2019t get much better than this: Right, that\u2019s quite enough from me. Katy is back, fed, watered and Pimms-ed for the action at SW19. Pliskova breaks in the third! Hsieh and Pliskova both win their opening service games of the final set before Hsieh has another of those wobbles. She reaches for the towel at 0-30 down and that seems to do the trick, as she plays an expert drop shot to get back to 30-30. The next point sees her fail to repeat her success, and then a brutal winner takes the break point. A primal scream and a big smile plus the punch of the air from Conchita Martinez in the stand. Oh dear, Karen Khachanov, one of the outside bets for the tournament, is two sets down to Roberto Bautista Agut, having lost the second in a tie-break. The Russian winner of last year\u2019s Paris Masters has a long way to go to get back into this one. Pella, looking to go 4-1 up, is taken to deuce by Anderson, and then had an advantage, only for Anderson to come out on top in a lengthy rally of baseline hammerings once he comes to the net. Then, Pella has a huge chance for a winner with Anderson lost all at sea, and misses the winner. It\u2019s back to 3-2 to Pella with Big Kev to serve next. Tsieh wins the second set, and Pliskova takes a comfort break ahead of the decider. Pella is really taking this away from Anderson, and is 3-1 up in the second set. Anderson, who has not played much tennis this year, looks rusty. Hsieh looked to be motoring towards winning an equalising set, but then got all nervous when 4-2 up. She surrenders two break points to Pliskova, winning the first and then, after a long rally, forcing an error from her opponent. Eventually, after the trading of repeated deuces, she wins the game and goes up to 5-2. Jamie Murray, meanwhile, is warming up in his men\u2019s doubles match with Neal Skupski as they ready themselves to play Ivan Dodig and Filip Polasek, having had the match held over from last night. They are 2-1 up in sets, the Brit pair. On Court 18, Benoit Paire, the 28th seed from France, has just beaten Jiri Vesely, the Czech who calls Ras Al Khaimah home. The score? 5-7, 7-6 (5), 6-3, 7-6 (2). Gary Naylor makes a salient point: \u201cThe clapping at Wimbledon when the screen goes to a review is infantile, irritating and disrespectful to players whose championship may depend on the point.\u201d Yes, tennis VAR has been around a bit. Do the hoi polloi still need to greet the video footage like kids watching rockets go off on Bonfire Night? Pella wins the first set! Anderson has a real wobble and initially faces two set points from Pella. He serves the first one out, then goes full gun for the second, missing his first serve. Still, his second forces the chance to smash the ball to kingdom come. Then Anderson makes a mess of a backhand volley to offer up a third set point. \u201cCome on,\u201d bellows Anderson as he saves that with a bullying winner. But he can\u2019t repeat that and Pella has broken him. Drama. And not even the need for a tie-break. It was going with serve between Hsieh and Pliskova, by the way, but then Hsieh seized her first set point of the match to go 3-1 up in the second set. Anderson forces a break point at 4-4 in the battle of the biffers with Pella, but blows it with a wild shot. Pella gets to advantage at deuce but then commits a double fault. He then serves it out, and via a very decent skidding serve. It\u2019s at 5-4. Pliskova won the first set with some ease, 6-3 but lost the first game of the second set 1-0. Hsieh has recovered her step a little. More biffs on Centre Court. It continues to go with serve between Anderson and Pella. A brief glimpse at Henman Hill, where they don\u2019t appear to be watching this one too closely. It\u2019s lunchtime and the hampers are being emptied, scotch eggs-a-go-go, with lashings and lashings of avocado. Some of that classic Wimbledon hilarity as a bird - a wagtail - dances across Court 1. Everyone laughs just that little bit too hard at that, as is the way at SW19. On that court, away from the jolly japes, Hsieh and Pliskova was going with serve at 3-3, but now Pliskova has broken, and then served to love. It\u2019s 5-3 and she will serve for the first set. \u201cNo mention of Evan Hoyt and Eden Silva (GB) on Court 16 putting out a former Wimbledon doubles champ and a US Open singles champ? Worth a shout surely,\u201d says Robert Devaney. Leander Paes and Samantha Stosur were the victims. There is now, Robert, there is now. Biff! Kevin Anderson and Guido Pella have been exchanging bludgeons on Centre Court and there was a whiff of a break at 1-2 with Anderson serving, but the South African blams his way back to 2-2. Talking of big servers, Karen Khachanov has just lost the first set to Spanish vet Roberto Bautista Agut on Court No.2. Afternoon, all. Should you wish to get in touch, then @johnbrewin_ or John.Brewin.Casual@theguardian.com.... With that I\u2019m off for some lunch. I\u2019ll leave you with John Brewin. Over to you, John ... Elina Svitolina could do with some of Villanelle\u2019s ruthlessness right now because she just can\u2019t put Maria Sakkari away. Having had those two match points in the second set, she\u2019s had another three in the third. She leads 6-3, 6-7 (1), 5-2 and is serving at deuce. Here\u2019s a sixth match point. A 74mph powder puff serve is swatted away by Sakkari. Deuce. Advantage Svitolina, a seventh match point. And it\u2019s lucky seven for Svitolina when Sakkari slaps into the net! Svitolina eventually advances 6-3, 6-7 (1), 6-2! Phoebe Waller-Bridge is in the Royal Box. Let\u2019s hope for everyone\u2019s sake that Villanelle doesn\u2019t join her, otherwise things could get even messier on Centre Court than they did between Nick Kyrgios and Rafael Nadal last night. Though maybe Brian O\u2019Driscoll, who\u2019s also in the Royal Box this afternoon along with Alastair Cook, Katherine Grainger and Christian and Geri Horner, could take her down. As the clock strikes one, Kevin Anderson, last year\u2019s runner-up, strides on to Centre Court for his meeting with Argentina\u2019s Guido Pella. On No 1 Court it\u2019s Karolina Pliskova, the third seed and many people\u2019s favourite for the title despite never advancing beyond the fourth round, against the unorthodox Hsieh Su-wei of Taiwan. Raonic wraps up a 7-6 (1), 6-2, 6-1 win over Opelka, who faded alarmingly after a promising start as his serve absolutely deserted him. Injury? Inexperience? Tiredness? He did, remember, go five sets with Wawrinka in the previous round. Another big name from Wimbledons gone by, Lleyton Hewitt, is toiling in the men\u2019s doubles on Court 14. He and Jordan Thompson trail South Africa\u2019s Raven Klaasen and New Zealand\u2019s Michael Venus 6-3, 7-6 (3), 5-2. Make that 6-2. The 38-year-old and his fellow Australian are out. On this day in 2009: Reilly Opelka served 13 aces in the first set against Milos Raonic. He hasn\u2019t hit a single one since. The 21-year-old who knocked out Stan Wawrinka is getting a bit of a lesson from the former finalist and trails 7-6 (1), 6-2, 4-1. He\u2019s still saying his pleases and thank yous to the ballkids though, the polite young chap. Benoit Paire and Jiri Vesely, meanwhile, are level at one set all. Drama on No 3 Court too, where Greece\u2019s Maria Sakkari saved two match points to hold and force a second-set tie-break against the eighth seed, Elina Svitolina, with Sakkari surging through the breaker 7-1. Svitolina\u2019s boyfriend, Gael Monfils, winces from the stands. This one\u2019s going the distance. Wozniacki\u2019s resistance appears futile when Zhang quickly holds and moves 0-30 ahead on the Dane\u2019s serve. Wozniacki works her way to 30-all, but Zhang calmly dispatches a backhand winner down the line to bring up her first match point. Wozniacki cuts Zhang up with a backhand slice. Deuce. Advantage Wozniacki. Deuce. Then Zhang sets up another match point in the exact same way she did her first, with another backhand down the line. This time Zhang knifes away a backhand volley to end a quite draining rally and Wozniacki, the 14th seed and former world No 1, becomes another big name to bite the dust, beaten by a player who had never previously been beyond the first round! Wozniacki may be a married woman now but the 28-year-old still has her father cramping her style as her coach. Piotr Wozniacki doesn\u2019t look happy after two calls go against his daughter, and Wozniacki has a long discussion with the umpire. \u201cHow are we playing with Hawk-Eye that is this bad?\u201d she asks. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. How am I supposed to play when every single time the ball is overruled? It\u2019s crazy.\u201d Perhaps it helps her shake out some frustration, because she manages to hold, stopping a run of five consecutive service games in which she was broken. Wozniacki trails 6-4, 4-2. Wozniacki, who revealed towards the end of last year that she had been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, is seemingly fading on No 2 Court. After that perfect 4-0 start, she\u2019s won only one game and trails Zhang 6-4, 4-1. Wozniacki\u2019s husband, David Lee, a former NBA player who she married only last month, looks on anxiously from the stands. This happened a little while ago on No 3 Court, drawing a collective gasp when it was then shown on the big screen on Henman Hill/Murray Mound. And there we were thinking Court 12 was going to be the most hazardous place for spectators ... There\u2019s a first-set tie-break on Court 12 between the ace machines Milos Raonic and Reilly Opelka. It was always going to be this way, wasn\u2019t it? Though there again they have shared nine break points, with neither player able to take any. Raonic has a stranglehold on the breaker from the start, rocketing his way to five set points at 6-1. And the set is settled with the rarest of things, a rally, as Opelka\u2019s forehand flies wide. Raonic takes the tie-break 7-1. Zhang not only gains parity against Wozniacki, breaking for 4-4 from 4-0 down, she then moves ahead for the first time at 5-4. At 15-all on Wozniacki\u2019s serve, Zhang finishes a 14-stroke rally with an emphatic forehand winner. 15-30. Which two points later is 30-40. Set point. Zhang strikes deep to Wozniacki\u2019s backhand side, and the stumbling Dane is unable to dig that out of the grass! Zhang has won six games on the spin to take the set 6-4! Elina Svitolina has claimed the first set of the day, 6-3 against Maria Sakkari. The Ukrainian has had a fairly quiet year but a kind draw here suggests she could make some noise. Determined not to be outdone by Wozniacki, Zhang is now zipping through the games, taking three in a row. The reigning Australian Open women\u2019s doubles champion has shown plenty of prowess at the net to reduce her arrears to 4-3 but Wozniacki still has the break. And plenty of reading too: Some more day four highlights: Think you\u2019ll ever get tired of this? Me neither. Agnieszka Radwanska, the popular Pole who was beaten in the 2012 final by Serena Williams and retired at the end of last season, is watching her friend Wozniacki on No 2 Court. Radwanska will be liking what she sees. Wozniacki leads 4-0 in the blink of an eye. Or more accurately 15 minutes. Also under way in the third round: Caroline Wozniacki, last year\u2019s Australian Open champion, against China\u2019s Zhang Shuai; Elina Svitolina, the stylish eighth seed, against Greece\u2019s Maria Sakkari; and Benoit Paire, the eccentric Frenchman, against the conquering Czech qualifier Jiri Vesely, who took out Alex Zverev in the opening round. Milos Raonic has got his serving rifle out of his bag. Reilly Opelka has responded by getting out his bazooka. The spectators have put on their tin hats. They\u2019re all ready. Are you ready? Let\u2019s play. Opelka, the 21-year-old American who is world ranked 63 and won the boys\u2019 singles title here four years ago, opens up with an obligatory hold. Raonic responds with a love game. Just the three aces so far. The Voice of Wimbledon calmly urges excited spectators every morning not to run around the grounds. But thankfully my mad dash to the press centre following tube trouble seems to have gone unnoticed. Given how hot it is today \u2013 with a high of 28 degrees forecast \u2013 I could probably do with an ice bath. But Wimbledon waits for no one, the players are making their way to all corners of the grounds and day five will be under way very soon.

A 15-year-old prodigy headlining the bill later on Centre Court in only the third test of her grand slam career. And a first-round mixed doubles match yet to even be assigned a court being the most talked-about on today\u2019s schedule. These are no ordinary times at Wimbledon, but then these are no ordinary protagonists (or in Nick Kyrgios\u2019s case, perhaps that should be antagonist). With the dust yet to fully settle on Kyrgios\u2019s acrimonious arm-wrestle with a victorious Rafael Nadal, the Coco Gauff show arrives on Centre Court as the star of this year\u2019s tournament makes her debut there, while Andy Murray\u2019s courtship with Serena Williams begins. Gauff, having already accounted for the five-times champion Venus Williams and the 2017 semi-finalist Magdalena Rybarikova, now has her sights set on the Slovenian world No 60, Polona Hercog. Win this and a mouthwatering last-16 meeting with Simona Halep or Victoria Azarenka awaits. Halep and Azarenka meet on Centre before Gauff in a battle of former world No 1s that could turn out to be the most absorbing contest of the day, even though Murray\u2019s link-up with Serena may well be the most entertaining. The returning two-times home champion and the 23-times grand slam singles winner join forces in what Murray has described as potentially a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. \u201cWith everything that has gone on the last couple of years, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming next,\u201d says Murray nearly six months after his near-retirement. \u201cTo play with Serena, one of the best tennis players of all time and one of the greatest female athletes ever \u2013 it\u2019s something that I may never get another chance to do. It\u2019s brilliant.\u201d Novak Djokovic, having made such smooth progress in his title defence so far, is also on the day-five schedule, as is the man he beat up in last year\u2019s final, Kevin Anderson. Other names include Karolina Pliskova, Caroline Wozniacki and Elina Svitolina, along with the rising talents Felix Auger-Aliassime, Karen Khachanov and Daniil Medvedev. And hopefully the Court 12 spectators are busy putting on their body armour because first up it\u2019s the serving showdown between Reilly Opelka, the 6ft 11in giant giantkiller of Stan Wawrinka, and the 2016 runner-up Milos Raonic. Play will be getting underway there and around the outside courts at 11am BST, with show time on the show courts at 1pm BST.",

The tax does not cover sugary milk-based drinks but the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has suggested this could happen as a way of tackling childhood obesity. Johnson\u2019s campaign is being directed by Mark Fullbrook, who co-runs the London company in Crosby\u2019s empire, Crosby Textor Fullbrook Partners (CTFP). The company does not say which firms it represents in the UK. A register of lobbying interests in New South Wales shows the Australian part of Crosby\u2019s business, Crosby Textor Research Strategies Results, acts for the dairy multinational Parmalat. The Italian-based company, owned by the French dairy group Lactalis, sells various brands of sugared milk-based drinks in Australia, some with higher sugar content than soft drinks such as Coca-Cola, which would subject them to an extended UK-style sugar tax. Fullbrook worked with Johnson on his successful 2012 campaign to win a second term as London mayor.

      "body": "<p>When England face Sweden tomorrow in the third-place play-off of the eighth Women\u2019s World Cup, the nation will be justly proud of the players\u2019 achievements. The Lionesses have provided at times breathless and exciting football, scoring more goals in France than at any previous World Cup. Phil Neville, the team\u2019s manager, has an enviable record of just four defeats in 23 matches. England\u2019s semi-final loss to the United States this week was the biggest UK television <a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/sport/2019-07-03/england-vs-usa-womens-world-cup-semi-final-has-highest-peak-audience-of-any-tv-show-this-year/\" title=\"\">event</a> of the year, with the BBC\u2019s peak figure of 11.7m taking more than half of the audience share \u2013 a fivefold increase on England\u2019s semi-final against Japan four years ago.</p> <p>Women\u2019s football has come of age in time to make the very most of such a moment. Across western Europe it is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d465e422-97fa-11e9-8cfb-30c211dcd229\" title=\"\">growing</a> in popularity. The misogyny of the past, which saw women\u2019s football <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/33064421/the-secret-history-of-womens-football\" title=\"\">banned</a> in England, has thankfully gone. Sexism, unfortunately, has not completely disappeared: Patrice Evra, the former French captain who appeared as a pundit during last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/17/pundit-challenged-over-clapping-female-hosts-world-cup-analysis\" title=\"\">applauded</a> his female English co-panellist Eni Aluko, who writes for the Guardian, as if astonished to hear a woman offer a fluent and pointed analysis. It is a good thing for the beautiful game that such attitudes are the exception rather than the rule.</p> <p>To capitalise on the surge of interest, there must be changes on both the supply and demand sides. The Stars and Stripes are the most <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48586217\" title=\"\">successful</a> team, having won the World Cup three times and four Olympic gold medals. The US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/04/england-usa-womens-football-school-fa-close-the-gap\" title=\"\">maintains</a> a pipeline of talent via a federal law that forces universities to spend as much on women\u2019s sport as on men\u2019s. The result is that while England has 120,000 female players registered, in the US the figure is 1.6m. There needs to be more attention focused on the grassroots here.</p> <p>The talent needs somewhere to go. England\u2019s Women\u2019s Super League (WSL), with 12 teams, is Europe\u2019s only full-time professional competition. Yet its clubs cannot stand on their own two feet. Some rely on Premier League <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/14/womens-super-league-professional-success-top-clubs-sponsorship-crowds\" title=\"\">backing</a> to survive. Without the crowds \u2013 a WSL match averages just 1,000 fans \u2013 the game cannot thrive. It is remarkable that Sunderland, which provided the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-cup/2019/07/01/north-east-backbone-england-world-cup-squad-may-threat/\" title=\"\">backbone</a> of the present England squad, can no longer run a professional women\u2019s team. Women\u2019s football in England is in danger of becoming a southern sport \u2013 with no professional teams north of Manchester. That cannot be right.</p> <p>Finance drives the US success. Between 2016 and 2018 women\u2019s games <a href=\"https://www.sportbusiness.com/news/revealed-us-womens-soccer-team-generated-more-revenue-than-men/\" title=\"\">generated</a> about \u00a340.7m in revenue, a fraction more than the men.

      "bodyText": "When England face Sweden tomorrow in the third-place play-off of the eighth Women\u2019s World Cup, the nation will be justly proud of the players\u2019 achievements. The Lionesses have provided at times breathless and exciting football, scoring more goals in France than at any previous World Cup. Phil Neville, the team\u2019s manager, has an enviable record of just four defeats in 23 matches. England\u2019s semi-final loss to the United States this week was the biggest UK television event of the year, with the BBC\u2019s peak figure of 11.7m taking more than half of the audience share \u2013 a fivefold increase on England\u2019s semi-final against Japan four years ago. Women\u2019s football has come of age in time to make the very most of such a moment. Across western Europe it is growing in popularity. The misogyny of the past, which saw women\u2019s football banned in England, has thankfully gone. Sexism, unfortunately, has not completely disappeared: Patrice Evra, the former French captain who appeared as a pundit during last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup, applauded his female English co-panellist Eni Aluko, who writes for the Guardian, as if astonished to hear a woman offer a fluent and pointed analysis. It is a good thing for the beautiful game that such attitudes are the exception rather than the rule. To capitalise on the surge of interest, there must be changes on both the supply and demand sides. The Stars and Stripes are the most successful team, having won the World Cup three times and four Olympic gold medals. The US maintains a pipeline of talent via a federal law that forces universities to spend as much on women\u2019s sport as on men\u2019s. The result is that while England has 120,000 female players registered, in the US the figure is 1.6m. There needs to be more attention focused on the grassroots here. The talent needs somewhere to go. England\u2019s Women\u2019s Super League (WSL), with 12 teams, is Europe\u2019s only full-time professional competition. Yet its clubs cannot stand on their own two feet. Some rely on Premier League backing to survive. Without the crowds \u2013 a WSL match averages just 1,000 fans \u2013 the game cannot thrive. It is remarkable that Sunderland, which provided the backbone of the present England squad, can no longer run a professional women\u2019s team. Women\u2019s football in England is in danger of becoming a southern sport \u2013 with no professional teams north of Manchester. That cannot be right. Finance drives the US success. Between 2016 and 2018 women\u2019s games generated about \u00a340.7m in revenue, a fraction more than the men. Rightly, the US women\u2019s team is fighting for equal pay. This would be a nice problem to have. Perhaps the key is broadcasting women\u2019s top division games live on the BBC. It is clear that there is an appetite and high-profile exposure would help drive supporters to the matches. This in turn would increase funding for women\u2019s football through commercial deals. That we are even discussing such things shows that, win or lose on the pitch, women\u2019s football has triumphed.",

The sentences will run consecutively.</p> <p>At an earlier hearing at Southwark crown court in April, Cohen was found guilty of fraud relating to housing benefits to the value of \u00a3233,000.</p> <p>The Met analysed bank accounts linked to Chabad UK and found the number of transactions dramatically increased from March 2012.</p> <p>From March 2012, 14 bank accounts which received payments from the merchant accounts were opened in the names of charities and companies associated with Chabad UK.</p> <p>Between March 2012 and September 2014, nine companies of the Chabad UK group \u2013 seven of which were registered charities \u2013 processed more than \u00a310.3m.

      "bodyText": "A man has been jailed for almost 10 years for selling counterfeit erectile dysfunction and slimming pills and laundering more than \u00a310m through bank accounts linked to a Jewish charity. The Met police identified a number of websites offering erectile dysfunction medication and slimming aids, primarily for customers in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and France, during an investigation in 2013. Card payments for the products were received by a group of companies based in Stamford Hill, north London, and linked to Chabad UK, a charity administrated by Edward Cohen, 67. Chabad UK is entirely separate from Chabad Lubavitch UK and is not part of the official Chabad movement. Cohen was previously convicted of benefit fraud but fled the country before the new trial, the Jewish Chronicle reported. On 21 June, Cohen was found guilty in his absence of two charges of money laundering, one charge of theft and one charge of supplying false information to the Charity Commission. On Thursday, he was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years for money laundering and theft offences, and two years and three months\u2019 imprisonment for the benefit fraud. The sentences will run consecutively. At an earlier hearing at Southwark crown court in April, Cohen was found guilty of fraud relating to housing benefits to the value of \u00a3233,000. The Met analysed bank accounts linked to Chabad UK and found the number of transactions dramatically increased from March 2012. From March 2012, 14 bank accounts which received payments from the merchant accounts were opened in the names of charities and companies associated with Chabad UK. Between March 2012 and September 2014, nine companies of the Chabad UK group \u2013 seven of which were registered charities \u2013 processed more than \u00a310.3m. The Met said a very small proportion of transactions were confirmed as legitimate charitable donations. During this period, \u00a38.6m was transferred to foreign exchange accounts, and \u00a31,.7m was transferred to a number of money service bureaus. Thousands of pounds were also transferred to the Cohen\u2019s personal accounts. The issue was referred to police after a number of pharmaceutical companies had received complaints from customers receiving counterfeit medication. The Met said there was also an increase in the number of \u201cchargebacks\u201d \u2013 when the customer requests a refund often owing to goods being faulty or not received \u2013 on these merchant accounts. DSJohn Nagle from the north-west command unit, who led the investigation, said: \u201cEdward Cohen set up a pan-European operation selling dangerous counterfeit medication to thousands of unsuspecting people, pocketing millions of pounds in the process. \u201cIn an effort to conceal the profits from Edward\u2019s business venture and with full knowledge that what he was doing was illegal, the money was funnelled through bank accounts set up by a legitimate charity that he ran. \u201cEdward Cohen also transferred large sums from donations made to the charity in good faith into his own bank accounts, which paid for rent and other personal expenses.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 9 July 2019 to clarify the entirely separate nature of Chabad UK from Chabad Lubavitch UK and the official Chabad movement.",

      "body": "<p>Maybe we\u2019re too busy laughing to see it. Perhaps it\u2019s the jokes and memes that Donald Trump generates in abundance, the gift that keeps on giving, that blinds us to a chilling fact that we\u2019d rather not face. Put simply, the leader of the world\u2019s most powerful nation is behaving like an authoritarian dictator, one who threatens democracy in his own country and far beyond.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s the latest example of how the comedy can distract. On Thursday Donald Trump marked the Fourth of July by praising the US military, invoking the heroism of an army that defeated the British in the 18th century in part because \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/05/flight-of-fancy-trump-claims-1775-revolutionary-army-took-over-airports\" title=\"\">it took over the airports</a>\u201d. Lol: behold, the ignoramus president.

      "bodyText": "Maybe we\u2019re too busy laughing to see it. Perhaps it\u2019s the jokes and memes that Donald Trump generates in abundance, the gift that keeps on giving, that blinds us to a chilling fact that we\u2019d rather not face. Put simply, the leader of the world\u2019s most powerful nation is behaving like an authoritarian dictator, one who threatens democracy in his own country and far beyond. Here\u2019s the latest example of how the comedy can distract. On Thursday Donald Trump marked the Fourth of July by praising the US military, invoking the heroism of an army that defeated the British in the 18th century in part because \u201cit took over the airports\u201d. Lol: behold, the ignoramus president. Cue more chuckles as Trump delivered that speech during a downpour, the Almighty himself apparently deciding to rain on Trump\u2019s parade. But all those giggles served to obscure the more pressing fact: that in a departure from all precedent, Trump had used Independence Day to stage a military display, in which M1A2 tanks and Bradley armoured vehicles rolled into Washington, while fighter jets and helicopters filled the sky. The generals, mindful of the need to separate military and political power, had long opposed this extravaganza and, tellingly, most of the joint chiefs contrived to stay away. They understood that such a pageant is the stuff of despots, not democrats. Another image framed this split-screen 4 July: that of the children, separated from their parents, who are caged in detention camps on America\u2019s southern border. Accounts by lawyers and doctors who were allowed brief visits to these hellish places are almost unbearable to read: children deprived of sleep, denied access to blankets or mattresses, not allowed to wash their hands or brush their teeth; toddlers left alone on cold, hard floors, so traumatised they sit in stunned, tearless silence. I\u2019m especially haunted by the report of \u201ca suicidal four-year-old whose face was covered in bloody, self-inflicted scratches\u201d. This too is what dictators do: demonising a group \u2013 in this case, migrants \u2013 as an alien threat, an army of invaders, so intensely and for so long that eventually any fate, no matter how brutal or inhumane, seems deserved, even when it is inflicted on that group\u2019s youngest and most vulnerable members. Breaking up families, caging children in hot, fetid, disease-ridden camps \u2013 this is what dictators do. But we hesitate to see it for what it is. Again, the laughter gets in the way. So we snigger at Ivanka Trump ludicrously barging her way into a powwow of world leaders, making a meme of #uninvitedIvanka, rather than confronting head-on the reality that Trump is doing what dictators always do: he\u2019s building a hereditary dynasty, so that his power won\u2019t end with his death. Those images at the G20 looked absurd to us, but they will take their place in the showreel, so that, come the 2024 or 2028 elections, they can be used as proof of Ivanka\u2019s supposed experience on the global stage.

      "bodyText": "An invariably bewitching era will end on Saturday as Karen Carney pulls on her boots for one final time before retiring from football. As one of England\u2019s most-gifted and most-capped players, the now former Chelsea winger could not have picked a better setting for that swansong than the foothills above the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur where the Stade de Nice stages the third-place play-off between England and Sweden. \u201cKaren will get her 144th cap at some point,\u201d confirmed Phil Neville as he sat next to a near tearful Carney on the Riviera on Friday. Despite the emotion in her voice, she was adamant it was the right moment to announce a decision that had been under discussion with England\u2019s manager for 12 months. The 31-year-old has sensed for some time that her body was no longer keeping up with one of the sharpest brains in the game. \u201cMy mind can still do everything but I don\u2019t think my body can,\u201d said the former Birmingham, Arsenal and Chicago Red Stars player. \u201cMy mind wants to continue playing until I\u2019m 100 but my body tells me enough\u2019s enough. It\u2019s the right decision; I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve anything more in the tank. I\u2019ve given my heart and soul for my clubs and my country. So, no regrets.\u201d Not that it is easy to walk away from a sport which has, in many ways, been her life. \u201cThe thing I\u2019ll miss most is singing the national anthem before internationals,\u201d said Carney, who delayed telling teammates her big news until after breakfast on Friday. \u201cThat and kicking a ball.\u201d Perhaps surprisingly she names Euro 2005 as the zenith of her career. \u201cIt was the best bit, my first tournament and in England too,\u201d she said. \u201cBut biggest highlight was telling my mum I\u2019d be playing for England after my first call-up.\u201d She is not sure what happens now although media work will beckon. \u201cI\u2019d feel quite empty if I couldn\u2019t give something back to football in some way,\u201d she said. \u201cMy first job was in Sainsbury\u2019s, where my mum worked, so I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have had done without football. But as a player you\u2019re so selfish, so self-driven you sometimes forget the most important people in your life. That\u2019s not in a malicious way, it\u2019s what you have to do, but now I\u2019d like to give something back to the people who\u2019ve supported me.\u201d As keen as Neville is to offer a fitting sendoff to Carney \u2013 a player he has bonded with and describes as \u201can amazing person\u201d \u2013 he will not allow sentiment to intrude on attempts to secure the bronze medal. He admits the most concerning defeat of his tenure came against Sweden in Rotherham last November when a 2-0 friendly defeat \u201cruined my Christmas\u201d and he is anxious to avoid a repeat. \u201cSweden are a brilliant team \u2013 they\u2019re good tactically and strong physically,\u201d he said. \u201cOur challenge now is: \u2018Can we beat solid, well organised, consistent sides like them?\u2019 The bronze is not the medal we wanted to win and it\u2019ll be tough but it\u2019s the only one we can have.\u201d Much hinges on how the pair cope with the respective disappointments of semi-finals defeats by USA and the Netherlands. \u201cWe\u2019re hurting and Sweden will be hurting,\u201d said Neville, who will be without the suspended Millie Bright but intends fielding his strongest available team. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a mental test: can you get yourself up? They\u2019ll be thinking they probably should have beaten the Netherlands but we want to have something to show for this tournament. I want to be lying on a sunbed on holiday next week happy we\u2019ve won bronze.\u201d England know that, in future, their manager will demand more of them. \u201cMy players are under no illusions that the effort has to go up,\u201d said Neville, who made clear he would \u201cwelcome\u201d the Premier League taking over the running of the WSL. \u201cAt the moment we\u2019re a team that likes to complete 12 laps but it\u2019s got to become 20 because we\u2019re all sick of losing semi-finals. My players have realised that, physically, winning hurts and now we need to start kicking on. A lot of people talk about us inspiring people but the ultimate inspiration is actually winning a trophy.\u201d The England forward Toni Duggan is leaving Barcelona after two seasons but has not revealed her next club.",

You could forgive them for resenting the opportunities of the next generation. But instead of jealousy, there is immense pride at the hand football dealt.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was 11, I just wanted to play for England,\u201d Carney has said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know when it would happen, how it would happen. I picked that dream and I wanted that dream. I didn\u2019t know how to process it.</p> <p>\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve travelled the world. I went to university. I\u2019ve got a degree. I\u2019ve got a master\u2019s. I\u2019ve met some amazing people, I\u2019ve lived my dream. I\u2019ve picked up so many skill sets that I never would have. I haven\u2019t made a lot of money but I\u2019m comfortable. I have food, clothes on my back and my family. For me, I\u2019ll never be bitter.\u201d</p> <p>It is an attitude befitting the humble, softly spoken player. Her lack of self-promotion is perhaps born of her working-class background. Her first job was in Sainsbury\u2019s alongside her mum, and it is where she thinks she would still be without football.</p> <p>Yet although she was quiet, her quality on the pitch was loud. Because Carney was one of those rare players, like Kelly Smith, whose natural talent helped power arguments about the potential of the game when training and coaching barely existed. She made you say \u201cwow\u201d in the absence of her ability being nurtured to its full extent.</p> <p>The trust of Emma Hayes in the winger meant that where she coached Carney went. As Hayes moved from assistant at Arsenal to Chicago Red Stars, so did Carney; after a return to Birmingham, Carney was recruited by Hayes to help power her Chelsea revolution. Hayes told the BBC: \u201cI\u2019ve got to be honest, I\u2019m absolutely devastated that she\u2019s retiring but I\u2019m so proud of her for all of her achievements throughout her career.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll personally feel like I\u2019ve lost a limb when I go back to pre-season. I\u2019m going to miss her terribly. She is a fabulous role model. She\u2019s achieved everything she wanted to in her game and I\u2019m thankful for that.\u201d</p> <p>Only England\u2019s most-capped player \u2013 male or female \u2013 Fara Williams, has more appearances for the country than Carney\u2019s 143. When her retirement was announced, many felt the same pang as Hayes. At 31 it just feels too soon to say goodbye. Kaz was, and is, a trailblazer.</p>",

I\u2019ve got a master\u2019s. I\u2019ve met some amazing people, I\u2019ve lived my dream. I\u2019ve picked up so many skill sets that I never would have. I haven\u2019t made a lot of money but I\u2019m comfortable. I have food, clothes on my back and my family. For me, I\u2019ll never be bitter.\u201d It is an attitude befitting the humble, softly spoken player. Her lack of self-promotion is perhaps born of her working-class background. Her first job was in Sainsbury\u2019s alongside her mum, and it is where she thinks she would still be without football. Yet although she was quiet, her quality on the pitch was loud. Because Carney was one of those rare players, like Kelly Smith, whose natural talent helped power arguments about the potential of the game when training and coaching barely existed. She made you say \u201cwow\u201d in the absence of her ability being nurtured to its full extent. The trust of Emma Hayes in the winger meant that where she coached Carney went. As Hayes moved from assistant at Arsenal to Chicago Red Stars, so did Carney; after a return to Birmingham, Carney was recruited by Hayes to help power her Chelsea revolution. Hayes told the BBC: \u201cI\u2019ve got to be honest, I\u2019m absolutely devastated that she\u2019s retiring but I\u2019m so proud of her for all of her achievements throughout her career. \u201cI\u2019ll personally feel like I\u2019ve lost a limb when I go back to pre-season. I\u2019m going to miss her terribly. She is a fabulous role model. She\u2019s achieved everything she wanted to in her game and I\u2019m thankful for that.\u201d Only England\u2019s most-capped player \u2013 male or female \u2013 Fara Williams, has more appearances for the country than Carney\u2019s 143. When her retirement was announced, many felt the same pang as Hayes. At 31 it just feels too soon to say goodbye. Kaz was, and is, a trailblazer.",

They currently house about 4,500 people, including 1,300 who have already been tried and convicted and should have been moved to less crowded facilities in Baghdad. Most are being held on terrorism charges under Iraq\u2019s sweeping counter-terrorism legislation. None have access to lawyers and there is no clear legal basis for their detentions, HRW says, calling for the use of pre-trial detention as a last resort and the release of detained children in accordance with UN rules. As well as longstanding concerns over inhumane prison conditions and unfair trials, rights groups have repeatedly accused Iraqi forces of unlawful interrogations and torture and of executing men and boys believed to be former Isis fighters, which could amount to war crimes. \u201cWe documented these abuses two years ago and very little has been done to alleviate the situation,\u201d said Belkis Wille, a senior Iraq researcher at HRW. \u201cAs long as the policy is to detain anyone who may have assisted Isis, even if they were forced to, even if they were medical staff or clerks, this problem is going to persist. There is no discussion around national reconciliation or any alternative strategy.\u201d The situation in Iraq\u2019s prisons could be set to worsen: Baghdad is in talks with the US to transfer and place on trial tens of thousands of suspected Isis fighters and their families from detention centres in Syria to Iraq for a multibillion-dollar fee. Isis was defeated in its last stronghold, in Baghuz on the Syrian-Iraqi border, in March. The thousands of international fighters and their families who are among the last remnants of the so-called caliphate pose a legal headache for their countries of origin, which are under pressure from the US to repatriate citizens for trial at home. Conditions in Kurdish-run facilities in Syria for suspected Isis members are also dire. Al-Hol camp is home to 74,000 people, 65% of whom are children under the age of 12.",

      "bodyText": "The \u201cseven-year rule\u201d on gift-giving should be cut to five years as part of a radical shake-up of inheritance tax, according to an official review ordered by the chancellor. The Office of Tax Simplification (OTS) has proposed that executors would only need to account for gifts made within five years of death rather than seven years currently. But some tax experts said another proposed change linked to this would increase tax for some people. Inheritance tax has been dubbed Britain\u2019s most hated tax, although it affects relatively few people: fewer than 25,000 estates are liable each year, which is less than 5% of all deaths. Estates pay 40% tax on assets above the \u00a3325,000 threshold, and the OTS has now proposed changes to make the system more streamlined. Under the current regime, if there is tax to pay on gifts it is charged at 40% on those given in the three years before the individual dies, while those given three to seven years before death are taxed on a sliding scale known as taper relief. The OTS said the government should reduce the seven-year period to five years, so gifts to individuals made more than five years before death would be exempt, though it added that this would result in a loss of government revenue. The report also proposed scrapping taper relief, though it acknowledged this would create a \u201ccliff edge\u201d at the five-year point, where just one day would make the difference between paying 40% tax and nothing at all. The OTS also called for the confusing array of gift exemptions to be swept away and replaced with a \u201csingle personal gift allowance\u201d, which would allow an individual to give up to a fixed amount each year. This would mean the end of the annual exemption, where someone can give away \u00a33,000 worth of gifts each tax year without them being added to the value of their estate. This amount has been frozen since 1981 and would be \u00a311,900 today had it increased in line with inflation. Bill Dodwell, the OTS\u2019s tax director, said the single allowance should be set \u201cat a sensible level\u201d. Tax experts broadly welcomed the proposed changes.

Neither do I, who have nurtured and publicised the \u201cWindrush phenomenon\u201d since 1995. Baroness Benjamin did not consult with me or any other director of Windrush Foundation.</p> <p>The Empire Windrush passengers arrived at Tilbury Docks on 22 June 1948, and Sam King was one of them. Some passengers travelled through Fenchurch Street (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/22/windrush-generation-to-be-honoured-by-waterloo-monument\" title=\"\">not Waterloo station</a>), and 236 men went to Clapham South deep-level (air raid) shelter, where they found temporary accommodation.</p> <p>Within a few days, the mayor of Lambeth held a reception for them, and this was the only one they received. The local member of parliament spoke up for them. The passengers visited the local employment exchange in Brixton and soon found work, and set up home in the area.</p> <p>Brixton was the first \u201cWindrush community\u201d in 1948 and it is still going strong today. Windrush Square, in the centre of Brixton, commemorates and celebrates the contributions of the Windrush passengers, and it is there that the monument should be installed. They are the ones who laid the foundation for those of us who arrived later. Having the monument in Windrush Square would be the right \u201csymbolic link to our past as we celebrate our future\u201d, to quote Baroness Benjamin\u2019s words.

      "bodyText": "The late Sam King, a co-founder of Windrush Foundation, would not have agreed with Floella Benjamin\u2019s suggestion that Waterloo station is an appropriate site for a Windrush monument (Letters, 26 June). Neither do I, who have nurtured and publicised the \u201cWindrush phenomenon\u201d since 1995. Baroness Benjamin did not consult with me or any other director of Windrush Foundation. The Empire Windrush passengers arrived at Tilbury Docks on 22 June 1948, and Sam King was one of them. Some passengers travelled through Fenchurch Street (not Waterloo station), and 236 men went to Clapham South deep-level (air raid) shelter, where they found temporary accommodation. Within a few days, the mayor of Lambeth held a reception for them, and this was the only one they received. The local member of parliament spoke up for them. The passengers visited the local employment exchange in Brixton and soon found work, and set up home in the area. Brixton was the first \u201cWindrush community\u201d in 1948 and it is still going strong today. Windrush Square, in the centre of Brixton, commemorates and celebrates the contributions of the Windrush passengers, and it is there that the monument should be installed. They are the ones who laid the foundation for those of us who arrived later. Having the monument in Windrush Square would be the right \u201csymbolic link to our past as we celebrate our future\u201d, to quote Baroness Benjamin\u2019s words. This would materialise Sam King\u2019s dreams and legacy. Arthur Torrington Director, Windrush Foundation",

A triptych of hot and lumpy stages, visiting Saint-\u00c9tienne, Brioude and Albi, fall before the first day in the Pyrenees on stage 12. The only individual time trial, centred on Pau, prefaces two Pyrenean summit finishes, the first to the Col du Tourmalet, the second to the remote and wild Foix-Prat d\u2019Albis. Two transition days lead to the decisive Alpine finishes in Valloire, Tignes and Val Thorens, that climax a Tour which is sure to have a high fallout rate as the mountains take their toll. The route favours the Paris-Nice and Tour of Switzerland winner, Bernal, rather than Thomas but double-headed leaderships in the Tour do not have an illustrious history and have been characterised by as many bitter feuds as they have warm celebratory embraces. The infamous one between Greg LeMond and Bernard Hinault during the 1986 Tour was perhaps the most rancorous but the rift between Froome and Bradley Wiggins in 2012 was almost as intense. If the Ineos duo are starting the Tour all sweetness and light, the same could be said of the Tour\u2019s other double acts of Simon and Adam Yates at the Mitchelton-Scott team, Nibali and Rohan Dennis at Bahrain-Merida and the trio of podium contenders, Nairo Quintana, Alejandro Valverde and Mikel Landa, at the Movistar team. Froome\u2019s is a significant absence, not just for Ineos but for the other teams. In recent years so many of the other overall contenders have based their game plan around Froome and there is no doubt that his mere presence was a daunting factor.

Another German captain of a search-and-rescue ship, Klemp, 35, is potentially facing up to 20 years in prison over her role in saving 6,000 people from drowning in the Mediterranean. At the beginning of 2017, the Italian government railed against the large numbers of people being rescued and brought to their ports, and the lack of support from the EU\u2019s other 27 member states.

Instead of Jewish members leaving Labour, Labour members joined the Jewish community.</p> <p>Last September many took heart when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/04/labour-adopts-ihra-antisemitism-definition-in-full\" title=\"\">Labour </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/04/labour-adopts-ihra-antisemitism-definition-in-full\" title=\"\">party formally adopted</a> the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism. But it was a false dawn. In the ensuing months, it became clear that such a change in policy could never be enough. And just when you think that things cannot get worse, they do.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Words will not be enough: we need a radical change of policy to change the whole culture of our movement</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For somewhere along the way it became possible for a Labour MP, close to the leader, to suggest that in dealing with antisemitism we were being \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/feb/27/chris-williamson-says-labour-has-been-too-apologetic-about-antisemitism-video\" title=\"\">too apologetic</a>\u201d. As if the real issue was not the sheer volume of uninvestigated incidents \u2013 which clearly required an apology \u2013 and what I call \u201cthe web of poison\u201d, with some members of the Labour party (largely via Twitter, Facebook and other social media) spreading and normalising messages that seek to justify and propagate a centuries-old antisemitism. These messages are not appearing by accident: they are specifically designed by antisemites to lure people into targeting and demonising the Jewish people as a whole.</p> <p>Of course, this poison is not restricted to the Jewish community or to Labour. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/17/eu-islamophobia-britain-orban-china-muslims\" title=\"\">Islamophobes</a> who use social media to condemn all Muslims also exhibit a racism that disfigures more and more of our society \u2013 especially now that a populist nationalism, which needs enemies, is on the rise.</p> <p>Antisemitism takes many forms, both ancient and modern. Legitimate criticism of the actions of the government of Israel is sometimes exploited to promote the age-old vilification of the entire Jewish community. And there are despicable attempts to allege a Jewish-capitalist conspiracy \u2013 a revival of the discredited and darkest antisemitic creeds of the past.</p> <p>We cannot go on ignoring the consequences of the upsurge in hate and hate speech. A UK Jewish community of just 300,000 \u2013 already suffering from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/07/antisemitic-incidents-uk-record-high-third-year-in-row-community-security-trust\" title=\"\">record number of antisemitic incidents</a>, including attacks on synagogues and Jewish schools \u2013 is now facing a massive increase in online abuse, all too often in the form of sinister, anonymous and untraceable internet trolling.</p> <p>No individual or community should be treated in this way. We have to call out antisemitism for what it is: racism. In this case, anti-Jewish racism. Even the suggestion that the Labour party is in any way silent, ambiguous or ambivalent in its response to such a toxic environment shames us all. Because opposing antisemitism and every manifestation of racism goes to the heart of who we are and what we stand for as Labour members. It\u2019s about the moral soul of a party whose most basic goal is a commitment to equality for all \u2013 not just for some who suffer oppression \u2013 but for everyone.</p> <p>To fail to act, even against a single case of abuse, means we are not living up to the principles of the Labour party we joined. And so it\u2019s now time for our leadership, the national executive committee (NEC) and Labour conference to face up to the scale of a problem we have, for far too long, failed to address. Much as we might like to, we cannot now turn the clock back or undo the hurt that has been caused. Nor can we erase the memory of the damage done. Words will not be enough: we need a radical change of policy, starting at our September conference, not just to eliminate antisemitism but to change the whole culture of our movement. Automatic expulsion is the procedure we adopt when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/labour-expels-alastair-campbell-from-party\" title=\"\">members vote for or support other political parties</a>. When the offence is as counter to our core principles as antisemitism, we cannot, in all conscience, be less demanding and less immediate in our response. We should automatically expel \u2013 and not just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/28/labour-mps-make-third-attempt-to-censure-chris-williamson\" title=\"\">suspend</a> \u2013 in cases where there is irrefutable evidence of antisemitism or any kind of racism.</p> <p>Of course, we should ensure the right to an appeal, but the appeal system has to be independent of the Labour party\u2019s hierarchy, with members chosen for their standing and integrity among the public \u2013 and after consultation with the Jewish and other communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/28/labour-corbyn-williamson-antisemitism\">Of all the hills to die on, why on earth has Labour chosen Chris Williamson? | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And while I gave the go-ahead under the last Labour government for the establishment of a post-Holocaust envoy, it is now clear we need to go much further. The next Labour government should announce it will appoint a designated minister, backed up by an ambassador. This role should be to combat antisemitism \u2013 by monitoring and reporting on its evil presence and pressurising governments everywhere to eradicate it.</p> <p>When, in 2016, the Equality and Human Rights Commission <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/human-rights-watchdog-urgent-action-deep-rooted-inequality\" title=\"\">reviewed 50 years of anti-racist legislation</a> and enforcement, it called on the government to formulate a comprehensive anti-racism strategy fit for new times. The need is more urgent now and, in preparation for the next Labour government, we should consult on a new and broader strategy that begins with better education in our schools \u2013 for example, we should do more to support the work of the Holocaust Educational Trust \u2013 and include stronger laws against racism in all its forms.</p> <p>Some will suggest that focusing time and effort on fighting antisemitism is a diversion from the task of persuading people of the merits of the party\u2019s progressive economic and social philosophy.</p> <p>But standing up to racism is not a distraction from, or obstacle to, the realisation of our egalitarian ideals. It is, in fact, the most fundamental expression of them: a challenge far greater than simply talking about a fairer world for those suffering injustice \u2013 striving ceaselessly and unequivocally to realise that ideal.</p> <p>\u2022 Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010.

Last September many took heart when the Labour party formally adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism. But it was a false dawn. In the ensuing months, it became clear that such a change in policy could never be enough. And just when you think that things cannot get worse, they do. For somewhere along the way it became possible for a Labour MP, close to the leader, to suggest that in dealing with antisemitism we were being \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d. As if the real issue was not the sheer volume of uninvestigated incidents \u2013 which clearly required an apology \u2013 and what I call \u201cthe web of poison\u201d, with some members of the Labour party (largely via Twitter, Facebook and other social media) spreading and normalising messages that seek to justify and propagate a centuries-old antisemitism. These messages are not appearing by accident: they are specifically designed by antisemites to lure people into targeting and demonising the Jewish people as a whole. Of course, this poison is not restricted to the Jewish community or to Labour. Islamophobes who use social media to condemn all Muslims also exhibit a racism that disfigures more and more of our society \u2013 especially now that a populist nationalism, which needs enemies, is on the rise. Antisemitism takes many forms, both ancient and modern. Legitimate criticism of the actions of the government of Israel is sometimes exploited to promote the age-old vilification of the entire Jewish community. And there are despicable attempts to allege a Jewish-capitalist conspiracy \u2013 a revival of the discredited and darkest antisemitic creeds of the past. We cannot go on ignoring the consequences of the upsurge in hate and hate speech. A UK Jewish community of just 300,000 \u2013 already suffering from a record number of antisemitic incidents, including attacks on synagogues and Jewish schools \u2013 is now facing a massive increase in online abuse, all too often in the form of sinister, anonymous and untraceable internet trolling. No individual or community should be treated in this way. We have to call out antisemitism for what it is: racism. In this case, anti-Jewish racism. Even the suggestion that the Labour party is in any way silent, ambiguous or ambivalent in its response to such a toxic environment shames us all. Because opposing antisemitism and every manifestation of racism goes to the heart of who we are and what we stand for as Labour members. It\u2019s about the moral soul of a party whose most basic goal is a commitment to equality for all \u2013 not just for some who suffer oppression \u2013 but for everyone. To fail to act, even against a single case of abuse, means we are not living up to the principles of the Labour party we joined. And so it\u2019s now time for our leadership, the national executive committee (NEC) and Labour conference to face up to the scale of a problem we have, for far too long, failed to address. Much as we might like to, we cannot now turn the clock back or undo the hurt that has been caused. Nor can we erase the memory of the damage done. Words will not be enough: we need a radical change of policy, starting at our September conference, not just to eliminate antisemitism but to change the whole culture of our movement. Automatic expulsion is the procedure we adopt when members vote for or support other political parties. When the offence is as counter to our core principles as antisemitism, we cannot, in all conscience, be less demanding and less immediate in our response. We should automatically expel \u2013 and not just suspend \u2013 in cases where there is irrefutable evidence of antisemitism or any kind of racism. Of course, we should ensure the right to an appeal, but the appeal system has to be independent of the Labour party\u2019s hierarchy, with members chosen for their standing and integrity among the public \u2013 and after consultation with the Jewish and other communities. And while I gave the go-ahead under the last Labour government for the establishment of a post-Holocaust envoy, it is now clear we need to go much further. The next Labour government should announce it will appoint a designated minister, backed up by an ambassador. This role should be to combat antisemitism \u2013 by monitoring and reporting on its evil presence and pressurising governments everywhere to eradicate it. When, in 2016, the Equality and Human Rights Commission reviewed 50 years of anti-racist legislation and enforcement, it called on the government to formulate a comprehensive anti-racism strategy fit for new times. The need is more urgent now and, in preparation for the next Labour government, we should consult on a new and broader strategy that begins with better education in our schools \u2013 for example, we should do more to support the work of the Holocaust Educational Trust \u2013 and include stronger laws against racism in all its forms. Some will suggest that focusing time and effort on fighting antisemitism is a diversion from the task of persuading people of the merits of the party\u2019s progressive economic and social philosophy. But standing up to racism is not a distraction from, or obstacle to, the realisation of our egalitarian ideals. It is, in fact, the most fundamental expression of them: a challenge far greater than simply talking about a fairer world for those suffering injustice \u2013 striving ceaselessly and unequivocally to realise that ideal. \u2022 Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010. He will deliver the 17th annual Isaiah Berlin Lecture on Sunday in London \u2022 This article was amended on 10 July 2019 because an earlier version misnamed the Equality and Human Rights Commission as the Equalities and Human Rights Commission.

Late last year, the Guardian and Documented reported that the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) held nearly US$8m in stock in Geo Group and CoreCivic, which between them hold the lion\u2019s share of contracts to manage Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention facilities in the US. The CPPIB, which manages C$392bn (US$299bn) in pension funds on behalf of 20 million Canadians, did not make a public statement when it dropped the two companies from its list of foreign public equity holdings, but the change was spotted this week by the federal MP Charlie Angus, a member of the opposition New Democratic party. On Friday, he called on the CPPIB to publicly acknowledge the divestment and take a position on ethical investing. \u201cEthical investments are essential to maintaining public confidence in what the Canadian Pension Plan does, and the investments in Geo Group and CoreCivic were deeply offensive to Canadian values,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s a crock to say the market should be blind and we\u2019ll go where we can make the easiest money. I mean, there\u2019s all kinds of places to make easy money.\u201d The NDP has tabled a bill, C-431, asking that the pension board abide by greater ethical standards. Angus believes public pressure convinced the CPPIB to drop its holdings. After the US migrant crisis began, advocacy groups SumOfUs and LeadNow collected more than 55,000 signatures on petitions calling for the CPPIB to drop Geo Group and CoreCivic from its investment portfolio. Activists also attended public CPPIB meetings to demand divestment. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing testament to [our] members and the power of people to come together and make real change and say, \u2018We don\u2019t want our pensions funding Trump\u2019s anti-immigration policies,\u2019\u201d said Amelia Meister, senior campaigner at SumOfUs.

      "bodyText": "The role of donors to Tory leadership candidates has come into focus after it emerged Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have taken money from a climate change denier, a director of companies based in tax havens, a fox hunting enthusiast, fast food millionaires and a banker with close links to the Saudi regime, among others. An analysis of the past nine months of donations and other declared income to the pair shows that if attracting money is an indication of likely success, then Johnson appears set for an easy win. He has far outstripped Hunt under any metric of funding, amassing well over double the amount in donations, and more than \u00a31m overall since November in donations and income from speeches and other sources. The figures, drawn from the regularly updated register of members\u2019 interests, in which MPs must declare all donations of \u00a31,500 or more, also illustrate the often opaque world of UK political financing, not least the incredibly narrow social and professional world from which donors come. While there is no guarantee a wealthy individual with an interest in a particular area will be able to shape policy or gain influence, it is pertinent to know who is handing over money \u2013 and the big sums involved. How much have the candidates raised? Since November last year, amid the early signs of a Tory leadership race was likely, Johnson has declared more than \u00a31m in money via the register of MPs\u2019 interests. About \u00a3415,000 is from donations, with more than \u00a3330,000 given since May. About \u00a3385,000 came in fees for speeches, including \u00a3123,000 for a single address to a media conference in Delhi. Johnson also receives \u00a323,000 a month for his Telegraph column, and makes money from book royalties. Hunt is lagging considerably in donations, having pulled in just under \u00a3186,000 over the same nine-month period, all donated since May. As possibly the richest cabinet minister due to his education publishing business, Hunt has not needed to seek extra income \u2013 and as a minister he would not currently be permitted to do this. Is there a spending limit? Yes there is: under Tory party rules, a maximum of \u00a3135,000 per candidate during the leadership election period. Some of the donations, particularly to Johnson, were given and likely spent before this began, and so would not be subject to this limit. In previous Tory leadership elections, some candidates have given any excess once the race is over to Conservative campaign headquarters for the party to use. Who is giving away all this money? A relatively small and incredibly select group of people, almost entirely from the worlds of finance, banking and property \u2013 who would arguably have a vested interest in lower tax rates for the high-paid (a Johnson proposal), slashing the rate of corporation tax (as Hunt seeks to do), and a government with less interest in regulating businesses. For Johnson, of 27 individual donors who can be identified \u2013 who donated more than \u00a3200,000 between them \u2013 11 work in investment and asset management or similar jobs, with four more owning hedge funds and two being property developers. With corporate donations, Johnson received seven separate contributions from the digger company JCB and its pro-Brexit boss, Anthony Bamford, among others. Of 12 Hunt donors who can be identified from the register, five are connected to investments or private equity, with one running a hedge fund. Hunt\u2019s donors in part also reflect his time as health secretary: they include the director of a healthcare company, and a transplant surgeon. Who are some of the notable donors \u2013 and what do they believe? First Corporate Shipping Ltd: Donating to both Johnson and Hunt, the firm is co-owned by Terence Mordaunt, a strong Brexiter who is a board member of a climate change denial group the Global Warming Policy Forum. The organisation, which was led for years by the former Tory chancellor Nigel Lawson, refuses to say who funds it. Robin Birley: A businessman and property developer, the long-time Brexit supporter previously donated to Ukip under Nigel Farage, and recently attended an event run by the controversial youth group Turning Point UK, which was addressed by Farage. He has now given Johnson \u00a320,000. Graham Robeson: As chief executive of Rowland Capital, Robeson, who gave Johnson \u00a310,000, is the director of companies ultimately based in tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands. Among these is a company that prompted concern in Norfolk by buying up large amounts of land, leaving locals unable to find out who ultimately owned it. Atul and Tarspal \u2018Pinky\u2019 Pathak: Donors of \u00a310,000 to Hunt, the couple started in 2003 with a single franchise of McDonald\u2019s, and now run nearly 40 around London and nearby via their company, APPT Corporation, which has a turnover of more than \u00a370m. Johan Christofferson: The hedge fund manager, who has given Johnson \u00a336,000 in two donations, is a keen supporter of fox hunting. He is joint master of the Jedforest hunt in the Scottish borders, other members of which have been convicted of breaking fox hunting laws. Ken Costa: An investment banker who donated \u00a310,000 to Hunt, he was a UK special envoy to the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, during his efforts to reform the country \u2013 before Salman was heavily implicated in the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year.",

Eurofins, which is thought to carry out about half of all private forensic analysis, was targeted in a ransomware attack on 2 June, which the company described at the time as \u201chighly sophisticated\u201d. Three weeks later the company said its operations were \u201creturning to normal\u201d, but did not disclose whether or not a ransom had been paid. The BBC has reported that the company paid the hackers to regain control of its systems, although it said it had not been told how much money was paid or when any payment was made. Ransomware is a type of computer program that infiltrates an IT system and threatens to publish the victim\u2019s data or block their access to it by encrypting files until a sum of money is paid. Since the attack, police have halted all work with Eurofins, which normally processes more than 70,000 criminal cases each year in the UK, including DNA analysis, toxicology, firearms analysis and computer forensics. The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council launched an emergency response to the cyber-attack to prioritise the flow of forensic submissions so that the most serious crimes could continue to be investigated rapidly. However, cases are being delayed as police struggle to allocate the growing backlog of case work.

      "body": "<p>That rape cases are hard to prosecute is no shocker, but the claim that crime writers are partly to blame shocked me. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/05/crime-writers-react-staunch-prize-claim-hinder-rape-trials\">According to the Staunch prize</a> for books with no violence against women, writers who include sexual violence and rape in their books are contributing to a wider culture in which jurors are \u201creluctant to convict \u2018ordinary\u2019 men\u201d because \u201cthey don\u2019t fit the idea of a rapist they\u2019ve internalised through the stories and images they\u2019ve received through popular culture\u201d. In great thriller tradition, the call is coming from inside the house.</p> <p>As someone who analyses culture for a living and often finds it wanting, I\u2019m in the unaccustomed position of noting that what we\u2019re talking about is, after all, only fiction \u2013 where the bad guys, more often than not, meet a satisfactory justice that reality often fails to provide.</p> <p>My rapist was an ordinary man. I write that sentence not knowing if I mean the fictional Paul Beresford, a fin de si\u00e8cle rake who assaults my heroine Sarah Gilchrist less than a year before her first adventure <a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/kaite-welsh/wages-sin/\">The Wages of Sin</a> opens, or the man who raped me. In both cases, it happened after a party. In both cases, victim and perpetrator shared a circle of friends who would have seen it as her word against his, who had seen them laughing and joking together earlier in the night. They saw them leave the room (Sarah) or the party (me) with the man who, in both cases, later decided he wasn\u2019t interested in what the woman wanted, or didn\u2019t, after all.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>When books contain violence, they do just that: contain it, our real-world fears caught safely within fictional parentheses</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sarah isn\u2019t some flimsy author stand-in \u2013 she\u2019s a medical student in 1890s Edinburgh and I\u2019m a millennial writer who doesn\u2019t know where the spleen is \u2013 but there are similarities. Sarah\u2019s backstory is what it is because, when I sat down to write The Wages of Sin, I couldn\u2019t write about the experience of being a student at Edinburgh in any century without writing about rape. The two were inextricably linked. It\u2019s a depressing origin story, yes \u2013 but then so is Batman\u2019s, and I don\u2019t see prizes set up to reward books with no orphans in them.</p> <p>I doubt I\u2019m the only crime writer who is also a rape victim, and I\u2019m certainly not the only reader whose experiences occasionally overlap with her taste in literature. Women, in particular, consume crime fiction, especially violent crime fiction, at a rate that might seem concerning to some. But when books contain violence, they do just that: contain it, our real-world fears caught safely within fictional parentheses.</p> <p>This is not to say that authors writing about rape can indulge in whatever graphic, schlocky entertainment they wish. In my books, the assault happens offstage but we get glimpses of it, in flashbacks, exposition and small details; in my latest, The Unquiet Heart, the press of a bookcase against Sarah\u2019s back when her love interest consensually kisses her triggers a fight-or-flight response. I have no interest in writing a rape scene. But the aftermath of rape \u2013 the emotional fallout, the PTSD \u2013 that\u2019s where conflict, representation, whatever shred of catharsis I gain can be found.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/05/crime-writers-react-staunch-prize-claim-hinder-rape-trials\">Crime writers react with fury to claim their books hinder rape trials</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I can\u2019t write about a world without rape because I don\u2019t live in one. I won\u2019t sanitise my writing in service of some fictional, feminist utopia. And while I indulge in fictional universes that let me escape, write the world the way I wish it was, my work lies in marrying my imagination with the ugly truth, challenging myself to explore the friction in the places where they collide. I wanted to write someone whose story didn\u2019t end with rape, or even begin with it \u2013 but included it as just another bump in the road that has to be dealt with, worked through and lived with.</p> <p>I was raped in the same place as Sarah in my books; around the corner from Edinburgh\u2019s old medical school. Perhaps this is my way of reclaiming the city I love, by rewriting my past into an imagined and far bloodier history. When I walk nearby, all I see is Sarah\u2019s Edinburgh, not mine. I could have set it somewhere else and avoided the memories \u2013 but I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m letting one man who felt he was entitled to my body deprive me of a bloody good novel setting, or an ugly culture that refuses to believe women deprive me of telling a story that needs to be told.</p> <p>\u2022 The Unquiet Heart by Kaite Welsh is published by Tinder Press; she will be <a href=\"https://www.edbookfest.co.uk/the-festival/whats-on/caroline-lea-kaite-welsh-13283\">appearing at the Edinburgh international book festival in August.</a></p>",

According to the Staunch prize for books with no violence against women, writers who include sexual violence and rape in their books are contributing to a wider culture in which jurors are \u201creluctant to convict \u2018ordinary\u2019 men\u201d because \u201cthey don\u2019t fit the idea of a rapist they\u2019ve internalised through the stories and images they\u2019ve received through popular culture\u201d. In great thriller tradition, the call is coming from inside the house. As someone who analyses culture for a living and often finds it wanting, I\u2019m in the unaccustomed position of noting that what we\u2019re talking about is, after all, only fiction \u2013 where the bad guys, more often than not, meet a satisfactory justice that reality often fails to provide. My rapist was an ordinary man. I write that sentence not knowing if I mean the fictional Paul Beresford, a fin de si\u00e8cle rake who assaults my heroine Sarah Gilchrist less than a year before her first adventure The Wages of Sin opens, or the man who raped me. In both cases, it happened after a party. In both cases, victim and perpetrator shared a circle of friends who would have seen it as her word against his, who had seen them laughing and joking together earlier in the night. They saw them leave the room (Sarah) or the party (me) with the man who, in both cases, later decided he wasn\u2019t interested in what the woman wanted, or didn\u2019t, after all. Sarah isn\u2019t some flimsy author stand-in \u2013 she\u2019s a medical student in 1890s Edinburgh and I\u2019m a millennial writer who doesn\u2019t know where the spleen is \u2013 but there are similarities. Sarah\u2019s backstory is what it is because, when I sat down to write The Wages of Sin, I couldn\u2019t write about the experience of being a student at Edinburgh in any century without writing about rape. The two were inextricably linked. It\u2019s a depressing origin story, yes \u2013 but then so is Batman\u2019s, and I don\u2019t see prizes set up to reward books with no orphans in them. I doubt I\u2019m the only crime writer who is also a rape victim, and I\u2019m certainly not the only reader whose experiences occasionally overlap with her taste in literature. Women, in particular, consume crime fiction, especially violent crime fiction, at a rate that might seem concerning to some. But when books contain violence, they do just that: contain it, our real-world fears caught safely within fictional parentheses. This is not to say that authors writing about rape can indulge in whatever graphic, schlocky entertainment they wish. In my books, the assault happens offstage but we get glimpses of it, in flashbacks, exposition and small details; in my latest, The Unquiet Heart, the press of a bookcase against Sarah\u2019s back when her love interest consensually kisses her triggers a fight-or-flight response. I have no interest in writing a rape scene. But the aftermath of rape \u2013 the emotional fallout, the PTSD \u2013 that\u2019s where conflict, representation, whatever shred of catharsis I gain can be found. I can\u2019t write about a world without rape because I don\u2019t live in one. I won\u2019t sanitise my writing in service of some fictional, feminist utopia. And while I indulge in fictional universes that let me escape, write the world the way I wish it was, my work lies in marrying my imagination with the ugly truth, challenging myself to explore the friction in the places where they collide. I wanted to write someone whose story didn\u2019t end with rape, or even begin with it \u2013 but included it as just another bump in the road that has to be dealt with, worked through and lived with. I was raped in the same place as Sarah in my books; around the corner from Edinburgh\u2019s old medical school. Perhaps this is my way of reclaiming the city I love, by rewriting my past into an imagined and far bloodier history. When I walk nearby, all I see is Sarah\u2019s Edinburgh, not mine. I could have set it somewhere else and avoided the memories \u2013 but I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m letting one man who felt he was entitled to my body deprive me of a bloody good novel setting, or an ugly culture that refuses to believe women deprive me of telling a story that needs to be told. \u2022 The Unquiet Heart by Kaite Welsh is published by Tinder Press; she will be appearing at the Edinburgh international book festival in August.",

Bruguera, quite rightly, insists that integration into a new culture shouldn\u2019t mean leaving your own one behind but using it to enrich the one you\u2019ve entered. This is a call for a multiculturalism currently out of favour. I went to a talk on tea, and the different cultures of tea drinking around the world.

Around them old lockers and shelves are filled with mouldering records of Ghanaian parliamentary debates from the early post-colonial parliament, old schoolbooks, tattered photographs, tangles of lathe shearings, and much besides. There are archive drawers and vitrines. In one, we see a photo of a railway caboose wagon. This is not just for railway buffs. Most affecting is a series of photographs of forearms and hands: every arm tattooed with the name of the itinerant Ghanaian worker it belongs to. They tattooed themselves with their names in case they got injured or killed in their work far from home, so their families could be informed in case of accident.

The title isn\u2019t the only drudge here, in this fog of ideas wraithed in artificial mist and psychobabble. Atmospheric Memory has lots of wow, with its verbal miasmas, voice-activated exhibits, its projections and image-captures of ourselves, surveilled and tracked in our stunned wanderings around his mishmash of an installation. There is too much going on. We are shown the world\u2019s first 3D-printed version of a spoken word (it looks like a misshapen turd); filmed close-ups of vocal chords, opening and closing like weird bivalves and projected into the bottoms of empty oil drums. The actors all had endoscopes down their gullets. As much as this might remind you of Samuel Beckett, Lozano-Hemmer\u2019s gimmicky high-tech art also recalls Mona Hatoum and Susan Hiller, but with more money and much less finesse. It is all overdone. Whisper into a mic and a wall of fog coalesces into the word you\u2019ve just spoken, or a pool of water ripples with the soundwaves. \u201cGo towards the light!\u201d the artist commands as we are herded down a tunnel of amplified seagulls. I ran away. A different approach to language and knowledge is at the core of Tania Bruguera\u2019s School of Integration at Manchester Art Gallery, where a whole floor has been turned into classrooms. Bruguera, quite rightly, insists that integration into a new culture shouldn\u2019t mean leaving your own one behind but using it to enrich the one you\u2019ve entered. This is a call for a multiculturalism currently out of favour. I went to a talk on tea, and the different cultures of tea drinking around the world. There will be cooking, sewing, making things, talking. A haven for people to share experiences and knowledge. Unless they join in, there isn\u2019t much here for visitors. A forum for the pleasure of coming together, and using the gallery as a place in which everyone is a participant, Bruguera\u2019s project is very much in line with Manchester City Art Gallery and the Whitworth\u2019s director Alistair Hudson\u2019s ideas for a \u201cuseful museum\u201d. Ibrahim Mahama\u2019s Parliament of Ghosts at the Whitworth is also, in part, an invitation to participate. Beaten-up fibreglass railway carriage seats, sourced from Ghana\u2019s railways but fabricated in Manchester, are lined up in stepped rows. Around them old lockers and shelves are filled with mouldering records of Ghanaian parliamentary debates from the early post-colonial parliament, old schoolbooks, tattered photographs, tangles of lathe shearings, and much besides. There are archive drawers and vitrines. In one, we see a photo of a railway caboose wagon. This is not just for railway buffs. Most affecting is a series of photographs of forearms and hands: every arm tattooed with the name of the itinerant Ghanaian worker it belongs to. They tattooed themselves with their names in case they got injured or killed in their work far from home, so their families could be informed in case of accident. Nothing else here touches me as much. It is all very unheimlich at Home. Divided into five sections, or chapters, in appropriately low-lit galleries, David Lynch\u2019s paintings, prints, drawings and spooky sculpted lamps chart the same territories as his movies: nasty occurrences and creepy, damaged people for whom the world is both challenge and monstrous playground. There\u2019s a young pyromaniac with impossibly long arms and a matchbook, Bob (you may know the name from Twin Peaks), lost in a world of which he has no understanding, as if he has found himself marooned in an Anselm Kiefer painting with weird writing hovering in the sky and between the trees. Around him are houses on fire, floating factories and heads coughing painted muck into the void, as if saying something. There is no real development in Lynch\u2019s art, always the same sour atmosphere, the same writing on his mixed-media paintings, the same evil fun. A hanged girl is suspended from a branch. Another apologises for not knowing the gun was loaded. A photograph of dead flies, all pinned in neat rows, are appended with their names: Harry, Don, Eric, Sid. This is what passes for light relief beside Lynch\u2019s gruesome paintings, with their nasty lumpy inhabitants, their dangling, deformed, slithery, inside-out biologies and mentalities, their tiny doll\u2019s hands pushed into the paint, and the insistent handwritten voice bubbles and commentaries. I like his simple stone lithographs best, with their wayward crayonings and dirty, greasy inks. And the tiny drawings he made on matchbook covers while hanging around on set when he was shooting Eraserhead. It is all of a piece, all-too-believably unbelievable. Lynch the artist might be taken for a character from the world he paints, the madman with the easel, cackling in the attic. Rafael Lozano-Hemmer: Atmospheric Memory is at the Science and Industry Museum. Tania Bruguera: School of Integration is at Manchester Art Gallery. David Lynch is at Home. All are part of the Manchester international festival, which runs until 21 July.",

Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, and his supporters have tried to portray the slew of revelations about Moro\u2019s conduct in \u2018Operation Car Wash\u2019 as part of a leftwing assault being spearheaded by the investigative website the Intercept and its co-founder Glenn Greenwald. In early June, the Intercept began publishing a series of expos\u00e9s based on what it called \u201ca vast trove\u201d of leaked messages between Brazilian law enforcement officials. But efforts to disqualify the revelations were undermined on Friday when Brazil\u2019s most influential conservative magazine, Veja, published a front-page report featuring damaging new disclosures about Bolsonaro\u2019s most famous minister. Veja \u2013 long a cheerleader for Moro\u2019s anti-corruption crusade \u2013 said its journalists had spent a fortnight poring over nearly 650,000 leaked messages between officials involved in the investigation, and concluded the former judge was guilty of serious \u201cirregularities\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Earlier this year, Maxine Thomas-Asante asked her university if she could pause her work supporting black, Asian and minority ethnic students. She was running for office at her students\u2019 union, finishing coursework and preparing for her final exams. \u201cI had to say I\u2019m going to take a break.\u201d </p> <p>For the past two years, Thomas-Asante, co-president for democracy and education at Soas University of London student union, has attended meetings, panel discussions and focus groups, created mentoring schemes, organised events, listened to the problems experienced by BAME students and liaised between them and academic staff.</p> <p>At first, she did so voluntarily, but it is now a paid role after she was advised by a BAME staff member not to work for free. While she loves doing the job and values the way the university involves students in addressing the attainment gap, she says it\u2019s a lot of psychological pressure. \u201cJust because it\u2019s paid doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s any less difficult. It\u2019s an immense amount of work that you cannot do alone. It\u2019s not enough always for universities to say the work is being done because students are doing it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It is not only BAME students who bear the brunt of schemes to address inequality \u2013 academic staff from under-represented groups feel it too. Kalwant Bhopal, professor of education and social justice at the University of Birmingham, says that if there are issues around race and racial inequality \u201cthere seems to be an expectation that this should fall as a burden on BAME groups\u201d. </p> <p>While she is interested and passionate about race (her research focus is minority ethnic academics in higher education and she recently published a book on white privilege), she says: \u201ceven if I wasn\u2019t, there has always been an expectation on me that I should be doing BAME work\u201d.</p> <p>Although Bhopal is now a senior academic, she still sometimes feels she is a tick-box presence on a panel. She also says much of the work towards gaining race equality charter awards can fall on BAME staff, often without recognition in workload allocations or promotion paths.</p> <p>\u201cThe BAME attainment gap should be something everyone should be working to address, not just a particular group,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aec1e5bb6e7a2e5561d1a7c6f016ccffeb34e04f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aec1e5bb6e7a2e5561d1a7c6f016ccffeb34e04f/0_1112_3744_2246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amatey Doku, vice president at the National Union of Students\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amatey Doku, vice president at the National Union of Students says: \u2018It\u2019s reproducing some of the inequalities\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This has become more pressing since the Office for Students, which regulates universities, introduced targets to eliminate gaps between different students in access and attainment. The aim is that <a href=\"https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/news-blog-and-events/press-and-media/office-for-students-universities-must-eliminate-equality-gaps/\" title=\"\">within 20 years</a> such gaps should be gone.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2019/bame-student-attainment-uk-universities-closing-the-gap.pdf\" title=\"\">numbers are stark</a>. Among 2017-18 home graduates at UK universities, white students were around 13% more likely to get a first-class or upper second-class degree than students from black, Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds; the gap between white and black students was even wider, at 21%. White students outperformed students of all other ethnicities in England even when taking into account their previous qualifications.</p> <p>There are smaller gaps (2.9%) between disabled and non-disabled students, while the <a href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20180405115303/http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/year/2018/201805/\" title=\"\">latest figures</a> show a 10% gap in degree attainment between those from the poorest and most well-off areas.</p> <p>Last month the <a href=\"http://www.taso-he.org/\" title=\"\">Centre for Transforming Access and Student Outcomes</a> in Higher Education was set up by King\u2019s College London, Nottingham Trent University and a public-private agency, the <a href=\"https://www.bi.team/\" title=\"\">Behavioural Insights Team</a>. It aims to collect data and to research the kinds of interventions most likely to be effective. It will focus on inequalities experienced by a number of minority groups, not only in terms of race but social class, care leavers, students estranged from their parents, refugees and gypsy and traveller groups.</p> <p>Susannah Hume, director of the establishment phase of the centre and associate director for What Works at King\u2019s College London, says awareness of inequalities has been around for a while but it is only recently that improvements in collecting and publishing data have shown how bad they are. The aim is to identify concrete solutions, based on research, and to supply evidence to back up the good work taking place.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/21/divided-oldham-inside-school-defies-farage\">\u2018Divided Oldham\u2019? Inside the school that defies Farage\u2019s narrative</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are a lot of things institutions do, but the evidence base around whether they are changing outcomes for the students is low,\u201d she says.</p> <p>While the centre will focus on finding evidence, Hume recognises the need for cultural change in institutions so that people act on the evidence \u2013 and in a way that does not create other problems. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to be mindful of the fact that you need both to be engaging people about things that affect them but not demand too much of their time,\u201d she says.</p> <p>This has been recognised as an issue in relation to gender. In a journal article published earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1360080X.2019.1589682\" title=\"\">Bruce Macfarlane and Damon Burg</a> described the \u201cacademic housework trap\u201d, where female academics tend to feel more responsibility than men to act as mentors and to advance the cause of gender equality, particularly in science, where women are under-represented. The researchers suggest the extra work involved can slow women\u2019s career paths.</p> <p>Amatey Doku, vice president at the National Union of Students, says staff who are in a minority can find it hard to speak up when they need support. \u201cIt\u2019s not the case that academics don\u2019t want to do this, but if it is not acknowledged in the broader system it ends up being a bigger burden on them and reproducing some of the inequalities,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He would like to see the work by BAME staff and students being formalised, so that they are given recognition and training. \u201cYou are asking students to give their expertise where in other areas you would pay consultants,\u201d he says. \u201cSo you should pay them or give them a placement so they have something to show for it.\u201d</p> <p>Many institutions already do this. Coventry University offers paid internships and mentors for students working with course teams to refresh the curriculum to make it more inclusive. At Nottingham Trent University, student mentors are paid to guide students through their first year and arrange activities. </p> <p>Thomas-Asante says the way her fellow students open up and confide in her \u201cis a beautiful thing\u201d but it can be mentally exhausting. \u201cWe engage with the racial attainment gap in terms of numbers,\u201d she says. \u201cBut these are people.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Earlier this year, Maxine Thomas-Asante asked her university if she could pause her work supporting black, Asian and minority ethnic students. She was running for office at her students\u2019 union, finishing coursework and preparing for her final exams. \u201cI had to say I\u2019m going to take a break.\u201d For the past two years, Thomas-Asante, co-president for democracy and education at Soas University of London student union, has attended meetings, panel discussions and focus groups, created mentoring schemes, organised events, listened to the problems experienced by BAME students and liaised between them and academic staff. At first, she did so voluntarily, but it is now a paid role after she was advised by a BAME staff member not to work for free. While she loves doing the job and values the way the university involves students in addressing the attainment gap, she says it\u2019s a lot of psychological pressure. \u201cJust because it\u2019s paid doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s any less difficult. It\u2019s an immense amount of work that you cannot do alone. It\u2019s not enough always for universities to say the work is being done because students are doing it,\u201d she says. It is not only BAME students who bear the brunt of schemes to address inequality \u2013 academic staff from under-represented groups feel it too. Kalwant Bhopal, professor of education and social justice at the University of Birmingham, says that if there are issues around race and racial inequality \u201cthere seems to be an expectation that this should fall as a burden on BAME groups\u201d. While she is interested and passionate about race (her research focus is minority ethnic academics in higher education and she recently published a book on white privilege), she says: \u201ceven if I wasn\u2019t, there has always been an expectation on me that I should be doing BAME work\u201d. Although Bhopal is now a senior academic, she still sometimes feels she is a tick-box presence on a panel. She also says much of the work towards gaining race equality charter awards can fall on BAME staff, often without recognition in workload allocations or promotion paths. \u201cThe BAME attainment gap should be something everyone should be working to address, not just a particular group,\u201d she says. This has become more pressing since the Office for Students, which regulates universities, introduced targets to eliminate gaps between different students in access and attainment. The aim is that within 20 years such gaps should be gone. The numbers are stark. Among 2017-18 home graduates at UK universities, white students were around 13% more likely to get a first-class or upper second-class degree than students from black, Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds; the gap between white and black students was even wider, at 21%. White students outperformed students of all other ethnicities in England even when taking into account their previous qualifications. There are smaller gaps (2.9%) between disabled and non-disabled students, while the latest figures show a 10% gap in degree attainment between those from the poorest and most well-off areas. Last month the Centre for Transforming Access and Student Outcomes in Higher Education was set up by King\u2019s College London, Nottingham Trent University and a public-private agency, the Behavioural Insights Team. It aims to collect data and to research the kinds of interventions most likely to be effective. It will focus on inequalities experienced by a number of minority groups, not only in terms of race but social class, care leavers, students estranged from their parents, refugees and gypsy and traveller groups. Susannah Hume, director of the establishment phase of the centre and associate director for What Works at King\u2019s College London, says awareness of inequalities has been around for a while but it is only recently that improvements in collecting and publishing data have shown how bad they are. The aim is to identify concrete solutions, based on research, and to supply evidence to back up the good work taking place. \u201cThere are a lot of things institutions do, but the evidence base around whether they are changing outcomes for the students is low,\u201d she says. While the centre will focus on finding evidence, Hume recognises the need for cultural change in institutions so that people act on the evidence \u2013 and in a way that does not create other problems. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to be mindful of the fact that you need both to be engaging people about things that affect them but not demand too much of their time,\u201d she says. This has been recognised as an issue in relation to gender. In a journal article published earlier this year, Bruce Macfarlane and Damon Burg described the \u201cacademic housework trap\u201d, where female academics tend to feel more responsibility than men to act as mentors and to advance the cause of gender equality, particularly in science, where women are under-represented. The researchers suggest the extra work involved can slow women\u2019s career paths. Amatey Doku, vice president at the National Union of Students, says staff who are in a minority can find it hard to speak up when they need support. \u201cIt\u2019s not the case that academics don\u2019t want to do this, but if it is not acknowledged in the broader system it ends up being a bigger burden on them and reproducing some of the inequalities,\u201d he says. He would like to see the work by BAME staff and students being formalised, so that they are given recognition and training. \u201cYou are asking students to give their expertise where in other areas you would pay consultants,\u201d he says. \u201cSo you should pay them or give them a placement so they have something to show for it.\u201d Many institutions already do this. Coventry University offers paid internships and mentors for students working with course teams to refresh the curriculum to make it more inclusive. At Nottingham Trent University, student mentors are paid to guide students through their first year and arrange activities. Thomas-Asante says the way her fellow students open up and confide in her \u201cis a beautiful thing\u201d but it can be mentally exhausting. \u201cWe engage with the racial attainment gap in terms of numbers,\u201d she says. \u201cBut these are people.\u201d",

Britain\u2019s Foreign Office said it would not respond to every comment about the incident that emerged from Iran, and reiterated its position that the action came at the request of Gibraltar to halt a vessel believed to be bound for Syria. Tehran has been accused of sabotaging oil tankers in the strait of Hormuz in an attempt at economic retaliation against the US after Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal and imposed sanctions on Iran. EU sanctions prevent the Syrian regime from importing oil, and Gibraltar said on Thursday that it believed the Grace 1 and its 2m barrels of Iranian oil were bound for the Banyas refinery in Syria. Since then, Gibraltar and Spain have become embroiled in a row about the seizure and its ultimate purpose, with Madrid saying the Grace 1 was intercepted because of a request from the US to the UK. Spain said on Friday it planned to lodge a formal complaint about the action, because it considers the sea around Gibraltar to be part of its territorial waters, while the British regard it as theirs. \u201cWe are studying the circumstances and looking at how this affects our sovereignty,\u201d Josep Borell, Spain\u2019s acting foreign minister, said. In response to the Spanish claims, Gibraltar said: \u201cThere has been no political request at any time from any government that the Gibraltar government should act or not act.\u201d The territory\u2019s government said it only organised the seizure with the help of the Royal Marines \u201cas a direct result only of it having reasonable grounds to believe that the vessel was acting in breach of established EU sanctions against Syria\u201d. Nevertheless, the seizure was hailed enthusiastically overnight by a key member of the Trump administration. John Bolton, the US national security adviser, tweeted: \u201cExcellent news: UK has detained the supertanker Grace 1 laden with Iranian oil bound for Syria in violation of EU sanctions. \u201cAmerica and our allies will continue to prevent regimes in Tehran and Damascus from profiting off this illicit trade.\u201d The Grace 1 was likely to remain impounded for several weeks, British sources indicated.

The new sovereign council agreed upon on Friday morning will rule the country by rotation, according to an African Union official mediating in the crisis that has rocked the country for the past six months. The uprising of the Sudanese people, demanding democracy, freedom, justice and an end to human rights violations, has lasted through the removal of the country\u2019s long-term president, a military takeover and the brutal killing on 3 June by heavily armed paramilitary forces of at least 128 protesters who were staging a peaceful sit-in, as well as the rape of many more. Under the agreement, the military will lead the council first, with the head of the junta, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, as its chair, and then civilians will take over. The council will be made up of five military and five civilian members, as well as a sixth so-called civilian agreed upon by both sides who will actually be a retired military officer, according to reports. An independent investigation into the killings was also announced, and anyone found guilty will not be allowed to sit on the sovereign council. The African Union suspended Sudan\u2019s membership after the attack. Beginning in the eastern city of Atbara in December, the uprising is often said to have been triggered by a rise in bread prices, but has much deeper roots: it follows in a long tradition of revolution in Sudan, before the 30-year presidency of Omar al-Bashir. In 1964 and 1985, unpopular leaders were forced from power by popular revolts. Bashir was forced out in April, and is in jail charged with corruption, but the transitional military council, which seized power after Bashir\u2019s ousting, was unable to stop the demonstrations. Despite the violence against them, protesters have returned to the streets again and again, including last weekend when seven were killed and hundreds wounded in the first major demonstrations since the 3 June massacre. As well as a civilian government, protesters are calling for violent paramilitary forces to be withdrawn from cities, help for unarmed civilians who were attacked, an end to an internet blackout and the release of all political prisoners. However, the agreement made no mention of resuming internet service or removing the Rapid Support Forces, who are responsible for most of the abuses, from the streets. Despite leading the revolution, women were hardly represented in the negotiation room, the prominent Sudanese journalist Yousra Elbagir pointed out. Human Rights Watch\u2019s EU director, Lotte Leicht, said Sudan\u2019s armed forces had \u201ca history of broken promises, atrocities and impunity\u201d, and the UN should carry out an inquiry into the abuses.",

      "bodyText": "The return of Andy Murray five months after hip-resurfacing surgery has had a huge impact on Wimbledon, with television clamouring to get him on at the ideal time and his mixed doubles partnership with Serena Williams capturing much attention, even of Roger Federer. Through no fault of his own, Murray\u2019s presence has slightly overshadowed the performance of three other British players, all of whom will take their places in the third round on Saturday. Johanna Konta and Dan Evans would have backed themselves to still be in the draw at this stage but this is uncharted territory for Harriet Dart, who has come a long way since she was beaten 6-0, 6-0 by Maria Sharapova in the first round of the Australian Open earlier this year.

      "bodyText": "FINAL COUNTDOWN Naysayers who think third-place play-off matches at major football tournaments are a complete waste of everybody\u2019s time have clearly never had a daily football tea-time email to write on a day when the most interesting other news of note involves Andreas Pereira signing a new four-year deal with Manchester United, West Ham admitting they might agree a \u201cterrible deal\u201d to get rid of dressing-room diva Marko Arnautovic and former Dutch international Phillip Cocu agreeing a four-year deal to manage Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County. So trilbies off then, to Phil Neville and Karen Carney, for fronting up before Saturday\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup bronze-medal match, which pits England against Sweden to provide some much-needed news. An emotional Carney announced that after a 14-year career in which she has won 143 England caps (with another one to come, unless Neville is feeling particularly mischievous) and played for Birmingham City, Arsenal, Chicago Red Stars and Chelsea, she is ready to call it a day, hang up her boots and stop gadding about around football pitches for a living after seeing off Sweden. The 31-year-old revealed that \u201cmy mind still thinks I can do it \u2026 the body isn\u2019t as able\u201d and struggled to hold back salty tears as she told reporters the thing she\u2019d miss most about playing is \u201csinging the national anthem\u201d and just \u201ckicking a ball\u201d. Paying homage to the midfielder who has played in four World Cups and one Big Sports Day, Neville described Carney as \u201can incredible person and a special teammate\u201d, adding that \u201cwhile she will not want a fuss, Karen is someone who deserves total recognition and respect as a true legend of the game.\u201d The Football Association later confirmed the unwanted fuss (along with the accompanying recognition and respect) is in the pipeline and will be made at a future England international. The day after England\u2019s stirring but ultimately Pyrrhic victory over Sweden, Team USA! USA!! USA!!! and the Netherlands will go toe-to-toe in the final, a match few right-thinking folk give the Dutch a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of winning, as heartwarming an outcome as such an outcome might be for many watching. In the buildup to such an important match, it was only natural that assorted American players were asked about the apparent over-zealousness of celebrations in their last one. Both Alex Morgan and Lindsey Horan managed to maintain commendably straight faces as they fielded slightly passive aggressive queries about sipping imaginary cups of tea and whooping with delight respectively. \u201cObviously emotions are high after winning a World Cup semi-final,\u201d said Horan, who was gracious enough not to point out that it is something England\u2019s current players \u2013 both male and female \u2013 wouldn\u2019t know.

Some of those who made allegations of racism found themselves under attack, with the university closing ranks to protect senior white staff and institutional reputation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"696a9ded-1cb5-4394-99fd-596a7b33f5cf\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Data provided by 131 universities in response to freedom of information requests reveal insufficient dedicated anti-racism training for staff and students, a lack of policy on institutional racism and inconsistent record-keeping of racism complaints.</p>\n    <p>Only 75 universities reported they had centralised records of racism complaints, with 25 declaring they had not, and a further 12 recording either student complaints or staff complaints, not both.</p>\n    <p>More than 20 universities refused to provide some or all of the data requested, citing exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act that the information would either be too costly or time-consuming to collate. This is despite the fact that every university contacted by the Guardian has also been compelled to collate and provide figures on racism complaints to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), as part of its national inquiry into racism in higher education.</p>\n    <p>Eight universities did not provide data for all the five years requested. Seven of those have only begun recording student complaints of racism within the past three years, with one \u2013 Queen\u2019s University Belfast \u2013 starting to do so only in December 2018.</p>\n    <p>Some universities, including Manchester and Middlesex, lump complaints of racism together with other forms of discrimination, such as harassment and bullying. Middlesex recorded 74 complaints of student-on-student harassment and bullying but could not specify whether any of these involved racism. Manchester said while it does not have specific records of racism it does monitor the nature of complaints submitted to its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reportandsupport.manchester.ac.uk/\">online reporting system</a>.</p>\n    <p>Thirty-six universities did not provide exact figures, claiming this risked identifying the people concerned. The Guardian has rounded down responses of &lt;5, &lt;6,&lt;7 and &lt;10 to one, unless other information provided suggested otherwise. In many cases this means the actual number of complaints is likely to have been underestimated in our reporting. Twenty Cambridge colleges provided inexact figures in the range of zero and five complaints. These were each counted as one complaint, which means the total number for the university might be lower than reported.</p>\n    <p>The above factors should be borne in mind when interpreting the figures collected by the Guardian. Our findings should not be interpreted as a league table of university racism. Race-equality experts and campaigners have cautioned that universities reporting a high number of complaints are not necessarily those with the worst problems \u2013 indeed this may reflect that they have more effective procedures.</p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/inquiries-and-investigations/racial-harassment-higher-education-our-inquiry\">Equality and Human Rights Commission\u2019s inquiry into racism in UK universities</a>, expected to be published in September, will examine the gap between the number of formal complaints of racism and the reality of students\u2019 and staff\u2019s experiences.

I record every conversation I have with staff as I do not feel safe around them.\u201d One PhD student at a top English university who was born in China described her shock at \u201chow white\u201d her university campus is, particularly in comparison with her earlier studies at American universities which she found much more mixed ethnically and socially. \u201cI\u2019m often the only person of colour in the room,\u201d she said. \u201cThey expect I have nothing to say and they are shocked when I do. The faculty is all white British and mostly mediocre. The curriculum is white, and hardly decolonised. And most of the students are, of course, white.\u201d Attempts to raise concerns about lack of diversity among academic staff and in the curriculum are often slapped down. \u201cThe issue is dismissed as a non-issue,\u201d said a British Kurd who graduated from a leading London university. \u201cThe response is \u2013 \u2018pipe down, shut up and put up\u2019. Or, \u2018progress is happening \u2013 why don\u2019t you appreciate what\u2019s happening now?\u2019\u201d \ufeffUniversity workers from minorities complained of earning less and being overlooked for jobs. \u201cThere\u2019s an 18% pay gap between white and BME staff,\u201d a female research fellow at a northern university said. \u201cDespite being on a prestigious fellowship, I was put on a pay grade two levels below a white male colleague in a similar research role, despite having more research experience, publications and grants to my name. This means I earn about \u00a31,200 less than him annually. \u201cThe racism runs down from the top,\u201d she added, \u201cand is upheld by a system of cadreship run by a few older white men and the complicit white women and brown corporate faces they hire to bar meaningful action toward race-based equality.\u201d An academic with years of experience described what happened when he lodged a complaint. \u201cAt every stage the equal opportunities team seemed to prioritise protecting the institution over engaging with the complaint \u2026 Panels of senior professors hearing cases see their role as defusing, rather than remedying, and ultimately protect their own.\u201d\ufeff",

Responses to freedom of information (FoI) requests the Guardian sent to 131 universities showed that students and staff made at least 996 formal complaints of racism over the past five years.</p> \n<p>Of these, 367 were upheld, resulting in at least 78 student suspensions or expulsions and 51 staff suspensions, dismissals and resignations.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"696a9ded-1cb5-4394-99fd-596a7b33f5cf\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Data provided by 131 universities in response to freedom of information requests reveal insufficient dedicated anti-racism training for staff and students, a lack of policy on institutional racism and inconsistent record-keeping of racism complaints.</p>\n    <p>Only 75 universities reported they had centralised records of racism complaints, with 25 declaring they had not, and a further 12 recording either student complaints or staff complaints, not both.</p>\n    <p>More than 20 universities refused to provide some or all of the data requested, citing exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act that the information would either be too costly or time-consuming to collate. This is despite the fact that every university contacted by the Guardian has also been compelled to collate and provide figures on racism complaints to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), as part of its national inquiry into racism in higher education.</p>\n    <p>Eight universities did not provide data for all the five years requested. Seven of those have only begun recording student complaints of racism within the past three years, with one \u2013 Queen\u2019s University Belfast \u2013 starting to do so only in December 2018.</p>\n    <p>Some universities, including Manchester and Middlesex, lump complaints of racism together with other forms of discrimination, such as harassment and bullying. Middlesex recorded 74 complaints of student-on-student harassment and bullying but could not specify whether any of these involved racism. Manchester said while it does not have specific records of racism it does monitor the nature of complaints submitted to its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reportandsupport.manchester.ac.uk/\">online reporting system</a>.</p>\n    <p>Thirty-six universities did not provide exact figures, claiming this risked identifying the people concerned. The Guardian has rounded down responses of &lt;5, &lt;6,&lt;7 and &lt;10 to one, unless other information provided suggested otherwise. In many cases this means the actual number of complaints is likely to have been underestimated in our reporting. Twenty Cambridge colleges provided inexact figures in the range of zero and five complaints. These were each counted as one complaint, which means the total number for the university might be lower than reported.</p>\n    <p>The above factors should be borne in mind when interpreting the figures collected by the Guardian. Our findings should not be interpreted as a league table of university racism. Race-equality experts and campaigners have cautioned that universities reporting a high number of complaints are not necessarily those with the worst problems \u2013 indeed this may reflect that they have more effective procedures.</p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/inquiries-and-investigations/racial-harassment-higher-education-our-inquiry\">Equality and Human Rights Commission\u2019s inquiry into racism in UK universities</a>, expected to be published in September, will examine the gap between the number of formal complaints of racism and the reality of students\u2019 and staff\u2019s experiences.

      "bodyText": "A former nurse accused of fabricating claims of a murderous VIP paedophile ring in Westminster has opened up about his shame over being caught with a hoard of child abuse images. Carl Beech, 51, pleaded guilty in a separate trial to viewing indecent images of young boys and covertly recording a child using the toilet at the same time he was claiming to police to be a victim of abuse himself. The convicted paedophile, who initially lied to investigators and sought to frame his teenage son for the crime, at first pleaded not guilty to the indecent image offences before switching his plea and accepting he was responsible. Newcastle crown court had earlier heard during the seven-week trial how Beech concealed some of the material \u2013 which included 28 child abuse images of the most serious category \u2013 on a secret calculator app on his iPad. The divorced father-of-one is standing trial accused of falsely alleging he was among victims of a group of politicians and senior figures in the military and intelligence services that he claimed raped and murdered boys in the 1970s and 80s. Beech \u2013 known under the pseudonym \u201cNick\u201d \u2013 alleged the abuse gang included the former prime minister Edward Heath, the former home secretary Leon Brittan, the ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor, the D-day veteran Field Marshal Lord Bramall and Jimmy Savile. The allegations sparked a \u00a32m Scotland Yard inquiry, which shut without a single arrest being made. Beech denies 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud over a \u00a322,000 compensation payout he received. On Friday, Beech told the court that staying in Sweden \u2013 where he had purchased a \u00a317,000 property in a remote forested area \u2013 and not attending court last summer to face charges over the child abuse material found on his computers was a \u201cstupid mistake\u201d. Northumbria police had earlier raided his home in Gloucester where they found the child sexual abuse images, as well as a video of a child urinating.

He could not explain why he used a third name when trying to buy a second property, telling the court: \u201cI don\u2019t know what possessed me.\u201d Asked by Thompson for his response to prosecution claims that he has invented his allegations about the Westminster paedophile ring and that \u201cit is all untrue\u201d, Beech said: \u201cIt is not, it\u2019s something I lived through, it\u2019s something that still affects me today, still causes me problems today. \u201cI can only report my memories, my own truths and it happened.\u201d Beech also refused to name in court another alleged victim he claimed had been abused at the hands of the paedophile ring who he said could corroborate his story, explaining he did not have the childhood friend\u2019s permission.

      "bodyText": "The Labour MP Stella Creasy is leading another attempt to extend access to abortion to Northern Ireland, tabling an amendment arguing that the government is obliged to do this to comply with human rights obligations. Up to 60 MPs from across different parties were expected to co-sign the amendment, according to the Walthamstow MP, who has tried in the past to change Northern Ireland\u2019s notoriously strict abortion laws. The 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, which makes obtaining or helping somebody obtain an abortion a criminal offence, is still applicable in Northern Ireland. Last year the Republic of Ireland liberalised its abortion laws, but in Northern Ireland the long suspension of the devolved executive and assembly has obstructed any plans to do the same. Creasy\u2019s amendment would oblige ministers in Westminster to comply with their human rights obligation in Northern Ireland in relation to abortion, and thereby change a law that currently risks heavy jail sentences for women who have an abortion or medical staff who help them. It notes that last year the UN committee on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women found the abortion laws meant women were \u201csubjected to grave and systematic violations of rights through being compelled to either travel outside Northern Ireland to procure a legal abortion or to carry their pregnancy to term\u201d. Last year about 1,000 women from Northern Ireland travelled to England or Wales for an abortion. Both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, who are competing to replace Theresa May as prime minister, have ruled out intervention from Westminster to change the law in Northern Ireland, prompting pro-choice campaigners to accuse them of pandering to religious fundamentalists in the Democratic Unionist party. Earlier this week the women and equalities minister, Penny Mordaunt, said rapid action was needed. Mordaunt, speaking to the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, said: \u201cI think paucity of care that women have endured in Northern Ireland is the most appalling thing and it must change.\u201d Creasy\u2019s proposed amendment will be added to a bill due in the Commons next week concerned with amending budgets and planned elections for the Stormont assembly, which has been suspended amid political deadlock since January 2017. Another Labour MP, Conor McGinn, is planning to seek to target the same bill with a cross-party amendment aimed at changing the law in Northern Ireland on same-sex marriage. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that does not have equal marriage. Those signed up to Creasy\u2019s amendment include MPs from Labour, the Liberal Democrats, independents, Conservatives, the Green party and the Scottish National party. Creasy said: \u201cAccording to the UN, women in Northern Ireland face \u2018grave and systematic\u2019 human rights violations because we treat them as second-class citizens and deny them their basic human right not to be forced to continue an unwanted pregnancy. \u201cIt\u2019s time this government stopped hiding behind devolution to defend this situation and please the DUP. Again \u2013 not just what I think: the United Nations says they can\u2019t use devolution as an excuse for this disgraceful situation. \u201cWith women facing jail now in Northern Ireland and no sign of an assembly anytime soon at Stormont, this vote is a chance for parliament to uphold our human rights obligations and treat every woman in the UK with equal respect by ensuring they can access a safe, legal and local abortion if they want to do so.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "I cannot wait, as a global citizen and (for obvious reasons) constant consumer of news, for independence from Donald Trump. I will be celebrating every single day. Many of us will. And if you needed another reason (I anticipate that you do not), Trump\u2019s latest boneheaded episode was to give an Independence Day speech that referenced American takeover of airports in 1775. The first ever flight is thought to have taken place in 1903. Trump, becoming the first US president to make a 4 July address in almost 70 years, stuck to his script for once. It\u2019s just that the script was mostly wrong. As well as confusing the American revolutionary war (AKA the war of independence) with the war of 1812, Trump went on to make further historical errors. There was plenty more going on throughout the celebrations \u2013 let\u2019s take a look. Guys, in some hugely exciting news, Tiffany was allowed out of the basement again. She\u2019s absolutely chuffed about it, as you can see. Have you ever seen anyone more smug at being embraced by direct sunlight? Melania, meanwhile, does not seem too pleased, but that may be because Tiffany is copying her signature shoulder-robing. And Melania is definitely the inspiration for this, because the only media Tiffany has consumed in months is damp, 70s back issues of Jackie magazine that old crockery was wrapped in, next to a broken treadmill (she lives in a basement). Notice how almost everyone in this picture is enjoying the Blue Angels flyover. Melania is clapping in glee. Mike Pence looks like he is reciting an ode to the flyover. Mark Esper (acting defense secretary), to the left of Trump, is so thrilled with this flyover he has his leg at a jaunty angle. The man at the front, cosplaying as Evan Davis, is besotted. Now look at Trump. Dude looks like he doesn\u2019t even know what he\u2019s looking at. Dude looks like he\u2019s never seen a plane before (NB planes did not fly in 1775). He looks like an animal seeing itself in the mirror for the first time and trying to work out what the hell is going on. At least there are two others also not beaming. The officer to the left with his hands clasped, who looks as though he\u2019s just looked up to the board and seen it\u2019s 44 minutes to the next bus. And the guy to the left of him, who dropped a pill almost twice the strength that he\u2019s used to. Tell me this isn\u2019t the opening shot of a performance by a duo in the over-25s category who inexplicably made The X Factor final. Donald and Melania met 30 years ago at technical college in a northern town, brought together by their love of harmonies and aspirations beyond the Leeds to Liverpool canal. Donald spent a long time as a cruise ship entertainer while Melania abandoned her dreams and became a primary school teacher \u2013 but lived to put on the end-of-year shows. Now they\u2019ve given it one last shot, and here they are, while a third assistant director who thinks he\u2019s the next Scorsese shoots them over the shoulder about to belt out Marvin Gaye\u2019s My Last Chance. I have absolutely zero snark to contribute here, because these are great fireworks. They just are. Trump has of course refused to comment on how much the total celebrations cost US taxpayers, but \u201cconservative estimates\u201d put it at around $2m. I\u2019m not saying a single catherine wheel and a sparkler each would have cut it, but that is a lot of money literally gone up in smoke. Here we have vice president Mike Pence and his FEMALE WIFE, Karen. Karen is wearing a stars-and-stripes scarf, to remember which country\u2019s independence she is celebrating, while the couple hold hands to assert that they are a HETEROSEXUAL COUPLE in a HETEROSEXUAL MARRIAGE. I still feel so disappointed in Jon Voight. How can a man who gave us one of the greatest films of all time (Anaconda, and this isn\u2019t up for debate) and one of the world\u2019s most beautiful women, Angelina Jolie (again, no debate) have ended up saying that \u201cTrump is the best president since Abraham Lincoln\u201d. It is like when your phone gets too hot in the sun and starts malfunctioning and Siri starts just yelling random stuff that makes no sense. Or, as Robert De Niro put it, it\u2019s \u201cdelusional\u201d. Anyway, here\u2019s Voight, posing for a photo that will end up sloshing around the jpeg sea of minor celebrity selfies. When I was at school I was desperate to play an instrument, but basically had no musical talent whatsoever. Some years later I joined an orchestra but mostly this was to be eligible for a ski trip. When it came to an actual recital we had to give, I essentially mimed blowing on my French horn (shut up) throughout, hoping the others, who were actually playing and had some talent, would carry me through. This picture reminds me a lot of that. I\u2019m not saying this looks like a harrowing, dystopian vision \u2013 maybe the bits of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale where they hang people en masse (ie every other scene) \u2013 but also, that\u2019s exactly what this looks like. You know that thing where your friend invites you to their debut slam poetry performance? That. This is a picture of Trump saluting. There are a lot of pictures of Trump saluting during the celebrations and I\u2019d bet my bottom dollar this is because the name of Trump\u2019s speech was Salute to America, and Trump is a man who only understands things in a very literal way. He does not understand metaphor, or analogy, or metonymy, or even just nuance. This is a man who almost certainly asked \u201cBut where were the dogs?\u201d as the credits rolled on Reservoir Dogs. It\u2019s been 895 days since Trump took probably the most powerful office in the world and I will never, ever, ever get over it. \u2022 Hannah Jane Parkinson is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>An aspiring barrister has been jailed for 10 years after recording more than 150 children carrying out sex acts he told them to perform.</p> <p>Owain Thomas, 29, from south Wales, targeted children between the ages of nine and 16 on the internet, paying some with online game currency to encourage them to co-operate with his demands to perform indecent acts.</p> <p>Thomas, an Aberystwyth University law graduate, used Facebook and online gaming rooms to meet young boys and girls, sometimes posing as a child himself.</p> <p>Merthyr crown court heard Thomas used \u201cpersistent and sophisticated techniques\u201d including disguising his voice and using different accents during on-camera chats with his victims, where he repeatedly exposed himself.</p> <p>He also purported to be some of his older victims when showing explicit images taken of them to younger children.</p> <p>He was caught on 17 November last year after he approached two eight-year-old boys in his car in Ferndale, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and asked them to show him their penises. The boys refused and he showed them sexual images from his phone as he drove past.</p> <p>The boys complained to their parents, and he was tracked to his home in Pontypridd, where a crying Thomas told police: \u201cI need help. I know I need help. I can\u2019t go to prison, I won\u2019t cope in there.\u201d</p> <p>Police found a \u201cvast amount\u201d of child sex abuse images on his computer, with more than 150 child victims from the UK and the US. Police say 146 have been identified.</p> <p>He later pleaded guilty to 158 sex offences, including causing or inciting children to engage in sexual activity and distributing indecent images.</p> <p>A pre-sentence report read in court said Thomas would target children he deemed vulnerable after meeting them online, and would take away attention and friendship if they did not comply with his demands.</p> <p>The recorder of Merthyr Tydfil, Judge Richard Twomlow, said Thomas was a dangerous offender. He told him: \u201cI have no doubt you pose a significant risk of serious harm to members of the public.</p> <p>\u201cYou were about to move to actual contact as opposed to contact over the internet.\u201d</p> <p>Twomlow added: \u201cThis may have been through a screen but this was a very real experience for your victims. You went as far as you could persuade these children to go. You had multiple identities including pretending to be a nine-year-old girl.</p> <p>\u201cA recurring theme in this case is your persistence. If you couldn\u2019t convince them, you would return and try again.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of the sheer volume and scale of your offences I have no doubt that you are a significant risk to the public and pose a real risk. You are a dangerous offender.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas was jailed for 10 years, with an extended sentence meaning he will serve at least two-thirds of his term behind bars until a parole board will consider releasing him. Following his release he will spend five years on licence.</p> <p>Speaking outside court, South Wales police gave some insight into the delicate task of tracing victims and explaining to their parents or carers what had happened.</p> <p>DI Lianne Rees said: \u201cTo tell any parent that their child has been a victim of a sexual predator was not easy.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was so alarming was the high percentage of parents who had no clue whatsoever what their children were doing online, and that should be a warning for others.\u201d</p> <p>His victims were from Wales, England, Northern Ireland and the US.</p> <p>Rees said: \u201cThere are predators out there who are very good at manipulating \u2013 children are vulnerable and should all be safeguarded effectively and parents have a big role to play in that.</p> <p>\u201cBeing a technophobe can no longer be an excuse, as there are many websites out there which give advice and information to parents on how to keep children safe online.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "An aspiring barrister has been jailed for 10 years after recording more than 150 children carrying out sex acts he told them to perform. Owain Thomas, 29, from south Wales, targeted children between the ages of nine and 16 on the internet, paying some with online game currency to encourage them to co-operate with his demands to perform indecent acts. Thomas, an Aberystwyth University law graduate, used Facebook and online gaming rooms to meet young boys and girls, sometimes posing as a child himself. Merthyr crown court heard Thomas used \u201cpersistent and sophisticated techniques\u201d including disguising his voice and using different accents during on-camera chats with his victims, where he repeatedly exposed himself. He also purported to be some of his older victims when showing explicit images taken of them to younger children. He was caught on 17 November last year after he approached two eight-year-old boys in his car in Ferndale, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and asked them to show him their penises. The boys refused and he showed them sexual images from his phone as he drove past. The boys complained to their parents, and he was tracked to his home in Pontypridd, where a crying Thomas told police: \u201cI need help. I know I need help. I can\u2019t go to prison, I won\u2019t cope in there.\u201d Police found a \u201cvast amount\u201d of child sex abuse images on his computer, with more than 150 child victims from the UK and the US. Police say 146 have been identified. He later pleaded guilty to 158 sex offences, including causing or inciting children to engage in sexual activity and distributing indecent images. A pre-sentence report read in court said Thomas would target children he deemed vulnerable after meeting them online, and would take away attention and friendship if they did not comply with his demands. The recorder of Merthyr Tydfil, Judge Richard Twomlow, said Thomas was a dangerous offender. He told him: \u201cI have no doubt you pose a significant risk of serious harm to members of the public. \u201cYou were about to move to actual contact as opposed to contact over the internet.\u201d Twomlow added: \u201cThis may have been through a screen but this was a very real experience for your victims. You went as far as you could persuade these children to go. You had multiple identities including pretending to be a nine-year-old girl. \u201cA recurring theme in this case is your persistence. If you couldn\u2019t convince them, you would return and try again. \u201cBecause of the sheer volume and scale of your offences I have no doubt that you are a significant risk to the public and pose a real risk. You are a dangerous offender.\u201d Thomas was jailed for 10 years, with an extended sentence meaning he will serve at least two-thirds of his term behind bars until a parole board will consider releasing him. Following his release he will spend five years on licence. Speaking outside court, South Wales police gave some insight into the delicate task of tracing victims and explaining to their parents or carers what had happened. DI Lianne Rees said: \u201cTo tell any parent that their child has been a victim of a sexual predator was not easy. \u201cWhat was so alarming was the high percentage of parents who had no clue whatsoever what their children were doing online, and that should be a warning for others.\u201d His victims were from Wales, England, Northern Ireland and the US. Rees said: \u201cThere are predators out there who are very good at manipulating \u2013 children are vulnerable and should all be safeguarded effectively and parents have a big role to play in that. \u201cBeing a technophobe can no longer be an excuse, as there are many websites out there which give advice and information to parents on how to keep children safe online.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap: America\u2019s economy created more jobs than expected last month, calming fears of a sharp slowdown. The closely-watched Non-Farm Payroll rose by 224,000 in June, up from a downwardly-revised 72,000 in May. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the numbers. However, wage growth was a little weaker than expected - just 0.2% higher month-on-month. White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow has hailed the report as good news. Economists say the solid jobs gains means there is less likelihood of sharp cuts to US interest rates. Investors agree; shares have fallen in New York, and bond prices are also falling, partly reversing a recent rally. The dollar has risen, driving the pound down below $1.25 to its lowest rate in six months. But the economic clouds over the eurozone have darkened, after German factory orders reported slumping orders. German industrial orders fell by over 2% in May, and were a shocking 8.6% weaker than a year ago. It\u2019s another sign that the US-China trade war is hurting Europe\u2019s economy. In the UK, labour productivity has fallen again -- with output growth failing to keep pace with increased hours worked. Brexit uncertainty has been blamed. According to the ONS, Britain\u2019s productivity puzzle has wiped thousands of pounds off workers\u2019 salaries. That may be all for today. Thanks for reading, and have a lovely weekend. GW Alastair Neame, senior economist at the CEBR thinktank, believes the White House will get its interest rate cut soon: Today\u2019s boost to overall job numbers may just about be enough to stay the Fed\u2019s hand for the time being as trade tensions between the US and China have cooled since the G20 summit last week. Nevertheless, an uptick in the unemployment rate and the absence of faster wage growth indicate that the Fed are still more likely than not to act before the end of the year. Larry Kudlow, White House Economic Advisor, has welcomed today\u2019s jobs report. Kudlow has told Bloomberg TV that job creation was solid in June, wages kept rising at over 3% per annum, and the unemployment rate is still low (3.7%, up from 3.6%). He argues that the Trump administration\u2019s \u201csupply-side policies\u201d (deregulation and tax cuts) are working. We are still in a very strong prosperity cycle. It\u2019s a growth cycle, it\u2019s a prosperity cycle. Kudlow then cites the vision of \u201cLife, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\u201d stated in the American Declaration of Independence Things are looking pretty good. But despite being \u201cvery optimistic\u201d, Kudlow reckons the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates. He cites low US inflation, and the weak global economy, as justification for an \u201cinsurance rate cut\u201d. Ding ding! Wall Street has opened in the red. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed around 100 points, or 0.4%, as traders rethink the chances of sharp interest rate cuts. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has shed 0.5%, dropping back from its record highs earlier this week. Traders are concluding that good news is bad news -- ie, a strong jobs report means less chance of central bankers easing monetary policy. Oof! The surge in the US dollar has dragged sterling down to a six month low, at just above $1.25. As you can see, Brexit worries have been pulling the pound down in recent weeks. Alex Hunter of Capital Economics reckons today\u2019s jobs report means the Federal Reserve won\u2019t cut interest rates this month - and will wait until the autumn. He writes: The 224,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in June was much stronger than the consensus estimate of 160,000 and would seem to make a mockery of market expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates by up to 50bp late this month. Employment growth is still trending gradually lower but, with the stock market setting new records and trade talks back on (for now at least), the data support our view that Fed officials are more likely to wait until September before loosening policy. Admittedly, the headline payrolls gain was flattered by a 33,000 jump in government in employment, with private payrolls rising by a slightly more modest 191,000. Even that was far stronger than most had been expecting, however, with hiring in the business services and education sectors leading the charge. More reaction to the jobs report: Gold is another casualty of this strong jobs report: Edward Moya of trading firm OANDA is confident that America\u2019s Federal Reserve will cut US interest rates later this month, even though the jobs market looks solid. Today\u2019s non-farm payroll shows labor market is still getting tighter despite the unemployment rate ticking higher from the 49-year low as the participation rate rose. Trade tensions are not really hitting the labor market yet, but lack of international investment in the US will eventually hit the data points. The Fed never makes a decision off of one economic data point and the narrative remains inflation is subdued, and global growth concerns are heightened. Despite the strong rebound in jobs and steady wages, the Fed will still likely deliver a 25-basis point insurance cut at the end of the month. Richard Flynn, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab, agrees that the US labor market looks strong...but there\u2019s still plenty to worry about. \u201cToday\u2019s healthy job numbers have exceeded market expectations and show renewed momentum following last month\u2019s weak performance, which should be enough to calm fears of a near-term recession. \u201cNonetheless, investors still face uncertainty around slowing global economic growth and an ongoing U.S.-China trade war, despite assurances at the G20 that talks would resume. Economic data has yet to reflect a significant impact from trade concerns, but that\u2019s unlikely to last if the stalemate drags on, or another round of tariffs is imposed. \u201cEquity markets may have breathed a sigh of relief for now, but this is by no means the end of the trade war drama. A highly anticipated interest rate cut later this month could result in a welcome spike in borrowing and business investment, but the burning question is whether the Fed has sufficient ammunition to offset a slowdown, if and when it arrives.\u201d The US dollar is rallying - another sign that investors think this jobs report is too strong to justify a massive interest rate cut this month. The Federal Reserve is still expected to cut borrowing costs, but probably only by 0.25%. Investors are reacting to the Non-Farm Payroll report by selling bonds, and preparing to ditch shares when Wall Street opens in 45 minutes. Why such a negative reaction, when job creation has gone up? Because they reckon it takes some pressure off the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates twice this year, as some had hoped. There was widespread job creation across America last month, according to today\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll report. The Labor Department says: Professional and business services added 51,000 jobs in June Employment in health care increased by 35,000 over the month and by 403,000 over the past 12 months. Job growth occurred in ambulatory health care services (+19,000) and hospitals (+11,000). Transportation and warehousing added 24,000 jobs over the month and 158,000 over the past 12 months. Couriers and messengers (+7,000) and in air transportation (+3,000). Construction employment continued to trend up in June (+21,000), in line with its average monthly gain over the prior 12 months. Manufacturing employment edged up in June (+17,000), The US unemployment rate has inched up to 3.7%, from 3.6% in May. That may be due to more people looking for work -- the labor force participation rate has risen to 62.9% from 62.8%. Wage growth remains disappointing, though. Average earnings rose by 0.2% in June alone, weaker than the 0.3% expected. That means wages were 3.1% higher than a year ago, not 3.2% as hoped. NEWSFLASH: The US economy created 224,000 new jobs in June, more than expected, as job creation bounced back after slowing in May. More to follow.... Excitement is building.... partly because Non-Farm Payroll is notoriously hard to predict (and notoriously often revised in future months). Stephen Hubble, Chief Analyst at Centtrip, points out that the latest survey of private sector job creation (from ADP) was disappointing earlier this week. Today\u2019s non-farm report may confirm that the US labour market is going through a rough patch, he says: \u201cIf the NFP release follows the ADP number and comes in below the forecast of 165,000 jobs added, that will shake the Dollar and will strengthen the case for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month. The impact could be even more pronounced as the US has just celebrated the Independence Day and traders will inevitably be taking vacations, so lower liquidity can often lead to higher volatility in markets.\u201d Tension is mounting in the markets as investors prepare for the monthly US jobs report, due in half an hour. The Non-Farm Payroll is expected to show that job creation picked up in June. On average, analysts predict the NFP rose by around 162,000, up from a disappointing 75,000 last month. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: The impression that employment growth has slowed will only be challenged by a real barnstormer of a figure, that would contrast with what we\u2019re seeing in other labour market indicators. Economists will all scrutinise the latest earnings data. They\u2019re expected to show that average wages rose by 0.3% in June, up from 0.2% in May, lifting annual wage growth from 3.1% to 3.2%. A weak jobs report increases the chances that the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates later this month. It would also reinforce concerns that the global economy is weakening. FXPro analysts predict that the markets could be volatile once the data is released at 8.30am East Coast time (or 1.30pm in the UK). Markets quietened down in anticipation of the US Nonfarm Payrolls: there is a danger that this lull will be like a compressed spring that will shoot after the data is published. Here\u2019s a round-up of the latest forecasts. Shares in German industrial giants have fallen this morning, as investors fret about the slump in orders. Manufacturing conglomerate Siemens is leading the fallers, down 3.2% this morning, followed by engineering and steel giant Thyssenkrupp (-2%), material science group Covestro (-1.9%) and building materials group HeidelbergCement (-1.8%). This has pulled the DAX index of top German companies down by 0.3% so far today. This morning\u2019s slump in German factory orders continues to worry economists and investors. Many fear that Europe\u2019s largest economy is weakening. Here\u2019s more reaction: Britain\u2019s productivity problems have had a severe impact on wage growth. According to the ONS, the average worker would be earning \u00a35,000 per year more, if productivity had maintained its pre-crisis growth rate, rather than being so weak over the last decade. That\u2019s because, before the financial crisis, productivity was growing at 2.3% per year. Had it remained at that rate, productivity would be 28% higher than it is today. Jack Leslie, Policy Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, explains: \u201cUK productivity fell again in early 2019, continuing the falls seen in the second half of 2018. This is very disappointing for the economy, and deeply worrying for people\u2019s living standards prospects. \u201cLabour market productivity is now almost 30 per cent below the pre-crisis trend. This dismal record has been the single biggest driver of the stagnation in living standards over the last decade. \u201cAddressing the UK\u2019s productivity slump is as important, and not unrelated to, addressing Brexit.\u201d How are business leaders supposed to commit to major project when they don\u2019t know how Brexit will be resolved? That\u2019s the message from Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, who blames political uncertainty for Britain\u2019s productivity woes: \u201cThe UK\u2019s dire productivity performance shows no signs of letting up. \u201cWith political risks clouding business decisions, firms have lacked the confidence to invest in the equipment and technology that drive efficiency gains in their organisations. Even if the clouds of uncertainty do lift later this year, it will be a while before pent-up investment activity filters through to the productivity numbers. \u201cWhile the Conservative leadership candidates\u2019 Brexit and personal tax policies have grabbed the headlines, business leaders also want to see urgent progress on our skills agenda, infrastructure, and business support. Boosting the UK\u2019s productivity growth is the only way to deliver long-lasting increases to wages and living standards across the country.\u201d This chart highlights that UK productivity weakened because British workers collectively worked 2% more hours in January-March, but only boosted output by 1.8%. Britain\u2019s productivity woes are partly caused by companies taking on low-paid staff, rather than splashing out on better equipment, says Howard Archer of EY Item Club: Part of the UK\u2019s recent poor labour productivity performance has undoubtedly been that low wage growth has increased the attractiveness of employment for companies. It is apparent that many companies have preferred to take on labour rather than commit to costly investment, given a highly uncertain economic and political outlook, magnified by Brexit since mid-2016. The low cost and flexibility of labour relative to capital has certainly supported employment over investment. Bad news! Britain\u2019s productivity has fallen for the third quarter in a row. Labour productivity (how much output was created for each hour of work) shrank by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2019 compared with the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics. That follows a 0.1% year-on-year decline in October-December, and is the third contraction in a row. The ONS says that manufacturing productivity tanked by 0.9%, while the service sector achieved a 0.2% jump in productivity. Weak productivity is often a sign that companies haven\u2019t been investing in new equipment, perhaps because they\u2019re nervous about economic prospects while Brexit is unresolved. The slump in German factory orders has dampened the mood in the markets. The main European indices are all down slightly, as investors ponder whether central banks will unleash their firepower soon to prop up growth. In London, mining companies such as Anglo American (-2.4%) and Rio Tinto (-2.3%) are leading the fallers; weak factory output means less demand for raw materials. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, explains: The big news of the day is the sharp decline in German factory orders, down 2.2% in May versus estimates for a 0.2% decline. This will worry the European Central Bank and raise expectations of more monetary stimulus in the near future. \u201cIn the UK, the FTSE 100 fell 0.2% to 7,590 with miners sinking on renewed concerns about the global economy and how that might impact commodities demand. Rio Tinto, Anglo American and Evraz were among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100. Housebuilders were also out of favour.\u201d German factories aren\u2019t the only ones struggling. New data shows that Asian factories suffered a sharp downturn last month. Industrial goods production across the region shrank at the quickest pace in nearly seven years, data firm Markit reports. Metals and mining output also declined in June, at the sharpest rate since January. This is another sign that the global economy has weakened recently. More here. Understatement of the morning: While German factories struggle, UK industry can celebrate good news -- Jaguar Land Rover has just confirmed it will build an electric version of its Jaguar XJ saloon at its Castle Bromwich factory. Bloomberg is worried that global trade uncertainty is driving Europe\u2019s economy into a \u201cmore serious downturn\u201d. The German economy ministry reported huge declines in export orders and investment goods in May, just days after a survey showed factory activity shrank for a sixth month in June. The continued gloom is increasing concern at the European Central Bank, and a growing number of economists are predicting it will add more monetary stimulus as soon as this month. This slump in factory orders is bad news for Germany\u2019s economy, says Katharina Uterm\u00f6hl, senior economist for Europe at Allianz SE. She is worried that global trade tensions (with the US and China yet to resume negotiations) are hurting: In particular, the outlook for foreign demand has deteriorated considerably. The tentative spring recovery in global trade has thus turned out to be very short-lived. In view of the lingering trade uncertainties and elevated inventory levels, a swift recovery for German industry is not in the cards. Germany\u2019s export economy, which is strongly geared to industrial goods, will clearly remain under pressure. So far, domestic demand has been holding up relatively well, but it is only a matter of time before the weakness in industry also affects investment activity and consumption in a more pronounced manner. Overall, we expect GDP growth for Germany of only 0.8% in 2019. This chart also shows that consumer demand has propped up orders: Carsten Brzeski of ING is aghast to see that German factory orders have shrivelled so badly in May. He writes: The great order book deflation continues. Devastating new orders data just undermined any hopes for an industrial rebound. We are starting to lose our optimism. Instead, the order book deflation just reached a new standard. In May, new industrial orders dropped by a painful 2.2% MoM, from a slightly upwardly-revised 0.4% MoM increase in April. After two positive months and hopes for a bottoming out, the downward slide is back again. On the year, new orders were down by 8.6%; the worst YoY drop since 2009. Brzeski points out that other German economic data has weakened too: Combined with the weakest June performance of the labour market since 2002 and disappointing retail sales, today\u2019s new orders wrap up a week to forget for the German economy. The fear factor is back. John Hardy of Saxo Bank fears that Germany\u2019s economy is in recession: This tumble in German factory orders suggests its economy struggled in the last quarter, warns Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Alarm bells are flashing over the German economy this morning, after its factories suffered another slump in orders. German industrial orders shrank by 2.2% month-on-month in May, new figures show, much worse than the 0.1% fall expected. On an annual basis, orders were a shocking 8.6% lower than in May 2018, which appears to be the weakest reading since 2009, during the financial crisis. Destatis, the German statistics body, reports that German firms suffered a sharp slump in overseas orders: Domestic orders increased by 0.7% and foreign orders fell by 4.3% in May 2019 on the previous month. New orders from the euro area were down 1.7%, new orders from other countries decreased 5.7% compared to April 2019. Germany\u2019s factories are an important bellwether for global demand, so this may show that the US-China trade war is causing more damage to the world economy. Demand for expensive equipment and machinery (known as capital goods) was particularly poor, suggesting companies are too nervous to commit to major spending decisions. Destatis explains: In May 2019 the manufacturers of intermediate goods saw new orders fall by 1.5% compared with April 2019. The manufacturers of capital goods showed decreases of 2.8% on the previous month. For consumer goods, a decrease in new orders of 0.7% was recorded. City experts are alarmed - such weak data suggests Germany\u2019s economy is in trouble, and that\u2019s a bad sign for the eurozone economy as well. More reaction to follow! Also coming up today The latest US jobs report will show whether employment growth bounced back last month, after slowing sharply in May. A poor reading might increase fears that America\u2019s economy is slowing..... and also increase pressure to cut US interest rates soon. While in the eurozone, Greece is preparing to head to the polls this weekend in a general election which could end Alexis Tsipras\u2019s time as prime minister. The right wing New Democracy have a chunky lead in the opinion polls, ahead of Tsipras\u2019s left-wing Syriza party.

      "bodyText": "Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential frontrunner, hit out at the Democratic party\u2019s left wing on Friday, suggesting firebrand progressives cannot win in battleground states. Biden meanwhile admitted he wasn\u2019t prepared for the attack by rising challenger Senator Kamala Harris on his historic handling of race issues in the first primary debates last week \u2013 and said Donald Trump was a bully and he would \u201csmack him in the mouth\u201d. The former vice-president, sounding defensive and angry at times, casual and confident at others, suggested the policies of the new socialist-leaning breakout stars of the party, such as the New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, would not prevail in key swing states needed to retake the White House for the Democrats in 2020. Seeking to reignite his campaign after a faltering performance in the first presidential primary debates, Biden suggested policies from \u201cway left\u201d did not have widespread support. \u201cIt\u2019s centre-left, that\u2019s where I am,\u201d he said of the Democratic party, during an interview with CNN broadcast on Friday morning. Biden also returned to the type of aggressive warnings to the president that have received criticism in the past, saying Trump was a bully, a kind Biden said he was very familiar with, and suggesting: \u201cI\u2019d smack him in the mouth.\u201d Facing robust competition for the 2020 nomination on the left from Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Biden pointed to the 2018 midterm elections, when the party retook control of the House of Representatives after moderate Democrats unseated a series of Republicans in swing districts. \u201cI think Ocasio-Cortez is a brilliant, bright woman, but she won a primary,\u201d said Biden. \u201cIn the general election fights, who won? Mainstream Democrats who are very progressive on social issues and very strong on education and healthcare.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, 29, rose to national prominence by ousting incumbent congressman Joe Crowley in the party\u2019s primary in New York\u2019s safely Democratic 14th district, but also went on to easily win her general election contest against a Republican opponent last November. Biden defended his comparatively moderate position on healthcare, which he claimed would \u201ccost a hell of a lot less\u201d than universal publicly funded plans such as Medicare for All that are proposed by some of his opponents. While the former vice-president has not set out a detailed healthcare plan, he told CNN his proposal would make Medicare \u201can option for anybody who in fact wants to buy into\u201d it. \u201cBut if they like their employer-based insurance, which a lot of unions broke their neck to get, a lot of people like theirs, they shouldn\u2019t have to give it up,\u201d he said. Biden also appeared to dismiss proposals supported by some of his opponents to forgive the student loan debt owed by millions of Americans and to decriminalise entering the US without authorisation, which is a particularly hot topic in light of the furore over Trump administration immigration policies at the US-Mexico border. But he reiterated his support for funding emergency healthcare for undocumented immigrants in need of treatment. Pressed by Cuomo on whether he was equipped for a potentially bruising general election contest with Trump if nominated, Biden dismissed the president as \u201cthe bully that I knew my whole life\u201d and boasted aggressively about taking him on. \u201cHe\u2019s the bully that I\u2019ve always stood up to,\u201d said Biden. \u201cHe\u2019s the bully that used to make fun when I was a kid, that I stutter \u2013 and I\u2019d smack him in the mouth.\u201d Biden has been criticised by Republicans since 2016 for repeatedly saying of Trump that he wished he could \u201ctake him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\u201d. Biden once clarified his remark by saying he would only do so if the two septuagenarians were still in school, stressing: \u201cI want to make it clear I understand what assault is.\u201d The former vice-president appeared unsettled by the strident criticism he faced during the first debate from Senator Kamala Harris, the former state attorney general of California, who assailed him for failing to support the federally mandated bussing of black children during the 1970s to racially integrate schools. \u201cI was prepared for them to come after me, but I wasn\u2019t prepared for the person coming at me the way she came at me,\u201d Biden said, noting that Harris knew him and had known his late son, Beau. Biden has lost ground in some opinion polls on the primary field since the debate, while Harris has appeared to received a boost in support. Biden said his past position on the desegregation fight had been distorted but maintained: \u201cBussing did not work.\u201d Biden appeared to pledge that he would not use opposition research against his Democratic opponents, saying the candidates should be \u201cdebating what we do from here\u201d rather than digging up dirt. \u201cI get all this information about other people\u2019s past and what they\u2019ve done and not done.

      "body": "<h2><strong>1 Win the toss and bat </strong></h2> <p>One of the bigger cheers of the 2005 Ashes came when Michael Vaughan <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80qd1QgWY-k\" title=\"\">won the toss before the final Test</a> at the Oval. If there are any England fans at Edgbaston for Thursday\u2019s semi-final, there will surely be a similar cheer should Eoin Morgan do the same. As in 2005, batting first has suddenly assumed critical importance. A combination of tired pitches and debilitating pressure mean the team batting first have won 26 of the 39 completed games at this tournament \u2013 including 15 of the last 18. That\u2019s the kind of data nobody can ignore.</p> <h2><strong>2 Adapt to the conditions</strong></h2> <p>While England have been criticised for not always adapting with the bat, no one can doubt their tactical flexibility. Two of the non-negotiables of their World Cup plan \u2013 bowling first and playing two spinners \u2013 have gone out the window because of changes in conditions and form. And though they will remain open minded in case they encounter extreme conditions, it is hard to see them deviating from the new balance of five fast bowlers and one spinner \u2013 especially as all the fast bowlers are in form and both the spinners are not.</p> <h2><strong>3 Back the openers not to have a bad day</strong></h2> <p>Don Bradman was once told by Neville Cardus that the law of averages was against him making runs the following day. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the law of averages,\u201d Bradman said. He scored 304. England will hope Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow have a similar attitude, because they are due a failure. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jul/03/jonny-bairstow-new-zealand-england-odi\" title=\"\">Their opening partnership</a> has become totemic both in style and substance, and their record at home is almost Bradman-esque: they have an average stand of 95 and have hit nine 100 partnerships in 16 innings. And England have won all nine games when they have put on 100. </p> <h2><strong>4 Target early wickets to make a difference</strong></h2> <p>The new-ball partnership of Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer has been almost as important. England are superb frontrunners with bat and ball and excellent at holding their nerve in the field during a tight run chase; but they are not as good at dragging a game back after a poor start. It\u2019s no coincidence that the two big opening partnerships against them in this tournament \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/03/england-pakistan-cricket-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">by Pakistan</a> and Australia \u2013 led not only to defeat but also a slightly alarming unravelling in the field. All three potential opponents in the knockout stages rely heavily on their top four, so a strong start \u2013 and ideally a couple of early wickets \u2013 would be ideal. But England cannot expect to always control games from the start. At some stage, whether with bat or ball, they will have to cope with mid-match adversity better than they have so far in the tournament. A World Cup doesn\u2019t come for free.</p> <h2><strong>5 Catches win matches</strong></h2> <p>Fielding is a window into a team\u2019s soul. England lost their way and their rag against Pakistan<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/25/england-australia-cricket-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\"> and Australia</a>, and both times it affected their batting later in the day. Their fielding in the two must-win matches against India and New Zealand was electric, symbolised by Bairstow\u2019s almost-demented boundary-riding. They need to reach the same standard in the knockout stages, especially if they are asked to field first.</p> <h2><strong>6 Target the weak links</strong></h2> <p>The remaining semi-finalists are superb sides, yet all have passengers. England\u2019s ability to target the weaker links, with ball and especially bat, will be critical. Their assault on India\u2019s Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav last Sunday was breathtaking in its audacity, courage and skill, and for most of the tournament they have marmalised even the best spinners. Spin was England\u2019s white-ball kryptonite for so long; if they are going to win the World Cup they may as well exorcise one of the biggest demons of the last 27 years.</p> <h2><strong>7 Keep the score</strong><strong> ticking over</strong></h2> <p>Fifty overs is a long time. In the last two matches England have had very quiet spells with the bat, yet still scored over 300 both times. There will be periods in the semi-final when the scoreboard gets stuck; England need to accept that and sit in for a few overs where necessary. They will also, surely, accept that Jasprit Bumrah and especially Mitchell Starc must be handled with the utmost care.</p> <h2><strong>8 Captain Morgan must lead from the front</strong></h2> <p>There is no need for anyone to shove a game plan under the wrong hotel door. Everyone knows Morgan will be peppered with short balls when he comes to the crease. In the next few days he should spend hours having balls thrown at his head in the nets. Most of all, whether it is to duck, hook, make room or phone a friend, he needs to have absolute clarity in his mind. In the biggest matches the performance of the captain can set a decisive tone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f86f0518cba7f729fb131f65c37a0391a5cb828\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f86f0518cba7f729fb131f65c37a0391a5cb828/0_684_3451_2071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Wood runs out New Zealand\u2019s Kane Williamson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Wood runs out New Zealand\u2019s Kane Williamson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>9 Make your own luck</strong> </h2> <p>Roy could have been out first ball against New Zealand. Bairstow twice put an inside-edge against Mohammad Shami past leg stump at the start of his century against India. Mark Wood\u2019s fingertip dismissed Kane Williamson in the kind of freak incident that makes people believe in destiny. As good as England were against India and New Zealand they had the kind of luck that is usually essential in knockout games. They won both tosses, too, and were able to pick their best XI despite a few niggles to their fast bowlers. The backup looks relatively weak, for various reasons, so England will be desperate to avoid untimely injuries.</p> <h2><strong>10 And if Rashid and Buttler </strong><strong>rediscover their mojo \u2026</strong></h2> <p>Adil Rashid played an important role in England\u2019s win over New Zealand on Wednesday but only with the bat and in the field. His bowling has been out of sorts all summer, not just in this World Cup, and he has gone from key player to afterthought. The leg spinner has the worst economy rate and strike rate of any England bowler in the tournament. A shoulder problem has affected his ability to bowl the googly. Rashid has had a number of injections in his shoulder and may have another before Thursday\u2019s semi-final. He could also do with an injection of confidence from Morgan, who has managed him so brilliantly for four years. If Rashid \u2013 and also Jos Buttler \u2013 hit form, England will be in serious danger of winning a World Cup.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bbef71207b1ecd8f3aff90866c3f5ea55affa97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bbef71207b1ecd8f3aff90866c3f5ea55affa97/172_104_2472_1484/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Woakes (left) and Jofra Archer (right) have formed a formidable bowling partnership.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Woakes (left) and Jofra Archer (right) have formed a formidable bowling partnership.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "1 Win the toss and bat One of the bigger cheers of the 2005 Ashes came when Michael Vaughan won the toss before the final Test at the Oval. If there are any England fans at Edgbaston for Thursday\u2019s semi-final, there will surely be a similar cheer should Eoin Morgan do the same. As in 2005, batting first has suddenly assumed critical importance. A combination of tired pitches and debilitating pressure mean the team batting first have won 26 of the 39 completed games at this tournament \u2013 including 15 of the last 18. That\u2019s the kind of data nobody can ignore. 2 Adapt to the conditions While England have been criticised for not always adapting with the bat, no one can doubt their tactical flexibility. Two of the non-negotiables of their World Cup plan \u2013 bowling first and playing two spinners \u2013 have gone out the window because of changes in conditions and form. And though they will remain open minded in case they encounter extreme conditions, it is hard to see them deviating from the new balance of five fast bowlers and one spinner \u2013 especially as all the fast bowlers are in form and both the spinners are not. 3 Back the openers not to have a bad day Don Bradman was once told by Neville Cardus that the law of averages was against him making runs the following day. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the law of averages,\u201d Bradman said. He scored 304. England will hope Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow have a similar attitude, because they are due a failure. Their opening partnership has become totemic both in style and substance, and their record at home is almost Bradman-esque: they have an average stand of 95 and have hit nine 100 partnerships in 16 innings. And England have won all nine games when they have put on 100. 4 Target early wickets to make a difference The new-ball partnership of Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer has been almost as important. England are superb frontrunners with bat and ball and excellent at holding their nerve in the field during a tight run chase; but they are not as good at dragging a game back after a poor start. It\u2019s no coincidence that the two big opening partnerships against them in this tournament \u2013 by Pakistan and Australia \u2013 led not only to defeat but also a slightly alarming unravelling in the field. All three potential opponents in the knockout stages rely heavily on their top four, so a strong start \u2013 and ideally a couple of early wickets \u2013 would be ideal. But England cannot expect to always control games from the start. At some stage, whether with bat or ball, they will have to cope with mid-match adversity better than they have so far in the tournament. A World Cup doesn\u2019t come for free. 5 Catches win matches Fielding is a window into a team\u2019s soul. England lost their way and their rag against Pakistan and Australia, and both times it affected their batting later in the day. Their fielding in the two must-win matches against India and New Zealand was electric, symbolised by Bairstow\u2019s almost-demented boundary-riding. They need to reach the same standard in the knockout stages, especially if they are asked to field first. 6 Target the weak links The remaining semi-finalists are superb sides, yet all have passengers. England\u2019s ability to target the weaker links, with ball and especially bat, will be critical. Their assault on India\u2019s Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav last Sunday was breathtaking in its audacity, courage and skill, and for most of the tournament they have marmalised even the best spinners. Spin was England\u2019s white-ball kryptonite for so long; if they are going to win the World Cup they may as well exorcise one of the biggest demons of the last 27 years. 7 Keep the score ticking over Fifty overs is a long time. In the last two matches England have had very quiet spells with the bat, yet still scored over 300 both times. There will be periods in the semi-final when the scoreboard gets stuck; England need to accept that and sit in for a few overs where necessary. They will also, surely, accept that Jasprit Bumrah and especially Mitchell Starc must be handled with the utmost care. 8 Captain Morgan must lead from the front There is no need for anyone to shove a game plan under the wrong hotel door. Everyone knows Morgan will be peppered with short balls when he comes to the crease. In the next few days he should spend hours having balls thrown at his head in the nets. Most of all, whether it is to duck, hook, make room or phone a friend, he needs to have absolute clarity in his mind. In the biggest matches the performance of the captain can set a decisive tone. 9 Make your own luck Roy could have been out first ball against New Zealand. Bairstow twice put an inside-edge against Mohammad Shami past leg stump at the start of his century against India. Mark Wood\u2019s fingertip dismissed Kane Williamson in the kind of freak incident that makes people believe in destiny. As good as England were against India and New Zealand they had the kind of luck that is usually essential in knockout games. They won both tosses, too, and were able to pick their best XI despite a few niggles to their fast bowlers. The backup looks relatively weak, for various reasons, so England will be desperate to avoid untimely injuries. 10 And if Rashid and Buttler rediscover their mojo \u2026 Adil Rashid played an important role in England\u2019s win over New Zealand on Wednesday but only with the bat and in the field. His bowling has been out of sorts all summer, not just in this World Cup, and he has gone from key player to afterthought. The leg spinner has the worst economy rate and strike rate of any England bowler in the tournament. A shoulder problem has affected his ability to bowl the googly. Rashid has had a number of injections in his shoulder and may have another before Thursday\u2019s semi-final. He could also do with an injection of confidence from Morgan, who has managed him so brilliantly for four years. If Rashid \u2013 and also Jos Buttler \u2013 hit form, England will be in serious danger of winning a World Cup.",

      "body": "<p>The term \u201cburnout\u201d dates to <a href=\"https://www.scirp.org/(S(czeh2tfqyw2orz553k1w0r45))/reference/ReferencesPapers.aspx?ReferenceID=1380346\" title=\"\">1974</a> , but judging from the media, and many people I know, it\u2019s the official diagnosis of 2019. Well, semi-official: last month, in Geneva, the World Health Organisation <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/27/health/who-burnout-disease-trnd/index.html\" title=\"\">announced</a> it was recognising burnout for the first time \u2013 yet the next day, it <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/burnout-is-not-a-medical-condition/article27281884.ece\" title=\"\">emerged</a> this wasn\u2019t the case. (Let\u2019s be fair to the WHO staff, though; they\u2019re probably just very tired.) In a widely shared essay, the Buzzfeed writer Anne Helen Petersen <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work\" title=\"\">described</a> her own burnout, and the associated \u201ctask paralysis\u201d, leaving her unable to complete basic chores. This kind of burnout isn\u2019t a temporary crisis, she argued; for millennials, \u201cIt\u2019s our base temperature.\u201d And it won\u2019t be solved by self-help: \u201cYou don\u2019t fix it with a vacation, or an adult colouring book, or \u2018anxiety baking\u2019 \u2013 which helps explain why so many millennials increasingly identify with democratic socialism and are embracing unions: we are beginning to understand what ails us, and it\u2019s not something an oxygen facial or a treadmill desk can <a href=\"http://www.oliverburkeman.com/books\" title=\"\">fix.\u201d</a></p> <p>I agree, and thus hesitate to mention a self-help technique here. But while we try to overhaul society, we still have to tackle our to-do lists, and there\u2019s one technique I\u2019ve recently found more useful than any other, as well as better suited to this era of exhaustion and overwhelm: limiting work-in-progress, or WIP. It\u2019s a simple notion, originating in the Japanese system of industrial scheduling known as \u201ckanban\u201d, adapted by Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry in their book <a href=\"http://personalkanban.com/pk/\" title=\"\">Personal Kanban</a>. You fix a small upper limit to the number of tasks you\u2019ll be working on at any one time \u2013 say, three. Then, you add no further tasks to your plate until you\u2019ve finished at least one. When there are only two tasks remaining in your WIP, you can bring in one more. And so on. The kanban system visualises this using Post-its on a whiteboard, arranged in columns: each task moves from the \u201cto do\u201d column to \u201cdoing\u201d to \u201cdone\u201d. If your WIP limit is three, there should never be more than three notes in \u201cdoing\u201d. (You can add a \u201cwaiting\u201d column, where you shunt tasks that are waiting on other people.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/21/the-wrong-side-of-history-has-become-a-crowded-place-time-to-rethink\">The wrong side of history has become a crowded place. Time to rethink</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The effects are extraordinary. By limiting WIP, you <em>feel</em> your finite capacity, so the counterproductive urge to start 15 tasks naturally subsides. Without trying, you find yourself breaking projects down into doable chunks (because if \u201cwrite book\u201d or \u201cget new job\u201d is one of your tasks, it\u2019ll jam things up for months). Above all, this way of working brings a deeply satisfying sense of having a foothold on things. Benson and Barry write: \u201cLinearly finishing one task before embarking on the next commitment becomes addictive, a pattern, and eventually a habit.\u201d</p> <p>The obvious objection is that you have too many demands on your time to limit WIP to three. But that\u2019s a misunderstanding. You already <em>can\u2019t</em> do more than a handful of things at once. If the world demands you do a hundred, that\u2019s an impossible request. Your only options are to choose, consciously, which ones will have to wait \u2013 or choose unconsciously. And to be clear, none of this is a magic solution to burnout. Instead, it\u2019s a repudiation of magic solutions, a liberatingly down-to-earth engagement with how things actually are.</p> <h2>Watch this</h2> <p>Jim Benson outlines the basics of dealing with overload \u2013 you\u2019ll need a lot of sticky notes, and a spare wall \u2013 in a video series at <a href=\"http://personalkanban.com\" title=\"\">personalkanban.com</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The term \u201cburnout\u201d dates to 1974 , but judging from the media, and many people I know, it\u2019s the official diagnosis of 2019. Well, semi-official: last month, in Geneva, the World Health Organisation announced it was recognising burnout for the first time \u2013 yet the next day, it emerged this wasn\u2019t the case. (Let\u2019s be fair to the WHO staff, though; they\u2019re probably just very tired.) In a widely shared essay, the Buzzfeed writer Anne Helen Petersen described her own burnout, and the associated \u201ctask paralysis\u201d, leaving her unable to complete basic chores. This kind of burnout isn\u2019t a temporary crisis, she argued; for millennials, \u201cIt\u2019s our base temperature.\u201d And it won\u2019t be solved by self-help: \u201cYou don\u2019t fix it with a vacation, or an adult colouring book, or \u2018anxiety baking\u2019 \u2013 which helps explain why so many millennials increasingly identify with democratic socialism and are embracing unions: we are beginning to understand what ails us, and it\u2019s not something an oxygen facial or a treadmill desk can fix.\u201d I agree, and thus hesitate to mention a self-help technique here. But while we try to overhaul society, we still have to tackle our to-do lists, and there\u2019s one technique I\u2019ve recently found more useful than any other, as well as better suited to this era of exhaustion and overwhelm: limiting work-in-progress, or WIP. It\u2019s a simple notion, originating in the Japanese system of industrial scheduling known as \u201ckanban\u201d, adapted by Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry in their book Personal Kanban. You fix a small upper limit to the number of tasks you\u2019ll be working on at any one time \u2013 say, three. Then, you add no further tasks to your plate until you\u2019ve finished at least one. When there are only two tasks remaining in your WIP, you can bring in one more. And so on. The kanban system visualises this using Post-its on a whiteboard, arranged in columns: each task moves from the \u201cto do\u201d column to \u201cdoing\u201d to \u201cdone\u201d. If your WIP limit is three, there should never be more than three notes in \u201cdoing\u201d. (You can add a \u201cwaiting\u201d column, where you shunt tasks that are waiting on other people.) The effects are extraordinary. By limiting WIP, you feel your finite capacity, so the counterproductive urge to start 15 tasks naturally subsides. Without trying, you find yourself breaking projects down into doable chunks (because if \u201cwrite book\u201d or \u201cget new job\u201d is one of your tasks, it\u2019ll jam things up for months). Above all, this way of working brings a deeply satisfying sense of having a foothold on things. Benson and Barry write: \u201cLinearly finishing one task before embarking on the next commitment becomes addictive, a pattern, and eventually a habit.\u201d The obvious objection is that you have too many demands on your time to limit WIP to three. But that\u2019s a misunderstanding. You already can\u2019t do more than a handful of things at once. If the world demands you do a hundred, that\u2019s an impossible request. Your only options are to choose, consciously, which ones will have to wait \u2013 or choose unconsciously. And to be clear, none of this is a magic solution to burnout. Instead, it\u2019s a repudiation of magic solutions, a liberatingly down-to-earth engagement with how things actually are. Watch this Jim Benson outlines the basics of dealing with overload \u2013 you\u2019ll need a lot of sticky notes, and a spare wall \u2013 in a video series at personalkanban.com. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com",

He had been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, when his usual primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor.</p>\n    <p>His bizarre claim to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\">make model cardboard buses</a> has raised eyebrows. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass. It remains to be seen what impact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/neighbour-who-called-police-over-boris-johnson-row-goes-public\">late-night police visit</a> will have on his chances.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members. Johnson\u2019s camp insist it would be part of a wider \u2013 and so far unknown \u2013 package of tax changes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has said relatively little, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country. Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted 'Boris island' airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Climate and environment</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on 'global Britain', it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary.

The foreign secretary said he believed Cameron and Osborne \u201cdid a superb job\u201d in putting the economy \u201cback on its feet\u201d.</p> \n<p>But he added: \u201cI defend what happened then, but with the benefit of hindsight \u2013 and it is only with the benefit of hindsight \u2013 I think there were a couple of areas where austerity did go too far.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne of them was on police numbers \u2026 and the other is the social care system.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"23caf334-d396-4f7e-85b3-af46137a6e37\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p><strong>Personal style</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His style is notably technocratic, with few rhetorical flourishes and an emphasis on his consensual approach and long record as a minister, notably during more than five years as health secretary, a traditional graveyard of ministerial careers. Hunt\u2019s attempts to talk up a backstory as an 'underestimated' entrepreneur can fall flat given he is also the son of an admiral and was head boy at Charterhouse. Overall, Hunt\u2019s approach can seem uninspiring and hard to pin down in terms of core beliefs, hence the 'Theresa in trousers' nickname among some Tory MPs.</p>\n    <p>Hunt has made headlines by promising to repeal the ban on fox hunting, while always facing scrutiny on his views on the availability of abortion.</p>\n    <p>His campaign team have decided to take the fight directly to rival Boris Johnson though, with Hunt taking part in a Twitter Q&amp;A session as a direct response to Johnson's refusal to appear on a Sky TV head-to-head debate. The hashtag: #BoJoNoShow.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He says a new deal with the EU is possible by 31 October and he would send a cross-party negotiating team to Brussels, including members of the DUP. He would countenance leaving the EU without a deal but is notably more wary than rival Boris Johnson.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Has been fairly silent on this, beyond a proposal to cut corporation tax from 19% to 12.5%, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/27/hunts-pledge-to-reduce-corporation-tax-will-cost-13bn-a-year\">according to the IFS</a> would cost an estimated \u00a313bn a year. Even at 19%, the UK rate is well below European and global averages.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Before the campaign began he called for a doubling of defence spending, but he has since pulled back slightly, saying only that it should increase. He has argued that cuts to social care budgets had gone too far.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Climate and environment</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Hunt backs the 2050 target for zero net carbon emissions and has called for 'sensible tax incentives' to encourage green initiatives, but very little beyond this.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A likely strength for him, as he has been seen as a solid foreign secretary, an impression burnished by taking over from the chaotic Johnson.

      "bodyText": "Armed police have arrested a man at his home in London following a security service investigation into a potential jihadist plot. The 20-year-old was detained early on Friday after a raid by Scotland Yard\u2019s counter-terrorism command in south-west London. The level of potential danger required armed police to be present, according to an assessment by police chiefs. Police said the man was arrested under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and taken to a police station for questioning. In a statement, the Met said no one was injured during the operation. \u201cIt is not believed there was any imminent threat to the public,\u201d it added. The police investigation will try to determine if concerns were correct and what if anything may have been being planned. The Met said the arrest was not related to two arrests made on Wednesday in Luton. In that operation a 28-year-old man and 25-year-old woman were arrested after a car in which they were travelling was stopped by police. Both were arrested under under section 41 of the Terrorism Act. A warrant for their further detention has been granted, allowing them to be held into next week while investigations continue. Police said a residential address and a commercial premises in Luton were searched and both the man and woman were brought to London for questioning at a police station, where they remained on Friday. The terrorism threat level in the UK remains at severe, meaning an attack is highly likely.",

In a section entitled My Body Is a Weapon, the veteran Czech photographer <a href=\"http://www.jarcovjakova.com/\">Libu\u0161e Jarcovj\u00e1kov\u00e1</a> enthralls with her edgy diaristic approach, laying bare a life lived recklessly amid a period of political repression in the 1970s and 80s. In shadowy monochrome, the young, self-taught Jarcovj\u00e1kov\u00e1 relentlessly photographed her own wild, doggedly self-destructive life in images that pay little attention to formal concerns, but nevertheless capture a time and milieu in an uncompromising way.</p> <p>There is not trace of romanticism here, rather a portrayal of a hedonistic time when sex and alcohol were constants and excess itself a declaration of freedom. Often, she is her own most riveting, and revealing, subject. \u201cThe tangle of an untold number of limbs, red wine for breakfast,\u201d she writes of one series tellingly called Killing Summer. \u201cAt night I walk barefoot along sidewalks. I understand nothing and don\u2019t care. Life is pelting along too fast to understand. I\u2019m rarely sober.\u201d Her raw, imperfect images possess that same chaotic, devil-may-care energy, offering an insider\u2019s eye-witness account of a time and a place with an extraordinary honesty.

Both shows are uneven but catch the peculiar energy of fragmented European youth cultures that thrived despite the constraints of repression. What comes across most strongly is how subversive ideas, propelled by the template of punk music and graphics, spread like a virus across Europe in a pre-digital era that seems suddenly impossibly distant. Today\u2019s global interconnectivity, in its mesmerising superficiality, seems to work against this kind of subversive \u2013 and defiantly local \u2013 communal creativity.</p> <p>The anxieties and injustices of our own time are at the heart of <a href=\"http://www.mohamedbourouissa.com/\">Mohamed Bourouissa</a>\u2019s powerful and politically engaged installation, Free Trade, which pointedly is exhibited in a space in Monoprix, a superstore near the railway station.

In series such as Nous Sommes Les Halles and P\u00e9riph\u00e9riques, he engages with the lives of Parisian youths traditionally demonised by politicians and the rightwing press, often presenting narratives that, in their clandestine exchanges, echo the official rituals of power and finance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a8f156c9f3c464817c4e85ebc071145f6562bf19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8f156c9f3c464817c4e85ebc071145f6562bf19/0_0_5906_4643/1000.jpg\" alt=\"L\u2019impasse, from the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique series, 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"786\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clandestine exchanges \u2026 L\u2019impasse, from the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique series, 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohamed Bourouissa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bourouissia is a quintessentially contemporary artist, not averse to using reenactments as well as footage shot on surveillance cameras and even stolen smartphones, to create complex images that are a world away from traditional documentary and all the more urgent for that.

The campaign against fossil fuel corporations\u2019 sponsorship of the arts has escalated in recent months amid growing concern about the scale and severity of the climate crisis. In February hundreds of people occupied the British Museum and last month a judge and several leading artists wrote to Cullinan on the eve of the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s annual awards calling on it to end its links to the company.

This week the London Stock Exchange reclassified fossil fuel corporations as non-renewable energy companies to distinguish between heavily polluting companies and greener producers. A few days later the head of strategy at BP admitted some of its oil and gas reserves \u201cwon\u2019t see the light of day\u201d, in part because of investors\u2019 pressure to stick to lower-carbon projects. The secretary general of the oil producers\u2019 group Opec has complained that the \u201cgrowing mass mobilisation of world opinion \u2026 against oil\u201d was \u201cperhaps the greatest threat to our industry\u201d and was \u201cbeginning to \u2026 dictate policies and corporate decisions, including investment in the industry\u201d.

I thought that to be houseproud was to live neatly and tidily, in a space that resembles an interiors catalogue; to conform to someone else\u2019s version of existence. But now my memories are no longer cordoned off in boxes \u2013 they are in full display on windowsills and mantelpieces and in postcards Blu-Tacked to the wall. It\u2019s cluttered, but I\u2019ve never been prouder. So much for tidying up.",

The territory was promised \u201ca high degree of autonomy\u201d under the Basic Law \u2013 Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution. But over the years China has tightened its control over the city, chipping away at freedom of speech, judicial independence and political rights. The recent eruption of protests in Hong Kong \u2013 prompted by a proposed law allowing for individuals to be extradited to mainland China \u2013 reflects a growing anger at this erosion of basic freedoms. Political rights In June 2014, Beijing released a policy white paper declaring that the Chinese government had \u201ccomprehensive jurisdiction\u201d over Hong Kong and the city\u2019s \u201chigh degree of autonomy \u2026 comes solely from the authorisation by the central leadership\u201d.

At the same time, it pushed expensive integration projects \u2013 including a bridge linking Hong Kong, Macau and southern China and a high-speed rail link to China \u2013 which antagonised many people. Rule of law Over the past few weeks, millions protested against the proposed extradition law that allows for individuals to stand trial in China\u2019s opaque courts. The protests forced the government to suspend the bill and its leader, Carrie Lam, apologised for the crisis, but the protesters were dissatisfied that she refused to fully withdraw the bill. On the anniversary of Hong Kong\u2019s 1997 return to Chinese rule on 1 July, after a mass peaceful demonstration, hundreds of young protesters stormed and vandalised the legislature building. Police fired teargas after midnight to disperse them. The proposed extradition law follows a white paper published by Beijing in 2014, which says \u201cloving the country is a basic political requirement\u201d for judges and they must also \u201csafeguard the country\u2019s sovereignty and security\u201d. Meanwhile, the law and judicial process are being used by the government to suppress dissidents, warn critics, who point to the prosecution of leaders of the Umbrella movement for archaic common-law offences such as \u201cconspiracy to commit public nuisance\u201d and \u201cinciting others to public nuisance\u201d. Press freedom Hong Kong\u2019s media has long self-censored, but the trend has deteriorated sharply in recent years as China uses media ownership to influence coverage. Eight out of Hong Kong\u2019s 26 mainstream media outlets are either under mainland Chinese ownership or have significant mainland stakes, a recent report found.

Following the 2014 Umbrella movement, journalists have reported increased internal editorial interference and suppression of critical voices. Mainland-owned Hong Kong media seek to present themselves as credible news outlets but are beholden to the Chinese government, which regularly feeds them with exclusive stories or information they rarely decline to publish. Direct criticism of top Chinese leaders is off-limits. Journalists from pro-Beijing media have also been invited by the Chinese authorities to cover staged confessional interviews with dissidents including Gui Minhai, one of the booksellers who ended up in mainland police custody after publishing politically sensitive books. In 2019, Reporters without Borders ranked Hong Kong 73rd out of 180 regions and countries \u2013 a drop from 15 years earlier, when it consistently ranked in the global top 20. Publishing The once flourishing publishing business in Hong Kong has also vastly declined, as Chinese-backed chains dominate the trade and independent bookshops struggle to survive. An investigation by the public broadcaster RTHK last year showed that China\u2019s representative office in Hong Kong has indirect full ownership of a local publishing conglomerate that runs more than half of the bookshops in the city and owns more than 30 publishers in Hong Kong. The book trade was badly shaken in 2015 when five publishers and booksellers from the Causeway Bay Books shop disappeared in mysterious circumstances. They surfaced in confessions on Chinese state TV, in which they admitted to crimes from a hit-and-run traffic incident to sending Chinese clients banned books. One jumped bail and bravely spoke out about his ordeal, which included mental torture, prolonged isolation and threats. In the aftermath, readers, publishers and even printers shied away from politically sensitive books. Bao Pu, who runs New Century Press, has published many political titles including a memoir by the ousted liberal Chinese leader Zhao Ziyang. He said publishing had become \u201ca dangerous business\u201d after the Causeway Bookshop incident and the trade had \u201cdried up in the past couple of years\u201d. Even the printers now refuse to print politically sensitive contents, he said. The books he published this year, including The Last Secret: The Final Documents from the June Fourth Crackdown and Deng Xiaoping in 1989, were printed outside Hong Kong, which hugely increased the cost. Ideological education and academic freedom Although a Hong Kong government plan in 2012 to introduce \u201cnational education\u201d classes in the school curriculum was shelved after a mass protest, patriotic elements have long been seeping into the education system. Most schools have a regular flag-raising ceremony. Textbooks extol the greatness of the Chinese nation and praise historical authoritarian rulers while avoiding sensitive incidents such as the crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen movement. The use of Mandarin instead of Cantonese (the native tongue of 90% of Hong Kong residents) in Chinese language classes in many schools has also fuelled resentment. In universities, academic freedom suffers as the government fills their councils with pro-government figures to preside over the work of the institutions. Joseph Cheng, a retired political scientist at City University of Hong Kong, said academics now need to be \u201cpolitically correct\u201d if they wish to enter the management, seek promotion or gain tenure. Those whom China sees favourably can access lucrative funding in China.",

      "bodyText": "The global box office has so far failed to sizzle this summer, with ticket sales down 6% in the first half of 2019 as misfiring Hollywood sequels give cinemagoers a case of franchise fatigue. Film fans spent almost $19bn (\u00a315bn) on going to the cinema in the first six months of the year, compared with the $20.2bn spent in the same period last year. Analysts suggest film fans have grown tired of the number of franchise releases over the period: Men in Black: International; Godzilla: King of the Monsters; How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World; and The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part were all released in the first half and failed to live up to expectations. The slump has been most keenly felt in the US box office, the world\u2019s largest movie market, with ticket revenuesdropping by 9.4% to $5.6bn in the first six months of the year. The number of tickets sold in the US has also fallen significantly, down more than 8% to 623.6m, according to Box Office Mojo. The UK box office has fared better than the US but revenues were still 6% lower than last year at \u00a3613.5m, according to Comscore. Attendance figures for the first half are due out later this month. The cinema industry is struggling to keep pace with a record-setting 2018, which smashed box office records globally, thanks in large part to the pre-summer season release of Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War. \u201cIt is also worth remembering that 2018 had a very strong start, with films released late the previous year, such as The Greatest Showman and Star Wars: The Last Jedi, still doing good business,\u201d said Phil Clapp, the chief executive of the UK Cinema Association. \u201cThis year hasn\u2019t had that same boost and it is fair to say that the box office take in the first quarter in particular wasn\u2019t as strong as we would have liked.\u201d The cinema industry is also fighting increasing competition from the big streaming companies \u2013 with Netflix and Amazon soon to be joined in the sector by Disney and Apple \u2013 as well as the huge investment from traditional TV companies such as HBO in mega-hits such as Game of Thrones and Big Little Lies. Last year Netflix made the same number of films as the big Hollywood studios combined \u2013 about 80 \u2013 and finally became a force at the Oscars this year with Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma winning big. Upcoming releases include the $150m action film 6 Underground, starring Ryan Reynolds. But Clapp says that there have been positive signs of a recovery in theatres with the launch of Avengers: Endgame \u2013 the second highest-grossing film of all-time behind James Cameron\u2019s Avatar \u2013 at the end of April fuelling the most successful May for UK cinemas in 50 years. More than 16 million film fans flocked to cinemas during the month.

      "body": "<p>Dr Michael Irwin has boarded five planes to Switzerland with somebody who has not come back. In two years\u2019 time, when he is 90, he thinks he may decide he has had what he calls \u201ca completed life\u201d. In which case, the one-way ticket to Dignitas will be for him.</p> <p>Irwin, a former GP and for 32 years a doctor at the United Nations, mostly in New York where he briefly treated visiting Margaret Thatcher and Nancy Reagan as well as UN staff, agrees he currently has \u201ca very nice life\u201d. Sitting in the sunshine over tea in the courtyard garden of the Royal Over-Seas League in London, backing onto Green Park, it must be hard to contemplate leaving it. He has a UN pension paid in dollars, three daughters and eight grandchildren, a partner whom he calls \u201cmy fourth wife though we\u2019re not married\u201d and is on lunching terms with the others.</p> <p>\u201cOne has a very comfortable existence,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I know, from my medical background, that things won\u2019t get better \u2013 they will get progressively worse. And the point almost certainly will come when I say thank you, it\u2019s been a good life, I\u2019ve lived longer than most people do, let\u2019s say goodbye to it all, as decently as possible.\u201d</p> <p>On <a href=\"https://ninetyplus.org.uk/\">a website called Ninety Plus</a> with pictures of setting suns and Brighton and Hove\u2019s crumbling pier, Irwin argues for the availability of doctor-assisted dying for those over that age who feel that they have, as he puts it \u201creached the stage of a completed life\u201d. It\u2019s for people who feel they have lived enough and do not want to go through the inevitable process of physical decline that further years will bring.</p> <p>Until he was 55, Irwin was still playing squash. He has been a physically active man whose equally energetic mind has not been much diminished by the years. When asked how he can sit in a beautiful garden and think about seeking death, he thinks for a moment, then says: \u201cThe biggest problem I have nowadays is a lack of energy.</p> <p>\u201cWe have some kind of social event like a lunch or a dinner and it gets cancelled. I often think \u2013 thank god, I can stay at home with a good book or watch something on TV,\u201d he says.</p> <p>A lot of people 30 years younger than him might think the same. \u201cYes but it becomes more of a factor the older you get. So energy is a major thing I feel changing as the time goes by.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ef87d516bf389a94a529da61aa92c6fdf438f50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ef87d516bf389a94a529da61aa92c6fdf438f50/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Irwin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Irwin: \u2018The biggest problem I have nowadays is a lack of energy.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But he says he is also becoming more physically decrepit. He leans heavily on a stick (\u201cYou get away with murder. You can always claim a seat on the train\u201d) and has specially built-up shoes.</p> <p>\u201cI had a car accident about 10 years ago now and had severe damage to the lower part of the spine as well as fracturing my left leg and two ribs and a broken tooth and a fractured sternum and so on. It becomes more and more difficult to walk now. I have very little sensation in my feet. That\u2019s getting worse and worse,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that in time, it will limit one getting around.\u201d</p> <p>He has been with his partner Angela Farmer, 74, for 20 years now, living between her house in Surrey and his flat in Hove. He used to fly to New York, where his daughters live, every six months but not for the past three years.

If he lives comfortably to 90 or even 92 he will be pleased, he says. \u201cBut the time will come when it\u2019s obvious that the end-stage is going to be pretty soon and I don\u2019t want to hang on to the point of being fully dependent on others.\u201d</p> <p>Irwin is a former chairman of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society \u2013 now called Dignity in Dying. He has escorted five people to their deaths. Very easy and contented deaths, he says. The first in 2005 was May Murphy, 75, who was suffering from multiple system atrophy, a progressive deterioration of the nervous system. As she ate a sandwich on the plane to Zurich from Glasgow, she joked: \u201cPerhaps this is my last meal and I have only one disciple with me.\u201d In the Dignitas flat, she raised her glass of Nembutal in a toast of thanks to Irwin and her son who had joined them there.</p> <p>The second was Dave Richards, 61, who had Huntington\u2019s disease and gave an interview over dinner to a journalist before flying out.

      "bodyText": "Dr Michael Irwin has boarded five planes to Switzerland with somebody who has not come back. In two years\u2019 time, when he is 90, he thinks he may decide he has had what he calls \u201ca completed life\u201d. In which case, the one-way ticket to Dignitas will be for him. Irwin, a former GP and for 32 years a doctor at the United Nations, mostly in New York where he briefly treated visiting Margaret Thatcher and Nancy Reagan as well as UN staff, agrees he currently has \u201ca very nice life\u201d. Sitting in the sunshine over tea in the courtyard garden of the Royal Over-Seas League in London, backing onto Green Park, it must be hard to contemplate leaving it. He has a UN pension paid in dollars, three daughters and eight grandchildren, a partner whom he calls \u201cmy fourth wife though we\u2019re not married\u201d and is on lunching terms with the others. \u201cOne has a very comfortable existence,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I know, from my medical background, that things won\u2019t get better \u2013 they will get progressively worse. And the point almost certainly will come when I say thank you, it\u2019s been a good life, I\u2019ve lived longer than most people do, let\u2019s say goodbye to it all, as decently as possible.\u201d On a website called Ninety Plus with pictures of setting suns and Brighton and Hove\u2019s crumbling pier, Irwin argues for the availability of doctor-assisted dying for those over that age who feel that they have, as he puts it \u201creached the stage of a completed life\u201d. It\u2019s for people who feel they have lived enough and do not want to go through the inevitable process of physical decline that further years will bring. Until he was 55, Irwin was still playing squash. He has been a physically active man whose equally energetic mind has not been much diminished by the years. When asked how he can sit in a beautiful garden and think about seeking death, he thinks for a moment, then says: \u201cThe biggest problem I have nowadays is a lack of energy. \u201cWe have some kind of social event like a lunch or a dinner and it gets cancelled. I often think \u2013 thank god, I can stay at home with a good book or watch something on TV,\u201d he says. A lot of people 30 years younger than him might think the same. \u201cYes but it becomes more of a factor the older you get. So energy is a major thing I feel changing as the time goes by.\u201d But he says he is also becoming more physically decrepit. He leans heavily on a stick (\u201cYou get away with murder. You can always claim a seat on the train\u201d) and has specially built-up shoes. \u201cI had a car accident about 10 years ago now and had severe damage to the lower part of the spine as well as fracturing my left leg and two ribs and a broken tooth and a fractured sternum and so on. It becomes more and more difficult to walk now. I have very little sensation in my feet. That\u2019s getting worse and worse,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that in time, it will limit one getting around.\u201d He has been with his partner Angela Farmer, 74, for 20 years now, living between her house in Surrey and his flat in Hove. He used to fly to New York, where his daughters live, every six months but not for the past three years. He now enjoys cruises instead, where he can drive into the port, have his bags taken and there is a mini hospital on board. The last was in the Baltic Sea. The next is Iceland. He has good genes, he says. His father lived to 90 and his mother to nearly 96. If he lives comfortably to 90 or even 92 he will be pleased, he says. \u201cBut the time will come when it\u2019s obvious that the end-stage is going to be pretty soon and I don\u2019t want to hang on to the point of being fully dependent on others.\u201d Irwin is a former chairman of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society \u2013 now called Dignity in Dying. He has escorted five people to their deaths. Very easy and contented deaths, he says. The first in 2005 was May Murphy, 75, who was suffering from multiple system atrophy, a progressive deterioration of the nervous system. As she ate a sandwich on the plane to Zurich from Glasgow, she joked: \u201cPerhaps this is my last meal and I have only one disciple with me.\u201d In the Dignitas flat, she raised her glass of Nembutal in a toast of thanks to Irwin and her son who had joined them there. The second was Dave Richards, 61, who had Huntington\u2019s disease and gave an interview over dinner to a journalist before flying out. Irwin gave the third, Raymond Cutkelvin who had pancreatic cancer, \u00a31,500 towards the costs of the trip for him and his partner Alan Rees. Rees became a campaigner and challenged the police to arrest him for his actions, which they did in 2009. They also arrested Irwin, but after 11 months on bail, he was told he would not be charged. The Telegraph ran the headline \u201cDr Death ruled too old to stand trial\u201d. \u201cFriends wrote asking: what other crimes can you now commit and get away with?\u201d said Irwin.

He needed 2/3 to equal his official world record of 2882, 2.5/3 to surpass 2882, and 3/3 to beat his unofficial daily record of 2889. That last figure, plus the ultimate target of a round 2900, which Carlsen recently called \u201ca half-attainable goal\u201d will have to wait until his next classical tournament in August. David Howell\u2019s tied second prize at St Louis last week has made the Sussex 28-year-old the new England No1, although his rating is below the elite 2700 level which Nigel Short and Michael Adams easily surpassed in their best years. Gawain Jones lost his last three games in the US, while Luke McShane was beaten in his last two at Netanya, where the former world title challenger, Boris Gelfand, won on tie-break at age 51 and showed his strategic skills. Next up, the \u00a35,000 British Chess Championships at Torquay from 26 July to 4 August, where Howell and Adams are the clear top seeds, rated more than 100 points higher than the No 3 Nick Pert. Adams has won six British titles and Howell three, mostly in the last decade. The Cornishman, 47, who has rested since his setbacks earlier this year, won the 2016 British with a co-record 10/11 score and is the current holder, so Torquay will be his opportunity to recover his former status. 3626 (by Nicolo Belli) 1 Rh8!

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s more on the byelection remain pact: But that\u2019s it from me. Here\u2019s a summary of what learned from the Darlington hustings: Boris Johnson has denied a BBC report that he was kept away from intelligence briefings. \u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d he said and added: \u201cI am extremely dubious about the provenance of this story.\u201d Jeremy Hunt refused to comment on the story. He said: \u201cWe have the finest intelligence services in the world, but that does depend on some discretion by the foreign secretary\u201d Johnson said he could have more money outside politics as an example of where he had put the national interest above his own self interest. \u201cIt is obviously possible to make more money by not being a full time politician. You have to make sacrifices sometimes,\u201d he said. Johnson defended free speech and in his public gaffes. He said: \u201cWhen people say you are making a gaffe, what you are doing is saying something true and necessary.\u201d He added: \u201cI deplore xenophobia and hate speech but I do think we should be able to speak our minds frankly without the fear that we\u2019re going to get our heads bitten off.\u201d Johnson claimed he was never in favour of the Conservative austerity programme and resisted David Cameron\u2019s plan for an austerity Olympics. \u201cThat not the stuff to give the troops,\u201d Johnson claimed he told Cameron. Jeremy Hunt said austerity \u201cwent too far\u201d on cuts to policing and social care. But he said this was only with the benefit of hindsight. Hunt pleaded with MPs not to take a no-deal off the table in Brexit negotiations. \u201cThe best way to get a deal is to leave no-deal on the table,\u201d he said. Earlier the chancellor warned Hunt and Johnson that parliament would find a way of blocking no deal. In a pointed dig at his rival Hunt said he thought about the British Iranian Nazanin Zeghari-Ratcliffe every day she is jail. Her family claimed she was put at greater risk when Johnson falsely claimed she was in Iran to train journalists. Hunt made new promises on immigration and the environment. He promised to reconsider the \u00a330,000 salary level as too high for business. And he suggested a national programme for installing electric car charging points. John Major has backed Hunt\u2019s campaign for leadership of the party. \u201cWe need a serious leader for serious times,\u201d he told the BBC. And that\u2019s it from Darlington. I\u2019ll post a summary soon. In the meantime, Downing Street has played down reports that Johnson was shut out of intelligence briefings. On austerity Hunt admitted that cuts went too far on police funding and social care. Q: Would a no-deal Brexit ruin the Conservative\u2019s reputation as the party of business? Hunt: We are the party of business but also the party that respects democracy. This is a country where politicians do what people tell them. We are going to leave the EU and make it a tremendous success. Q: Name a policy to improve the environment. Hunt: We have to show young people that we are true Conservatives by leaving the planet in a cleaner state. On specifics Hunt suggests putting in charging points for electric vehicles. When installing new internet capacity he said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we put in electric car charging points so we get electric only car towns and cities?\u201d Q: Does the need to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland mean we can\u2019t leave the EU? Hunt: I believe their is a technological solution, but it will take time. The EU must know that the backstop will never get through parliament which is why they must discuss technological solutions. Hunt agreed that the debate on this before the referendum was not good. On immigration, Hunt says he would reconsider the \u00a330,000 salary limit. He said the current limit is not good for business. He promises a royal commission on the issue. Hunt said: \u201cI am concerned about the \u00a330,000 salary limit, because that is too high for the needs of many businesses.\u201d As he answers questions from the audience, Hunt has just won the backing of John Major. \u201cWe need a serious leader for serious times,\u201d the former prime minister told the BBC\u2019s Hard Talk programme. Q: When was the last time you let someone down? Hunt says he thinks about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe every day. \u201cI am letting down Nazanin Zeghari-Ratcliffe every day she remains in jail.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve tried very hard to get her out, I\u2019ve met her husband Richard Ratcliffe on several occasions, she has a daughter the same age as my daughter.\u201d Q: would you accept a place in Johnson\u2019s cabinet? Hunt: After Brexit we have to come together, which is why there will always be a place for Boris Johnson in my cabinet. I would of course be proud to serve in Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet. The best way to get a deal is to leave no-deal on the table, Hunt repeats. To Tory colleagues he said: \u201cPlease don\u2019t take no-deal off the table\u201d. This is loudly applauded. Q: Is Brexit like being emancipated from Slavery? Hunt: We need to dial down the rhetoric on all sides and be the best of friends. Asked about Islamophobia, Hunt said \u201cwe have to root out all prejudice in our party\u201d which is why he said he backs an inquiry into the issue. Q: Are you confident you are seeing all intelligence briefings? Hunt: we can\u2019t comment on intelligence. \u201cSorry I\u2019m not commenting on intelligence matters.\u201d \u201cWe have the finest intelligence services in the world, but that does depend on some discretion by the foreign secretary\u201d. Hunt promises that he won\u2019t take the Tories into a general election until it recruits more young people as members. He said: We could elect our own populist, or we could do better, we could elect our Jeremy. Jeremy Hunt is up next. He starts by praising Darlington\u2019s railway history and its current record on engineering and exporting bridges. He said the main difference between him and Johnson is his ability to negotiate a deal, and trots out his well-worn lines about being an entrepreneur. Johnson can\u2019t remember the location of the sausage factory he visited yesterday, describing it as \u201csomewhere in Yorkshire\u201d. The audience laughs. Asked about Tory MPs voting against whatever Brexit deal has been present to parliament, Johnson said: \u201cI think that they\u2019re just going to have to get used to the fact that unless we get on and do this we\u2019re going to keep on haemorrhaging support.\u201d Johnson suggested he won\u2019t accept chlorinated chicken being imported from the US after Brexit. Johnson claims he was never a fan of austerity. \u201cAusterity is not a helpful term. I never liked it. I remember Dave Cameron saying he wanted an austerity Olympics and I said: \u2018No way mate.\u2019 That\u2019s not the stuff to give the troops.\u201d Q: Should we have a written constitution to enshrine free speech? Free speech has been protect in Britain since the 18th century, Johnson said. He added that we don\u2019t need any protection for free speech from the EU he claims. \u201cI deplore xenophobia and hate speech but I do think we should be able to speak our minds frankly without the fear that we\u2019re going to get our heads bitten off.\u201d On Education, Johnson described student debt as \u201cmassive Ponzi\u201d scheme. He says wants to give young people a better chance of owning their own home. He also claims the Conservatives are the party for a cleaner environment, which he claims is a vote winner for young people. Asked about the fishing industry, Johnson refuses to say whether the UK will scrap the 12 mile limit. But he repeats that the UK will be taking controls of our waters. Johnson insists he is not selfish by claiming that he could have made more money by not being a politician. \u201cIt is obviously possible to make more money not being a politician. But you have to make sacrifices sometimes,\u201d he said. He claims he could have earned more by writing a book about Shakespeare. Johnson criticises Theresa May\u2019s government for slipping in its preparation for a no-deal Brexit. \u201cWe sagged on our oars,\u201d he said. The most important thing is to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, he said. On that BBC intelligence story Johnson said: \u201cI am extremely dubious about the provenance of this story\u201d. Asked about gaffes, Johnson says: \u201cWhen people say you are making a gaffe, what you are doing is saying something true and necessary.\u201d Johnson is asked by CNN\u2019s Hannah Vaughan Jones about a BBC report that he was kept away from intelligence briefings. Johnson says he does not comment on intelligence maters. But then adds: \u201cIt is not true. But I cannot comment any further on intelligence matters. I am sure the prime minister will not comment on security matters.\u201d Johnson repeats his joke about the ingredients for Mars bars but adds a local reference to parmos. Johnson begins by lamenting the Conservative\u2019s standing in the polls. He says he can\u2019t remember when the party last sank to 9%, but claims this the dark before the dawn. Boris Johnson will be up first in Darlington. He will give a speech and then be interviewed. Jeremy Hunt will then go through the same formula. Once again there will be no head-to-head debate. Boris Johnson has arrived at the Darlington Hippodrome in time for the latest hustings, according to the local Northern Echo\u2019s live blog of event. \u201cIt\u2019s a north-east Tory who\u2019s who\u201d, according to the Echo\u2019s Chris Lloyd. Johnson has launched a new campaign video timed for the arrival in the post of ballot papers to Tory party members. He underlines his pledge not to delay Brexit beyond the Halloween deadline. \u201cKick the can and we kick the bucket\u201d, is his chosen soundbite to the party faithful. Jeremy Hunt appears to have arrived by train in Darlington for this morning\u2019s hustings. We\u2019re not sure how Johnson is getting there but it\u2019s only a 40 minute drive from Ripon (near where\u2019s he was shearing sheep) to Darlington. Boris Johnson has apologised for offending Scots, while condemning the SNP\u2019s record in government and insisting that a no-deal Brexit is \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d in an interview in the Press and Journal. Asked about a series of magazine articles in which he described being a Scottish MP as a \u201cpolitical disability\u201d and said that \u201cgovernment by a Scot is just not conceivable\u201d, Johnson replied: \u201cOf course I am sorry if people take offence at distorted quotations from old newspaper articles \u2013 but one of the things I want to make clear is that Conservatives must reach out beyond the Westminster bubble and that means not just speaking in waffle and jargon\u201d. He went on to accuse the SNP of using devolved power \u201cto damage the Scottish economy: making Scotland the highest taxed part of the UK, bloating the Scottish deficit to four times that of the UK\u2019s and desperately trying to keep Scottish fishing communities locked into the hated Common Fisheries policy\u201d. Boris Johnson has been shearing sheep in North Yorkshire before the hustings in Darlington today. Meanwhile, his campaign continues retweet posts from Tory members who claim to have voted for Johnson. Jeremy Corbyn has accused Amazon of not paying its fair share of taxes. The Labour leader wrote a card to the company\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, to mark the 25th anniversary of Amazon\u2019s launch. It read: \u201cDear Jeff. Happy Birthday. You owe the British people millions in taxes that pay for the public services that we all rely on. This year, pay your fair share of taxes, give your hard-working staff a pay rise and respect workers\u2019 rights. \u201cMany Happy Tax Returns, Jeremy.\u201d The outgoing LibDem leader, Vince Cable, has welcomed a pledge by the Greens and Plaid Cymru not to contest the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection next month, claiming it will open the way for more pro-remain electoral pacts. The contest was triggered by a recall petition after the Conservative MP for the seat, Chris Davies was convicted of fiddling expenses. Speaking to the Today programme Cable said: \u201cThe Liberal Democrats have the best opportunity to win this byelection and Plaid have got behind us endorse our candidate as have the Greens. There is strength in being together.\u201d Asked if the LibDems were prepared to pull their candidates in seats where Plaid and the Greens had the best chance of winning, Cable said: \u201cYes in principle we would be willing to do that.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is no narrow deal around this particular seat but it will create trust and good will, we will reciprocate in an appropriate way. We have no difficulty with that. We had an agreement with the Greens at the last general election - they didn\u2019t contest my seat and we didn\u2019t contest the Green\u2019s seat in Brighton. And that kind of thing could now happen much more widely given the strength of feeling about Brexit.\u201d Cable said he had consulted the two candidates competing to succeed him, Jo Swinson and Ed Davey, about the move. He said: \u201cThey will have to endorse the strategy going forward but we\u2019ve had a careful process of consultation. The political logic of what\u2019s happening is irresistible.\u201d But Cable ruled out electoral deals with the Labour Party even if moved to back a second referendum. Cable said: \u201cThe Labour party is way off the map where this is concerned. They have been so ambiguous for so long and sat on the fence. There is no possibility of an agreement with the Labour party.\u201d Theresa May is heading for Poland on what is expected to her last foreign trip as prime minister. She is expected to tell delegates as the Western Balkans summit to work together to tackle organised crime. According to PA she is set to say crimes including money laundering, human and drugs trafficking, weapons trading, cyber-attacks and terrorism threaten lives in the UK and undermine security and stability in the Western Balkans. \u201cThere is no doubt that serious and organised crime and corruption are security challenges we all face across Europe,\u201d she will tell the summit. \u201cThey can only be tackled by strong international cooperation.\u201d Back home, five former top police officers in Britain have attacked May\u2019s record on crime, saying that \u201cresources drained to dangerously low levels\u201d have contributed to a \u201cfeeling of lawlessness\u201d and saying confidence in the police has to be urgently restored. A letter to the Times signed by Lord Condon, Lord Stevens, Lord Blair, Sir Paul Stephenson and Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, says: \u201cThe reduction of police and support staff by more than 30,000, the virtual destruction of neighbourhood policing and the inadvisable undermining of lawful police powers such as stop and search, have taken their toll. Common sense suggests that these factors have contributed to the feeling of lawlessness generated by knife murders and \u2018county lines\u2019 drugs.\u201d Speaking to LBC Stevens said: \u201cTheresa May\u2019s departure from number 10 will hopefully mark an end to the dark period of policing, where quite frankly, relationship between the government and police officers are an all time low. We know what the situation is on the streets, and we really do need something done about it, and done about it now. \u201cWe witnessed a complete breakdown of trust and confidence between her and overworked police officers.\u201d Welcome to a Friday instalment of Politics Live at a crucial juncture in the Tory leadership race. Most of the 160,000 Tory members will now have received their ballot papers and many will be voting over the weekend. The two contenders, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, are due to take part in four leadership hustings in the next two days. The first is in Darlington at 10.30am today, before Johnson and Hunt head to Perth for the only hustings in Scotland, at 7pm. Ringing in Hunt and Johnson\u2019s ears will be a parting shot from the chancellor Philip Hammond.

      "body": "<p>John McCririck, who has died aged 79, was one of the pioneers of an abrasive, in-your-face, style of television broadcasting which was provocative, challenging and entertaining to many. His loud, misogynist manner offended some viewers, but enabled him to become the best-known and most discussed individual in horse racing. </p> <p>As the face of male chauvinism, he was hired regularly by TV producers to appear in light entertainment and lifestyle programmes such as Celebrity Big Brother, Wife Swap, Loose Women and The Weakest Link. But his great love, and most significant source of income, remained horse racing, and, despite a claim by his long-suffering wife, Jenny (nicknamed \u201cthe Booby\u201d by her husband), that \u201cJohn won\u2019t get out of bed for less than \u00a31,500\u201d, he was content, in later years, to cover an evening race meeting on satellite TV for a few hundred pounds.</p> <p>For many years, bedecked in an Old Harrovian blazer, or a swirling cape and deerstalker hat, his act (for that is what it was) was a blend of Peter Wilson (the journalist known as \u201cthe Man They Can\u2019t Gag\u201d) and the racecourse tipster Prince Monolulu, whose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OauiVnN1YUU\">trademark cry of \u201cI gotta horse\u201d</a> resonated around racecourse enclosures during the postwar period. McCririck\u2019s racecourse diatribe, accompanied by tic-tac hand signals, invariably attracted a pied-piper following of camera-seeking and often inebriated racegoers.</p> <p>His career faltered in 2008, when Channel 4 Racing reduced his appearances, to McCririck\u2019s annoyance and frustration. Still his popularity remained buoyant in the US, where his visits invariably included contributions to ESPN\u2019s coverage of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/breeders-cup\" title=\"\">Breeders\u2019 Cup</a> race meeting. Unhappily, one broadcast in 2009 proved disastrous, when he decried the chances of two well-fancied runners, Conduit and Zenyatta, both of which won.</p> <p>When, in 2012, Channel 4 announced that McCririck would no longer be part of its presenting team, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/02/john-mccririck-channel-4-irritating-tribunal\" title=\"\">he claimed ageism at an employment tribunal</a>.

His career as a writer and reporter, broadening into coverage of horse racing, earned him several awards, including specialist writer of the year in 1978, and, the following year, campaigning journalist of the year, following his expos\u00e9 of improper practices at the Tote under the chairmanship of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/dec/12/biography\" title=\"\">Woodrow Wyatt</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d488435590393a58d77a6955e222b5ee8313da96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d488435590393a58d77a6955e222b5ee8313da96/0_102_3988_2393/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Mccririck with his wife, Jenny, at the Derby in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John McCririck with his wife, Jenny, at the Derby in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Javier Garc\u00eda/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But his days behind the camera in Grandstand led to a growing frustration and determination to spread his wings. In 1981 he moved to ITV, and when Andrew Franklin and Brough Scott planned the switch of the independent network\u2019s coverage of racing to Channel 4 in the mid-1980s, McCririck offered himself as an on-the-spot reporter of market moves, located in the centre of the betting action.</p> <p>Franklin and Scott went for it; McCririck was given the freedom of the betting jungle, and coverage of horse racing was transformed. As his reputation as an audience-puller increased, he became the \u201cmust have\u201d voice of racing on radio and television, when any general-interest racing story broke.</p> <p>While his star remained in the ascendant in television, his associates became concerned at the effect of the on-course bookmaking environment on his personal betting transactions. In March 1984 the Star newspaper\u2019s front page carried the headline \u201cTV Star\u2019s Gambling Debts\u201d. The essence of the story was that bookmakers were writing off massive gambling debts in return for publicity.</p> <p>McCririck sued for libel and won six-figure damages. His creditors were satisfied and McCririck reined in his betting. Despite now earning substantial sums through broadcasting and public appearances, he maintained a low profile in his personal life. When he and Jenny moved away from the Marylebone flat, their new home was a modest mews cottage in Primrose Hill.</p> <p>McCririck would hold court, seated on the floor, or a wicker chaise longue in his ante-room in the manner of Buddha, smoking a vast cigar and calling for champagne to be served by his wife. \u201cThe Trap\u201d, as the dwelling was named, and McCririck\u2019s lifestyle, were revealed to a horrified public during his ill-advised appearance on Celebrity Wife Swap, on which he was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sx3nBPHZhY\" title=\"\">matched with the former </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sx3nBPHZhY\" title=\"\">Conservative MP Edwina Currie</a>. This followed his equally controversial appearance on Celebrity Big Brother in 2005, during which he refused point-blank to speak for three days when he was deprived of his daily \u201cfix\u201d of Diet Coke.</p> <p>His compliance with requests to feature in similar programmes baffled his associates. Nonetheless, appearances on Loose Women (he was booed off), the Sharon Osbourne Show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH8Wpcjo_Pk\" title=\"\">(</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH8Wpcjo_Pk\" title=\"\">the hostess threw water over him)</a>, The Weakest Link, Hell\u2019s Kitchen and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSuMkYffsLg\" title=\"\">Alan Titchmarsh Show (</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSuMkYffsLg\" title=\"\">the host asked him to leave)</a> all followed. A man who in the 1980s had been viewed as a hard-working and serious journalist was now playing the part of the unlovable clown in burlesque.</p> <p>One individual who never left his side was Jenny, who was his driver (he refused to drive a car), gofer (holding his umbrella at the races), caterer, housekeeper, dog walker and defender. She never accompanied him on his holidays to Las Vegas, Bangkok and Japan, however, preferring to spend his absence working their dogs and \u201cpicking up\u201d at friends\u2019 shoots.</p> <p>McCririck had few close friends, but there were many who held him in deep affection. Beneath all his petulant bluff and bluster, he remained an essentially kind person and a generous host.</p> <p>Jenny survives him.</p> <p> \u2022 John Michael McCririck, racing pundit, journalist and broadcaster, born 17 April 1940; died 5 July 2019</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/22/julian-wilson\" title=\"\">Julian Wilson</a> died in 2014</p>",

McCririck would hold court, seated on the floor, or a wicker chaise longue in his ante-room in the manner of Buddha, smoking a vast cigar and calling for champagne to be served by his wife. \u201cThe Trap\u201d, as the dwelling was named, and McCririck\u2019s lifestyle, were revealed to a horrified public during his ill-advised appearance on Celebrity Wife Swap, on which he was matched with the former Conservative MP Edwina Currie. This followed his equally controversial appearance on Celebrity Big Brother in 2005, during which he refused point-blank to speak for three days when he was deprived of his daily \u201cfix\u201d of Diet Coke. His compliance with requests to feature in similar programmes baffled his associates. Nonetheless, appearances on Loose Women (he was booed off), the Sharon Osbourne Show (the hostess threw water over him), The Weakest Link, Hell\u2019s Kitchen and the Alan Titchmarsh Show (the host asked him to leave) all followed. A man who in the 1980s had been viewed as a hard-working and serious journalist was now playing the part of the unlovable clown in burlesque. One individual who never left his side was Jenny, who was his driver (he refused to drive a car), gofer (holding his umbrella at the races), caterer, housekeeper, dog walker and defender. She never accompanied him on his holidays to Las Vegas, Bangkok and Japan, however, preferring to spend his absence working their dogs and \u201cpicking up\u201d at friends\u2019 shoots. McCririck had few close friends, but there were many who held him in deep affection. Beneath all his petulant bluff and bluster, he remained an essentially kind person and a generous host. Jenny survives him. \u2022 John Michael McCririck, racing pundit, journalist and broadcaster, born 17 April 1940; died 5 July 2019 Julian Wilson died in 2014",

He had been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, when his usual primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor.</p>\n    <p>His bizarre claim to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\">make model cardboard buses</a> has raised eyebrows. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass. It remains to be seen what impact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/neighbour-who-called-police-over-boris-johnson-row-goes-public\">late-night police visit</a> will have on his chances.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members. Johnson\u2019s camp insist it would be part of a wider \u2013 and so far unknown \u2013 package of tax changes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has said relatively little, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country. Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted 'Boris island' airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Climate and environment</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on 'global Britain', it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has hit out at claims that Downing Street sought to restrict his access to some sensitive intelligence information when he became foreign secretary in mid-2016. The Conservative leadership frontrunner told a hustings of party members that \u201che was extremely dubious about the provenance\u201d of the story that had led the BBC morning bulletins and that it was untrue. Rumours have circulated in political and intelligence circles that Johnson\u2019s access to intelligence briefings was restricted during his time as foreign secretary, an interesting claim given that the role includes responsibility for MI6 and GCHQ. The BBC report said that in 2016 Downing Street did not want Johnson to be shown a category of sensitive secret intelligence. One source said this was down to \u201ccontrol freakery\u201d on the part of No 10 rather than fears about whether Johnson could be trusted. Johnson\u2019s campaign team has obtained assurances from Downing Street insiders from the time, who insisted there was no attempt to prevent him from seeing relevant intelligence. Downing Street in the early period of Theresa May\u2019s tenure was run by two joint chiefs of staff, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy. People who worked for them at the time told the Guardian they were \u201cobsessed by controlling information\u201d, but they had no specific evidence that Johnson was singled out to be cut out of intelligence briefings. At the same hustings, Johnson\u2019s rival for the leadership and the current foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said there was a rule that ministers had to remain tight-lipped on intelligence matters. \u201cWe have the finest intelligence services in the world in this country \u2013 that does depend on some discretion by the foreign secretary so I\u2019m not going to breach that now,\u201d Hunt said. Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies are normally wary of becoming embroiled in any kind of political debate or dispute, and even raising the question has caused nervousness in the intelligence community. Whitehall sources said ministers received briefings or information that was appropriate to their role in government, and that general procedure was followed in Johnson\u2019s case. It would be normal for a prime minister to have more information than their senior prime ministers, as only Downing Street would have the full set of available information at any one time. Sources close to Johnson say there was no row at the time about being denied access and added that he saw everything he should have seen as foreign secretary. The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said on Friday: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on intelligence matters.\u201d Asked whether May had trusted Johnson at the time, she said yes. The spokesperson added: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of fact that it was the PM\u2019s decision to appoint Boris Johnson as FS in full knowledge of all the responsibilities that that involves. He did a good job as foreign secretary in his time in the post.\u201d",

More than 80% of the country\u2019s arable land is cultivated for rice production, and at least 15 million smallhold farmers rely on rice production for their livelihoods. Trang Tran grew up among this culture. It\u2019s what inspired her to create Fargreen, a social enterprise dedicated to building sustainable farming communities.

Whether Priest is writing violent near-future dystopias about the effect of virtual reality on society, time-slip romances or subtle political parables, a constant feature of the stories is the cool, assured quality of his prose. The first three tales are more horror than SF: a claustrophobic Lovecraft homage; a detailed study of a protagonist\u2019s dying moments; and the powerful \u201cThe Head and the Hand\u201d, a macabre, understated tale of a man driven to perform acts of masochism on stage. The standouts of this excellent volume include the haunting \u201cAn Infinite Summer\u201d, in which Priest deftly recreates the manners and mores of the late Victorian era in a poignant story of a man separated from his lover by the intervention of time travellers from the future, and \u201cPalely Loitering\u201d, detailing a boy\u2019s obsessive love in a far-future society, where starships and time travel contrast with an old-fashioned, almost Edwardian mood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"43bd32f0045043d5e975bdeb724565d28c060362\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43bd32f0045043d5e975bdeb724565d28c060362/0_0_327_499/327.jpg\" alt=\"Water Shall Refuse Them\" width=\"327\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Lucie McKnight Hardy\u2019s <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/water-shall-refuse-them-9781911585565.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><strong>Water Shall Refuse Them</strong></a> (Dead Ink, \u00a39.99) is a slow-burning coming-of-age novel examining family grief, set in an isolated rural community where things unseen and unsaid simmer beneath the surface of everyday life. In the sweltering summer of 1976, teenager Nif and her family leave Bristol to spend a month in the Welsh countryside; after the tragic drowning of Nif\u2019s younger sister, they are trying to come to terms with their loss. Instead, the pressure-cooker atmosphere of rural isolation and incommunicable grief builds relentlessly. Nif becomes involved with a local sect known as the Creed and finds refuge in the arcane rituals of witchcraft, abetted by mysterious local teenager Mally, as the novel builds towards a heart-rending climax. Hardy skilfully captures the mood of the 70s, the hostility of an entrenched community and the power of superstitious belief. Expertly juxtaposing folk horror and everyday reality, this impressive debut conveys an atmosphere of imminent menace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"25c5708bcada0c62e80c89fb2e609cc57b2769c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25c5708bcada0c62e80c89fb2e609cc57b2769c2/0_0_313_500/313.jpg\" alt=\"The Border Keeper by Kerstin Hall\" width=\"313\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There are no everyday elements to Kerstin Hall\u2019s debut novella <strong>The Border Keeper</strong> (Tor, \u00a311.99). It begins on the outskirts of the spirit world, before moving to the weird realm of the underworld, Mkalis, where demon beasts and macabre gods are in constant battle. The grieving Vasethe has come to petition the eponymous border keeper: he wants her to guide him through Mkalis in search of his dead lover\u2019s soul. What follows is a phantasmagorical picaresque through a lushly realised underworld, populated by a grotesque bestiary of fantastical creatures, with danger dogging our protagonists\u2019 every step.

On the run from the Mages\u2019 Guild, which has imprisoned his grandfather, Gray teams up with an enslaved young woman, Brix, and together they attempt to free his grandfather from a subterranean temple.

Book three follows the sinister mystic Geryon Wynter, resurrected from the dead, as he returns to Rotherweird for his own mysterious purposes; he must deal with the many townsfolk who work both for and against him.

Prep 20 min Cook 30 min Makes 6 2 medium celeriac (about 350g each) For the barbecue sauce 2 tbsp red-wine vinegar 30g light brown sugar 1 tbsp molasses 100ml tomato ketchup Juice of 1 lemon Juice of \u00bd orange 1 garlic clove, bashed \u00bd tsp flaked sea salt A few sprigs fresh oregano or thyme, leaves picked 1 sprig rosemary \u00bd red chilli, deseeded For the slaw 1 spring cabbage, finely shredded 2 large carrots, peeled 50g pickled jalape\u00f1os, finely chopped, plus 2 tbsp of the pickle liquid Juice of 1 lime 1 drizzle honey 4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil Salt and black pepper 1 tbsp toasted sunflower seeds 50g bunch coriander, leaves only To serve 6 burger buns Mayonnaise Chilli sauce or sriracha First make the barbecue sauce. Mix all the ingredients in a saucepan, then simmer briskly over a medium-high heat for eight to 10 minutes, until slightly darker and a little thicker. Set aside to cool. Thickly peel the celeriac and cut into six 3cm \u201csteaks\u201d \u2013 they should weigh about 100g each. Bring a pan of salted water to a boil. Simmer the celeriac steaks for 10 minutes, until tender. Drain, put in a large bowl or roasting tray, pour over the barbecue sauce, then leave to marinate. Meanwhile, light the barbecue or heat a griddle pan, then prepare the slaw. Shred the cabbage and carrots, then toss with the chopped jalape\u00f1os. Make the slaw dressing in a jar: shake the pickled jalape\u00f1o liquid, lime juice, honey and olive oil, and season well. Just before serving, toss the cabbage with the dressing, sunflower seeds and coriander. Once the coals on the barbecue are white, grill the celeriac for five minutes on each side, brushing the steaks with the excess marinade. Layer the buns with a little mayo, a celeriac steak, some slaw and a drizzle of chilli sauce. Summer ros\u00e9 spritz I spent one long summer sipping this on grassy verges in Barcelona. In Spain, this super-relaxed street-side drinking is called botell\u00f3n \u2013 everyone brings a bottle, glasses and some ice, and it\u2019s as simple as that. This is often made with red wine, which works just as well, and decent shop-bought lemonade. Prep 5 min Makes 1.5 litres 1 bottle good-quality ros\u00e9, chilled 750ml sparkling water 150ml agave or sugar syrup 1 unwaxed lemon, sliced 1 unwaxed lime, sliced Put everything in a jug with lots of ice and give it a good stir. Pour into glasses, and drink outside in the sunshine or on a warm summer evening.",

      "body": "<p>Today, 5 July, marks 10 years since the far western Chinese region of Xinjiang exploded into violence between Uighurs, a majority-Muslim group living there, and Han, China\u2019s dominant ethnic group. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/06/china-riots-uighur-xinjiang\" title=\"\">incident left at least 196 dead</a>, countless injured, and a government determined to push the Uighurs to the brink.</p> <p>These events have ultimately led to the largest mass arbitrary detention since the second world war \u2013 with estimates of about 1 million individuals, possibly more, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/11/if-you-enter-a-camp-you-never-come-out-inside-chinas-war-on-islam\" title=\"\">held</a> against their will. There have been have multiple reports of mistreatment, torture and mysterious deaths at facilities designed to erode ethnic identity that resemble nothing so much as internment camps. At the same time, the region itself has been transformed into a surveillance state not seen anywhere else on Earth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/02/report-reveals-how-china-spies-on-muslim-minority-xinjiang-uighur\">\u2018Seldom uses front door\u2019: report reveals how China spies on Muslim minority</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though 2009 undoubtedly represented a turning point, the current crackdown has deep roots. China asserts that the Xinjiang region has always been an inalienable part of its territory, though Uighurs typically see their rule as illegitimate. Unmistakable colonial practices such as the transfer of Han Chinese to the region have been coupled with policies aimed at asserting Han culture as self-evidently superior.</p> <p>It was the 9/11 attacks and the US-led response to them that offered the Chinese government a new framing for the Xinjiang conflict: it was subsequently portrayed as a struggle against terrorism, despite the fact that the limited separatist movement in Xinjiang bore very little resemblance to the transnational terrorism propagated by the likes of Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>But back to 2009. At a factory in Shaoguan, Guangdong province, six Uighur men were accused of raping two Chinese women. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/10/china-riots-uighurs-han-urumqi\" title=\"\">Rioting broke out</a> and at least two Uighurs were killed. Shortly thereafter, video surfaced appearing to show Uighurs being beaten to death by Chinese co-workers. The initial allegations turned out to be false, but this did little to cool tensions. Shaoguan became the spark that lit a powder keg of resentment and hostility between Uighurs and Han, particularly in the regional capital, Urumqi, where the most significant numbers of Han had relocated \u2013 incentivised with lucrative employment opportunities.</p> <p>Young Uighurs marched towards the centre of the city in initially peaceful protests that <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2009/10/20/we-are-afraid-even-look-them/enforced-disappearances-wake-xinjiangs-protests\" title=\"\">escalated into violent rioting</a>. Groups of young Uighurs attacked Chinese residents, killing many. There were retaliatory attacks in the following days.</p> <p>Amnesty International conducted <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ASA17/027/2010/en/\" title=\"\">interviews with eyewitnesses</a> and concluded that security forces made liberal use of live ammunition.

      "bodyText": "Today, 5 July, marks 10 years since the far western Chinese region of Xinjiang exploded into violence between Uighurs, a majority-Muslim group living there, and Han, China\u2019s dominant ethnic group. The incident left at least 196 dead, countless injured, and a government determined to push the Uighurs to the brink. These events have ultimately led to the largest mass arbitrary detention since the second world war \u2013 with estimates of about 1 million individuals, possibly more, held against their will. There have been have multiple reports of mistreatment, torture and mysterious deaths at facilities designed to erode ethnic identity that resemble nothing so much as internment camps. At the same time, the region itself has been transformed into a surveillance state not seen anywhere else on Earth. Though 2009 undoubtedly represented a turning point, the current crackdown has deep roots. China asserts that the Xinjiang region has always been an inalienable part of its territory, though Uighurs typically see their rule as illegitimate. Unmistakable colonial practices such as the transfer of Han Chinese to the region have been coupled with policies aimed at asserting Han culture as self-evidently superior. It was the 9/11 attacks and the US-led response to them that offered the Chinese government a new framing for the Xinjiang conflict: it was subsequently portrayed as a struggle against terrorism, despite the fact that the limited separatist movement in Xinjiang bore very little resemblance to the transnational terrorism propagated by the likes of Osama bin Laden. But back to 2009. At a factory in Shaoguan, Guangdong province, six Uighur men were accused of raping two Chinese women. Rioting broke out and at least two Uighurs were killed. Shortly thereafter, video surfaced appearing to show Uighurs being beaten to death by Chinese co-workers. The initial allegations turned out to be false, but this did little to cool tensions. Shaoguan became the spark that lit a powder keg of resentment and hostility between Uighurs and Han, particularly in the regional capital, Urumqi, where the most significant numbers of Han had relocated \u2013 incentivised with lucrative employment opportunities. Young Uighurs marched towards the centre of the city in initially peaceful protests that escalated into violent rioting. Groups of young Uighurs attacked Chinese residents, killing many. There were retaliatory attacks in the following days. Amnesty International conducted interviews with eyewitnesses and concluded that security forces made liberal use of live ammunition. Human Rights Watch counted 43 verified cases of enforced disappearance of Uighurs arrested in the aftermath \u2013 a number that is likely much higher in reality. In the years after 2009, China went to great lengths to silence those seeking answers about their lost relatives. A noticeable security presence remained for months and was followed by the installation of an extensive network of security cameras and surveillance equipment. Five years on, after a spate of violent attacks including knifings and suicide bombings killed dozens of people inside and outside the region, came the \u201cStrike Hard\u201d campaign. Amendments to national religious regulations imposed further restrictions on religion, followed by legislation on counter-terrorism in 2015 and a deeply problematic law on \u201cde-extremification\u201d in 2017 \u2013 which UN experts have called \u201cneither necessary nor proportionate\u201d. China took surveillance to new levels, with mass DNA collection, the installation of street checkpoints where people\u2019s phones were inspected and the use of facial recognition technology. The response from the international community throughout this period was notably muted, including recently, as more evidence of grave abuses has emerged: from the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, who merely \u201craised the plight of Muslims in Xinjiang\u201d with the Chinese president in April, to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, which openly commended China for \u201cproviding care to its Muslim citizens\u201d in March, to a growing list of states that have already rolled over to please their (often) biggest trading partner. States need to be reminded that China is not the immovable object that many make it out to be. Chinese leaders have shown themselves remarkably sensitive to criticism. You can trace this in Beijing\u2019s constantly shifting narrative on the camps, indicating that greater scrutiny has had a real effect. From complete denial, to a hastily organised defence, to what we see today \u2013 an aggressively offensive propaganda push to refute and reframe reality \u2013 China has been forced to develop its counter-narrative. It is now clear that Chinese leaders are concerned that their Orwellian experiment in Xinjiang will come undone if it is met with broad censure from the international community. Until now we haven\u2019t seen anywhere near adequate pushback, given that credible voices argue that China\u2019s action in Xinjiang may constitute crimes against humanity. But if China responds to even the mildest of pressure, imagine what a strong, collective and coordinated response could achieve. \u2022 Peter Irwin is programmes manager for the World Uyghur Congress",

It means Sondheim, 89, will be the only living artist to have a theatre named in his honour both in London\u2019s West End and on Broadway in New York, where the former Henry Miller\u2019s theatre was named after him in 2010. Sondheim said he had loved British theatre since he saw his first play in London in 1958 and Mackintosh\u2019s gesture meant a great deal. \u201cI am chuffed, as you say in British English, to a degree I wouldn\u2019t have imagined. Or as we say in American English: it\u2019s awesome.\u201d Mackintosh said he had been a friend and colleague of Sondheim\u2019s since he produced the musical revue Side by Side by Sondheim in 1976. \u201cAs an innovative voice in musical theatre, his influence has no equal. Sondheim\u2019s work will undoubtedly be performed as long as audiences want to see live theatre, so I feel honoured that he has agreed to have his name on one of my Shaftesbury Avenue theatres to salute his upcoming 90th birthday,\u201d he said. Mackintosh previously hoped to create a studio space in London named after Sondheim but the plans fell through. He said the new plan provided \u201ca perfect companion\u201d to his theatre next door, the Gielgud, named after the actor John Gielgud, and his Coward and Novello theatres, named after No\u00ebl Coward and Ivor Novello. The Queen\u2019s theatre, designed by the architect WGR Sprague, opened in 1907 with a production of The Sugar Bowl, a comedy by Madeleine Lucette Ryley. It closed for 20 years after a bomb hit it during the blitz, reopening in 1959 with Gielgud\u2019s Shakespearean recital The Ages of Man. The renaming will take place in December when the theatre reopens after four months of renovation and rebuilding work. Part of the project will involve the restoration of Sprague\u2019s original boxes, which were destroyed by the bomb along with the entire front of house. Les Mis\u00e9rables, the world\u2019s longest-running musical in its 35th year, will be at the Gielgud theatre while its regular home is closed.",

But then, there is no end of masochistic pleasure to be had from watching the suffering of others from the comfort of an armchair, as newcomers to the sport will be able to discover once this year\u2019s Tour de France sets off from Brussels on Saturday before wending its way into more familiar, Gallic terrain. Comprising 21 stages and covering a distance of 3,460 kilometres over three weeks, the <em>Grand Boucle</em> is a grandiose sporting spectacle that is broadcast almost in its entirety on the fringes of mainstream television in the UK.</p> <p>Like cricket on the radio, this coverage boasts no shortage of abstruse statistics, thoughtful historical rumination and all those other qualities Bryson found so endearing. While the days are long, and for long periods often uneventful, what sets cycling on the television apart is the ever-changing and often brutal and breathtaking canvas on which the action unfolds.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, considering stages can last up to six hours, there is often very little going on as the peloton meanders through the picturesque countryside from one town to the next, a whirring, shape-shifting swarm of arrestingly garish Lycra-clad human endeavour. To the untrained eye, it is just a bunch of blokes on bikes; 176 of them to begin with, until the inevitable accidents and illnesses begin to trim their ranks. Closer inspection, however, reveals this apparently random mob to be a self-sufficient society with a strictly defined hierarchy where every member has a designated role.</p> <p>As eager to seduce new converts as they are to keep those already radicalised onside, the commentary teams on Eurosport and ITV walk a tightrope as they attempt to educate the former while making sure to avoid patronising the latter. It can be difficult, because at times the whole jamboree can resemble a school sports day, where it seems everybody gets a prize.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9f17f45c2b5abc79e179869e74497876e2105c20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f17f45c2b5abc79e179869e74497876e2105c20/0_0_3500_2145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Movistar riders during a training session.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"613\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Movistar riders during a training session.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s the yellow jersey for overall leader and the green for best sprinter; the iconic polka\u2011dot shirt is worn by the King of the Mountains, while the best young rider wears pristine white. Stage winners are also rewarded on a daily basis, while there is even a prize for combativity, generally given to each day\u2019s most heroic failure.</p> <p>So much to win and yet so few contenders. While the horrific crash endured by Chris Froome during a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/12/chris-froome-doubt-tour-de-france-crash-criterium-hospital-injured\" title=\"\">reconnaissance mission</a> at the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 means the handful of riders actually capable of outright victory has been reduced, every man jack of the near 200 riders who set off on Saturday\u2019s first stage will have a crucial role to play.

      "bodyText": "In his book Down Under, the American travel writer Bill Bryson writes of accidentally stumbling into \u201cthe surreal and rewarding world of cricket on the radio\u201d. Driving alone along Australia\u2019s Stuart Highway, our intrepid explorer chances upon the commentary of an unspecified cricket match which provides him with welcome companionship and he realises something Test Match Special listeners have long known: there is \u201csomething incomparably soothing\u201d about cricket on the radio. Bryson marvelled at its \u201cunhurried pace, comforting devotion to abstruse statistics and thoughtful historical rumination, exhilarating micro-moments of real action stretched across many hours and with a lushness of terminology and restful elegance\u201d. Reading his findings, one can\u2019t help but feel such an enlightened and naturally inquisitive man would be similarly seduced by cycling on the television. Much like cricket on the radio, there is something incomparably soothing about cycling on the television, a state of affairs that might seem strangely at odds with the often punishing brutality of the sport involved. But then, there is no end of masochistic pleasure to be had from watching the suffering of others from the comfort of an armchair, as newcomers to the sport will be able to discover once this year\u2019s Tour de France sets off from Brussels on Saturday before wending its way into more familiar, Gallic terrain. Comprising 21 stages and covering a distance of 3,460 kilometres over three weeks, the Grand Boucle is a grandiose sporting spectacle that is broadcast almost in its entirety on the fringes of mainstream television in the UK. Like cricket on the radio, this coverage boasts no shortage of abstruse statistics, thoughtful historical rumination and all those other qualities Bryson found so endearing. While the days are long, and for long periods often uneventful, what sets cycling on the television apart is the ever-changing and often brutal and breathtaking canvas on which the action unfolds. Unsurprisingly, considering stages can last up to six hours, there is often very little going on as the peloton meanders through the picturesque countryside from one town to the next, a whirring, shape-shifting swarm of arrestingly garish Lycra-clad human endeavour. To the untrained eye, it is just a bunch of blokes on bikes; 176 of them to begin with, until the inevitable accidents and illnesses begin to trim their ranks. Closer inspection, however, reveals this apparently random mob to be a self-sufficient society with a strictly defined hierarchy where every member has a designated role. As eager to seduce new converts as they are to keep those already radicalised onside, the commentary teams on Eurosport and ITV walk a tightrope as they attempt to educate the former while making sure to avoid patronising the latter. It can be difficult, because at times the whole jamboree can resemble a school sports day, where it seems everybody gets a prize. There\u2019s the yellow jersey for overall leader and the green for best sprinter; the iconic polka\u2011dot shirt is worn by the King of the Mountains, while the best young rider wears pristine white. Stage winners are also rewarded on a daily basis, while there is even a prize for combativity, generally given to each day\u2019s most heroic failure. So much to win and yet so few contenders. While the horrific crash endured by Chris Froome during a reconnaissance mission at the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 means the handful of riders actually capable of outright victory has been reduced, every man jack of the near 200 riders who set off on Saturday\u2019s first stage will have a crucial role to play. This year\u2019s Tour comprises 22 teams, each with its own leader, his lieutenants and the more limited lackeys known as domestiques. Behind them, orders are barked over radio by demanding generals from support cars, which are also occupied by support staff whose job is to keep the troops fed, watered and as comfortable as possible on the road. Meanwhile in the commentary boxes, those tasked with providing even more colour intersperse their often nuanced and informative discourses on the battles we are watching, but sometimes cannot see unfold, with the kind of ruminations that really shouldn\u2019t work but do. A personal favourite remains the gruff, no-nonsense, former Irish professional Sean Kelly expounding at great length on his efforts to compete at the highest level while suffering the excruciating discomfort of \u201ca boil on the buttock\u201d and the apparently unspeakable horrors that entailed. For the TV viewer, every stage of the Tour de France is a school day with an ever-changing syllabus incorporating subjects as diverse as race etiquette, the feeding habits of riders, the geography and geology of Mont Ventoux\u2019s famous \u201clunar landscape\u201d and assorted chapters from the long, rich and often murky history of an event that is about to be held for the 106th time. Wide-ranging and illuminating, these unhurried, improvised tutorials will from time to time be interrupted by the comparative frenzy of an actual bike race, which seems only fair because ultimately that\u2019s why cycling on the television is there.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s been a good few days for 15-year-olds. First we had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/01/alex-mann-the-teenage-rap-fan-who-lit-up-glastonbury\">Alex Mann</a> wowing Glastonbury as he rapped on stage with Dave. Then we had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/01/wimbledon-coco-gauff-fairytale-debut-venus-williams\">Coco Gauff</a> defeating Venus Williams, a winner of seven grand slam titles, in the first round of Wimbledon. I\u2019m slightly in awe but can\u2019t help wondering where they developed the talent, the confidence and the determination. When I was their age I hadn\u2019t a clue about anything very much and could barely look other people in they eye when talking to them. Even now as a 62-year old, I still experience my life as some kind of terrifying adventure for which I have been given no instruction manual. I can remember bringing my daughter home from hospital for the first time and thinking: I\u2019m not ready for this as I really don\u2019t have a clue what I\u2019m supposed to be doing. It\u2019s still a mystery to me that she and her brother have somehow grown up into the sort of adults I would like to have been. My career has followed a similar trajectory. Nothing about it has ever been planned, rather it\u2019s been a survival regime to get me to the end of the day more or less intact, predicated on saying yes to every opportunity that has come my way. There are still many days when I struggle to get out of bed with anxiety. I\u2019m writing this on my laptop holed up in my bedroom as nowhere else feels quite as safe today. With all due respect to Alex and Coco, there\u2019s sometimes something to be said for getting your disappointments in early.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>Some days the news values feel all wrong. A man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/03/man-who-fell-from-plane-could-be-nairobi-airport-employee\">stows away</a> in the wheel arch of a Kenya Airways plane, freezes to death during the flight from Nairobi and, when the wheels are retracted, falls 3,500ft into someone\u2019s back garden in south-west London. You\u2019d have thought the story here was who exactly was the stowaway \u2013 he is as yet unnamed \u2013 and why was he so desperate to escape Kenya that he embarked on a journey he must have known there was a high probability he wouldn\u2019t survive. And yet the way the story was reported by most newspapers in the UK, the main issue was the distress caused to the person into whose garden the man had fallen. For it wasn\u2019t just any garden. It was the garden of a house worth more than \u00a32m and its owner, who had so thoughtlessly had his <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9417223/sunbather-stowaway-fell-3500ft-kenya-airways-jet-shock/\">sunbathing interrupted</a>, was an Oxford graduate. And as we all know, Oxford graduates are much more sensitive than other mortals and find it much harder to cope with having their paving slabs broken by a desperate man frozen into a block of ice. The message to all other stowaways is clear: if you\u2019re going to be inconsiderate enough to die in transit, at least have the grace to fall out over the Thames where there\u2019s a chance your body may never be found. But failing that, fall out somewhere where house prices are lower and you\u2019re less likely to disturb Oxford graduates.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>My new summer tactic of not watching sporting events on TV in order to enhance England\u2019s chances would be working better if I could stick to it. I managed to miss most of the Women\u2019s World Cup semi-final against the USA by going to hear my sister play in her first big band concert since taking up the trumpet 18 months ago. So far, so good. I got home just after England had been awarded a penalty but before it had been taken. You know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/02/usa-england-womens-world-cup-match-report\">what happened next</a>. Don\u2019t blame Steph Houghton, blame me. I knew she was going to miss from the moment she stood over the ball. Years of experience, years of heartbreak. I\u2019m doing rather better with the cricket. With England poised to go out of the World Cup, I avoided the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/30/england-cricket-world-cup-india-plunkett-woakes-match-report\">match against </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/30/england-cricket-world-cup-india-plunkett-woakes-match-report\">India</a> by first hanging out with my children in Brighton and then going to a stunning performance of Massenet\u2019s opera Cendrillon. For what was effectively a quarter-final <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/03/england-new-zealand-match-report\">against New Zealand</a>, I merely had the TV on mute in the background at work and only kept a partial eye on proceedings. As a result, England are now in the semi-finals. If I make a point of missing the next two games, England are sure to win the whole thing. Best not to watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/03/andy-murray-serena-williams-wimbledon\">Andy Murray and Serena Williams</a> too. Instead I shall try to sound knowledgeable about why Tanguy Ndombele \u2013 a player neither I nor almost anyone else had ever heard of until six months ago \u2013 is the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jul/03/tanguy-ndombele-complete-midfielder-focus-spurs-tottenham\">complete midfielder</a>\u201d and well worth the club-record \u00a355m that Spurs have spent on him.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>After another week close to the Tory leadership hustings and seeing the UK\u2019s new MEPs arriving at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, I feel increasingly degraded and toxified by British politics. Almost every day we seem to hit a new low. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt care only for the votes of 160,000 party members and are locked in a death spiral to prove who is clinically insane enough to lead the Conservatives. Both are promising to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/04/boris-johnson-spending-plans-no-deal-brexit-york-hustings\">spend billions</a> the country doesn\u2019t have to counter the effects of a no-deal Brexit that almost nobody wants. Boris literally doesn\u2019t have a plan while Hunt has turned into an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/01/everyman-plastic-politician-jeremy-hunt-mutates-into-kamikaze-kurtz\">Action Man </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/01/everyman-plastic-politician-jeremy-hunt-mutates-into-kamikaze-kurtz\">Colonel Kurtz</a> with a 10-point plan that centres on declaring war on the EU and giving it three weeks to surrender. It\u2019s hard to know which is worse. Meanwhile, Boris also wants to make the country as fat as possible by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/03/boris-johnson-vows-to-review-whether-sugar-tax-improves-health\">getting rid of the sugar tax</a> and Jezza loves the smell of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/04/jeremy-hunt-promises-vote-on-repeal-of-foxhunting-ban\">napalm on foxes</a> in the morning. Next up, the return of public hangings and transportation. Things are no better in Strasbourg where first the new Brexit party MEPs embarrassed themselves and the country by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/02/brexit-party-meps-turn-their-backs-european-anthem-ode-to-joy\">turning their backs</a> on an orchestra and singer performing Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy \u2013 a protest described by the clueless Claire Fox as \u201cmild\u201d, despite it evoking the Nazis in the Reichstag. Nor did the Lib Dems exactly cover themselves in glory with their \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/09/liberal-democrats-bollocks-to-brexit-party-slogan\">Bollocks to Brexit</a>\u201d T-shirts. Then we get Ann Widdecombe, the Brexit party\u2019s pantomime dame, whose most notable contribution as a Tory MP was to ensure pregnant prisoners attended hospital appointments in chains, using her maiden speech to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/04/ann-widdecombe-likens-brexit-to-emancipation-of-slaves\">compare membership of the EU to slavery</a> and fail to understand that the European parliament had a right to ratify selections for the top jobs. The UK is now the laughing stock of Europe. An object lesson in becoming a failed state. We are being governed by the new idiocracy.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>Some recovery from the dehumanising effects of the Tory leadership contest and Ann Widdecombe in the form of Arthur Smith\u2019s new show Syd at the Soho Theatre in London. Here were words \u2013 and music, provided by the pianist and singer Kirsty Newton \u2013 for the soul. Smith is not just a master of the laugh-out-loud, deadpan gag. As he\u2019s got older he\u2019s allowed a vulnerability into his act, and Syd is a touching tribute to his late father, a policeman whose reputation for preferring, whenever possible, not to arrest people on his south London beat earned him the nickname of \u201cThe Poet\u201d from his colleagues. There were so many high points \u2013 who could ever resist Smith growling along to Leonard Cohen songs? \u2013 but what stayed with me longest was the section in which he switched between his father\u2019s life as a young man and his own. While Smith was getting charged by the French riot police in Paris when taking part in a student protest he knew nothing about, Syd was watching his fellow soldiers get machine-gunned at El Alamein before being captured and made a prisoner of war. He eventually ended up in Colditz. I\u2019ve often felt the same about my father, who spent the entire war in the navy, getting sunk twice and seeing horrors from which he never fully recovered. All I could manage between the ages of 18 and 24 was to get two degrees and become a heroin addict. No comparison really. I wasn\u2019t the only person to leave the show in tears. Syd is only an hour long and is on for a couple more weeks before relocating to Edinburgh for August. Do go. You will come out feeling better about the world. For a short while at least.</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested: </strong>The Tory hustings: the Unspeakable in pursuit of the votes of the Untreatable. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c6dc585afbbdf160383709b5f72f082f41a60ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c6dc585afbbdf160383709b5f72f082f41a60ef/101_69_3319_1991/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage and Ann Widdecombe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photo of the week (1): \u2018And the best thing is you get paid a shed load of cash for being a complete twat.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Seeger/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2767ce35e2b63bc00dbfa2b4fba392fcb2ca64b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2767ce35e2b63bc00dbfa2b4fba392fcb2ca64b/0_0_4019_2412/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Osborne at Wimbledon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photo of the week (2): \u2018And after I\u2019ve become head of the IMF, I\u2019m going to be Andy Murray\u2019s doubles partner.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Veysey/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

Then we get Ann Widdecombe, the Brexit party\u2019s pantomime dame, whose most notable contribution as a Tory MP was to ensure pregnant prisoners attended hospital appointments in chains, using her maiden speech to compare membership of the EU to slavery and fail to understand that the European parliament had a right to ratify selections for the top jobs. The UK is now the laughing stock of Europe. An object lesson in becoming a failed state. We are being governed by the new idiocracy. Friday Some recovery from the dehumanising effects of the Tory leadership contest and Ann Widdecombe in the form of Arthur Smith\u2019s new show Syd at the Soho Theatre in London. Here were words \u2013 and music, provided by the pianist and singer Kirsty Newton \u2013 for the soul. Smith is not just a master of the laugh-out-loud, deadpan gag. As he\u2019s got older he\u2019s allowed a vulnerability into his act, and Syd is a touching tribute to his late father, a policeman whose reputation for preferring, whenever possible, not to arrest people on his south London beat earned him the nickname of \u201cThe Poet\u201d from his colleagues. There were so many high points \u2013 who could ever resist Smith growling along to Leonard Cohen songs? \u2013 but what stayed with me longest was the section in which he switched between his father\u2019s life as a young man and his own. While Smith was getting charged by the French riot police in Paris when taking part in a student protest he knew nothing about, Syd was watching his fellow soldiers get machine-gunned at El Alamein before being captured and made a prisoner of war. He eventually ended up in Colditz. I\u2019ve often felt the same about my father, who spent the entire war in the navy, getting sunk twice and seeing horrors from which he never fully recovered. All I could manage between the ages of 18 and 24 was to get two degrees and become a heroin addict. No comparison really. I wasn\u2019t the only person to leave the show in tears. Syd is only an hour long and is on for a couple more weeks before relocating to Edinburgh for August. Do go. You will come out feeling better about the world. For a short while at least. Digested week, digested: The Tory hustings: the Unspeakable in pursuit of the votes of the Untreatable.",

At about 440g, the 26,800mAh Anker is a beast, but it can produce 30W from its USB-C port, which is enough to fast-charge small and medium laptops, tablets and anything in between.</p> <p>Two standard USB ports can take care of anything else, while the large capacity battery has enough juice to charge most smartphones up to seven times, tablets at least twice or laptops once. It will fully charge via USB-C in about 4 hours with a 30W charger and just sneaks under the flight limit for rechargeable batteries, meaning you can safely take it on a plane.</p> <p>If the Anker is too expensive, the RavPower USB-C Power Bank 26,800mAh PD Portable Charger is half price at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/26800mAh-Portable-Charger-External-Nintendo-Black/dp/B07PN36LLW/\">\u00a356</a> with the same 30W USB-C output, two standard USB ports and a microUSB port for charging.

The only downside is that you\u2019ll need an adapter if you want to plug either cable into a USB-C charger such as the Anker Atom PD1 or Mu One.</p> <h2>Phone mounts</h2> <p>Holidays in a car mean a GPS device is a must. But don\u2019t rent a GPS from the hire car company; your phone loaded with offline Google Maps in a phone mount will be way better.</p> <p><strong>WinnerGear Montar Car Holder \u2013</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/WinnerGear-Genuine-Montar-Strongest-Holder-Black-Red/dp/B00BZWW3ES/\">\u00a322</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"607ab64db48c3025bab296b1025ce6395c2310ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/607ab64db48c3025bab296b1025ce6395c2310ef/43_0_1787_1072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WinnerGear Montar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The WinnerGear Montar car mount sticks like glue to your windshield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WinnerGear</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are lots of excellent car mounts, but if you need one that sticks like glue to your windshield, then I heartily recommend the Montar from WinnerGear.

Any old wallet or toiletry bag can help, but dedicated cable organisers tie the pesky things down either to a board or in a small bag, making them probably one of the best travel accessories I\u2019ve ever bought.</p> <p><strong>Bagsmart Pomona Electronic Organiser</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/BAGSMART-Travel-Electronics-Organizer-Drives/dp/B06XR3V2JL\">\u00a315</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4512f37ce83966ef0a3c72a04fe2d982fc5b80e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4512f37ce83966ef0a3c72a04fe2d982fc5b80e8/58_69_2367_1421/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bagsmart Pomona Electronic Organiser\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bagsmart Pomona Electronic Organiser cable bag will make sure all your chargers and leads stay neat and tucked away when travelling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bagsmart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you want a small cable organiser to start, then Bagsmart\u2019s highly-rated small Pomona Electronic Organiser has a good combination of elastic tidies, mesh pockets and even an SD card pouch.</p> <p>Larger versions are available with multiple layers for even more cables.

It will charge just about any USB-C laptop including an Apple MacBook Pro or Dell XP13, plus anything smaller such as tablets and phones. Multichargers If you need to power up multiple things at once there are some excellent multi-device chargers available. Anker\u2019s highly-rated PowerPort+ has four standard USB ports and one 29W USB-C port (\u00a330) using a standard, detachable C7 (figure-eight) lead for power, which you can swap out for a EU or US plug.

Two standard USB ports can take care of anything else, while the large capacity battery has enough juice to charge most smartphones up to seven times, tablets at least twice or laptops once. It will fully charge via USB-C in about 4 hours with a 30W charger and just sneaks under the flight limit for rechargeable batteries, meaning you can safely take it on a plane. If the Anker is too expensive, the RavPower USB-C Power Bank 26,800mAh PD Portable Charger is half price at \u00a356 with the same 30W USB-C output, two standard USB ports and a microUSB port for charging. Anker\u2019s slightly smaller PowerCore Speed 20100mAh Powerbank will also deliver 22.5W via USB-C for \u00a350. RavPower USB-C Power Bank 45W PD 3.0 - \u00a356 If you need a more powerful 45W of charging for a larger laptop, RavPower\u2019s 20,100mAh power bank will do the trick with one USB-C port and one standard USB socket. It will fully charge in about 3.5 hours via USB-C at 30W, but it\u2019s 100g heavier than the 30W powerbanks and more difficult to get in the UK than lower wattage banks. Pocket chargers Big capacity batteries are great, but are bulky. For those times when you need a bit of juice on the go, pocketable chargers such as Anker\u2019s 86g PowerCore+ mini 3350 (\u00a313) or 68g RavPower Power Bank Luster Mini 3350mAh (\u00a311) will be enough to charge your phone to at least 60%, depending on the model. Most will only output a paltry 1A (5W) out of their USB socket, which means slow charging, but they\u2019re great in a pinch. Multi-head cables Traveling light isn\u2019t easy if you have multiple devices with you on the road, but if you\u2019re only charging one device at a time a multi-headed cable can cut the number of cables you need in three. Anker\u2019s 1m PowerLine II 3-in-1 (\u00a312) and Spigen\u2019s 1.5m Essential C10I3 (\u00a312) both have a regular USB plug at one end and a microUSB plug at the other with add-on USB-C and Apple Lightning adapters, making them the one cable that can charge practically anything. The only downside is that you\u2019ll need an adapter if you want to plug either cable into a USB-C charger such as the Anker Atom PD1 or Mu One. Phone mounts Holidays in a car mean a GPS device is a must. But don\u2019t rent a GPS from the hire car company; your phone loaded with offline Google Maps in a phone mount will be way better. WinnerGear Montar Car Holder \u2013 \u00a322 There are lots of excellent car mounts, but if you need one that sticks like glue to your windshield, then I heartily recommend the Montar from WinnerGear. It will stay stuck so hard to pretty much any flat surface that prising it off takes a bit of brute force, and has a good grip on your phone too. Mpow Gravity Car Mount \u2013 \u00a310 Vent mounts are a good alternative to windscreen holders. Magnetic mounts have become popular, but you need to put a plate on the back of your phone. If you\u2019re just looking for something simple for travel, the highly-rated Mpow Car Phone Holder Gravity Car Mount fits most phones in cases clipping onto air conditioning vents to hold your phone in place. Cable organisers Travelling with a mass of cables, chargers and batteries can be a nightmare of tangles. Any old wallet or toiletry bag can help, but dedicated cable organisers tie the pesky things down either to a board or in a small bag, making them probably one of the best travel accessories I\u2019ve ever bought. Bagsmart Pomona Electronic Organiser - \u00a315 If you want a small cable organiser to start, then Bagsmart\u2019s highly-rated small Pomona Electronic Organiser has a good combination of elastic tidies, mesh pockets and even an SD card pouch. Larger versions are available with multiple layers for even more cables. If you\u2019re travelling with an iPad or other tablet too there even combo cases that will sort your cables and protect your electronics, starting at about \u00a320. Active noise cancelling headphones A good set of noise cancelling headphones can relieve some of the stress of travelling by car, plane or train. Good options are available from about \u00a380 and up, with the Bose QC35 II (\u00a3289) and the Sony MX1000M3 (\u00a3279) being the very best. Noise-cancelling headphones use a series of microphones to detect unwanted sound, then play the inverse of that sound through the headphones\u2019 speakers, timed so it reaches your eardrum at the same time. The two sound waves cancel each other out, neutralising the nasty noise such as the drone of engines or the roar of air and protecting your hearing while they\u2019re at it.

      "bodyText": "Crime novelists have hit out at the claim that fictional depictions of sexual assault influence the outcomes of rape cases, after a prize for books with no violence against women asserted that stereotypical portrayals of attackers could \u201cseriously affect justice\u201d. The Staunch prize, awarded to a thriller in which no woman is beaten, stalked, sexually exploited, raped or murdered, was launched last year to \u201coffer an alternative narrative to stories based around violence to women\u201d. When it was announced, it was widely criticised by major writers including Val McDermid and Sophie Hannah. McDermid said that \u201cas long as men commit appalling acts of misogyny and violence against women, I will write about it so that it does not go unnoticed\u201d, and Hannah told her publishers not to submit her books for the prize. The prize, which is now looking for entries for 2019, this year points to what it calls a growing body of research suggesting that jurors are \u201creluctant to convict \u2018ordinary\u2019 men accused of rape, as they don\u2019t fit the idea of a rapist they\u2019ve internalised through the stories and images they\u2019ve received through popular culture\u201d. Its website adds: \u201cFictional stereotypes of night stalkers, dark-alley attackers, serial killers and menacing strangers are dangerously misleading when 90% of rapists are known to the victim and the majority of women murdered knew their killer. That this can so seriously affect justice for women is alarming, to say the least, and must be addressed. For these reasons, and because we love great writing, we invite thriller writers to bring us strong stories that don\u2019t resort to the same old cliches.\u201d Steve Mosby, whose latest novel You Can Run follows a killer who has been abducting women for 20 years, called the implication that crime writers who write about violence against women foster it in real life \u201cnot only offensive, but backwards and wrong-headed\u201d. \u201cMany crime writers explore this kind of material because they believe it\u2019s important not to brush it under the carpet \u2013 and they do so carefully and with sensitivity, compassion and insight. The message given out by the organisers of the Staunch prize suggests they haven\u2019t read very much of the genre at all,\u201d said Mosby. Julia Crouch, whose novels include Cuckoo and Her Husband\u2019s Lover, said she loves to write about \u201cwomen who behave \u2018badly\u2019 \u2026 Because of this, they find themselves in dangerous situations and sometimes they get hurt,\u201d she said. \u201cIs [the prize] really suggesting that they stay at home and knit? But then, the home is no safer. According to the Crime Survey of England and Wales, an estimated 1.2 million women experienced domestic abuse in the year ending March 2017, and an estimated 4.3 million aged 16-59 have experienced domestic abuse since the age of 16. Are we just not allowed to write about this?\u201d Crouch said that novelists tackle violence against women because \u201cit is our lived experience \u2026 To say that exploring it in fiction is somehow reprehensible seems to me to be yet another way of sidelining and silencing the female experience and voice. I know for a fact that women who have experienced violence can find it helpful to explore it in fictional form.\u201d Sarah Hilary, author of the Marnie Rome crime series, called the Staunch award \u201cnot a prize so much as a gagging order\u201d. \u201cViolence against women takes many forms, perhaps the most insidious of which is censorship. We\u2019re discouraged from going to the police in case we\u2019re not believed, taught to expect resistance to our version of events, silenced by shame or fear,\u201d she said. \u201cThis prize reinforces all those negative messages, and ignores the very real good that crime fiction can do by reflecting the violent reality of many women\u2019s lives.\u201d Staunch prize founder Bridget Lawless said that the award had not claimed that \u201ccrime writers who deal with sexual violence are contributing to it in real life \u2026 But we are concerned about the way that women are depicted as the victims of extreme torture, rape and murder, graphically described, bloody, terrifying and prolonged, normalised and offered up as entertainment. And guess what, so are lots of people, including readers who reject it by preference, and those working to end violence towards women,\u201d she said. \u201cHow does celebrating violence towards women like this deepen our understanding of social issues, as is so frequently claimed? Where is the research that demonstrates that this kind of writing does anything positive socially?\u201d She pointed to the recently reported fall in prosecutions for rape despite growing incidence. \u201cThose researching and advising about rape myths will tell you that the the public don\u2019t recognise rape in many situations that actually are [rape]. Could this be because they have in their mind an idea of what is a \u2018real rape\u2019 and a \u2018real rapist\u2019? The kind they see on TV or read about in books?\u201d she said. \u201cIs it true perhaps, that the research which tells us that many of our jurors have very fixed and wrongly held ideas about rapists are part of the reason they fail to convict in so many of the 90% of cases where the victim knew their rapists? \u201cThe Staunch prize celebrates thrillers that are an alternative to novels which feature violence to women. If you have a problem with that, ask yourself why.\u201d",

He thought he recognised the chair as being the same as the one he had bought on eBay and had shipped from France. So he decided to bring both chairs to Antiques Roadshow in Compton Verney to find out more about them. Lucy Bowden, multi-camera director, working in a tent on site. Right; dolls made for a window display Antiques Roadshow has a special place in Britain\u2019s cultural history. For more than 40 years it has been on the nation\u2019s screens attracting viewers of all ages and backgrounds. Its audience peaked at 15 million in the 1990s, before the advent of the internet, social media, and on-demand streaming services, but it still enjoys a regular audience of 6 million viewers today. No one who is not being filmed is allowed to walk on the red carpet When the show launched in 1977, its first presenter was the journalist and broadcaster Bruce Parker. It has often attracted well known presenters, including Angela Rippon, Michael Aspel, and since 2008, Fiona Bruce. Part of the show\u2019s appeal is its narrative jeopardy: you don\u2019t know if the object you are seeing is something incidental with a charming back story or a genuinely valuable antique. Some unexpected surprises have included the discovery of a Lalique vase, which was bought for a pound in a car boot sale and later sold for \u00a325,000, and a portrait by an unknown artist bought by a priest for \u00a3400 in a Norwich antique shop (partly for its frame), which was later identified as a painting by Van Dyck that was valued at \u00a3400,000.

Sex scenes in the movies are generally between people who are having sex for the first time. Laura and John are having married sex: they have had sex many times before this, although this is surely the first time since the death of their child, so the sex is a kind of redemptive miracle, a scene that is moving in its frankness and intimacy. Sutherland and Christie are an overwhelmingly convincing married couple, despite being apart for much of the film.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/venice\">Venice</a> itself has never been more passionately captured on screen. Almost every movie is content with sugary tourist cliches, but Don\u2019t Look Now, despite showing the obvious tourist locations, always shows it as a real working city.</p> <p>Lastly, that title: it always seems to belong to a much brasher, pulpier and more self-satirising horror film. In fact, the only moment to which the title applies is the scene where John is shocked to see the two old ladies in church and turns away \u2013 evidently before they can see him looking at them. They of course know something about John that he does not: his terrible prophetic gift that serves only to condemn him more utterly to his terrible fate.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXP8OaJGxrM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xXP8OaJGxrM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

Laura and John are having married sex: they have had sex many times before this, although this is surely the first time since the death of their child, so the sex is a kind of redemptive miracle, a scene that is moving in its frankness and intimacy. Sutherland and Christie are an overwhelmingly convincing married couple, despite being apart for much of the film. Venice itself has never been more passionately captured on screen. Almost every movie is content with sugary tourist cliches, but Don\u2019t Look Now, despite showing the obvious tourist locations, always shows it as a real working city. Lastly, that title: it always seems to belong to a much brasher, pulpier and more self-satirising horror film. In fact, the only moment to which the title applies is the scene where John is shocked to see the two old ladies in church and turns away \u2013 evidently before they can see him looking at them. They of course know something about John that he does not: his terrible prophetic gift that serves only to condemn him more utterly to his terrible fate.",

      "body": "<p>In 1983, millions of unsold cartridges of the Atari game ET The Extra Terrestrial were secretly buried in a concrete-covered landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Thanks to extremely rushed development and alleged interference from Universal Pictures, the movie tie-in was one of the worst video games ever made, and a mass grave was the only option for the poor, unwanted cartridges.</p> <p>Unfortunately, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/29/movie-adaptations-video-games-terrible-crack-code\">movies adapted from games</a>, games adapted from movies are often <em>bad</em>. (There are exceptions: 1997\u2019s 2D sidescrolling interpretation of Disney\u2019s Hercules on PlayStation brought me more joy than most recent games.)</p> <p>Historically, this has not been the result of too much interference from the movie studios that own the licences, but too little. Promising pop-culture properties such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/jul/07/transformers-revenge-fallen-wii-ps3\">Transformers</a>, Robocop and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/nov/22/harry-potter-deathly-hallows-part-one-review\">Harry Potter</a> have often been farmed out to contracted development studios that are then given far too little time to make anything half decent. The forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/starwars/jedi-fallen-order\">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a>, however, has better prospects than most. It\u2019s being developed by the lauded studio behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/04/titanfall-2-respawn-entertainment-giant-robot-shooter\">Titanfall EA\u2019s Respawn Entertainment</a>. And this is being done in close collaboration with Lucasfilm.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXpxWy8DJSE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WXpxWy8DJSE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is canon: that is to say, it exists in the same, increasingly dense Star Wars fictionverse as the movies, comic books and TV shows. \u201cIt\u2019s exhaustive,\u201d explains Aaron Contreras, narrative lead on the game, of the relationship. \u201cWe have very active partners at Lucasfilm. They\u2019ve been with us every step of the way creatively. Every character, every line in the script, every story beat has been negotiated, discussed, challenged, and fought over with Lucasfilm.\u201d</p> <p>Jedi: Fallen Order is a third-person, lightsaber swooshing, Jedi force-wielding, action adventure, set shortly after the events of Revenge of the Sith and before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/13/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-review-felicity-jones-gareth-edwards\">Rogue One</a>. Everything takes place in the same galaxy that Han Solo and Kylo Ren call home \u2013 albeit many years earlier in the timeline than the Skywalker saga. \u201cWe\u2019re looking back and telling a very specific story about a period in Star Wars history, while the current films are about the future, and closing that saga,\u201d explains Contreras.</p> <p>You play as the new character Padawan Cal Kestis, who has survived Order 66 to execute all the Jedi in the Republic, passed during the movie prequel trilogy, as he fights back against the Empire that carried out the great purge.</p> <p>Because Fallen Order is part of the connected Star Wars universe, fans will know some of its characters. In a demo session at this year\u2019s EA Play fan event in Los Angeles, I\u2019m navigating the forested wookiee planet Kashyyyk, previously seen in episode 3, to save a community of imprisoned wookiees from the Empire with help from Forest Whitaker\u2019s rebel character from Rogue One, Saw Gerrera.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"251b49ebecce0cb864004d39c566ecfcd608eb76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/251b49ebecce0cb864004d39c566ecfcd608eb76/0_0_2560_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order promotional image - Forest Whitaker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To the rescue! Forest Whitaker goes on wookiee patrol in Rogue One.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cProbably half of our locations in the game are existing locations inside the Star Wars universe, and you can bet there\u2019ll be more characters that the audience remember,\u201d says Contreras.</p> <p>The cutest original contribution that Fallen Order brings to the Star Wars universe is companion droid BD-1. This explorer droid was dreamt up by Respawn, and he joins you on your journey throughout the game. He jumps around on his two little legs, moving between riding on your back (adorable) and hopping around to scan the environment, hack stuff for you, and generally be your droid bestie (adorable, and also useful). BD-1 is aware of your player character, Cal\u2019s, physical health as well as how he\u2019s feeling, and his uneven little robot-eyes are always scanning for items useful to his owner. You can picture him in Christmas toy form.</p> <p>\u201cDroids tend to be the heart and the spine of the Star Wars franchise,\u201d reckons Contreras. \u201cWe had a vision and a concept for BD-1, which was largely what you see. But Lucasfilm pushed for more specificity in its design. So now, in the Star Wars universe, if you\u2019re an archaeologist or a climate scientist and you\u2019re going far away on a mission, you\u2019d bring a BD unit as a companion.\u201d</p> <p>The droid, which Contreras says was inspired by the Peanuts characters Snoopy and Woodstock, brings a lighthearted tone to Fallen Order that recalls the earliest Star Wars films. In fact, A New Hope was the biggest influence on this game\u2019s narrative and feel. On my mission to free the wookiees, I climb with BD-1 on my back up the legs of huge AT-AT, hauling my way on board the enormous moving vehicle to take over the vehicle\u2019s pilot seat, bonking the heads of the bozo stormtrooper pilots together in classic Star Wars slapstick fashion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"411fe1f2992e97eb637bd2d38f34b349a0573b18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/411fe1f2992e97eb637bd2d38f34b349a0573b18/80_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order BD-1 droid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cute touch \u2026 the BD-1 droid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fighting, meanwhile, is sophisticated and sometimes brutal, combining Force powers with the samurai-style sword-slashing \u2013 but with lightsabers, naturally. While BD-1 brings kid-friendly humour to the game, the combat, which is reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/dark-souls-2\">Dark Souls</a> series and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/apr/12/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review-playstation-xbox-software-activision\">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>, brings satisfaction and toughness. There\u2019s nothing childish about using the Force to pull an enemy trooper\u2019s neck into your grasp before slicing him up with your saber. It doesn\u2019t go too far for a 12 rating, though: you can\u2019t dismember enemies.

      "bodyText": "In 1983, millions of unsold cartridges of the Atari game ET The Extra Terrestrial were secretly buried in a concrete-covered landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Thanks to extremely rushed development and alleged interference from Universal Pictures, the movie tie-in was one of the worst video games ever made, and a mass grave was the only option for the poor, unwanted cartridges. Unfortunately, like movies adapted from games, games adapted from movies are often bad. (There are exceptions: 1997\u2019s 2D sidescrolling interpretation of Disney\u2019s Hercules on PlayStation brought me more joy than most recent games.) Historically, this has not been the result of too much interference from the movie studios that own the licences, but too little. Promising pop-culture properties such as Transformers, Robocop and Harry Potter have often been farmed out to contracted development studios that are then given far too little time to make anything half decent. The forthcoming Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, however, has better prospects than most. It\u2019s being developed by the lauded studio behind Titanfall EA\u2019s Respawn Entertainment. And this is being done in close collaboration with Lucasfilm. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is canon: that is to say, it exists in the same, increasingly dense Star Wars fictionverse as the movies, comic books and TV shows. \u201cIt\u2019s exhaustive,\u201d explains Aaron Contreras, narrative lead on the game, of the relationship. \u201cWe have very active partners at Lucasfilm. They\u2019ve been with us every step of the way creatively. Every character, every line in the script, every story beat has been negotiated, discussed, challenged, and fought over with Lucasfilm.\u201d Jedi: Fallen Order is a third-person, lightsaber swooshing, Jedi force-wielding, action adventure, set shortly after the events of Revenge of the Sith and before Rogue One. Everything takes place in the same galaxy that Han Solo and Kylo Ren call home \u2013 albeit many years earlier in the timeline than the Skywalker saga. \u201cWe\u2019re looking back and telling a very specific story about a period in Star Wars history, while the current films are about the future, and closing that saga,\u201d explains Contreras. You play as the new character Padawan Cal Kestis, who has survived Order 66 to execute all the Jedi in the Republic, passed during the movie prequel trilogy, as he fights back against the Empire that carried out the great purge. Because Fallen Order is part of the connected Star Wars universe, fans will know some of its characters. In a demo session at this year\u2019s EA Play fan event in Los Angeles, I\u2019m navigating the forested wookiee planet Kashyyyk, previously seen in episode 3, to save a community of imprisoned wookiees from the Empire with help from Forest Whitaker\u2019s rebel character from Rogue One, Saw Gerrera. \u201cProbably half of our locations in the game are existing locations inside the Star Wars universe, and you can bet there\u2019ll be more characters that the audience remember,\u201d says Contreras. The cutest original contribution that Fallen Order brings to the Star Wars universe is companion droid BD-1. This explorer droid was dreamt up by Respawn, and he joins you on your journey throughout the game. He jumps around on his two little legs, moving between riding on your back (adorable) and hopping around to scan the environment, hack stuff for you, and generally be your droid bestie (adorable, and also useful). BD-1 is aware of your player character, Cal\u2019s, physical health as well as how he\u2019s feeling, and his uneven little robot-eyes are always scanning for items useful to his owner. You can picture him in Christmas toy form. \u201cDroids tend to be the heart and the spine of the Star Wars franchise,\u201d reckons Contreras. \u201cWe had a vision and a concept for BD-1, which was largely what you see. But Lucasfilm pushed for more specificity in its design. So now, in the Star Wars universe, if you\u2019re an archaeologist or a climate scientist and you\u2019re going far away on a mission, you\u2019d bring a BD unit as a companion.\u201d The droid, which Contreras says was inspired by the Peanuts characters Snoopy and Woodstock, brings a lighthearted tone to Fallen Order that recalls the earliest Star Wars films. In fact, A New Hope was the biggest influence on this game\u2019s narrative and feel. On my mission to free the wookiees, I climb with BD-1 on my back up the legs of huge AT-AT, hauling my way on board the enormous moving vehicle to take over the vehicle\u2019s pilot seat, bonking the heads of the bozo stormtrooper pilots together in classic Star Wars slapstick fashion. The fighting, meanwhile, is sophisticated and sometimes brutal, combining Force powers with the samurai-style sword-slashing \u2013 but with lightsabers, naturally. While BD-1 brings kid-friendly humour to the game, the combat, which is reminiscent of the Dark Souls series and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, brings satisfaction and toughness. There\u2019s nothing childish about using the Force to pull an enemy trooper\u2019s neck into your grasp before slicing him up with your saber. It doesn\u2019t go too far for a 12 rating, though: you can\u2019t dismember enemies. Well, unless they\u2019re droids. A combination of Uncharted-style adventuring, cinematic scenes and comedy japes make Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order feel like a Star Wars film. It\u2019s got a family-friendly twinkle in its eye. But, like the movies, we should expect light and shade in this game, says Contreras. \u201cLike all things Star Wars, we try to have a wide range of tone.\u201d \u2022 Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is out in November, a month before Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is released in cinemas.",

      "bodyText": "The Conservatives\u2019 chances of retaining the Brecon and Radnorshire constituency in a byelection at the start of next month have slimmed after other pro-remain parties opted to stand aside to give the Liberal Democrat challenger a free run. The Green party and Plaid Cymru said they had decided to not stand candidates in the Welsh seat on 1 August in the hope of maximising the vote for Jane Dodds, the Lib Dem hopeful. The byelection was called after voters signed a recall petition against the incumbent Conservative MP, Chris Davies, who was convicted of submitting fake expenses documents. The petition was signed by 10,005 people, 19% of registered voters, well above the 10% threshold needed for a recall. The Conservatives have since announced that Davies will stand again, while the Brexit party is also putting up a candidate, further boosting the chances of the Lib Dems regaining a seat they held from 1997 to 2015. The Lib Dems are privately hopeful about winning the seat, which would instantly cut the effective working majority of the new Conservative prime minister to just three. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dems\u2019 deputy leader, who is standing as a candidate to replace Vince Cable as leader, tweeted her thanks to Plaid Cymru and the Greens, saying: \u201cPutting the needs of the country above party politics takes courage.\u201d Adam Price, the leader of Plaid Cymru, told the BBC the decision was not easy, but had been \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d. He said: \u201cWe are facing one of the most significant decisions, as to whether we are going to be seemingly yanked out of the European Union even without a deal.

Davies secured a majority of just over 8,000 in the 2017 general election, with the Lib Dems in second, Labour third and Plaid Cymru fourth. In the byelection, the Brexit party is putting up a candidate who would be expected to take some Conservative votes. The idea of left-leaning or anti-Brexit parties standing aside for each other to avoid splitting the vote under the UK\u2019s first-past-the-post parliamentary election system \u2013 known as a progressive alliance \u2013 was mooted before the 2017 election. While a handful of candidates did step aside, the idea proved difficult to implement more widely, with parties often loth to order long-established activists to give up their hope of fighting the election.",

House wines begin at \u00a318.50 for a bottle of Las Condes Sauvignon Blanc and stretch to \u00a334 for a bottle of petit chablis. If I lived locally, I\u2019d come here a lot to take advantage of the views, the booze and the neverending supply of local intrigue as villagers stop by to check up on their investment. In the final episode of my imaginary BBC One drama, The Packhorse, the locals would celebrate their victory with a concert in the garden. Landlord Martin Clunes would rock out with a guitar and inevitably snog Sheridan Smith, who plays the barmaid who never stopped believing in him. As I left the pub, I saw a sign on the noticeboard that said, \u201cTomorrow 1pm Packstock! The tent is up. The bands are booked! Tomorrow, we start another tradition.\u201d The Packhorse is a wonderful example of how stranger things can happen. \u2022 The Packhorse Inn Old School Hill, South Stoke, Bath, Somerset, 01225 830300.

It is one of the most important museums of Copenhagen, with a big collection of classic works and contemporary art. I have wandered around the exhibits many times, but this time I thought I should honour the beautiful orange building.</p> <p>It is always crowded, but has a wonderful patio inside with palm trees.</p> <p>In the summer there are lots of tourists in the city, who always head straight to the museums and places indicated on tourist maps and travel websites. The areas between Tivoli (Europe\u2019s oldest entertainment park), Glytoptek and Central Station are always full of tourists. I like to observe the new visitors to the city; I find their reactions and movements amusing.</p> <p>On the day I sketched this, it was quite hot and I just wanted to stay for ever on the street to enjoy this rare (for Copenhagen) weather.</p> <p>It is easy to imagine stories when drawing, and I often imagine the lives of the people who built the buildings, the challenges, the empty spaces that are being completed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"331e2a44eeae315c78c1877cc993754fc0abcb78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/331e2a44eeae315c78c1877cc993754fc0abcb78/0_0_1483_1208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HC Andersens Boulevard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"815\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HC Andersens Boulevard</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Jo\u00e3o Albergaria/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>HC Andersens Boulevard is one of the main streets of Copenhagen, with a mix of old and new buildings. I really enjoy sketching old buildings with lots of decoration. It makes me focused \u2013 it\u2019s like putting a puzzle together.</p> <p>This building is imposing and I always wonder about what is going on inside. I do not know if people live there, or whether it is offices or something else entirely.

Lots of new, vulgar and misguided, construction is springing up. This drawing was a kind of tribute to a big effort made by residents to keep the harbour small and less developed and to the memory of a place that is in the process of disappearing.</p> <p>I always like to find places to draw where there is some controversy or discussion about the place. In this case, little remains of the spirit of the original harbour; it has become artificial with horrible new edifices around it.</p> <p>It is sad that part of the history of the city is disappearing. I think the boats that remain are magical. Some of them have become like exclusive and expensive hotels, but there is still a small remnant of port life \u2013 only very little, but something survives.

Copenhagen is a flat city and most of the buildings don\u2019t have more than five or six floors; I like how towers make it possible to pick out the different squares and locations.</p> <p>The light was beautiful on that summer\u2019s day.</p> <p>I decided to go to the top of the tower a bit by chance. The tower building itself is rather ugly and uninteresting, but I thought the view could be interesting. And it was \u2013 that magnificent view over Copenhagen and that intense light. From the top of the tower you can see all the significant landmarks. Steeples and high roofs that are normally attached to important city buildings, such as churches, City Hall and other civil buildings, are located in squares. So using that as a starting point, it is possible to read the layout of the whole city. The towers link the axes of the city, marking the key points of entry to the old city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a2529512b249042456cae173c8a7dc710e666cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a2529512b249042456cae173c8a7dc710e666cb/38_106_2877_1242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pal\u00e6 Bar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"432\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pal\u00e6 Bar</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Jo\u00e3o Albergaria/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pal\u00e6 is an emblematic bar of Copenhagen. There was a great jazz concert in the day I did the sketch and at the end the musicians wanted to sign my original drawing. What a honour.</p> <p>The space was crowded but I was lucky and got a place right in front of the musicians.

      "bodyText": "A popular square in the centre of a multicultural neighbourhood, N\u00f8rrebro, Bl\u00e5g\u00e5rds Plads hosts street markets, concerts and demonstrations. It is considered something of an alternative location, a bit out of the context of the city, partly because of the large communities of Arab and African people in the area. There are also many stores that sell secondhand or recycled products. It is a very busy area, but the trees lend the square tranquillity, projecting fantastic shadows on the pavement. It was the start of spring and lots of people were outside enjoying the weather \u2013 I tried to capture the spirit of the crowded square and the beautiful light. Frederiksholms Kanal is the largest artificial canal built in the centre of Copenhagen in the 17th century. Along the canal are landmark buildings of Copenhagen \u2013 Christiansborg palace, parliament, the National Museum \u2013 as well as old warehouse buildings, beautiful bridges and hundreds of boats. In this particular scene, what struck me most were the vivid colours of the boats against the surroundings on a winter\u2019s day. During Denmark\u2019s long, dark winter, life in the boats stops and they are left alone until the springtime weather arrives. This 360-degree view means a lot to me. I worked in the area for three years and this drawing was done in several days. Every day I did a small part and it was a challenge because I needed to connect all the parts together. There are several important buildings in the drawing, such as Nikolaj Kunsthal, parliament, the National Museum, Museum Thorvaldsen and Christiansborg palace. It was a privilege to work in the Gammel Strand area. It is a very old part of the city with remarkably beautiful buildings. The name means the old beach, and is where the fish market used to be. Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek (New Carlsberg) is a Danish art museum founded by Carl Jacobsen and opened to the public in 1906. It is one of the most important museums of Copenhagen, with a big collection of classic works and contemporary art. I have wandered around the exhibits many times, but this time I thought I should honour the beautiful orange building. It is always crowded, but has a wonderful patio inside with palm trees. In the summer there are lots of tourists in the city, who always head straight to the museums and places indicated on tourist maps and travel websites. The areas between Tivoli (Europe\u2019s oldest entertainment park), Glytoptek and Central Station are always full of tourists. I like to observe the new visitors to the city; I find their reactions and movements amusing. On the day I sketched this, it was quite hot and I just wanted to stay for ever on the street to enjoy this rare (for Copenhagen) weather. It is easy to imagine stories when drawing, and I often imagine the lives of the people who built the buildings, the challenges, the empty spaces that are being completed. HC Andersens Boulevard is one of the main streets of Copenhagen, with a mix of old and new buildings. I really enjoy sketching old buildings with lots of decoration. It makes me focused \u2013 it\u2019s like putting a puzzle together. This building is imposing and I always wonder about what is going on inside. I do not know if people live there, or whether it is offices or something else entirely. This mystery keeps my imagination active. This harbour is in an area where the new city is expanding. Lots of new, vulgar and misguided, construction is springing up. This drawing was a kind of tribute to a big effort made by residents to keep the harbour small and less developed and to the memory of a place that is in the process of disappearing. I always like to find places to draw where there is some controversy or discussion about the place. In this case, little remains of the spirit of the original harbour; it has become artificial with horrible new edifices around it. It is sad that part of the history of the city is disappearing. I think the boats that remain are magical. Some of them have become like exclusive and expensive hotels, but there is still a small remnant of port life \u2013 only very little, but something survives. I really appreciate this effort. Like all the central stations in Europe\u2019s big capital cities, it\u2019s a peculiar place, with lots of people coming and going. The roof is made of a beautiful wood structure supported by stone columns. It was an extremely cold day, and even though I was drawing indoors I had to wear lots of layers of clothing, which affected my sketching skills and agility. A city\u2019s central station is a place where momentous things happen. It is a place of meetings and disagreements; of new beginnings and departures. I made this sketch on the rooftop of Rundetaarn, one of the highest spots of the city. Copenhagen is a flat city and most of the buildings don\u2019t have more than five or six floors; I like how towers make it possible to pick out the different squares and locations. The light was beautiful on that summer\u2019s day. I decided to go to the top of the tower a bit by chance. The tower building itself is rather ugly and uninteresting, but I thought the view could be interesting. And it was \u2013 that magnificent view over Copenhagen and that intense light. From the top of the tower you can see all the significant landmarks. Steeples and high roofs that are normally attached to important city buildings, such as churches, City Hall and other civil buildings, are located in squares. So using that as a starting point, it is possible to read the layout of the whole city. The towers link the axes of the city, marking the key points of entry to the old city. Pal\u00e6 is an emblematic bar of Copenhagen. There was a great jazz concert in the day I did the sketch and at the end the musicians wanted to sign my original drawing. What a honour. The space was crowded but I was lucky and got a place right in front of the musicians. From up close you can feel their expressive intensity, see the head movements, long moments with closed eyes. It was a great opportunity to draw the scene. The logo of the cafe is brilliant: a reference to the little mermaid, one of the symbols of the city. Sydhavn is a beautiful harbour outside the city centre. Is it still a fishing harbour and also has a lot of old boat houses. It is my favourite spot to sketch in Copenhagen; I feel at home and welcomed by the people who live there. Sydhavn is an oasis in the city, an old fishing port lost in the greatly expanding new city of Copenhagen. More than being just an old fishing port, Sydhavn has the soul of alternative dimension: people who live there seem completely apart from the accelerated rhythm of the rest of the city. The atmosphere in Sydhavm has a different rhythm; I cannot identify a trace of stress. Going to Sydhavn to draw works like therapy for me when I have had one of those days of intense and stressful work. There is a huge pressure of real estate investors to destroy the port and build those blocks of horrible apartments that look the same wherever you are in the world. But for now, drawing the boats of Sydhanvn is a great pleasure: I love to unravel their secrets and memories. The boats speak for themselves; they have souls and they survive. Tivoli is the oldest amusement park in Europe and the Danish are extremely proud of it. Drawing symbols of the city is always a challenge and a huge responsibility. I tried to get the overall view of the building and then used a fish-eye perspective, which gives an expressive dynamic grammar to a drawing. Vaenedamsvej is one of the busiest shopping streets in Vesterbro: huge cafes and shops that sell almost everything line up one after the other. Residents of Copenhagen go to this street to buy things they need but also to relax. There is a dynamism in the shops and cafes, nothing is boring. There are bicycles everywhere and the cafes put tables outside once the weather improves. Also, for me, the bikes in the foreground are an icon of the city. I like the diversity of the building on the city corner; it makes the city feel alive, and it is easy to see lots of things happening at once because of the dynamic of the location. I often like to look for nooks and crannies to draw, and in Vesterbro you can find a lot of them. This place where Viktoriagade crosses Vesterbrogade is particularly interesting for its architectural diversity. Here, several buildings of different epochs and proportions are connected.

      "body": "<p>A station in London: excited children gather for the \u201cspecial train\u201d to a remote boarding school that looks like a castle. Not the all-conquering school series of the present era, Harry Potter, but the opening chapter of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/enid-blyton\">Enid Blyton</a>\u2019s Malory Towers books, set on the Cornish coast and published between 1946 and 1951. These six short novels have been adored for nearly seven decades, with a further six titles by Pamela Cox added in 2009 <strong>\u2013</strong> last year they sold 350,000 copies in English alone. Now comes a book of four new stories by contemporary children\u2019s authors, with a BBC series in development, while later this month theatre director Emma Rice, fresh from her adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/angelacarter\">Angela Carter</a>\u2019s <em>Wise Children</em>, will stage a musical version.</p> <p>Blyton characterised her school stories as dramatising \u201cthe little spites and deceits of school life, the loyalty and generosities of friendship, and the never-ending impact of one character on another\u201d. The psychology of the girls is blunt, but accurate, and while they may be archetypes, they are memorable ones. Heroine Darrell, whose androgynous name was borrowed from Blyton\u2019s second husband, has flaws many of us might be glad to own: hot-headed bravery and a forthright temper. Clever, confident trickster Alicia needs to learn that life doesn\u2019t come so easily for everyone. There\u2019s steady, sensible Sally, who wrestles with jealousy; scatterbrained musical and artistic geniuses Irene and Belinda; horse-mad Bill; shy Mary-Lou; and of course spoiled, shallow Gwendoline, perhaps the only girl on whom Malory Towers\u2019 magic \u2013 \u201cthe longer you stay here the decenter you get\u201d \u2013 won\u2019t work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In 2019, Malory Towers feels radical for its moral certainty and lack of cynicism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Blyton has long been disparaged for her clunky prose style, always responding that she took no notice of critics over the age of 12. Some of her work also displays xenophobia, racism and a snobbish little-Englander sensibility, and has been rewritten to smooth over dated attitudes or vocabulary. Malory Towers is less vulnerable to such accusations; unlike the Famous Five or Secret Seven, it doesn\u2019t feature groups of middle-class youngsters roaming the countryside harassing \u201cforeigners\u201d and demanding bread and jam from farmers\u2019 wives, but girls coming of age together as they work out their collective moral code. Every book begins with the same rousing speech from headteacher Miss Grayling, encouraging pupils to grow into \u201cgood hearted and kind, sensible and trustable, good, sound women the world can lean on\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d0f2609807536d18fbfc3c3a191c50d3c35c0bc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0f2609807536d18fbfc3c3a191c50d3c35c0bc9/8_5_427_669/319.jpg\" alt=\"Malory Towers\" width=\"319\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>New Class at Malory Towers</em> takes Blyton\u2019s time capsule and introduces the kinds of characters it wouldn\u2019t have occurred to her to write about. It begins with Patrice Lawrence\u2019s story of Marietta, a black girl whose parents are part of a travelling circus: she unwillingly joins Darrell and the others, nursing trauma and a secret. Gwendoline, of course, is desperate to touch her hair. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lucymangan\">Lucy Mangan</a> explores Darrell\u2019s new friendship with a \u201cbookworm\u201d, the kind of girl who doesn\u2019t fit in with the sports-mad, gung-ho spirit of boarding school; her story challenges the bullying undertones of Blyton\u2019s original. Narinder Dhami cleverly subverts the children\u2019s book stereotype of an Indian princess, while Rebecca Westcott introduces a less privileged girl, to counter what she calls that \u201cteeny little whiff of entitlement\u201d coming off the pages of the original books. As a child, Westcott was a huge fan of the series, but it was \u201c100% fantasy and escapism. There was as much chance of a girl like me, living on benefits on a council estate, going to Mordor.\u201d Her character Maggie declares: \u201cYou all think that you\u2019re something special just because you go to school here \u2026 It isn\u2019t normal to have all your meals cooked for you and your clothes washed for you while you swan around the place, riding your ponies and sketching in art books.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t normal for Rice, either; she hadn\u2019t read the Malory Towers books before producer friend David Pugh sent them to her six years ago with the suggestion that she make them into a stage show. Having blanked out her own schooldays at a \u201cfairly unpleasant\u201d Nottingham girls\u2019 comp, she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d take him up on it \u2013 but the project remained \u201can itch she wanted to scratch\u201d. Rice believes the time is right for a revival, not for reasons of twee nostalgia \u2013 that version of Blyton piled up on bookshop tables in retro-jacketed parodies of Famous Five books \u2013 but because of something \u201cfar more radical\u201d.</p> <p>The books were written, she points out, against the backdrop of a postwar Labour government focused on social equality, the rebuilding of society and the creation of the welfare state. \u201cThey offer such a sense of community and collective responsibility,\u201d she says. \u201cThe girls are constantly deciding what they should do as a team and I think that\u2019s amazing when we\u2019re crumbling as a society that\u2019s able to make collective decisions.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about the spoken, named desire to be good that feels almost radical. Right now we are deciding whether it matters to us whether our prime minister is a good person. Blyton\u2019s questioning of the rules is really interesting too \u2013 there are times where the girls decide to break them, and they are right to. Their moral compass is not an obedient one, it\u2019s a compass that has integrity. You can find your way through bad behaviour and be forgiven. It\u2019s a very live debate. I want people to feel like marching after they see this show.\u201d</p> <p>Rice has had to cut with abandon to compress six years of school into one night of theatre, dispensing with the adult characters and using animation to represent Miss Grayling (\u201cshe inspires awe in the girls and has great status. So with animation I can make her really big\u201d). While she wants the show to feel a little like a 1940s musical \u2013 \u201cthat relief that the war is over, we can tap our way to happiness\u201d \u2013 she stresses that \u201cthis is a piece made in 2019\u201d, framed by scenes set in a contemporary school from which \u201cwe tumble back in time\u201d. Original compositions will mix with 40s songs, to \u201clet the voice of now bubble through\u201d.</p> <p>She has also whittled the number of girls down to seven, with a diverse cast: Darrell, Alicia and Irene aren\u2019t white, and the actor playing Sally is of restricted height. \u201cThere\u2019s not any reason <em>not</em> to have a diverse cast. My work is always from a storytelling background, which means anyone can be anything. They are bang on for their archetype.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e5abd698d25e8dfeef2150fda2bed8555154ef1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e5abd698d25e8dfeef2150fda2bed8555154ef1/0_121_3486_2091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enid Blyton with her daughters at home in Buckinghamshire, 1949.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enid Blyton with her daughters at home in Buckinghamshire, 1949.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Konig/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rice felt it was important, too, to include the \u201ctomboy\u201d character Bill, \u201cat this time where gender fluidity is such an interesting and important topic for young people. And Blyton writes it with such detail. She says: \u2018Please don\u2019t call me Wilhelmina, I shall not know myself if you call me by that name. Call me Bill.\u2019 Girls aren\u2019t usually allowed to decide their own nicknames, but the others realise how important it is. I\u2019m certainly not suggesting Bill isn\u2019t a girl, but I\u2019m bringing contemporary discussions into the room.\u201d</p> <p>Mary Lou is included, as well as Irene (\u201cshe\u2019s very neurodiverse, as they say \u2013 lost in her music and quite chaotic\u201d) and the dreadful Gwendoline. \u201cDreadful <em>and</em> tragic. She\u2019s such a troubled girl. We all knew them, and we all know them. I\u2019ve given her a bit more, because she\u2019s got the biggest journey to go through.

      "bodyText": "A station in London: excited children gather for the \u201cspecial train\u201d to a remote boarding school that looks like a castle. Not the all-conquering school series of the present era, Harry Potter, but the opening chapter of Enid Blyton\u2019s Malory Towers books, set on the Cornish coast and published between 1946 and 1951. These six short novels have been adored for nearly seven decades, with a further six titles by Pamela Cox added in 2009 \u2013 last year they sold 350,000 copies in English alone. Now comes a book of four new stories by contemporary children\u2019s authors, with a BBC series in development, while later this month theatre director Emma Rice, fresh from her adaptation of Angela Carter\u2019s Wise Children, will stage a musical version. Blyton characterised her school stories as dramatising \u201cthe little spites and deceits of school life, the loyalty and generosities of friendship, and the never-ending impact of one character on another\u201d. The psychology of the girls is blunt, but accurate, and while they may be archetypes, they are memorable ones. Heroine Darrell, whose androgynous name was borrowed from Blyton\u2019s second husband, has flaws many of us might be glad to own: hot-headed bravery and a forthright temper. Clever, confident trickster Alicia needs to learn that life doesn\u2019t come so easily for everyone. There\u2019s steady, sensible Sally, who wrestles with jealousy; scatterbrained musical and artistic geniuses Irene and Belinda; horse-mad Bill; shy Mary-Lou; and of course spoiled, shallow Gwendoline, perhaps the only girl on whom Malory Towers\u2019 magic \u2013 \u201cthe longer you stay here the decenter you get\u201d \u2013 won\u2019t work. Blyton has long been disparaged for her clunky prose style, always responding that she took no notice of critics over the age of 12. Some of her work also displays xenophobia, racism and a snobbish little-Englander sensibility, and has been rewritten to smooth over dated attitudes or vocabulary. Malory Towers is less vulnerable to such accusations; unlike the Famous Five or Secret Seven, it doesn\u2019t feature groups of middle-class youngsters roaming the countryside harassing \u201cforeigners\u201d and demanding bread and jam from farmers\u2019 wives, but girls coming of age together as they work out their collective moral code. Every book begins with the same rousing speech from headteacher Miss Grayling, encouraging pupils to grow into \u201cgood hearted and kind, sensible and trustable, good, sound women the world can lean on\u201d. New Class at Malory Towers takes Blyton\u2019s time capsule and introduces the kinds of characters it wouldn\u2019t have occurred to her to write about. It begins with Patrice Lawrence\u2019s story of Marietta, a black girl whose parents are part of a travelling circus: she unwillingly joins Darrell and the others, nursing trauma and a secret. Gwendoline, of course, is desperate to touch her hair. Lucy Mangan explores Darrell\u2019s new friendship with a \u201cbookworm\u201d, the kind of girl who doesn\u2019t fit in with the sports-mad, gung-ho spirit of boarding school; her story challenges the bullying undertones of Blyton\u2019s original. Narinder Dhami cleverly subverts the children\u2019s book stereotype of an Indian princess, while Rebecca Westcott introduces a less privileged girl, to counter what she calls that \u201cteeny little whiff of entitlement\u201d coming off the pages of the original books. As a child, Westcott was a huge fan of the series, but it was \u201c100% fantasy and escapism. There was as much chance of a girl like me, living on benefits on a council estate, going to Mordor.\u201d Her character Maggie declares: \u201cYou all think that you\u2019re something special just because you go to school here \u2026 It isn\u2019t normal to have all your meals cooked for you and your clothes washed for you while you swan around the place, riding your ponies and sketching in art books.\u201d It wasn\u2019t normal for Rice, either; she hadn\u2019t read the Malory Towers books before producer friend David Pugh sent them to her six years ago with the suggestion that she make them into a stage show. Having blanked out her own schooldays at a \u201cfairly unpleasant\u201d Nottingham girls\u2019 comp, she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d take him up on it \u2013 but the project remained \u201can itch she wanted to scratch\u201d. Rice believes the time is right for a revival, not for reasons of twee nostalgia \u2013 that version of Blyton piled up on bookshop tables in retro-jacketed parodies of Famous Five books \u2013 but because of something \u201cfar more radical\u201d. The books were written, she points out, against the backdrop of a postwar Labour government focused on social equality, the rebuilding of society and the creation of the welfare state. \u201cThey offer such a sense of community and collective responsibility,\u201d she says. \u201cThe girls are constantly deciding what they should do as a team and I think that\u2019s amazing when we\u2019re crumbling as a society that\u2019s able to make collective decisions. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the spoken, named desire to be good that feels almost radical. Right now we are deciding whether it matters to us whether our prime minister is a good person. Blyton\u2019s questioning of the rules is really interesting too \u2013 there are times where the girls decide to break them, and they are right to. Their moral compass is not an obedient one, it\u2019s a compass that has integrity. You can find your way through bad behaviour and be forgiven. It\u2019s a very live debate. I want people to feel like marching after they see this show.\u201d Rice has had to cut with abandon to compress six years of school into one night of theatre, dispensing with the adult characters and using animation to represent Miss Grayling (\u201cshe inspires awe in the girls and has great status. So with animation I can make her really big\u201d). While she wants the show to feel a little like a 1940s musical \u2013 \u201cthat relief that the war is over, we can tap our way to happiness\u201d \u2013 she stresses that \u201cthis is a piece made in 2019\u201d, framed by scenes set in a contemporary school from which \u201cwe tumble back in time\u201d. Original compositions will mix with 40s songs, to \u201clet the voice of now bubble through\u201d. She has also whittled the number of girls down to seven, with a diverse cast: Darrell, Alicia and Irene aren\u2019t white, and the actor playing Sally is of restricted height. \u201cThere\u2019s not any reason not to have a diverse cast. My work is always from a storytelling background, which means anyone can be anything. They are bang on for their archetype.\u201d Rice felt it was important, too, to include the \u201ctomboy\u201d character Bill, \u201cat this time where gender fluidity is such an interesting and important topic for young people. And Blyton writes it with such detail. She says: \u2018Please don\u2019t call me Wilhelmina, I shall not know myself if you call me by that name. Call me Bill.\u2019 Girls aren\u2019t usually allowed to decide their own nicknames, but the others realise how important it is. I\u2019m certainly not suggesting Bill isn\u2019t a girl, but I\u2019m bringing contemporary discussions into the room.\u201d Mary Lou is included, as well as Irene (\u201cshe\u2019s very neurodiverse, as they say \u2013 lost in her music and quite chaotic\u201d) and the dreadful Gwendoline. \u201cDreadful and tragic. She\u2019s such a troubled girl. We all knew them, and we all know them. I\u2019ve given her a bit more, because she\u2019s got the biggest journey to go through. And you need that, because otherwise everybody would be nice all the time.\u201d In 2019, Malory Towers doesn\u2019t just feel radical for its moral certainty and lack of cynicism. Rice characterises her production as a \u201cgirl power\u201d show, and the books are indeed a grand celebration of female friendship and potential. As she points out, pupils \u201cpass the Bechdel test over and over again \u2013 they\u2019re not talking about boys, they\u2019re not thinking about how they look\u201d (considering the recent pinkification of girls\u2019 books, it\u2019s striking how disapproving Blyton is of any princessy behaviour). There are references to \u201cpashes\u201d in the books, and much discussion of whether friendships can work as a \u201cthreesome\u201d.

GLAAD found that adults between the ages of 18 and 34, often taken for granted as LGBTQ supporters, have actually become <em>less</em> comfortable with LGBTQ people since 2016. In 2016, 24% of those polled said they would be uncomfortable to learn that a family member was LGBTQ; in the most recent results, that number shot up to 36%.</p> <p>On 29 June, GLAAD CEO &amp; President Sarah Kate Ellis addressed the results during <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1145033432487137280\">a CNN interview</a>, attributing the decline to hateful rhetoric and the anti-LGBTQ policies of the Trump administration. In an<a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/political-parties-division-1878742/\"> increasingly polarized political atmosphere</a>, it\u2019s certainly possible that people are adopting a more \u2018us versus them\u2019 mentality when it comes to just about everything.</p> <p>\u201cClosing the gap to full acceptance of LGBTQ people will not come from legislation [or] judicial decisions alone, but from creating a culture where LGBTQ people are embraced and respected,\u201d Ellis wrote in the report. \u201cThis year\u2019s results demonstrate an urgent need for GLAAD to reach younger Americans with stories and campaigns that build acceptance.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the World Cup is, intentionally or not, one of those campaigns.</p> <p>Outsports.com co-founder and author of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27131493-fair-play\">Fair Play: How LGBT Athletes Are Claiming Their Rightful Place in Sports</a>, Cyd Zeigler sees sports as an ideal way to connect people across cultural and political divides, especially as it applies to LGBTQ issues.</p> <p>\u201cThe more people see out LGBTQ people, the more they understand that we walk, talk and score goals like everyone else,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are like everyone else.

It\u2019s hard to say that these fears are completely unfounded when even Fifa, the governing body behind this very queer-friendly World Cup, continues to make moves that do little to help LGBTQ players.</p> <p>Fifa awarded the 2018 men\u2019s World Cup to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar. Russia, as many know, is home to an oppressive anti-LGBTQ culture as well as laws restricting LGBTQ speech. During the 2018 tournament, <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/14/england-fan-beaten-frenchman-left-disabled-homophobic-attack-russia-7629681/\">two fans were brutally beaten in an anti-gay attack</a> and at least one gay rights activist was <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/russian-police-free-gay-rights-activist-arrested-moscow-n883151\">arrested for protesting outside the Kremlin</a>. In Qatar, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/exclusive-world-cup-spotlight-qataris-cracks-lgbt-news/story?id=56668874\">homosexuality is illegal</a> and punishable by up to seven years in prison. Understandably, it may be hard for players to feel as though the organization truly has their backs.</p> <p>In 2015, Robbie Rogers, the first active Major League Soccer player to come out as gay, wrote an op-ed for <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/20/soccer-gay-fifa-robbie-rogers/22054045/\">USA Today</a> denouncing FIFA\u2019s decision to embrace LGBTQ-hostile countries like Russia and Qatar.</p> <p>\u201cIf actions speak louder than words, then the message FIFA sends to gay athletes is painfully clear,\u201d wrote Rogers. \u201cNot only don\u2019t they have our backs, our lives don\u2019t matter. So for any gay soccer player who has hopes of playing for the U.S. National Team at the World Cup, being open about their sexuality could have real consequences when they set foot in countries with laws that could land them in jail.\u201d</p> <p>When Team USA takes the field on Sunday to try and cap off back-to-back World Cup victories, they\u2019ll be doing it with the knowledge that LGBTQ people all over America \u2014 and, for that matter, the world \u2014 will be watching, and maybe, for one of the very first times ever, see themselves represented and cheered on by tens of thousands of roaring fans. Just as <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/06/football/womens-world-cup-abby-wambach-wife-kiss/index.html\">Abby Wambach\u2019s post-victory kiss</a> was the perfect queer moment of 2015\u2019s World Cup \u2014 occuring the same summer the US achieved marriage equality \u2014 Rapinoe and her teammates could put a cap on this tournament with a perfectly 2019 statement of their own, a statement that says: We\u2019re here, and we\u2019re not going down without a fight.</p> <p><br></p>",

While Team USA have managed to take on the world\u2019s best soccer teams, its toughest opponent yet might be homophobia. Last month, LGBTQ media advocacy organization GLAAD published the findings of its fifth annual Accelerating Acceptance Index survey of US adults. GLAAD found that adults between the ages of 18 and 34, often taken for granted as LGBTQ supporters, have actually become less comfortable with LGBTQ people since 2016. In 2016, 24% of those polled said they would be uncomfortable to learn that a family member was LGBTQ; in the most recent results, that number shot up to 36%. On 29 June, GLAAD CEO &amp; President Sarah Kate Ellis addressed the results during a CNN interview, attributing the decline to hateful rhetoric and the anti-LGBTQ policies of the Trump administration. In an increasingly polarized political atmosphere, it\u2019s certainly possible that people are adopting a more \u2018us versus them\u2019 mentality when it comes to just about everything. \u201cClosing the gap to full acceptance of LGBTQ people will not come from legislation [or] judicial decisions alone, but from creating a culture where LGBTQ people are embraced and respected,\u201d Ellis wrote in the report. \u201cThis year\u2019s results demonstrate an urgent need for GLAAD to reach younger Americans with stories and campaigns that build acceptance.\u201d Perhaps the World Cup is, intentionally or not, one of those campaigns. Outsports.com co-founder and author of Fair Play: How LGBT Athletes Are Claiming Their Rightful Place in Sports, Cyd Zeigler sees sports as an ideal way to connect people across cultural and political divides, especially as it applies to LGBTQ issues. \u201cThe more people see out LGBTQ people, the more they understand that we walk, talk and score goals like everyone else,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are like everyone else. When you have out athletes doing that while wearing the Team USA colors, Americans naturally cheer for these athletes. It\u2019s why sports are so powerful in building bridges across communities.\u201d Sports may very well be the way to win over LGBTQ skeptics, but many athletes remain closeted for fear of being rejected by their teams, leagues, fans, or sponsors. It\u2019s hard to say that these fears are completely unfounded when even Fifa, the governing body behind this very queer-friendly World Cup, continues to make moves that do little to help LGBTQ players. Fifa awarded the 2018 men\u2019s World Cup to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar. Russia, as many know, is home to an oppressive anti-LGBTQ culture as well as laws restricting LGBTQ speech. During the 2018 tournament, two fans were brutally beaten in an anti-gay attack and at least one gay rights activist was arrested for protesting outside the Kremlin. In Qatar, homosexuality is illegal and punishable by up to seven years in prison. Understandably, it may be hard for players to feel as though the organization truly has their backs. In 2015, Robbie Rogers, the first active Major League Soccer player to come out as gay, wrote an op-ed for USA Today denouncing FIFA\u2019s decision to embrace LGBTQ-hostile countries like Russia and Qatar. \u201cIf actions speak louder than words, then the message FIFA sends to gay athletes is painfully clear,\u201d wrote Rogers. \u201cNot only don\u2019t they have our backs, our lives don\u2019t matter. So for any gay soccer player who has hopes of playing for the U.S. National Team at the World Cup, being open about their sexuality could have real consequences when they set foot in countries with laws that could land them in jail.\u201d When Team USA takes the field on Sunday to try and cap off back-to-back World Cup victories, they\u2019ll be doing it with the knowledge that LGBTQ people all over America \u2014 and, for that matter, the world \u2014 will be watching, and maybe, for one of the very first times ever, see themselves represented and cheered on by tens of thousands of roaring fans. Just as Abby Wambach\u2019s post-victory kiss was the perfect queer moment of 2015\u2019s World Cup \u2014 occuring the same summer the US achieved marriage equality \u2014 Rapinoe and her teammates could put a cap on this tournament with a perfectly 2019 statement of their own, a statement that says: We\u2019re here, and we\u2019re not going down without a fight.",

The stories she was working on at the time of her death might have remained unpublished were it not for <a href=\"https://forbiddenstories.org/\">Forbidden Stories</a>, an initiative run by a global network of investigative journalists whose mission is to finish the work of who have been imprisoned or harmed. <a href=\"https://forbiddenstories.org/case/the-daphne-project/\">The Daphne </a><a href=\"https://forbiddenstories.org/case/the-daphne-project/\">project</a>, published last year, was a collaborative effort between 45 journalists in 15 countries.</p> <p>Independent journalists like those with Forbidden Stories have a critical role to play in our democracies: they uncover truth, hold power to account and protect one another as they do so. And yet independent journalism faces an existential crisis. Misinformation and hate speech are destabilising democracies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/19/journalists-death-toll-nearly-doubles-in-2018\">attacks on journalists are increasing</a> and financial models for public interest journalism are collapsing. At a moment when authoritarian governments and other malign influences are seeking to manipulate and silence the media on an unprecedented scale, only <a href=\"https://www.cima.ned.org/publication/comprehensive-analysis-media-aid-flows/\">0.3% of global aid</a> goes to supporting media.</p> <p>Next week in London, we have a chance to change this. Many of Caruana Galizia\u2019s peers will gather alongside more than 50 foreign ministers and a number of philanthropists for the first <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.gov.uk_government_topical-2Devents_global-2Dconference-2Dfor-2Dmedia-2Dfreedom-2Dlondon-2D2019&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=Ftw_YSVcGmqQBvrGwAZugGylNRkk-uER0-5bY94tjsc&amp;r=nx5b5kQLh41L8aL5r707mggTtSJQGyFCjkhVHxltaQg&amp;m=gTj8HD_hwZLYYczWHHzmGur6CkRIsCX6QUmlQRHlynY&amp;s=leWMDpe8V9WernWnCX7vIP15oo-1rCZQUTmQZdISyOw&amp;e=\">global conference for media freedom</a>, co-hosted by the UK Foreign Office and the Canadian government. We will be pushing a game-changing idea that could boost robust journalism and media freedom: a $1bn (\u00a3795m) international public interest media fund.</p> <p>Such a move would help to tackle the crisis facing independent journalism by funding organisations around the world. The money would support strong, diverse media platforms, and in turn protect journalists from intimidation and attack. As shown by the murder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\">Jamal Khashoggi</a>, one of the only Saudi journalists to criticise the regime, and the legal harassment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/14/maria-ressa-arrest-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-rappler-editor\">Maria Ressa</a>, one of the few voices in the Philippines to highlight President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/28/duterte-confesses-my-only-sin-is-the-extrajudicial-killings\">extra</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/28/duterte-confesses-my-only-sin-is-the-extrajudicial-killings\">judicial killings</a>, a single journalist or organisation is much easier to silence than a vibrant community.</p> <p>The fund should draw capital from government development agencies, philanthropic donors and social media platforms. For democratic governments, weak media ecosystems around the world are an untenable threat to societies, especially in and around elections. For philanthropic donors, whose mission it is to tackle some of the toughest societal problems, the need to invest in the public good that is independent journalism has never been more urgent. And for the social media platforms that have done so much damage to the business model of journalism, now is the time to support the rebuilding of the industry.</p> <p>A single, international structure assembling funds from these sectors would allow for a cost-effective and coordinated approach to funding public interest media. The capital would go to organisations editorially independent from government, corporate or other influences that focus primarily on reporting in the public interest.</p> <p>Recipients could be organisations like <a href=\"https://amabhungane.org/\">amaBhugan</a><em><a href=\"https://amabhungane.org/\">e</a></em> in South Africa, which led the <a href=\"http://www.gupta-leaks.com/\">Gupta </a><a href=\"http://www.gupta-leaks.com/\">leaks</a><a href=\"http://www.gupta-leaks.com/\"> investigation</a>, exposing the role of the billionaire Gupta family in the corrupt power structure of Jacob Zuma\u2019s government.

      "bodyText": "Daphne Caruana Galizia was driving away from her home in October 2017 when a bomb planted under the seat of her car was remotely triggered, killing her instantly. Caruana Galizia was a renowned anti-corruption journalist who had published damaging revelations about Malta\u2019s prime minister and his political allies. The stories she was working on at the time of her death might have remained unpublished were it not for Forbidden Stories, an initiative run by a global network of investigative journalists whose mission is to finish the work of who have been imprisoned or harmed. The Daphne project, published last year, was a collaborative effort between 45 journalists in 15 countries. Independent journalists like those with Forbidden Stories have a critical role to play in our democracies: they uncover truth, hold power to account and protect one another as they do so. And yet independent journalism faces an existential crisis. Misinformation and hate speech are destabilising democracies, attacks on journalists are increasing and financial models for public interest journalism are collapsing. At a moment when authoritarian governments and other malign influences are seeking to manipulate and silence the media on an unprecedented scale, only 0.3% of global aid goes to supporting media. Next week in London, we have a chance to change this. Many of Caruana Galizia\u2019s peers will gather alongside more than 50 foreign ministers and a number of philanthropists for the first global conference for media freedom, co-hosted by the UK Foreign Office and the Canadian government. We will be pushing a game-changing idea that could boost robust journalism and media freedom: a $1bn (\u00a3795m) international public interest media fund. Such a move would help to tackle the crisis facing independent journalism by funding organisations around the world. The money would support strong, diverse media platforms, and in turn protect journalists from intimidation and attack. As shown by the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, one of the only Saudi journalists to criticise the regime, and the legal harassment of Maria Ressa, one of the few voices in the Philippines to highlight President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s extrajudicial killings, a single journalist or organisation is much easier to silence than a vibrant community. The fund should draw capital from government development agencies, philanthropic donors and social media platforms. For democratic governments, weak media ecosystems around the world are an untenable threat to societies, especially in and around elections. For philanthropic donors, whose mission it is to tackle some of the toughest societal problems, the need to invest in the public good that is independent journalism has never been more urgent. And for the social media platforms that have done so much damage to the business model of journalism, now is the time to support the rebuilding of the industry. A single, international structure assembling funds from these sectors would allow for a cost-effective and coordinated approach to funding public interest media. The capital would go to organisations editorially independent from government, corporate or other influences that focus primarily on reporting in the public interest. Recipients could be organisations like amaBhugane in South Africa, which led the Gupta leaks investigation, exposing the role of the billionaire Gupta family in the corrupt power structure of Jacob Zuma\u2019s government. Another candidate might be Nexo, the digital news site providing explanatory, contextualized journalism in the polarised Brazil of Bolsonaro. With a structure independent from its backers, the fund would be free from undue influence over the distribution of money. Regional offices in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and elsewhere would ensure a localfocus, while having a single entity to support investigative journalism around the world would allow us to test what works and learn lessons. Funding would focus on the countries of greatest need \u2013 where advertising markets are weakest, political conditions most challenging and disinformation is having the most devastating consequences. An institution founded on these principles would protect journalism and journalists worldwide. We urge foreign ministers, government donors and philanthropists gathering in London to consider this idea seriously, provide input to strengthen and improve it, and collaborate to make it a reality. \u2022 Nishant Lalwani is the director for independent media at Luminate, a global philanthropic organisation with the goal of empowering people and institutions to work together to build just and fair societies.",

Maybe we make narratives so that we feel safe: we have a plan.\u201d Only You is in UK cinemas and on digital from 12 July.",

Five minutes from home, I tripped over my own feet. I fell on the gravel path, a searing pain ripping through my right leg. I\u2019d twisted it and the knee had dislocated, my foot bent at an alarming angle. I assumed it was a fracture. I couldn\u2019t move, but felt strangely calm, the adrenaline acting as a painkiller.</p> <p>Neither of us had brought our phones, so we had to wait for a passerby to call an ambulance; it felt like hours. By now, I was fighting unconsciousness and in agony. A man came along and made the call, then disappeared, telling us he had a train to catch. All we could do was wait. I heard a siren draw nearer before fading away. Eventually, a girl appeared. She phoned another ambulance and waited with us, flagging it down from the road. I remember laughing with the paramedics, feeling positive, despite being on the maximum dose of morphine. They showed no sign of panic; I thought I\u2019d be home that night.</p> <p>But within a few hours, I was in intensive care. There was no pulse in my right foot. The severity of my injuries stunned everyone. My surgeon has since told me that when he was bleeped from A&amp;E that morning, he thought someone had made a mistake \u2013 he didn\u2019t believe that injuries that bad could have been caused by a trip.

Just save as much of my leg as you can.\u201d I took a final look at my right foot; the toenails painted red, skin mottled blue. By that point, I was in so much pain I just wanted it to stop.</p> <p>After six weeks in hospital, I moved back to my parents\u2019 house in Kent. I spent four months in a wheelchair, waiting for my knee to heal before I could get a prosthetic leg. My psychological state deteriorated. I hated how others saw me, those pitying smiles to the girl in the wheelchair.</p> <p>In October 2016, I was admitted to a specialist amputee rehabilitation centre, where I embarked on a programme of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and counselling. Getting my first prosthetic leg was the turning point. It was heavy and cumbersome, and I was terrified to begin with.

I remember it was a very emotional conversation in my kitchen but eventually I agreed to let him go.\u201d</p> <p>Wright completed his move to Highbury at the age of 27 after he had helped Palace to promotion via the play-offs before finishing third in the old First Division in their second season in the top flight, only 14 points behind the champions, Arsenal. Over the next seven years, he went on to become the club\u2019s all\u2011time top scorer with 185 goals in 288 appearances to prove that it had very much been money well spent by George Graham.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/01/arsenal-40m-approach-crystal-palace-wilfried-zaha\">Arsenal make \u00a340m approach to Crystal Palace for Wilfried Zaha</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fast-forward almost three decades and the characters may have changed but there are plenty of parallels with the situation facing Palace and their latest talisman, Wilfried Zaha, this summer. Noades \u2013 an often controversial figure who died in December 2013 \u2013 has been replaced by the co-chairman Steve Parish, who is recognised as being the man responsible for masterminding Palace\u2019s emergence as an established member of the Premier League over the past six seasons, albeit largely due to the presence of Zaha \u2013 who also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/27/crystal-palace-promoted-premier-league-kevin-phillips\" title=\"\">helped them win promotion</a> in the first place, in May 2013.</p> <p>Four months earlier he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/25/wilfried-zaha-manchester-united-july\" title=\"\">signed for Manchester United</a> for \u00a310m but he spent much of the following two years on loan, partly at Cardiff but mainly at Selhurst Park. Since his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/02/manchester-united-sell-wilfried-zaha-crystal-palace\" title=\"\">permanent return in February 2015</a>, it is no exaggeration to say the player who grew up a stone\u2019s-throw from the club\u2019s ground has been the main reason the club he joined at the age of 12 are enjoying the most sustained period of success in their history. Countless assists and a vastly improved return of 26 goals in the past three seasons have helped Palace finish 14th, 11th and 12th and cemented Zaha\u2019s reputation as one of the best players outside the Premier League\u2019s top six.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c73cd18ef5b3a73bf2b64e1f1be68a480173304\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c73cd18ef5b3a73bf2b64e1f1be68a480173304/0_0_4056_2876/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Wright went on to become Arsenal\u2019s all\u2011time top scorer with 185 goals in 288 games after joining from Crystal Palace in 1991.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"709\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian Wright went on to become Arsenal\u2019s all\u2011time top scorer with 185 goals in 288 games after joining from Crystal Palace in 1991.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there is Arsenal.

      "bodyText": "Ron Noades used to enjoy telling the story about the day a tearful Ian Wright pleaded with him to accept Arsenal\u2019s offer for his star striker in September 1991. \u201cWe\u2019d had a bid of \u00a32.5m, which was a hell of a lot of money back then,\u201d Crystal Palace\u2019s infamous former chairman told me in 2012. \u201cIan came to my house in tears and asked me why we hadn\u2019t accepted it. I remember it was a very emotional conversation in my kitchen but eventually I agreed to let him go.\u201d Wright completed his move to Highbury at the age of 27 after he had helped Palace to promotion via the play-offs before finishing third in the old First Division in their second season in the top flight, only 14 points behind the champions, Arsenal. Over the next seven years, he went on to become the club\u2019s all\u2011time top scorer with 185 goals in 288 appearances to prove that it had very much been money well spent by George Graham. Fast-forward almost three decades and the characters may have changed but there are plenty of parallels with the situation facing Palace and their latest talisman, Wilfried Zaha, this summer. Noades \u2013 an often controversial figure who died in December 2013 \u2013 has been replaced by the co-chairman Steve Parish, who is recognised as being the man responsible for masterminding Palace\u2019s emergence as an established member of the Premier League over the past six seasons, albeit largely due to the presence of Zaha \u2013 who also helped them win promotion in the first place, in May 2013. Four months earlier he had signed for Manchester United for \u00a310m but he spent much of the following two years on loan, partly at Cardiff but mainly at Selhurst Park. Since his permanent return in February 2015, it is no exaggeration to say the player who grew up a stone\u2019s-throw from the club\u2019s ground has been the main reason the club he joined at the age of 12 are enjoying the most sustained period of success in their history. Countless assists and a vastly improved return of 26 goals in the past three seasons have helped Palace finish 14th, 11th and 12th and cemented Zaha\u2019s reputation as one of the best players outside the Premier League\u2019s top six. Then there is Arsenal. They are no longer the force they were under Graham in 1991 and Unai Emery has reportedly been handed only \u00a350m to replenish his squad over the next few weeks after the disappointment of failing to qualify for the Champions League, hence the derisory offer of \u00a340m for Zaha this week that is said to have left Palace feeling \u201cincensed\u201d. That is less than half the value they place on the 26-year-old, who is currently on international duty with Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations. Left out of the starting lineup by the coach, Ibrahim Kamara, for the opening two matches in Egypt, Zaha cut a dejected figure on the bench during Ivory Coast\u2019s defeat to Morocco on the same day United reached a breakthrough in their negotiations with Palace over his close friend Aaron Wan-Bissaka. The sizeable fee \u2013 \u00a345m up front and another \u00a35m in add-ons \u2013 for a player who has made fewer than 50 first-team appearances is evidence that Palace drive a hard bargain and will not let their prized asset leave on the cheap. Since that move back to south London on a permanent basis \u2013 a deal that also included a 25% sell-on fee for United \u2013 Zaha\u2019s outstanding performances have been rewarded with a series of improved deals that have taken his wages from around \u00a330,000 a week to more than \u00a3120,000 a week. Key to that process has been Parish, who \u2013 in contrast to Noades when he attempted to keep Wright \u2013 has been able to call upon the vast riches of the modern Premier League to help his cause, and his recognition that his star player held the key to survival every season. The result has been a wage packet and contract that have so far dissuaded several interested parties, including Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s Tottenham, from following up their interest, as well as helping Zaha to purchase Noades\u2019s old house in 2015 for \u00a32.5m \u2013 coincidentally the same amount Arsenal paid back in 1991 for Wright. Having also featured in the television show Footballers\u2019 Wives in the past, it\u2019s not known whether the house\u2019s swimming pool still has the Palace badge emblazoned on the bottom tiles as it did the day Wright visited all those years ago. But while the kitchen might not witness the same dramatic scenes this summer, the nagging rumours that Zaha was assured he would be allowed to leave this summer should a suitable offer be received have left Palace supporters fearing everything is finally coming to a head. Many would not begrudge Zaha the opportunity to prove he belongs at a higher level after such committed service over the years \u2013 but they will also be concerned that Palace are not held to ransom for a player who has become so important. The situation is complicated by the fact that Zaha is in Cairo with the Ivorian squad, out of reach of Parish, with the public statements of his brother Judicael Boris Rodrigue Inchaud this week apparently confirming his desire to move on to the club he supported as a child. Another brother, Herv\u00e9, played a role as a consultant for the agency that worked on Wan\u2011Bissaka\u2019s move to Old Trafford and has represented Zaha for several years. They were instrumental in his 2013 move to United, when Sir Alex Ferguson was persuaded to make the then 20-year-old his final signing. Arsenal were also in the mix until Ars\u00e8ne Wenger balked at the prospect of increasing an \u00a38m offer and loaning him back for the rest of the season, as United eventually agreed to do.

      "body": "<p>By page 15 of a book named after Ralph Vaughan-Williams\u2019s romance for violin and orchestra, after an evocation of the soaring, floating, intoxicating solo that takes us flying with the lark up over the orchestral sounds of the earth, we might expect to be getting started on the contexts of the English music renaissance or the meanings of pastoralism. Instead, we have Richard King\u2019s enraptured memories of Castlemorton Common festival in 1992, when 20,000 (or was it 40,000?) revellers danced night after night, and the sound systems vibrated through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/dec/28/lets-move-to-great-malvern-and-the-malvern-hills-walk-in-elgars-footsteps\" title=\"\">Malvern hills</a>.</p> <p>With this leap, the nation\u2019s favourite piece of music <strong> </strong>is established as the presiding spirit of an idiosyncratic pilgrimage through 20th-century experiments in life and sound. King relieves Vaughan Williams of his tweeds and supplies an honorary bandana in their place.

      "bodyText": "By page 15 of a book named after Ralph Vaughan-Williams\u2019s romance for violin and orchestra, after an evocation of the soaring, floating, intoxicating solo that takes us flying with the lark up over the orchestral sounds of the earth, we might expect to be getting started on the contexts of the English music renaissance or the meanings of pastoralism. Instead, we have Richard King\u2019s enraptured memories of Castlemorton Common festival in 1992, when 20,000 (or was it 40,000?) revellers danced night after night, and the sound systems vibrated through the Malvern hills. With this leap, the nation\u2019s favourite piece of music is established as the presiding spirit of an idiosyncratic pilgrimage through 20th-century experiments in life and sound. King relieves Vaughan Williams of his tweeds and supplies an honorary bandana in their place. Finding some vestige of hope and glory in a land pulsing with bass beats, he is moved by the thought of \u201cElgar Country\u201d, the Malverns, hosting on its few remaining pieces of common ground a free gathering of commoners wanting to be outdoors together. For King there is a kind of sublime impersonality in the outdoor rave that unfolds spontaneously, without organiser or programme, generating a shared sense of reverie. And in this it answers to his experience of The Lark Ascending \u201cas intimate, if not spiritual, as music can create\u201d. In the poem that inspired Vaughan Williams, George Meredith described the lark\u2019s song as \u201cseraphically free / Of taint of personality\u201d.

Powerful feelings for the hymn book and for musical ritual clearly remained with him when, later, he sought out convergences of jazz, folk and rock, and launched the underground label Planet Records. Those feelings shape The Lark Ascending, which wanders between cathedral stalls and festival fields, magnetically drawn to overlaps of avant-gardism and popular song, radicalism and tradition. The general idea is to explore the musical lives and ideals of people with strong responses to landscape, and to reveal the intense, diverse, mystical and often bizarre ways in which music has been used to solemnise new relationships with the land. Prioritising distinct events and encounters over cultural survey, King seeks out the extremities of interwar ruralism, the radical thinkers grouped around Resurgence &amp; Ecologist magazine, and the rites of new age travellers at Stonehenge. Some of the music is not rural in its genesis, but becomes so in the minds of its listeners. King finds room for a delighted appreciation of the Penguin Cafe Orchestra, describing Simon Jeffes\u2019s domestic dreamscapes as the accompaniment to numerous British family holidays in the 1980s.

For his second film, Aster marches into Wicker Man territory as his two leads, Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor, head for a Swedish midsummer festival with some weird tribal rituals. Unsettling doesn\u2019t do justice to it.</p> <h2>Spider-Man: Far from Home (12A)</h2> <p><em>(Jon Watts, 2019, US) 129 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_DXYCZceXE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J_DXYCZceXE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This is Tom Holland\u2019s second feature outing as the wallcrawler, in which Peter Parker goes on a National Lampoon-style Euro vacation, only battling supervillains rather than car thieves. More importantly, this is a further step in the integration of Spider-Man into the Marvel Cinematic Universe; a follow-up is already in the pipeline.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t Look Now (15)</h2> <p><em>(Nicolas Roeg, 1973, UK) 105 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXP8OaJGxrM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xXP8OaJGxrM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Often cited as one of the best horror films ever made, Roeg\u2019s adaptation of a Daphne du Maurier story is a masterpiece of brooding atmosphere and formal daring, as well as <em>that</em> sex scene. Roeg\u2019s penchant for time-shift narrative works particularly well in this Venice-set chiller involving tragedy and premonition: cinema that is both transcendent and utterly creepy.</p> <h2>Ibiza: The Silent Movie (15)</h2> <p><em>(Julien Temple, 2019, UK) 92 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN8DYKJwgYY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zN8DYKJwgYY?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As the festival season cranks into action across the UK, here\u2019s Julien Temple\u2019s take on the parallel get-together out in the Mediterranean, long the holiday party choice for clubbers. This is only \u201csilent\u201d insofar as no one talks; there is plenty of pounding music, as Temple evokes the wider history of the island going back millennia.</p> <h2>Vita &amp; Virginia (12A)</h2> <p><em>(Chanya Button, 2018, Ire/UK) 110 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw4m6jPsY4M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yw4m6jPsY4M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>An account of the relationship between two literary giants of the Bloomsbury era: Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf, played by Gemma Arterton and Elizabeth Debicki respectively.

The Saturday bill is topped by Chance the Rapper, with Giggs, Four Tet, Lizzo and Brockhampton. And if that all sounds a bit millennial, Cypress Hill play Friday. <br><em><a href=\"https://loveboxfestival.com/\">Gunnersbury Park, W3, Friday 12 to 13 July</a></em></p> <h2>Aly &amp; AJ</h2> <p>Alyson and Amanda are not your average synthpop act: they\u2019re big-in-America Christian rock stars and Disney Channel alumnae. Which is more than you can say for Frankmusik. Their Sanctuary EP is full of the sort of shiny emotive anthems that\u2019ll surely score countless romcoms starring Noah Centineo and someone from Riverdale to come. <br><em><a href=\"https://scala.co.uk/events/aly-and-aj/\">The Scala, N1, Thursday 11</a>; <a href=\"https://www.manchesteracademy.net/aly-and-aj-tickets/tour#tour\">Manchester Academy 2, Friday 12 July</a></em></p> <h2>Monsta X</h2> <p>Along with BTS, Monsta X are one of the last surviving boybands (soz, Boyzlife). While their songs have a futuristic R&amp;B sheen, they are flying the flag for traditional boyband tropes, too: slick choreography, matching outfits, turbocharged enthusiasm and the ability to amass the sort of rabid fans who pitch tents outside the venue 24 hours before the doors open. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.ssearena.co.uk/events/detail/monsta-x\">The SSE Arena, Wembley, Tuesday 9 July</a></em></p> <h2>Amber Mark</h2> <p>Amber Mark is a singer, songwriter and producer who \u2013 if her video for Mixer is anything to go by \u2013 has mastered an essential pop skill: walking down a New York street moodily \u00e0 la Beyonc\u00e9 and Christina. Last year\u2019s EP Conex\u00e3o featured a cover of Sade\u2019s Love Is Stronger Than Pride, while the recent What If is Stevie Wonder-indebted, giving you an idea of the ballpark she\u2019s aiming for. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.ambermarkmusic.com/\">Longitude festival, Dublin, Sunday 7; Manchester, Monday 8; London, Tuesday 8 July</a></em></p> <p><em>HG</em></p> <h2>Love Supreme jazz festival</h2> <p>Cinematic Orchestra\u2019s jazzy, soulfully thoughtful album To Believe has deservedly put them among the headliners at the soul, ska, rap and jazz-bridging Love Supreme festival. Gladys Knight, Jimmy Cliff and Ms Lauryn Hill supply the weekend\u2019s legend quotient; Chick Corea, Snarky Puppy, Seed Ensemble and more reflect the diversity of contemporary jazz. <br><em><a href=\"https://lovesupremefestival.com/#Ox0VWYKitTilvrF5.97\">Glynde Place, nr Lewes, Saturday 6 &amp; Sunday 7 July</a></em></p> <p><em>JF</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best ... classical concerts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2812e9162554b68a9d6a8cfaac6c1f8ba2093660\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2812e9162554b68a9d6a8cfaac6c1f8ba2093660/124_785_2155_1293/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Murray stars in Lucio Papirio Dittatore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For a tenor\u2026 Robert Murray stars in Lucio Papirio Dittatore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donald Cooper/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Lucio Papirio Dittatore</h2> <p>Tchaikovsky\u2019s Eugene Onegin and Offenbach\u2019s Orpheus in the Underworld feature at this year\u2019s Buxton festival, but this operatic rarity is one of the 90-odd stage works by Antonio Caldara. The Venetian, born in 1670, is best known now for the lavish choral works he wrote in his native city, but the opera seria Lucio Papirio Dittatore was composed in 1719 for Vienna, where Caldara was employed by the imperial court. It comes to Buxton courtesy of La Serenissima, with Robert Murray in the title role of the Roman ruler. <br><em><a href=\"https://buxtonoperahouse.org.uk/event/lucio-papirio-dittatore\">Buxton Opera House, Tuesday 9, 13 and 18 July</a></em></p> <h2>Ruth Gipps</h2> <p>Female composers feature very prominently at Cheltenham this summer, and the first ever work that the festival commissioned from a woman, in 1956, is revived in the CBSO\u2019s all-British programme. It is the second symphony by Ruth Gipps, an influential figure in British music in the 1950s and 60s.

In China, where it originated, a cup of tea can symbolise everything from respect for elders to an apology. In Japan, its consumption was formalised in the tea ceremony. Echoes of those customs came with its arrival in 18th-century Britain; paintings by Arthur Devis and Johann Zoffany show people gathering in country houses to take tea.

      "bodyText": "Five of the best\u2026 films Midsommar (18) (Ari Aster, 2019, US) 147 mins With his debut feature, Hereditary, Ari Aster applied a new finesse to horror, arguably reinvigorating a genre that appeared to be running on empty, or at least very little. For his second film, Aster marches into Wicker Man territory as his two leads, Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor, head for a Swedish midsummer festival with some weird tribal rituals. Unsettling doesn\u2019t do justice to it. Spider-Man: Far from Home (12A) (Jon Watts, 2019, US) 129 mins This is Tom Holland\u2019s second feature outing as the wallcrawler, in which Peter Parker goes on a National Lampoon-style Euro vacation, only battling supervillains rather than car thieves. More importantly, this is a further step in the integration of Spider-Man into the Marvel Cinematic Universe; a follow-up is already in the pipeline. Don\u2019t Look Now (15) (Nicolas Roeg, 1973, UK) 105 mins Often cited as one of the best horror films ever made, Roeg\u2019s adaptation of a Daphne du Maurier story is a masterpiece of brooding atmosphere and formal daring, as well as that sex scene. Roeg\u2019s penchant for time-shift narrative works particularly well in this Venice-set chiller involving tragedy and premonition: cinema that is both transcendent and utterly creepy. Ibiza: The Silent Movie (15) (Julien Temple, 2019, UK) 92 mins As the festival season cranks into action across the UK, here\u2019s Julien Temple\u2019s take on the parallel get-together out in the Mediterranean, long the holiday party choice for clubbers. This is only \u201csilent\u201d insofar as no one talks; there is plenty of pounding music, as Temple evokes the wider history of the island going back millennia. Vita &amp; Virginia (12A) (Chanya Button, 2018, Ire/UK) 110 mins An account of the relationship between two literary giants of the Bloomsbury era: Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf, played by Gemma Arterton and Elizabeth Debicki respectively. Taking its cue from Woolf\u2019s novel Orlando: A Biography, with its radical take on gender (as well as Eileen Atkins\u2019s 1992 play), it finds Arterton\u2019s Vita pursuing Debicki\u2019s bookish Virginia in a smart if conventional treatment. AP Five of the best ... rock &amp; pop Lovebox festival This two-day festival boasts one of the most impressive lineups of the summer: expect cowboy hats and meaningful shadow work during Solange\u2019s headline set, as well as high-energy sets from J Hus and Slowthai. The Saturday bill is topped by Chance the Rapper, with Giggs, Four Tet, Lizzo and Brockhampton. And if that all sounds a bit millennial, Cypress Hill play Friday. Gunnersbury Park, W3, Friday 12 to 13 July Aly &amp; AJ Alyson and Amanda are not your average synthpop act: they\u2019re big-in-America Christian rock stars and Disney Channel alumnae. Which is more than you can say for Frankmusik. Their Sanctuary EP is full of the sort of shiny emotive anthems that\u2019ll surely score countless romcoms starring Noah Centineo and someone from Riverdale to come. The Scala, N1, Thursday 11; Manchester Academy 2, Friday 12 July Monsta X Along with BTS, Monsta X are one of the last surviving boybands (soz, Boyzlife). While their songs have a futuristic R&amp;B sheen, they are flying the flag for traditional boyband tropes, too: slick choreography, matching outfits, turbocharged enthusiasm and the ability to amass the sort of rabid fans who pitch tents outside the venue 24 hours before the doors open. The SSE Arena, Wembley, Tuesday 9 July Amber Mark Amber Mark is a singer, songwriter and producer who \u2013 if her video for Mixer is anything to go by \u2013 has mastered an essential pop skill: walking down a New York street moodily \u00e0 la Beyonc\u00e9 and Christina. Last year\u2019s EP Conex\u00e3o featured a cover of Sade\u2019s Love Is Stronger Than Pride, while the recent What If is Stevie Wonder-indebted, giving you an idea of the ballpark she\u2019s aiming for. Longitude festival, Dublin, Sunday 7; Manchester, Monday 8; London, Tuesday 8 July HG Love Supreme jazz festival Cinematic Orchestra\u2019s jazzy, soulfully thoughtful album To Believe has deservedly put them among the headliners at the soul, ska, rap and jazz-bridging Love Supreme festival. Gladys Knight, Jimmy Cliff and Ms Lauryn Hill supply the weekend\u2019s legend quotient; Chick Corea, Snarky Puppy, Seed Ensemble and more reflect the diversity of contemporary jazz. Glynde Place, nr Lewes, Saturday 6 &amp; Sunday 7 July JF Three of the best ... classical concerts Lucio Papirio Dittatore Tchaikovsky\u2019s Eugene Onegin and Offenbach\u2019s Orpheus in the Underworld feature at this year\u2019s Buxton festival, but this operatic rarity is one of the 90-odd stage works by Antonio Caldara. The Venetian, born in 1670, is best known now for the lavish choral works he wrote in his native city, but the opera seria Lucio Papirio Dittatore was composed in 1719 for Vienna, where Caldara was employed by the imperial court. It comes to Buxton courtesy of La Serenissima, with Robert Murray in the title role of the Roman ruler. Buxton Opera House, Tuesday 9, 13 and 18 July Ruth Gipps Female composers feature very prominently at Cheltenham this summer, and the first ever work that the festival commissioned from a woman, in 1956, is revived in the CBSO\u2019s all-British programme. It is the second symphony by Ruth Gipps, an influential figure in British music in the 1950s and 60s. The concert also includes a premiere: Thea Musgrave\u2019s Trumpet Concerto, with the festival\u2019s artistic director, Alison Balsom, as the soloist.

      "body": "<p>Jesca Hoop\u2019s fifth album is named after an exhibit in a Philadelphia medical museum: a calcified foetus that a woman carried inside her for decades. It\u2019s a hauntingly evocative image, and one that contains a multitude of contradictions: the most vulnerable of humans transformed into rock-solid matter; an existence both profoundly lonely and subsumed inside another; a life that never truly began but continues to exist today. This is very Hoop. Liminal spaces, the places between clearcut emotional boundaries, is where the 44-year-old prefers to be. Stonechild sees the California-born Chorlton resident pare back the unshowy sonic irregularity that has seen her acquire musician\u2019s-musician status (notable admirers include Tom Waits, Guy Garvey and Stewart Copeland) but hold tight to her strange narratives that swell with a hard-to-pin-down sadness.</p> <p>If Hoop\u2019s previous album, 2017\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/09/jesca-hoop-memories-are-now-review-sub-pop\">Memories Are Now</a>, was a quietly subversive take on classic finger-picked singer-songwriter fare, then Stonechild cleaves to an altogether more conventional style, drawing on the brooding, ancient-sounding melodiousness of traditional English folk music. The album\u2019s highlight is a track called Shoulder Charge. A plain, pensive ballad that flowers into Elbow-like indie-rock exultation, it centres around an unnamed tragedy \u2013 one that devastates but is commonplace enough to require its owner to carry on regardless, meeting friends for coffee \u201carmoured in mascara\u201d. The song\u2019s combination of pedestrian simplicity and stark absence means it strikes the perfect balance between warm relatability and compelling mystery.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not something you could say about all of Stonechild\u2019s tracks. While her subject matter tends to be just about discernible \u2013 other topics include technology, patriarchy, slavery and the concept of time \u2013 the complexity and impenetrability of Hoop\u2019s words can make them difficult to engage with. In Stonechild, Hoop has streamlined her sound. It\u2019s hard not to feel her sentiments could benefit from some similar pruning.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jesca Hoop\u2019s fifth album is named after an exhibit in a Philadelphia medical museum: a calcified foetus that a woman carried inside her for decades. It\u2019s a hauntingly evocative image, and one that contains a multitude of contradictions: the most vulnerable of humans transformed into rock-solid matter; an existence both profoundly lonely and subsumed inside another; a life that never truly began but continues to exist today. This is very Hoop. Liminal spaces, the places between clearcut emotional boundaries, is where the 44-year-old prefers to be. Stonechild sees the California-born Chorlton resident pare back the unshowy sonic irregularity that has seen her acquire musician\u2019s-musician status (notable admirers include Tom Waits, Guy Garvey and Stewart Copeland) but hold tight to her strange narratives that swell with a hard-to-pin-down sadness. If Hoop\u2019s previous album, 2017\u2019s Memories Are Now, was a quietly subversive take on classic finger-picked singer-songwriter fare, then Stonechild cleaves to an altogether more conventional style, drawing on the brooding, ancient-sounding melodiousness of traditional English folk music. The album\u2019s highlight is a track called Shoulder Charge. A plain, pensive ballad that flowers into Elbow-like indie-rock exultation, it centres around an unnamed tragedy \u2013 one that devastates but is commonplace enough to require its owner to carry on regardless, meeting friends for coffee \u201carmoured in mascara\u201d. The song\u2019s combination of pedestrian simplicity and stark absence means it strikes the perfect balance between warm relatability and compelling mystery. But that\u2019s not something you could say about all of Stonechild\u2019s tracks. While her subject matter tends to be just about discernible \u2013 other topics include technology, patriarchy, slavery and the concept of time \u2013 the complexity and impenetrability of Hoop\u2019s words can make them difficult to engage with. In Stonechild, Hoop has streamlined her sound. It\u2019s hard not to feel her sentiments could benefit from some similar pruning.",

And sure, she\u2019s got gadgets and gizmos aplenty, but she\u2019s crying out for a remake. Ariel may be rebellious and strong-willed, but her story, for all its catchy songs, is essentially a morality tale about the corrupting influence of a world outside her father\u2019s control and the virtues of a woman\u2019s silence.</p> <p>Thirty years on, and a Disney live-action remake is happening. And so is a backlash of sorts, after Halle Bailey, an African-American singer, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/04/us-singer-halle-bailey-cast-as-ariel-in-disneys-live-action-remake-of-the-little-mermaid\" title=\"\">cast in the main role</a>. The problem is, naysayers insist, Ariel is meant to be ginger.</p> <p>Let\u2019s grab a <a href=\"https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Dinglehopper\" title=\"\">dinglehopper</a> and pick this one apart. Some are doubtless using Ariel\u2019s hair colour as code for her skin colour. Their feelings are that Ariel isn\u2019t just meant to have red hair, she\u2019s meant to be the sort of person who tends to have naturally red hair \u2013 a white person. This is racism. There was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/05/harry-potter-jk--rowling-black-hermione\" title=\"\">a similar backlash</a> from so-called fans when a black woman was cast to play Hermione in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Though it was a play where people use wands to cast spells, certain people couldn\u2019t manage to see Hermione, written in the books as having brown eyes and frizzy hair, as anything but a white woman. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/24/aladdin-princess-jasmine-brown-colorism-disney\">The fairest of them all? Two cheers for Aladdin's browner Princess Jasmine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While it\u2019s fair to say Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s Little Mermaid probably wasn\u2019t black in his original story, the narrative features the mermaid killing herself in order to achieve moral purity, so tweaking his version has always been necessary.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWouldn\u2019t you say I\u2019m the girl who has everything,\u201d warbles Ariel in the 1989 Disney film The Little Mermaid. And sure, she\u2019s got gadgets and gizmos aplenty, but she\u2019s crying out for a remake. Ariel may be rebellious and strong-willed, but her story, for all its catchy songs, is essentially a morality tale about the corrupting influence of a world outside her father\u2019s control and the virtues of a woman\u2019s silence. Thirty years on, and a Disney live-action remake is happening. And so is a backlash of sorts, after Halle Bailey, an African-American singer, was cast in the main role. The problem is, naysayers insist, Ariel is meant to be ginger. Let\u2019s grab a dinglehopper and pick this one apart. Some are doubtless using Ariel\u2019s hair colour as code for her skin colour. Their feelings are that Ariel isn\u2019t just meant to have red hair, she\u2019s meant to be the sort of person who tends to have naturally red hair \u2013 a white person. This is racism. There was a similar backlash from so-called fans when a black woman was cast to play Hermione in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Though it was a play where people use wands to cast spells, certain people couldn\u2019t manage to see Hermione, written in the books as having brown eyes and frizzy hair, as anything but a white woman. While it\u2019s fair to say Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s Little Mermaid probably wasn\u2019t black in his original story, the narrative features the mermaid killing herself in order to achieve moral purity, so tweaking his version has always been necessary. Disney\u2019s creators used Italian-American Alyssa Milano\u2019s face as a template for Ariel, bunged on some blue eyes, and turned her hair red simply because, the story goes, blonde hair would be too similar to Daryl Hannah\u2019s in 1984\u2019s Splash, and red complements a green tail.

      "body": "<p>Wigan council has achieved a remarkable feat. Despite cuts of \u00a3140m, it has maintained, even improved, its services, and transformed its relationship with residents. But there has been a cost: more than 1,000 of its staff have lost their jobs \u2013 roughly a fifth of the workforce.</p> <p>Under relentless pressure to do more with less, all councils have had to make cuts. Many also bandy the word transformation around, but few achieve it. <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/wigan-deal\">A study of Wigan by the King\u2019s Fund</a> makes clear this council is an exception.</p> <p>The bedrock of Wigan\u2019s approach is a new relationship with both its staff and local people. It has rejected the paternalism that bedevils many public services in favour of working with individuals, families and communities to nurture their strengths and build independence and self-reliance. This is known locally as the Wigan Deal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/19/health-inequality-life-expectancy\">Telling people to eat fewer burgers won't solve shocking health inequality | Richard Vize</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Key to its success has been farsighted financial planning. While many councils in the early years of austerity became fixated on what they had to cut, Wigan looked at evidence from across the country to decide what it could do differently.</p> <p>A number of councils exacerbated their precarious financial position by setting impossible cuts targets, forcing them to gouge out even greater amounts of spending in subsequent years and deplete their reserves to prop up day-to-day costs. Wigan set realistic cuts targets, which allowed for some inevitable slippage, and used reserves to fund change programmes such as hiring temporary social workers to reassess care packages so they were better suited to individual needs.</p> <p>This financial smart thinking allowed the council to focus on the primary goal of the Wigan Deal: improving the lives of local people. Brilliantly, it invested in training its workforce to think differently. An anthropologist worked with staff on techniques to understand the lives and needs of local people better, setting aside their preconceptions and exploring the world through residents\u2019 eyes.</p> <p>This evolved into a new approach to social work, based around having \u201cdifferent conversations\u201d about what clients valued in life and what they could do, rather than what they couldn\u2019t. Families with complex needs were encouraged to take control over their lives by building relationships, living healthier lives and feeling part of the community, supported rather than led by council staff.</p> <p>The council showed courage by taking this approach into difficult areas such as child protection. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/oct/10/family-group-conferences-change-lives\">Family group conferences</a> were introduced, which might involve eight members of the child\u2019s extended family and only two social workers, trying to find a way forward by drawing on the family\u2019s own resources.</p> <p>Across local government and the NHS there is endless talk about investing in prevention to reduce future demand. Wigan\u2019s huge focus on public health \u2013 such as training thousands of health champions to bring campaigns to schools, homes and workplaces \u2013 means the town is outstripping the national average in cutting premature mortality from cardiovascular disease and cancer, probably through more physical activity and less smoking. Healthy life expectancy has improved by 31 months for women and 19 for men \u2013 a strong performance.</p> <p>Delayed transfers of care between the NHS and social services are less than half the national average and re-enablement services for older people are keeping impressive numbers in their own homes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/22/open-book-guardian-public-service-awards-2019\">Does your work help improve lives? Enter the Guardian Public Service Awards 2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Aspects of what Wigan has done \u2013 sound financial planning, investing to save and liberating the resourcefulness of staff and local people \u2013 are seen across the country. But Wigan stands out for the way its financial approach has underpinned a new philosophy about what it is trying to achieve and the relationship with the people it is there to serve.</p> <p>Other councils could learn from Wigan\u2019s success in mobilising community resources around everything from public health to supporting individual families in crisis. It has improved outcomes, promoted self-reliance and strengthened the sense of people pulling together. It has achieved this through the tremendous energy and commitment of its staff and by tapping into the sense of local pride \u2013 the slogan is \u201cBelieve in Wigan\u201d.</p> <p>The Wigan Deal can never be a national blueprint.

      "bodyText": "Wigan council has achieved a remarkable feat. Despite cuts of \u00a3140m, it has maintained, even improved, its services, and transformed its relationship with residents. But there has been a cost: more than 1,000 of its staff have lost their jobs \u2013 roughly a fifth of the workforce. Under relentless pressure to do more with less, all councils have had to make cuts. Many also bandy the word transformation around, but few achieve it. A study of Wigan by the King\u2019s Fund makes clear this council is an exception. The bedrock of Wigan\u2019s approach is a new relationship with both its staff and local people. It has rejected the paternalism that bedevils many public services in favour of working with individuals, families and communities to nurture their strengths and build independence and self-reliance. This is known locally as the Wigan Deal. Key to its success has been farsighted financial planning. While many councils in the early years of austerity became fixated on what they had to cut, Wigan looked at evidence from across the country to decide what it could do differently. A number of councils exacerbated their precarious financial position by setting impossible cuts targets, forcing them to gouge out even greater amounts of spending in subsequent years and deplete their reserves to prop up day-to-day costs. Wigan set realistic cuts targets, which allowed for some inevitable slippage, and used reserves to fund change programmes such as hiring temporary social workers to reassess care packages so they were better suited to individual needs. This financial smart thinking allowed the council to focus on the primary goal of the Wigan Deal: improving the lives of local people. Brilliantly, it invested in training its workforce to think differently. An anthropologist worked with staff on techniques to understand the lives and needs of local people better, setting aside their preconceptions and exploring the world through residents\u2019 eyes. This evolved into a new approach to social work, based around having \u201cdifferent conversations\u201d about what clients valued in life and what they could do, rather than what they couldn\u2019t. Families with complex needs were encouraged to take control over their lives by building relationships, living healthier lives and feeling part of the community, supported rather than led by council staff. The council showed courage by taking this approach into difficult areas such as child protection. Family group conferences were introduced, which might involve eight members of the child\u2019s extended family and only two social workers, trying to find a way forward by drawing on the family\u2019s own resources. Across local government and the NHS there is endless talk about investing in prevention to reduce future demand. Wigan\u2019s huge focus on public health \u2013 such as training thousands of health champions to bring campaigns to schools, homes and workplaces \u2013 means the town is outstripping the national average in cutting premature mortality from cardiovascular disease and cancer, probably through more physical activity and less smoking. Healthy life expectancy has improved by 31 months for women and 19 for men \u2013 a strong performance. Delayed transfers of care between the NHS and social services are less than half the national average and re-enablement services for older people are keeping impressive numbers in their own homes. Aspects of what Wigan has done \u2013 sound financial planning, investing to save and liberating the resourcefulness of staff and local people \u2013 are seen across the country. But Wigan stands out for the way its financial approach has underpinned a new philosophy about what it is trying to achieve and the relationship with the people it is there to serve. Other councils could learn from Wigan\u2019s success in mobilising community resources around everything from public health to supporting individual families in crisis. It has improved outcomes, promoted self-reliance and strengthened the sense of people pulling together. It has achieved this through the tremendous energy and commitment of its staff and by tapping into the sense of local pride \u2013 the slogan is \u201cBelieve in Wigan\u201d. The Wigan Deal can never be a national blueprint. Endless public sector cultural change programmes have tested to destruction the idea that success can simply be transplanted from one place to another. But many councils should reflect on the way Wigan has put the wisdom and creativity of staff and the community at the heart of its thinking. Procedures and transactions are giving a way to listening and understanding. The town achieved this by spending money on changing the way staff think. As one social worker put it: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like a job, it feels like a movement.\u201d \u2022 Richard Vize is a public policy commentator and analyst",

At the same time, car sales in China \u2013 the key growth market for the global automotive industry \u2013 fell last year for the first time in nearly three decades. JLR was forced to take a \u00a33.1bn accounting writedown in the last quarter of 2018 after admitting its investments in China were worth much less than planned, resulting in its worst annual loss.",

      "body": "<h2>25. With A Song In My Heart (1963)</h2> \n<p>Who wants to hear a 12-year-old singing Great American Songbook standards? Apparently Berry Gordy, whose big \u2013 and baffling \u2013 idea seemed to be that Wonder should go into cabaret, as evidenced by these syrupy orchestral selections. Wonder gives it his best shot, but they are way beyond his abilities.</p> \n<h2>24. Eivets Rednow (1968)</h2> \n<p>A curio: an album of harmonica instrumentals, released off the back of a minor hit version of Bacharach and David\u2019s Alfie, with Wonder\u2019s name pseudonymously spelt backwards. It came out on Motown\u2019s Mo Jazz subsidiary, but its contents are closer to easy listening.</p> \n<h2>23. Stevie on the Beach (1964)</h2> \n<p>Wonder was later mortified by this stage of his early career, when he acquiesced to some deeply naff ideas. He was particularly irked by a perky novelty track here called Hey Mr Harmonica Man, which is indeed pretty excruciating: the rest isn\u2019t as bad as that, although its appeal is definitely kitschy.</p> \n<h2>22. Someday at Christmas (1967)</h2> \n<p>There is a generous helping of schmaltz here \u2013 not least his version of Silver Bells, which sounds like pre-second world war pop \u2013 but there is also the troubled title track, which seems to have as much to do with the Vietnam war as Christmas, and the great closer, What Christmas Means to Me, which offers seasonal good cheer without an accompanying sugar overdose.</p> \n<h2>21. Characters (1987)</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fc80f185e0fd694b0b15e8c92b9b2c6c09e39802\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc80f185e0fd694b0b15e8c92b9b2c6c09e39802/0_0_1921_2400/800.jpg\" alt=\"The harmonica years \u2026 Stevie Wonder in the early 60s.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The harmonica years \u2026 Stevie Wonder in the early 60s.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CSU Archv/Everett / Rex Features</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Characters was cut from the same local-radio-friendly cloth as its predecessor, 1985\u2019s million-selling In Square Circle: diehard fans with time on their hands could probably pick through it and make a case for the funky Dark \u2019n\u2019 Lovely and Skeletons, but it is hard to see why you would play the latter when you could play Superstition instead.</p> \n<h2>20. I Was Made to Love Her (1967)</h2> \n<p>The superb title track was Wonder\u2019s biggest hit of the 60s, but the subsequent album was hurriedly thrown together to capitalise on it. You can tell \u2013 there are a lot of hastily knocked-off covers \u2013 although Wonder\u2019s version of Holland-Dozier-Holland\u2019s Baby Don\u2019t You Do It is fantastic.</p> \n<h2>19. The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie (1962)</h2> \n<p>On one level, Stevie Wonder\u2019s debut album is extraordinary. He was 11 when he cut these dancefloor jazz instrumentals, audibly designed to show off his prowess on keyboards, harmonica and percussion: moreover, he co-wrote one of its best tracks, Wondering. On another, it is not hugely characterful: the opener Fingertips is better heard in the unbound and extended hit live version recorded a year later.</p> \n<h2>18. In Square Circle (1985)</h2> \n<p>I Just Called to Say I Love You\u2019s success seemed to turn Wonder\u2019s head, which explains how an artist who spent the 70s at the cutting edge settled comfortably into the middle of the road. Flashes of the old greatness can be heard on Spiritual Walkers and Overjoyed, but In Square Circle offered pretty slim pickings, and the antiseptic mid-80s production does it no favours at all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bGOgY1CmiU\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1bGOgY1CmiU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>17. The Woman in Red (1984)</h2> \n<p>The point at which things get tricky. The corny, jingle-like I Just Called to Say I Love You (which, in its album version, goes on for about three weeks) won an Oscar and became Wonder\u2019s biggest single, which tends to overshadow The Woman in Red\u2019s admittedly scattered highlights, not least Love Light in Flight\u2019s polished-but-potent 80s boogie.</p> \n<h2>16. My Cherie Amour (1969)</h2> \n<p>At this stage, Wonder still didn\u2019t always pen his own singles, but the quality of his albums was increasingly defined by how many times his name showed up in the writing credits. Certainly, the best non-single tracks here \u2013 Somebody Knows, Somebody Cares and Angie Girl \u2013 have his signature on them.</p> \n<h2>15. Music From the Movie Jungle Fever (1992)</h2> \n<p>A commission to score Spike Lee\u2019s film seemed to shake Wonder out of his 80s doldrums, at least partially: Lighting Up the Candles and These Three Words suggested that his ballads now came with syrup as standard, but Each Other\u2019s Throats was harder-hitting funk than he had recorded in a decade, and came with the distinct intimation that he had been listening to Prince.</p> \n<h2>14. Down To Earth (1966)</h2> \n<p>A relative flop, Wonder\u2019s second album of 1966 still shows him maturing at a startling rate. Be Cool, Be Calm (And Keep Yourself Together) is a bit too close to Uptight for comfort, but Sylvia is a great show-stopping ballad, his version of Mr Tambourine Man is great, and his voice was getting richer and tougher with each album.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df90591dd78ed866d4612a2f5178f006b155e340\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df90591dd78ed866d4612a2f5178f006b155e340/0_152_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wonder playing live, early 70s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wonder playing live, early 70s.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>13. Conversation Peace (1995)</h2> \n<p>Odd as it is to hear someone who was once an agenda-setter playing catch-up, Conversation Peace\u2019s lunge for contemporaneity \u2013 hip-hop-inspired beats, a hint of dancehall on Tomorrow Robins Will Sing \u2013 works quite well. The songs are mostly stronger than his 80s work; the jazzy R&amp;B of Sensuous Whisper is great.</p> \n<h2>12. For Once In My Life (1968)</h2> \n<p>Wonder\u2019s late 60s albums were still clearly something of an afterthought, padded out with filler covers. But there are fewer than before here and some of Wonder\u2019s co-authored album tracks are as good as his singles: Do I Love Her is coolly sophisticated; I Don\u2019t Know Why builds thrillingly; and You Met Your Match is a tough funk strut, its keyboard playing a signpost towards Superstition.</p> \n<h2>11. Stevie Wonder\u2019s Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants (1979)</h2> \n<p>Met with bafflement on release, time has been kind to Wonder\u2019s oft-reviled film soundtrack, where exploratory synth instrumentals met songs packed full of lyrical mysticism/mumbo-jumbo. It is not all great, but when it is \u2013 A Seed\u2019s a Star/Tree Medley, Race Babbling\u2019s avant-disco/proto-techno \u2013 it is really great.</p> \n<h2>10. Up-Tight (1966)</h2> \n<p>With Motown clearly unsure what to do with him, Wonder began slowly taking charge of his own career, demonstrating a self-assurance that wasn\u2019t always appreciated by his label. But it yielded immediate results: he started producing himself, co-wrote the brilliant title track and made a bold attempt to cover Bob Dylan\u2019s Blowin\u2019 In the Wind in gospel-soul style.</p> \n<h2>9. Signed, Sealed &amp; Delivered (1970)</h2> \n<p>By now, Wonder was clearly straining at the confines of the standard Motown album. Heaven Help Us All was troubled and gospel-influenced; You Can\u2019t Judge a Book by Its Cover could have fitted on any of his subsequent albums; and his distorted version of We Can Work It Out transforms it from a love song into something more socially concerned.</p> \n<h2>8. A Time to Love (2005)</h2> \n<p>A late-period return to form, or something close: the more organic sound suits him and there is a real fire about So What the Fuss and If Your Love Cannot Be Moved. Please Don\u2019t Hurt My Baby, meanwhile, reworks What\u2019s That You\u2019re Doing?, a fantastic 1982 collaboration with Paul McCartney bafflingly overshadowed by the ghastly Ebony and Ivory.</p> \n<h2>7. Where I\u2019m Coming From (1971)</h2> \n<p>Not as consistent as what was to follow and hampered by weedy production, Where I\u2019m Coming From was still Wonder\u2019s best, most expansive album at the time: joyous pop alongside dense, paranoid synthy funk, and in I Never Thought You\u2019d Leave in Summer and the seven-minute Sunshine in Their Eyes, an emotional sucker-punch climax.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vjj6J7gXpY\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9Vjj6J7gXpY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>6. Hotter Than July (1980)</h2> \n<p>It says a great deal about Wonder\u2019s 70s work that an album as good as Hotter Than July was greeted as a mild disappointment. Happy Birthday saw him indulging in tinny, rounded-edged synthpop, but its heights \u2013 I Ain\u2019t Gonna Stand For It, All I Do, Lately \u2013 are still pretty skyscraping.</p> \n<h2>5. Music of My Mind (1972)</h2> \n<p>Aged 21, relocated to New York and with a renegotiated Motown contract in hand, on Music of My Mind, Wonder was off the leash. He wrote every song, played virtually every instrument, experimented wildly \u2013 not least with electronics \u2013 and for the first time, made an album, rather than a collection of tracks: one of the all-time great hot streaks in pop history begins here.</p> \n<h2>4. Fulfillingness\u2019 First Finale (1974)</h2> \n<p>Between 1972 and 1976, Wonder released nothing but unequivocal masterpieces: arranging them into a Top 4 isn\u2019t really about quality, just personal preference. Fulfillingness is more about romance than its predecessors, but You Haven\u2019t Done Nothin\u2019s farewell to Nixon might be his most ferocious blast of political ire.</p> \n<h2>3. Talking Book (1972)</h2> \n<p>An album that took the freedom, bold experimentation and one-man-band approach of Music of My Mind and added laser-sharp songwriting focus, Talking Book\u2019s songs alternately detailed the collapse of his marriage to collaborator Syreeta Wright \u2013 who contributed two lyrics \u2013 and, on Big Brother and the peerless Superstition, outlined an increasingly sharp social consciousness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmKshpLXnxE\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hmKshpLXnxE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>2. Innervisions (1973)</h2> \n<p>Its centrepiece is Living for the City\u2019s raw examination of systemic racism, but Innervisions has everything, from luscious love songs (Golden Lady) to disarmingly gentle excoriations of the US president (He\u2019s Misstra Know It All), by way of Higher Ground, the funkiest song ever written about reincarnation. This is an awesome album.</p> \n<h2>1. Songs in the Key of Life (1976)</h2> \n<p>From Curtis Mayfield to George Clinton, no genre is more overburdened with no-further-questions geniuses than soul music in the 70s, but even in that climate, Wonder stood out. Songs in the Key of Life shows why. It\u2019s not a<strong> </strong>better album than Innervisions per se, but it clinches the top spot by dint of its breadth and consistency: a rare double album where the quality never lags. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/stevie-wonder-songwriter-bim-adewunmi\">Its sheer ambition knocks you sideways</a> \u2013 Village Ghetto Land set nightmarish social reportage to, of all things, mock-baroque synthesizer \u2013 but what is really startling is that its ambitions are completely fulfilled: every song hits home. And, in Sir Duke, it contains one of the most joyous, life-affirming pieces of music ever recorded.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "25. With A Song In My Heart (1963) Who wants to hear a 12-year-old singing Great American Songbook standards? Apparently Berry Gordy, whose big \u2013 and baffling \u2013 idea seemed to be that Wonder should go into cabaret, as evidenced by these syrupy orchestral selections. Wonder gives it his best shot, but they are way beyond his abilities. 24. Eivets Rednow (1968) A curio: an album of harmonica instrumentals, released off the back of a minor hit version of Bacharach and David\u2019s Alfie, with Wonder\u2019s name pseudonymously spelt backwards. It came out on Motown\u2019s Mo Jazz subsidiary, but its contents are closer to easy listening. 23. Stevie on the Beach (1964) Wonder was later mortified by this stage of his early career, when he acquiesced to some deeply naff ideas. He was particularly irked by a perky novelty track here called Hey Mr Harmonica Man, which is indeed pretty excruciating: the rest isn\u2019t as bad as that, although its appeal is definitely kitschy. 22. Someday at Christmas (1967) There is a generous helping of schmaltz here \u2013 not least his version of Silver Bells, which sounds like pre-second world war pop \u2013 but there is also the troubled title track, which seems to have as much to do with the Vietnam war as Christmas, and the great closer, What Christmas Means to Me, which offers seasonal good cheer without an accompanying sugar overdose. 21. Characters (1987) Characters was cut from the same local-radio-friendly cloth as its predecessor, 1985\u2019s million-selling In Square Circle: diehard fans with time on their hands could probably pick through it and make a case for the funky Dark \u2019n\u2019 Lovely and Skeletons, but it is hard to see why you would play the latter when you could play Superstition instead. 20. I Was Made to Love Her (1967) The superb title track was Wonder\u2019s biggest hit of the 60s, but the subsequent album was hurriedly thrown together to capitalise on it. You can tell \u2013 there are a lot of hastily knocked-off covers \u2013 although Wonder\u2019s version of Holland-Dozier-Holland\u2019s Baby Don\u2019t You Do It is fantastic. 19. The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie (1962) On one level, Stevie Wonder\u2019s debut album is extraordinary. He was 11 when he cut these dancefloor jazz instrumentals, audibly designed to show off his prowess on keyboards, harmonica and percussion: moreover, he co-wrote one of its best tracks, Wondering. On another, it is not hugely characterful: the opener Fingertips is better heard in the unbound and extended hit live version recorded a year later. 18. In Square Circle (1985) I Just Called to Say I Love You\u2019s success seemed to turn Wonder\u2019s head, which explains how an artist who spent the 70s at the cutting edge settled comfortably into the middle of the road. Flashes of the old greatness can be heard on Spiritual Walkers and Overjoyed, but In Square Circle offered pretty slim pickings, and the antiseptic mid-80s production does it no favours at all. 17. The Woman in Red (1984) The point at which things get tricky. The corny, jingle-like I Just Called to Say I Love You (which, in its album version, goes on for about three weeks) won an Oscar and became Wonder\u2019s biggest single, which tends to overshadow The Woman in Red\u2019s admittedly scattered highlights, not least Love Light in Flight\u2019s polished-but-potent 80s boogie. 16. My Cherie Amour (1969) At this stage, Wonder still didn\u2019t always pen his own singles, but the quality of his albums was increasingly defined by how many times his name showed up in the writing credits. Certainly, the best non-single tracks here \u2013 Somebody Knows, Somebody Cares and Angie Girl \u2013 have his signature on them. 15. Music From the Movie Jungle Fever (1992) A commission to score Spike Lee\u2019s film seemed to shake Wonder out of his 80s doldrums, at least partially: Lighting Up the Candles and These Three Words suggested that his ballads now came with syrup as standard, but Each Other\u2019s Throats was harder-hitting funk than he had recorded in a decade, and came with the distinct intimation that he had been listening to Prince. 14. Down To Earth (1966) A relative flop, Wonder\u2019s second album of 1966 still shows him maturing at a startling rate. Be Cool, Be Calm (And Keep Yourself Together) is a bit too close to Uptight for comfort, but Sylvia is a great show-stopping ballad, his version of Mr Tambourine Man is great, and his voice was getting richer and tougher with each album. 13. Conversation Peace (1995) Odd as it is to hear someone who was once an agenda-setter playing catch-up, Conversation Peace\u2019s lunge for contemporaneity \u2013 hip-hop-inspired beats, a hint of dancehall on Tomorrow Robins Will Sing \u2013 works quite well. The songs are mostly stronger than his 80s work; the jazzy R&amp;B of Sensuous Whisper is great. 12. For Once In My Life (1968) Wonder\u2019s late 60s albums were still clearly something of an afterthought, padded out with filler covers. But there are fewer than before here and some of Wonder\u2019s co-authored album tracks are as good as his singles: Do I Love Her is coolly sophisticated; I Don\u2019t Know Why builds thrillingly; and You Met Your Match is a tough funk strut, its keyboard playing a signpost towards Superstition. 11. Stevie Wonder\u2019s Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants (1979) Met with bafflement on release, time has been kind to Wonder\u2019s oft-reviled film soundtrack, where exploratory synth instrumentals met songs packed full of lyrical mysticism/mumbo-jumbo. It is not all great, but when it is \u2013 A Seed\u2019s a Star/Tree Medley, Race Babbling\u2019s avant-disco/proto-techno \u2013 it is really great. 10. Up-Tight (1966) With Motown clearly unsure what to do with him, Wonder began slowly taking charge of his own career, demonstrating a self-assurance that wasn\u2019t always appreciated by his label. But it yielded immediate results: he started producing himself, co-wrote the brilliant title track and made a bold attempt to cover Bob Dylan\u2019s Blowin\u2019 In the Wind in gospel-soul style. 9. Signed, Sealed &amp; Delivered (1970) By now, Wonder was clearly straining at the confines of the standard Motown album. Heaven Help Us All was troubled and gospel-influenced; You Can\u2019t Judge a Book by Its Cover could have fitted on any of his subsequent albums; and his distorted version of We Can Work It Out transforms it from a love song into something more socially concerned. 8. A Time to Love (2005) A late-period return to form, or something close: the more organic sound suits him and there is a real fire about So What the Fuss and If Your Love Cannot Be Moved. Please Don\u2019t Hurt My Baby, meanwhile, reworks What\u2019s That You\u2019re Doing?, a fantastic 1982 collaboration with Paul McCartney bafflingly overshadowed by the ghastly Ebony and Ivory. 7. Where I\u2019m Coming From (1971) Not as consistent as what was to follow and hampered by weedy production, Where I\u2019m Coming From was still Wonder\u2019s best, most expansive album at the time: joyous pop alongside dense, paranoid synthy funk, and in I Never Thought You\u2019d Leave in Summer and the seven-minute Sunshine in Their Eyes, an emotional sucker-punch climax. 6. Hotter Than July (1980) It says a great deal about Wonder\u2019s 70s work that an album as good as Hotter Than July was greeted as a mild disappointment. Happy Birthday saw him indulging in tinny, rounded-edged synthpop, but its heights \u2013 I Ain\u2019t Gonna Stand For It, All I Do, Lately \u2013 are still pretty skyscraping. 5. Music of My Mind (1972) Aged 21, relocated to New York and with a renegotiated Motown contract in hand, on Music of My Mind, Wonder was off the leash. He wrote every song, played virtually every instrument, experimented wildly \u2013 not least with electronics \u2013 and for the first time, made an album, rather than a collection of tracks: one of the all-time great hot streaks in pop history begins here. 4. Fulfillingness\u2019 First Finale (1974) Between 1972 and 1976, Wonder released nothing but unequivocal masterpieces: arranging them into a Top 4 isn\u2019t really about quality, just personal preference. Fulfillingness is more about romance than its predecessors, but You Haven\u2019t Done Nothin\u2019s farewell to Nixon might be his most ferocious blast of political ire. 3. Talking Book (1972) An album that took the freedom, bold experimentation and one-man-band approach of Music of My Mind and added laser-sharp songwriting focus, Talking Book\u2019s songs alternately detailed the collapse of his marriage to collaborator Syreeta Wright \u2013 who contributed two lyrics \u2013 and, on Big Brother and the peerless Superstition, outlined an increasingly sharp social consciousness. 2. Innervisions (1973) Its centrepiece is Living for the City\u2019s raw examination of systemic racism, but Innervisions has everything, from luscious love songs (Golden Lady) to disarmingly gentle excoriations of the US president (He\u2019s Misstra Know It All), by way of Higher Ground, the funkiest song ever written about reincarnation. This is an awesome album. 1. Songs in the Key of Life (1976) From Curtis Mayfield to George Clinton, no genre is more overburdened with no-further-questions geniuses than soul music in the 70s, but even in that climate, Wonder stood out. Songs in the Key of Life shows why. It\u2019s not a better album than Innervisions per se, but it clinches the top spot by dint of its breadth and consistency: a rare double album where the quality never lags. Its sheer ambition knocks you sideways \u2013 Village Ghetto Land set nightmarish social reportage to, of all things, mock-baroque synthesizer \u2013 but what is really startling is that its ambitions are completely fulfilled: every song hits home. And, in Sir Duke, it contains one of the most joyous, life-affirming pieces of music ever recorded.",

A Guardian reporter who submitted a name and email address later received an email from Patriot News Alerts with a link to a story on the Patriot News Alert blog. There\u2019s no information about who runs the blog, but the Guardian searched the name and found it appears to be linked to conservative blogger Shaun Connell. Connell signs several blogposts as the pages\u2019 founder, and Patriot News Alerts shares the same Connecticut address as several other blogs. Connell is also behind Breaking Patriot News and The Daily Conservative, and the blogs are presented in a similar layout to and include some of the same writers as other right wing blogs that can be linked to Connell, like Daily Christian News.

Connell didn\u2019t return an email from the Guardian seeking comment. The four Connell-linked Facebook pages have spent about $300,000 since being created between July 2017 and September 2018. Edlelson said she tracks dozens of similar pages on the left and right, and there are probably many more. \u201cThe tactic started and was perfected on the right, but once you have a political tactic like this, everyone will use it, especially when it\u2019s this easy,\u201d Edelson said.",

(Sayers was a very popular chain in the north-west before Greggs came along \u2013 in completely the same colour scheme, I might add \u2013 and somehow became \u201ccool\u201d. I don\u2019t think this injustice has ever been fully acknowledged.)</p> <p>Anyway, I was in Sayers the bakers, and I complimented a woman on her earrings. The woman didn\u2019t thank me; she instead looked very embarrassed and proceeded to deliver a five-minute monologue about how rubbish her earrings were. How they were actually really cheap. And the colour washed her out. They weren\u2019t real silver, either. These earrings were basically the source of all that was bad in the world.</p> <p>I remember it because a week before I had read in some teen magazine that girls and women very rarely accept compliments \u2013 and here was empirical proof. I resolved then to always accept a compliment. In truth, I often add a self-deprecating aside, but, more than I used to, I will just smile and say thank you. It feels good.</p> <p>Is it better to give or receive? With compliments, as with sex, these are equally pleasurable. I give a lot of compliments. I love to give compliments. I compliment people on the street, sometimes weaving between commuters like the opening scene of a Bond film where he\u2019s giving chase, to ask someone where they got their awesome top (it\u2019s never, say, \u201cJigsaw last month.\u201d Always: \u201cOh!

      "bodyText": "When I was about 12, I distinctly remember being in a branch of Sayers the bakers. (Sayers was a very popular chain in the north-west before Greggs came along \u2013 in completely the same colour scheme, I might add \u2013 and somehow became \u201ccool\u201d. I don\u2019t think this injustice has ever been fully acknowledged.) Anyway, I was in Sayers the bakers, and I complimented a woman on her earrings. The woman didn\u2019t thank me; she instead looked very embarrassed and proceeded to deliver a five-minute monologue about how rubbish her earrings were. How they were actually really cheap. And the colour washed her out. They weren\u2019t real silver, either. These earrings were basically the source of all that was bad in the world. I remember it because a week before I had read in some teen magazine that girls and women very rarely accept compliments \u2013 and here was empirical proof. I resolved then to always accept a compliment. In truth, I often add a self-deprecating aside, but, more than I used to, I will just smile and say thank you. It feels good. Is it better to give or receive? With compliments, as with sex, these are equally pleasurable. I give a lot of compliments. I love to give compliments. I compliment people on the street, sometimes weaving between commuters like the opening scene of a Bond film where he\u2019s giving chase, to ask someone where they got their awesome top (it\u2019s never, say, \u201cJigsaw last month.\u201d Always: \u201cOh! A tiny off-the-beaten-track stall in Peru four years ago!\u201d). Most of the time, people beam at random compliments. If someone is looking great, why not tell them? Likewise, if someone has produced something you have really enjoyed, tell them. As a novelist friend recently tweeted: \u201cIf you spot a harried husk of an author looking broken in the tinned mysteries aisle at Lidl, and you are considering engaging them in excited chat about their last book\u2026 do. Made my week.\u201d We don\u2019t often get things for free in this world. But a compliment is free and easy. It can make a heavy heart lift.

Khan insists the fence isn\u2019t supposed to restrict the flow of ordinary people, and denies the existence of the smuggling gates. \u201cThe tough part is that our tribal areas should have never been separated in the first place,\u201d says Shakir Khan, 25, who recently returned to Pakistan after his brother\u2019s death, marrying his widowed wife according to tradition. Economically, he says, there are differences between Pakistan and Afghanistan\u2019s border areas, but when it comes to daily life, it\u2019s largely the same. \u201cI have relatives with Pakistani passports and others with Afghan passports. Here in this area, we\u2019re the same people and international borders won\u2019t change this.\u201d",

They were recent economic migrants to South Africa from a small village on a little island in Greece. I would stare for hours at the photograph, my grandparents looking young and glamorous, dressed in their finest; at my three-year-old mother, sitting obediently with curls in her hair; at the studio painted backdrop of a misty romantic scene.

On an 18-month cycle, the award focuses on a theme that promotes discussion and debate on issues of sustainability, awarding 100,000 Swiss francs (\u00a380,700) to the work that speaks most powerfully to the theme of the award. The theme for this cycle is Hope, which offers a wide range of creative possibilities and a strong set of connections to the overriding theme of sustainability: hope in the face of adversity, recycling, reforestation, rewilding, science \u2013 with a look at advances in medicine and technological solutions for global environmental problems \u2013 and the reduction of poverty levels. Shahidul Alam, born in 1955 in Bangladesh, based in Dhaka Series: Still She Smiles, 2014 \u201cGang raped numerous times as a child, forced into pickpocketing, caned until unconscious, sold to a madame, Hajera Begum\u2019s life has little that would give cause to smile. Yet she smiles. She cries too. Not because of the gang rapes, or the beating, or the many years she lived in the streets as a ragpicker, but when she remembers that a man who worked at an NGO refused to work in her team because she was a sex worker.\u201d Hajera arranging supplies for her orphanage on the phone while removing lice from the hair of one of the children. \u201cWhen I first met Hajera in 1996, she was a sex worker in Dhaka. We became friends, and she and her friends would often visit us in our flat, which would be considered an unacceptable act in most Bangladeshi homes. She said: \u2018You hugged me today when you saw me in the street, just like the old times. That\u2019s something men will never do. They will have sex with me, grope me in the dark, rape me if they get the chance, but they will never hug me, as a sister, as a friend. That is what I want for my children. That they will grow up with dignity, in a world where they will be loved.\u2019\u201d The photographer, writer, curator and activist Shahidul Alam studied in London before returning to his hometown, Dhaka, in 1984, where he documented the democratic struggle to remove General Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who was in power from 1983 to 1990. Joana Choumali, born in 1974 in Ivory Coast, based in Abidjan Series: \u00c7a va aller, 2016-2019 \u201cThese pictures were taken three weeks after the terrorist attacks in Grand Bassam [Ivory Coast] on 13 March 2016. After the attacks, the atmosphere of this little town changed. A a kind of melancholy invaded the town. I decided to wander the silent empty streets and I chose to leave my camera behind and shoot with my iPhone instead. I did not want to intrude on people\u2019s intimacy and disrupt their mourning. In that moment, I did not feel like a photographer, detached by the place, instead I felt part of the wounded inhabitants.\u201d \u201cIn Ivory Coast, people do not discuss their psychological issues or feelings. A post-traumatic state is often considered a weakness or a mental disease. People hardly talk about their feelings, and each conversation is quickly shortened by a resigned \u2018\u00e7a va aller\u2019. This work is a way to address the way Ivorian people deal with trauma and mental health. Joana Choumali is visual artist and photographer based in Abidjan, in Ivory Coast. She works mainly on conceptual portraits, mixed media and documentary photography. Margaret Courtney-Clarke, born in 1949 in Namibia, based in Swakopmund Series: Cry Sadness into the Coming Rain, 2014-2018 This series opens a new phase in Courtney-Clarke\u2019s photographic work, documenting the artist\u2019s return to Namibia and her engagement with its people and landscape in crisis. \u201cNamibia is steeped in history dating from the earliest inhabitants \u2013 Khoi, Bushmen, Herero, Namaqua, Damara \u2013 to German occupation, to the South Africans and apartheid, and now to \u2018liberation\u2019 and statehood \u2013 a nation of diverse peoples and cultures in a vast land of seeming nothingness and unparalleled light. I seek out the traces of their passing on the land.\u201d Life is Them. Emsi Tjambiru and Beverly Tjivinde dance on the road near their craft stall to flag down tourist buses, 2017. \u201cCry Sadness into the Coming Rain is a record of this social process, which has always hinged on the fragility of hope. The existential world of the people I photograph is located in an unforgiving environment where life is precarious: little or no rain, scarce water and food, people abandoned by their government and forced to migrate to flee the emptiness ... Their only anchor is the expectation that life will persist against these odds.\u201d After studying art and photography in South Africa, Margaret Courtney-Clarke spent the next four decades working as a photographer in Italy, the US and across Africa. Rena Effendi, born in 1977 in Baku, Azerbaijan, based in Istanbul, Turkey Series: Transylvania: Built on Grass, 2012 \u201cFor centuries, the small villages in Transylvania have preserved their hay meadows, raised cattle and operated self-sustainable farms. The agrarian fairytale extinct in western Europe still exists here, in bucolic scenes where young boys learn to cut and rake hay by hand, where all village women know how to weave and all men can build a house from scratch. In this old world, defined by traditional belief systems and respect for the environment, one does not trample a meadow of high grass before mowing it, the cows and horses find their way home along the muddy village tracks and the rivers\u2019 water is busy with the milling, washing and alcohol making.\u201d The Borcas relaxing after a working day. Gheorghe and Anu\u021ba Borca were married in July 1995, in the middle of the grass-cutting season, therefore the honeymoon had to be shortened. \u201cHaving survived the collectivisation of Ceausescu\u2019s communist regime, this fragile rural environment now faces the modern threat of industrialisation and globalisation as a result of Romania\u2019s 2007 entry into the European Union. This world is on the brink of extinction, as local small-scale farmers cannot compete with the European imports and industrialised agricultural production, and as youngsters leave the countryside in search for work in the cities of western Europe.\u201d Born in Azerbaijan, Rena Effendi lives and works in Istanbul, Turkey. Educated as a linguist, Effendi\u2019s early work focused on the oil industry\u2019s effects on people\u2019s lives in her region. Lucas Foglia, born in 1983 in the US, based in San Francisco Series: Human Nature, 2006-2019 \u201cConservationists often disagree about how humankind should best move forward from the damage it has already done. Traditionalists argue we should put a boundary around wild spaces to preserve them, but there is no way to contain the effects of people. More radical conservationists propose moving all people to green cities, supplied with renewable energy and sustainable agriculture, to allow the countryside to re-wild itself.\u201d Kate in an EEG Study of Cognition in the Wild, Utah 2015. \u201cResponding to this debate, I befriended and photographed people who are working towards a positive environmental future despite the enormity of the task. Human Nature is a series of interconnected stories about our reliance on the natural world and the science that fosters our relationship to it. Each story is set in a different ecosystem: city, forest, farm, desert, ice field, ocean and lava flow. From a newly built rainforest in urban Singapore to a Hawaiian research station measuring the cleanest air on Earth, the photographs examine our need for \u2018wild\u2019 places \u2013 even when those places are human constructions.\u201d Lucas Foglia grew up on a farm in New York and currently lives in San Francisco. His third book, Human Nature, was recently published by Nazraeli Press. Janelle Lynch, born in 1969 in the US, based in New York Series: Another Way of Looking at Love, 2015-2018 \u201cThis series explores the interconnectedness of all life forms and supports a renewal of human relationships to each other, and to the natural and the spiritual worlds. For some images, I create points of connection with elements from the same species \u2013 Japanese barberry or burdock, for example \u2013 while for others, I combine multiple species, such as goldenrod and pokeweed or burning bush and pine trees. Points of connection create spaces, which represent areas where new realities can be envisioned. The depiction of unity, together with colour and light, show the beauty and magic of the natural world.\u201d Summer Wreath, 2017. \u201cAnother Way of Looking at Love follows the belief that in our organic and spiritual essence, we are inextricably linked to each other and to Mother Nature ... Our wellness and the well-being of the world depend on healthy connections to each other and to the earth.\u201d Janelle Lynch is an American large-format photographer investigating themes of absence, presence, transcendence and the life cycle through the landscapes and waterways of the US, Mexico and Spain. Ross McDonnell, born 1979 in Ireland, based in New York Series: Limbs, 2012 Limbs shows a set of improvised prosthetic legs that the artist captured at the International Committee of the Red Cross orthopedic hospital in Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan. Patients who came to receive their new custom fitted limb often would leave their old one behind. They were kept at the hospital and displayed on the wall. One health worker said: \u201cIt would be impossible to count the number of people who have lost limbs as a result of conflict in Afghanistan.\u201d The hospital serves the semi-permanent battle space that has come to define eastern Afghanistan throughout the country\u2019s 40 years of near-continuous conflict. For McDonnell, Limbs served to anthropomorphise the resilience and optimism of the Afghan people he spent years documenting. Jalalabad, Nangarhar. Limbs. Ross McDonnell is a film-maker and photographer from Dublin, Ireland. McDonnell\u2019s work in long-term documentary projects focuses on themes of sustainability, conflict, migration and ecology. Gideon Mendel, born 1959 in South Africa, based in London Series: Damage: A Testament of Faded Memory, 2016 \u201cThese images emerge from a time of hope, activism and tragedy. In the 1980s, I was part of a young generation of \u2018struggle photographers\u2019 in South Africa, documenting the fight against apartheid. In 1990 I left a box of my outtakes (negatives and transparencies) in storage in Johannesburg, and forgot about it. A few years ago, they were returned to me and I discovered that, in their many years of neglect, the box had been rained on, and the top layers had been affected by moisture and mould.\u201d \u201cHope and tragedy seem so closely intertwined in my recollections of this period. It was a moment where the hegemony and power of the apartheid state seemed insurmountable in all its brutality, yet in response there was such heroic idealism within the township mobilisation that I witnessed.\u201d Gideon Mendel began photographing in the 1980s, during the final years of apartheid. It was his work during this period that first brought his photographs to global attention. Ivor Prickett, born 1983 in Ireland, based in Europe and the Middle East Series: End of the Caliphate, 2016-2018 \u201cThis selection of images is not an all-encompassing view of war, but rather a beacon of strength in the midst of terrible hardship. They can give us hope despite the challenges we face as a global community. Nadhira sat in a plastic chair 15 feet (4.5 metres) from where an excavator was digging through the ruins of her home in Mosul\u2019s Old City. At times she was engulfed in dust, whipped up as the driver dumped mounds of stone and parts of her house beside her, but she refused to move. Slowly they found the remains of her sister and niece, who had been killed when the house was flattened by an airstrike in the final weeks of a battle to defeat Isis in Mosul in the summer of 2017.\u201d Nadhira Aziz looking on as Iraqi civil defence workers dig out the bodies of her sister and niece from her house in Mosul, where they were killed by an airstrike in June 2017. Iraq, September 2017. \u201cThe levels of violence and killing I witnessed while doing this work were beyond comprehension. During the two years I spent documenting the battle to defeat Isis and its aftermath in Iraq and Syria, I struggled to see the high cost of the war as anything but disastrous. In Mosul alone, the death toll was estimated to be more than 9,000 and vast tracts of the city were left in ruins. However, I also saw glimmers of hope for humanity amid the rubble-strewn aftermath. Meeting Nadhira was one of those moments.\u201d Based in the region since 2009, Ivor Prickett documented the Arab Spring uprisings in Egypt and Libya, working simultaneously on editorial assignments and his own long-term projects. Robin Rhode, born 1976 in South Africa, based in Berlin Series: Principle of Hope, 2017 \u201cUsing the street corner as my studio, the photographic work titled Principle of Hope is photographed against a ruined wall in a township in Johannesburg, \u2026 [which] remains a footprint of the segregated Apartheid era. Today, communities there are plagued by high levels of gangsterism, violence, poverty, drug abuse, unemployment, and with HIV Aids on an upward rise because of poor facilities and lack of education. The youths of this area are grappling with identity issues and a lack of self-worth, even after 20 years in a newly democratic post-Apartheid South Africa.\u201d Principle of Hope (Selected still 2), 2017 \u201cThese disenfranchised youths have become my studio assistants and collaborators in this unique art-making process. The walls are painted in brightly coloured palettes to trigger psychological perception and to embrace mathematics and geometry as an educative tool to assist in developing reason and logic in the minds of young people.\u201d The Berlin-based multidisciplinary artist engages in a variety of visual languages such as photography, performance, drawing and sculpture using materials such as soap, charcoal, chalk and paint. Awoiska van der Molen, born 1972 in the Netherlands, based in Amsterdam Series: Im schwarzen Himmelsrund, 2010-2018 \u201cWhen I came across the phrase \u2018Im schwarzen Himmelsrund\u2019 in the composer Gustav Mahler\u2019s Das Lied von der Erde, it immediately struck me as the perfect title for a selection of my photo works. Himmelsrund, which literally translates as the heavens\u2019 rim, was used in the middle ages to refer to the celestial firmament as a vaulted disc. This juxtaposition of the divine and the astronomic resonates with my process and my constant quest as a photographer, since my solitary journeys in nature resemble those of the classic pilgrim or anchorite. We share that sense of hope present in alchemist, spiritual and even Christian beliefs, a conviction that there must be a higher plane of existence to which humanity once had access, but with which it lost substantive contact.\u201d #384-16, 2013. \u201cSince the start of my artistic practice 16 years ago , my aim has always been to try to get as close as possible to some true, unspoilt core of a place.

Alexia Webster, born 1979 in South Africa, based in New York Series: Street Studios, 2011-2018 \u201cAll the years I was growing up, hanging in the hallway of my childhood home in South Africa was an old black-and-white photograph of my grandparents, my great uncles and my mother as a toddler, posing in a photographer\u2019s studio. They were recent economic migrants to South Africa from a small village on a little island in Greece. I would stare for hours at the photograph, my grandparents looking young and glamorous, dressed in their finest; at my three-year-old mother, sitting obediently with curls in her hair; at the studio painted backdrop of a misty romantic scene. Although they had just left their whole world behind in search of a better life, to me they looked like elegant characters from a tale my grandmother would tell. This family photograph, of all the images I have, is my most treasured.\u201d Charle Kahalalo escaped violent attacks in his village in Masisi and has been in living for a year in Bulengo IDP camp in Goma, DRC, 2014. \u201cFirst created in March 2011, the Street Studios project is a communal family photo album that began with the set-up of free outdoor photographic studios on more than 20 street corners and public spaces around the world. In each community we visited, we created public photo studio sets and invited any passing families and individuals to pose for a portrait. With thousands of photographs taken over almost an eight-year period, Street Studios is an archive of family and love, an archive that documents not what makes things fall apart but what keeps them together.\u201d Alexia Webster is a South African photographer and visual artist. Her work explores ideas of intimacy, family and identity across the African continent and beyond.",

The National Tertiary Education Union announced on Friday that it had withdrawn its action in the New South Wales supreme court over what it had described as the \u201cunlawful\u201d approval of the degree by the university late last year. It comes after the university took the unusual step last month of having its top governing body \u2013 the university council \u2013 approve the degree, despite it never being considered by its academic senate. In a statement on Friday the national president of the NTEU, Alison Barnes, claimed the university council\u2019s intervention was an admission there was \u201ca real case to answer in court\u201d. \u201cWe initiated the court action against the university because it didn\u2019t follow its normal procedures when it fast-tracked approval for the new course,\u201d she said. \u201cThe university bypassed its normal academic governance processes, which play a vital role in quality control and are fundamental to ensuring academic integrity and quality, and the council has done that again by making this decision.\u201d In December last year the university announced it had agreed to a $50m deal with the Ramsay Centre over the controversial degree.

William Hill, along with the other major chains, was allowed to suck billions of pounds from what were already deprived areas the length and breadth of Britain, when Labour\u2019s 2005 Gambling Act legitimised the gaming machines which they had been quietly introducing to their shops for some time.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: \u2018We are one people,\u2019 says Trump</h2> <p>Good morning all. This is Martin Farrer bringing you all the stories you need to know about this Friday morning.</p> <p>Donald Trump has given a tub-thumpingly jingoistic speech as the set-piece of his controversial<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/05/donald-trumps-july-4th-jamboree-symbolic-jingoistic-and-untraditional\"> \u201cSalute to America\u201d event to mark the 4th of July in Washington</a>. Despite concerns that the US president might politicise the independence day celebrations with a partisan address, he steered clear of his usual campaign-rally style and instead chose to run through a litany of American achievements with a heavy bias towards military prowess. Trump was accompanied by martial music, flypasts to flout aerial power and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/03/donald-trump-fourth-of-july-parade-speech-independence-day\">the much-promised armoured vehicles</a> in a ceremony costing the National Parks Service a reported $2.5m. \u201cWe are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny,\u201d he said in an appeal to national unity, which has been rare during his presidency. Code Pink, an antiwar protest group, staged a demonstration on the mall, complete with the \u201cTrump baby blimp\u201d balloon. But the large crowd gathered at the Lincoln memorial was supportive, many of them wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats and chanting \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d at any opportunity.</p> <p>However, history buffs pointed out that in his description of the 1775 war of independence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/05/flight-of-fancy-trump-claims-1775-revolutionary-army-took-over-airports\">Trump went a bit far in his claims of heroism by saying that the revolutionary army \u201ctook over the airports\u201d </a>from the British. You can also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2019/jul/05/we-will-plant-the-american-flag-on-mars-trump-delivers-july-4th-speech-video\">watch our video highlights </a>where Trump promises that Americans will plant the stars and stripes on Mars.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Tanker standoff \u2013 </strong>Iran has reacted angrily after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/04/royal-marines-gibraltar-tanker-oil-syria-eu-sanctions\">Royal Marines seized a tanker off the coast of Gibraltar </a>which was believed to be on its way to deliver oil to Syria. Marines from 42 Commando were lowered on to the ship by helicopter as it slowed down in the narrow waters leading into the Mediterranean. The ship\u2019s 28 mostly Indian crew were questioned on board by the Gibraltarian authorities. Amid heightened tensions between western powers and Iran, authorities in Tehran condemned the \u201cillegal interception\u201d of the 330m-long Grace 1 vessel. Iran summoned the British ambassador in protest but it is understood that Rob Macaire reiterated the government\u2019s position that it was enforcing the EU\u2019s sanctions regime against Syria.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p><strong>Emergency landing \u2013 </strong>A Virgin Atlantic plane bound from New York to Heathrow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/05/virgin-atlantic-flight-makes-emergency-landing-in-boston-after-fire-on-board\">was forced to make an emergency landing at Boston airport </a>last night after a fire broke out on board. Everyone on the Airbus A330 flight was evacuated safely. Police said they suspected that a faulty battery charger had sparked a blaze between two seats.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Party of remain\u2019 \u2013</strong> Tom Watson is stepping up pressure on Jeremy Corbyn by urging grassroots members to sign a public declaration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/04/tom-watson-urges-labour-members-to-sign-remain-declaration\">calling for Labour to be \u201cthe party of remain\u201d</a>. The Labour leader is being lobbied to adopt the anti-Brexit position his deputy believes is the only way the party can win the next election. \u201cAs the party of remain, we will not take every voter with us, but it\u2019s the only way that Labour can win, and the only way to keep our country together,\u201d Watson\u2019s petition says. On the other side of the political ledger, Boris Johnson claimed at a Tory hustings event last night that his extravagant spending plans could be funded in the event of no deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/04/boris-johnson-spending-plans-no-deal-brexit-york-hustings\">by using the \u00a339bn intended to be paid to the EU</a> on completion of an amicable exit.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Drug warning \u2013 </strong>Primary school children are being targeted for grooming, violence and exploitation by drug gangs, enslaving them into criminality in the notorious \u201ccounty lines\u201d system. A report by the Children\u2019s Society says the main age bracket for criminal exploitation of children is 14 to 17, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/05/children-as-young-as-seven-being-enslaved-by-uk-drug-gangs\">warns the age at which youngsters are being targeted for grooming is getting younger</a> and can be as young as seven. The criminal exploitation of younger children can easily be overlooked by agencies, the report says, so opportunities to protect under-10s can be missed.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Trees for life \u2013 </strong>Planting billions of trees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/04/planting-billions-trees-best-tackle-climate-crisis-scientists-canopy-emissions\">would be the most effective way to fight global warming</a>, according to scientists who say the new trees could suck up nearly 750bn tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Excluding existing farmland and urban areas, there are 1.7bn hectares of treeless land across the world \u2013 roughly the size of the United States and China combined. Study co-author Thomas Crowther said it was the cheapest solution and the most effective. \u201cIt is available now, it is the cheapest one possible and every one of us can get involved.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0808ab34ff6a7da0881196b7be68940be1badf56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0808ab34ff6a7da0881196b7be68940be1badf56/0_1397_3100_1860/1000.jpg\" alt=\"THE RESANDRO AMEN AN EGYPTIAN BROWN QUARTZITE HEAD OF THE GOD AMEN WITH THE FEATURES OF THE PHARAOH TUTANKHAMEN NEW KINGDOM, 18TH DYNASTY, REIGN OF TUTANKHAMEN, CIRCA 1333-1323 B.C., H: 28.5 cm\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Boom for bust \u2013 </strong>A sculpture of Tutankhamun <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/05/bust-of-tutankhamun-sold-at-auction-for-47m-despite-egypt-protests\">has been sold at auction for \u00a34.7m at Christie\u2019s in London </a>despite protests from Egypt.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018We are one people,\u2019 says Trump Good morning all. This is Martin Farrer bringing you all the stories you need to know about this Friday morning. Donald Trump has given a tub-thumpingly jingoistic speech as the set-piece of his controversial \u201cSalute to America\u201d event to mark the 4th of July in Washington. Despite concerns that the US president might politicise the independence day celebrations with a partisan address, he steered clear of his usual campaign-rally style and instead chose to run through a litany of American achievements with a heavy bias towards military prowess. Trump was accompanied by martial music, flypasts to flout aerial power and the much-promised armoured vehicles in a ceremony costing the National Parks Service a reported $2.5m. \u201cWe are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny,\u201d he said in an appeal to national unity, which has been rare during his presidency. Code Pink, an antiwar protest group, staged a demonstration on the mall, complete with the \u201cTrump baby blimp\u201d balloon. But the large crowd gathered at the Lincoln memorial was supportive, many of them wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats and chanting \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d at any opportunity. However, history buffs pointed out that in his description of the 1775 war of independence, Trump went a bit far in his claims of heroism by saying that the revolutionary army \u201ctook over the airports\u201d from the British. You can also watch our video highlights where Trump promises that Americans will plant the stars and stripes on Mars. * * * Tanker standoff \u2013 Iran has reacted angrily after Royal Marines seized a tanker off the coast of Gibraltar which was believed to be on its way to deliver oil to Syria. Marines from 42 Commando were lowered on to the ship by helicopter as it slowed down in the narrow waters leading into the Mediterranean. The ship\u2019s 28 mostly Indian crew were questioned on board by the Gibraltarian authorities. Amid heightened tensions between western powers and Iran, authorities in Tehran condemned the \u201cillegal interception\u201d of the 330m-long Grace 1 vessel. Iran summoned the British ambassador in protest but it is understood that Rob Macaire reiterated the government\u2019s position that it was enforcing the EU\u2019s sanctions regime against Syria. * * * Emergency landing \u2013 A Virgin Atlantic plane bound from New York to Heathrow was forced to make an emergency landing at Boston airport last night after a fire broke out on board. Everyone on the Airbus A330 flight was evacuated safely. Police said they suspected that a faulty battery charger had sparked a blaze between two seats. * * * \u2018Party of remain\u2019 \u2013 Tom Watson is stepping up pressure on Jeremy Corbyn by urging grassroots members to sign a public declaration calling for Labour to be \u201cthe party of remain\u201d. The Labour leader is being lobbied to adopt the anti-Brexit position his deputy believes is the only way the party can win the next election. \u201cAs the party of remain, we will not take every voter with us, but it\u2019s the only way that Labour can win, and the only way to keep our country together,\u201d Watson\u2019s petition says. On the other side of the political ledger, Boris Johnson claimed at a Tory hustings event last night that his extravagant spending plans could be funded in the event of no deal by using the \u00a339bn intended to be paid to the EU on completion of an amicable exit. * * * Drug warning \u2013 Primary school children are being targeted for grooming, violence and exploitation by drug gangs, enslaving them into criminality in the notorious \u201ccounty lines\u201d system. A report by the Children\u2019s Society says the main age bracket for criminal exploitation of children is 14 to 17, but warns the age at which youngsters are being targeted for grooming is getting younger and can be as young as seven. The criminal exploitation of younger children can easily be overlooked by agencies, the report says, so opportunities to protect under-10s can be missed. * * * Trees for life \u2013 Planting billions of trees would be the most effective way to fight global warming, according to scientists who say the new trees could suck up nearly 750bn tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Excluding existing farmland and urban areas, there are 1.7bn hectares of treeless land across the world \u2013 roughly the size of the United States and China combined. Study co-author Thomas Crowther said it was the cheapest solution and the most effective. \u201cIt is available now, it is the cheapest one possible and every one of us can get involved.\u201d * * * Boom for bust \u2013 A sculpture of Tutankhamun has been sold at auction for \u00a34.7m at Christie\u2019s in London despite protests from Egypt. The 3,000-year-old bust of brown quartzite depicts the young king as the god Amen and was sold to an anonymous private collector. But a small group of Egyptians gathered outside the auction house last night to protest their national heritage being sold like \u201cfruit and vegetables\u201d. A former Egyptian antiquities minister has alleged the bust was stolen from the temple of Karnak in the 1970s. Today in Focus podcast: Who owns England? It is a simple question with an incredibly complex answer \u2013 not even the Land Registry knows the exact ownership of all parts of the country. Guy Shrubsole set out to solve the mystery. Lunchtime read: I toke you to be my wife \u2013 the rise of weed weddings As the legalisation of marijuana spreads across the Unites States \u2013 currently 10 states and counting \u2013 a new industry has popped up in its wake: the weed wedding. An expo in Las Vegas in March brought together two dozen vendors promoting such products as CBD bath bombs, vintage vases repurposed as bongs and the inevitable space cakes. Many couples are taking advantage of the opening up of the laws, including 28-year-old Londoner Serena Baleja who encouraged guests to get stoned at her wedding to Jeff in Los Angeles last year. \u201cIt should be normalized completely,\u201d she says. Sport Nick Kyrgios discovered on Thursday evening that you provoke a champion at your peril as Rafael Nadal husbanded his controlled fury to win their second round encounter at Wimbledon. The controversial Australian admitted he aimed a shot at Nadal\u2019s chest during the match, which came after some unusual preparations in the Dog &amp; Fox pub. Elsewhere, it was just like old times as the Pimms flowed and cries of \u201cCome on Andy\u201d were heard on Murray Mound as Britain\u2019s greatest tennis player teamed up with Pierre-Hugues Herbert to win their first-round doubles match. There were also wins for Dan Evans and Harriet Dart but it was the end of the road for defending champion Angelique Kerber. Frank Lampard, the former Chelsea midfielder, has returned as manager with the express aim of making the club more competitive in the league. Tammy Beaumont hit her maiden Ashes hundred in a gloriously confident display but it was not enough for England to beat Australia in the second ODI of the series. Chris Froome\u2019s crash at the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 has opened up the Tour de France, which starts this weekend, and given other riders reason to believe in their chances. And England have unveiled their official Rugby World Cup jersey but the debate continues over exactly who will wear the new shirt in Japan. Business The Wolf of Wall Street producer Riza Aziz, who is the stepson of former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak, has been charged with embezzling millions of dollars from the Malaysian government\u2019s 1MDB investment fund by a court overnight. He is the third member of the family to face charges relating to corruption at the notorious fund. Asian markets and FTSE100 futures were quiet ahead of US jobs figures later today.

Trump made the mistake during his hour-long speech at the Lincoln memorial in Washington DC as part of his 4th of July \u201cSalute to America\u201d celebrations, which saw him become the first US president in nearly 70 years to address the country on Independence Day. In a departure from his usual style of rambling, impromptu speeches in which the president lurches between topics at high speed, Trump gave a surprisingly scripted address in which he outlined the history of Independence Day, American achievement in various fields, and then paid tribute to each branch of the military in turn. During his tribute to the army, Trump said: \u201cIn June of 1775, the Continental Congress created a unified army out of the revolutionary forces encamped around Boston and New York \u2026 The Continental Army suffered a bitter winter of Valley Forge, found glory across the waters of the Delaware, and seized victory from Cornwallis of Yorktown. \u201cOur army manned the air, it rammed the ramparts, it took over the airports, it did everything it had to do, and at Fort McHenry, under the rockets\u2019 red glare, it had nothing but victory.\u201d As listeners were quick to point out, air travel did not occur in the US until early in the 1900s.

Mark, a lifelong cannabis advocate whose stepfather went to prison for a weed-related offense, and Anna, \u201ca major, major insomniac\u201d with endometriosis who eats edibles to help her sleep, wanted to make a statement. \u201cIt was to celebrate freedom and sensible policy,\u201d Mark, 46, says. Each had previously been married and were tossing around ideas for an inconspicuous ceremony for themselves. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need a white wedding. We didn\u2019t want to do a typical Vegas wedding with Elvis in a drive-through,\u201d Mark, 46, says. Rather than bringing weed to their wedding, they brought their wedding to the weed, holding a ceremony inside The Grove\u2019s cultivation facility surrounded by hundreds of pot plants. What was initially supposed to be an under-the-radar event became internationally publicized, which is exactly what Mark had hoped for. Though Mark sported a bud in his suit pocket and Anna carried a bouquet with marijuana leaves, neither partook after the ceremony. \u201cWe wanted to make a statement about policy and people\u2019s rights,\u201d he says. Amanda and Kyle Recreational marijuana wasn\u2019t legal in Canada until a month after Amanda and Kyle tied the knot in Oshawa, Ontario, last September. That didn\u2019t prevent the couple from having a tasteful cannabis theme on their special day. Kyle, 36, has been a cannabis activist for 10 years. He credits the plant with helping him overcome depression and opioid abuse after an injury sidelined his hockey career. Many of the Amanda and Kyle\u2019s wedding guests were medical cardholders. Those with the legal right to do so were encouraged to bring their own cannabis to the reception, which featured a designated smoking section. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as if we had a budtender set up, as much as I would have liked to. We weren\u2019t there on the legal side and my wife\u2019s pretty conservative, so she didn\u2019t want to push the envelope too much,\u201d Kyle says. Though not everyone was consuming cannabis at the wedding, there was still a subtle presence, from the invitations to the seating arrangements, both of which prominently featured marijuana leaf graphics. Kyle sported a bud in his boutonni\u00e8re, and Amanda\u2019s maid of honor entered the reception with a joint in her mouth as the bridal party was introduced.",

Senior judges, junior ministers, permanent secretaries and diplomats are among the least representative professions. But the media, and particularly newspaper columnists, are right up there, too. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At issue here is not individuals but a system that rewards privilege and privileges the rich</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is a clear and undeniable link between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/06/leveson-murdoch-cameron-brooks-privilege\" title=\"\">entrenched and calcifying class stratification</a> in British society and the inept chaos in which we currently find ourselves. The gene puddle from which the elite siphons its ranks has become shallow and fetid. Those who make the laws in government, oversee the civil service that will implement them, adjudicate on them in court or assess them in newspapers, are drawn from such a narrow social layer that they might as well be the same person. Even when they do not form a majority, their critical mass is such that they set the tone, define the culture and shape the parameters for what is institutionally permissible.</p> <p>This was never healthy and always absurd. But recently it has become untenable. The prime minister who got us into this Brexit mess a few years back went to the same school and joined the same supper club at the same university as the person who will most likely be prime minister in a few weeks\u2019 time. Nobody thinks that is an uncanny coincidence. It\u2019s how Britain works. It\u2019s also why it\u2019s not working.</p> <p>\u201cThe country\u2019s model of leadership is disintegrating,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/12/22/the-elite-that-failed\" title=\"\">wrote the Economist</a>, not known for its Marxist tendencies, in December. \u201cBritain is governed by a self-involved clique that rewards group membership above competence and self-confidence above expertise.\u201d The overwhelming failure of integration in this country has nothing to do with Muslims or race \u2013 it\u2019s that those who are running it, governing it and commenting on it have such a limited experience of living in it the way that most do. The consequences of that dislocation are proving devastating.</p> <p>A brief caveat here to confront predictable straw men. Nobody should be blamed for being born rich or the school they go to \u2013 they had no say in it. Meanwhile, the handful of working-class people who make it to Oxbridge should be applauded for their achievement. At issue here is not individuals but a system that rewards privilege and privileges the rich \u2013 giving more opportunities, wealth and power to those who did not earn them, or have otherwise acquired them, while excluding others of access to resources.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/25/britain-ruled-private-educated-people-culture-deference\">Britain is still ruled by a privately educated elite. Let\u2019s end this culture of deference | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Class privilege is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/sunday/brexit-ireland-empire.html\" title=\"\">not new</a>. Between 1955 and 1964 all three British prime ministers went to Eton and Oxford. But several things have changed since then that make this persistent dominance of a tiny stratum particularly problematic. First of all, levels of income inequality have grown massively. According to the <a href=\"https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/about-us\" title=\"\">Equality Trust</a> thinktank, between 1938 and 1979 the share of income going to the top 10% <a href=\"https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/how-has-inequality-changed\" title=\"\">fell by 40%</a>, while that going to the bottom grew a little. After 1979 that trend reversed sharply and has now effectively stalled. Real wages have <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/economy/how-have-wages-changed/\" title=\"\">yet to catch up</a> with pre-crisis levels.</p> <p>So the oligarchic tendencies in our economy are being reinforced and amplified in our polity and broader culture. The people who have everything also run everything. The Tory frontrunner, Johnson, is not just a product of that system but an advocate for it. When we see him call for a massive tax cut for the rich, we see a candidate who has had much and wants more. When we see him guessing the minimum wage \u201c<a href=\"https://www.indy100.com/article/boris-johnson-conservative-leadership-national-living-wage-sky-interview-8982126\" title=\"\">at or around \u00a310</a>\u201d when it is in fact \u00a38.21 we see a candidate who knows nothing about those who have little and has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/14/response-to-grenfell-windrush\" title=\"\">no interest in learning</a>. (Imagine what would have happened to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/02/boris-johnson-white-privilege-black-woman\" title=\"\">Diane Abbott</a> had she made a mistake like that.)</p> <p>Second, their increasingly desperate efforts to preserve their grip on power are having increasingly extreme consequences. We are in a period of extended crisis and division, largely brought about by financial elites whose reckless behaviour was first enabled and indulged, and then forgiven and written off, by political elites. It is highly unlikely that the imaginative and radical responses we need to turn this around are going to come from those same elites.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a45a7f077b7df8bd33867c9ccd496e52ec2eb3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a45a7f077b7df8bd33867c9ccd496e52ec2eb3f/0_195_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson during a tour of the RHS garden in Wisley, Surrey, on 25 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson during a tour of the RHS garden in Wisley, Surrey, on 25 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brexit is simply the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/brexit-disaster-decades-in-the-making\" title=\"\">clearest manifestation</a> of these crises.

His opponent is just hopeless. The question of how long either will last in the top job is debatable.</p> <p>Throughout this time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/13/election-tories-media-broadcasters-press-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">media elites</a>, drawn from the same class as their financial and political counterparts, have mostly been obsessed by the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/corbynism-is-rotting-from-the-head-down-9mg2qm7nm\" title=\"\">crisis in leadership</a> in an ostensibly \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/doom-merchants-corbyn-viable-leader-labour\" title=\"\">unelectable</a>\u201d Labour party, which has had the same leader for four years \u2013 and gained seats and vote share in the last general election. Those media elites have called pretty much <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/journalists-brazen-dismissal-of-corbyn-was-professional-malpractice\" title=\"\">every major political event</a>, from Brexit to the last two elections, <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/06/why-political-journalism-keeps-getting-it-wrong\" title=\"\">incorrectly</a>.</p> <p>The point here is not about Jeremy Corbyn or partisanship \u2013 though it could be \u2013 but perspective and proportionality. One of the reasons why British politics is so difficult to understand at present is that most of those critiquing it are so deeply embedded and implicated in the world they are critiquing, they just can\u2019t see straight. Which leads to the final point. Since the war Britain has come to think of itself as far more meritocratic. The current situation gives the lie to that illusion. If you think Johnson is the best person for the top job then you either know nothing about the job or you know nothing about him.</p> <p>At Eton, notes James Wood in the London Review of Books, they were taught to impose themselves on the world with \u201ceffortless superiority\u201d. But these people fall short too often. The trouble is they keep failing upwards \u2013 constantly given the benefit of the doubt, leaving them with the benefits and the rest of us with the doubts.</p> <p>\u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last week Boris Johnson delivered a speech to a Royal Horticultural Society audience in Wisley, Surrey, before heading to the affluent village of Oxshott to buy some fennel and tarragon sausages and have a cup of tea in the Munch and Wiggles cafe. In a series of interviews later that day, he was unwilling to reveal the provenance of the staged photograph of him and his partner, Carrie Symonds. He was, however, able to insist that Britain would leave the European Union, \u201cdo or die\u201d, by the end of October. On the same day, the Sutton Trust and the Social Mobility Commission issued a report into elitism in Britain that \u201cpaints a picture of a country whose power structures are dominated by a narrow section of the population [where] social mobility is low and not improving\u201d. Those who went to private school comprise 7% of the country\u2019s population but 39% of the elite; those who went to Oxford or Cambridge university comprise less than 1% of the population but 24% of the elite. Senior judges, junior ministers, permanent secretaries and diplomats are among the least representative professions. But the media, and particularly newspaper columnists, are right up there, too. There is a clear and undeniable link between the entrenched and calcifying class stratification in British society and the inept chaos in which we currently find ourselves. The gene puddle from which the elite siphons its ranks has become shallow and fetid. Those who make the laws in government, oversee the civil service that will implement them, adjudicate on them in court or assess them in newspapers, are drawn from such a narrow social layer that they might as well be the same person. Even when they do not form a majority, their critical mass is such that they set the tone, define the culture and shape the parameters for what is institutionally permissible. This was never healthy and always absurd. But recently it has become untenable. The prime minister who got us into this Brexit mess a few years back went to the same school and joined the same supper club at the same university as the person who will most likely be prime minister in a few weeks\u2019 time. Nobody thinks that is an uncanny coincidence. It\u2019s how Britain works. It\u2019s also why it\u2019s not working. \u201cThe country\u2019s model of leadership is disintegrating,\u201d wrote the Economist, not known for its Marxist tendencies, in December. \u201cBritain is governed by a self-involved clique that rewards group membership above competence and self-confidence above expertise.\u201d The overwhelming failure of integration in this country has nothing to do with Muslims or race \u2013 it\u2019s that those who are running it, governing it and commenting on it have such a limited experience of living in it the way that most do. The consequences of that dislocation are proving devastating. A brief caveat here to confront predictable straw men. Nobody should be blamed for being born rich or the school they go to \u2013 they had no say in it. Meanwhile, the handful of working-class people who make it to Oxbridge should be applauded for their achievement. At issue here is not individuals but a system that rewards privilege and privileges the rich \u2013 giving more opportunities, wealth and power to those who did not earn them, or have otherwise acquired them, while excluding others of access to resources. Class privilege is not new. Between 1955 and 1964 all three British prime ministers went to Eton and Oxford. But several things have changed since then that make this persistent dominance of a tiny stratum particularly problematic. First of all, levels of income inequality have grown massively. According to the Equality Trust thinktank, between 1938 and 1979 the share of income going to the top 10% fell by 40%, while that going to the bottom grew a little. After 1979 that trend reversed sharply and has now effectively stalled. Real wages have yet to catch up with pre-crisis levels. So the oligarchic tendencies in our economy are being reinforced and amplified in our polity and broader culture. The people who have everything also run everything. The Tory frontrunner, Johnson, is not just a product of that system but an advocate for it. When we see him call for a massive tax cut for the rich, we see a candidate who has had much and wants more. When we see him guessing the minimum wage \u201cat or around \u00a310\u201d when it is in fact \u00a38.21 we see a candidate who knows nothing about those who have little and has no interest in learning. (Imagine what would have happened to Diane Abbott had she made a mistake like that.) Second, their increasingly desperate efforts to preserve their grip on power are having increasingly extreme consequences. We are in a period of extended crisis and division, largely brought about by financial elites whose reckless behaviour was first enabled and indulged, and then forgiven and written off, by political elites. It is highly unlikely that the imaginative and radical responses we need to turn this around are going to come from those same elites. Brexit is simply the clearest manifestation of these crises. The race for Tory leader is the clearest illustration of how ill-equipped we are to deal with them. This party has won an outright majority just once in the last six elections and is about to elect its third leader in three years. The runaway favourite is an unrepentant race-baiter, liar, philanderer and opportunist, liked least by those who know him best. His opponent is just hopeless. The question of how long either will last in the top job is debatable. Throughout this time media elites, drawn from the same class as their financial and political counterparts, have mostly been obsessed by the crisis in leadership in an ostensibly \u201cunelectable\u201d Labour party, which has had the same leader for four years \u2013 and gained seats and vote share in the last general election. Those media elites have called pretty much every major political event, from Brexit to the last two elections, incorrectly. The point here is not about Jeremy Corbyn or partisanship \u2013 though it could be \u2013 but perspective and proportionality. One of the reasons why British politics is so difficult to understand at present is that most of those critiquing it are so deeply embedded and implicated in the world they are critiquing, they just can\u2019t see straight. Which leads to the final point. Since the war Britain has come to think of itself as far more meritocratic. The current situation gives the lie to that illusion. If you think Johnson is the best person for the top job then you either know nothing about the job or you know nothing about him. At Eton, notes James Wood in the London Review of Books, they were taught to impose themselves on the world with \u201ceffortless superiority\u201d. But these people fall short too often. The trouble is they keep failing upwards \u2013 constantly given the benefit of the doubt, leaving them with the benefits and the rest of us with the doubts. \u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>An imperious blond German ex-model with a voice once described as like \u201ca body falling through a window\u201d, Nico was already extraordinary by the time she leant her vocals to songs including Femme Fatale and All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties on the Velvet Underground\u2019s classic first album, produced by Andy Warhol.</p> <p>Soon after that, she embarked on a solo career, and made records, such as The Marble Index, that were even darker, with despairing lyrics and a wheezing harmonium accompanying Nico\u2019s Teutonic tones. By this time, she was no longer blond \u2013 she disdained her traffic-stopping looks \u2013 and was addicted to heroin.</p> <p>Music and drugs led her to Manchester, where she lived for much of the 80s. As a new show about her, The Nico Project, comes to the Manchester international festival, the Guardian spoke to some of the people who found themselves working and hanging out with a cultural icon.</p> <p><strong>Nigel Bagley (co-manager, promoter):</strong> We were booking artists for the Rafters nightclub in Manchester in 1981 when I got a call from an agency telling me that Nico was in a pub in London, was a mess and was borrowing money off everyone. The person said: \u201cYou can book her, but I\u2019ve no idea if she will turn up.\u201d I\u2019d had the Kevin Ayers, John Cale, Brian Eno and Nico June 1, 1974 <a href=\"https://ultimateclassicrock.com/ayers-cale-nico-eno-june-1-1974/\" title=\"\">live album</a> since I was 12, which led me to <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-velvet-underground-and-nico-10-things-you-didnt-know-109041/\" title=\"\">The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</a>, so it was a chance to put on my childhood heroine. I booked her for \u00a3200. Then the agency called back, asking: \u201cCan you get her some heroin?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Phil Jones (co-manager, promoter):</strong> She turned up with her harmonium. Her arms were horrible, but otherwise she didn\u2019t look as if she\u2019d been taking heroin for years. We realised what an icon she was later when we put her on in London and Siouxsie [Sioux], Duran Duran and all these film stars turned up. At that first Rafters gig, New Order, Tony Wilson and the Factory Records lot were on the guest list. She sang Femme Fatale, All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties and I\u2019m Waiting for the Man. Alan Wise [her manager] was enthralled. She had nowhere to stay and he said: \u201cWe can\u2019t just let her go.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Nigel Bagley:</strong> We put her up in a Polish B&amp;B. She put a \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign on the door and was there for three weeks.</p> <p><strong>Phil Jones:</strong> She needed to perform to get money for drugs, and the next thing we knew, Wise had bamboozled her into letting us co-manage her. A Polish ex-servicemen\u2019s club gave her a room for a while. She moved into people\u2019s houses because they liked the idea of having Nico in the spare room, but then they would say the kids were scared of her, so she got a flat in Sedgeley Park in Prestwich. We hooked her up with musicians, and Manchester was her home for years.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMjnaaAPyBc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BMjnaaAPyBc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Martin Bramah (guitarist):</strong> I think she was aware that there was a scene \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/24/joy-division-this-searing-light-extract-ian-curtis-jon-savage\" title=\"\">Joy Division</a>, dark music \u2013 or maybe she just liked the cheap heroin. When we were on the road, there was a lot of waiting around unsavoury parts of town \u2013 she would post letters full of heroin to herself at the next hotel \u2013 whereas in Manchester, she had a dealer. But she didn\u2019t see the grubby, industrial city I grew up in. She\u2019d gaze at the Victorian architecture and say: \u201cThis is so romantic.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Phil Jones:</strong> She liked the fact that she was a bit of celeb, and people were a bit in awe of her \u2013 Tony Wilson called her \u201cma\u2019am\u201d \u2013 but she also really liked normality. On Sunday nights, we would go to the Kwok Man in Chinatown for a Chinese meal. Alan took her to meet his family at Christmas. She liked the pubs in Prestwich, where she could play pool and be anonymous.</p> <p><strong>Richard Hector-Jones (bystander):</strong> I saw her being searched by police in <a href=\"http://pubs-of-manchester.blogspot.com/2011/08/spinners-arms-robert-adam-crescent.html\" title=\"\">the Spinners Arms \u2013</a> a then-notorious pub in Hulme. My friend whispered: \u201cThat\u2019s Nico,\u201d and I was thinking: \u201cWhat the fuck is a star from the Velvet Underground doing in this shit-hole?\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u201cSpider\u201d Mike King (guitarist):</strong> She was a true bohemian. Her whole world was in a holdall: a change of underwear and a blouse.</p> <p><strong>Jane Goldstraw (friend):</strong> I think sometimes she just craved to be herself, and she could be that with me because I didn\u2019t want anything from her \u2013 I didn\u2019t take drugs. She loved my soup. We\u2019d watch a film or sing; I would play piano. She rode her bicycle around Manchester, and we\u2019d take my dog and kids, and walk across the moors. I think she was very lonely, but so was I.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"06934f62e940c145207239518f8cbae64f0f5240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06934f62e940c145207239518f8cbae64f0f5240/0_567_3367_4207/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018She liked the fact that she was a bit of a celeb.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018She liked the fact that she was a bit of a celeb.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Noble/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Nigel Bagley:</strong> She didn\u2019t really socialise with the Manchester glitterati or hang out in clubs. Hooky [Peter Hook from New Order] would occasionally turn up. Later, she shared a flat with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/oct/28/john-cooper-clarke-my-trousers-river-island-or-ms-the-skinniest-they-do\" title=\"\">John Cooper Clarke</a> in London, but her heroes were from a previous generation; the Bob Dylans and so on. She once asked me round for dinner, and there was this bizarre scene of Nico cooking couscous with one hand and cooking up heroin with the other. I was thinking: \u201cI hope she doesn\u2019t mix them up.\u201d She has such a dark image, but there was so much funny stuff, and she was wonderfully deadpan. We met the film director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/08/john-waters-homotopia-festival-liverpool-manson-murders\" title=\"\">John Waters</a> who asked if she would sing at his funeral. She said: \u201cCall me when you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Una Baines (keyboards):</strong> She OD\u2019d on a ferry between the Hook of Holland and Harwich, and was read the last rites. Afterwards, we were all searched by customs and Nico just sat there, cool as a cucumber. They didn\u2019t find anything, and she said: \u201cDid you see how I hypnotised the dog?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Jane Goldstraw:</strong> She loved to shock. We\u2019d go to the local shops and she\u2019d go: \u201cThis is Jane, my girlfriend\u201d \u2013 which I wasn\u2019t \u2013 \u201cI love her\u201d. And, of course, this being the 1980s, people\u2019s jaws would drop.</p> <p><strong>Graham \u201cDids\u201d Dowdall (drums):</strong> She was very matter-of-fact, very down to earth: \u201cLet\u2019s just do this.\u201d At my first rehearsal, the microphone didn\u2019t work, so she sang without one and every hair on my neck stood on end.</p> <p><strong>Una Baines:</strong> She let me sound-check her Indian pump organ. Patti Smith bought it for her. You were with her, learning songs like David Bowie\u2019s Heroes, thinking: \u201cIs this real?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Martin Bramah:</strong> In the car, she would get herself nicely stoned and reminisce about her lovers \u2013 Bob Dylan, Brian Jones, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, Jim Morrison. She knew it enthralled people. Lovely, romantic tales.</p> <p><strong>Mike King:</strong> I think the relationship with Alain Delon [with whom she had a son, Ari, in 1962] had caused her a lot of pain. She carried with her the separation from these worlds.</p> <p><strong>James Young (keyboards):</strong> When she was withdrawing [from heroin], she would become very angry. So there was a lot of anger being suppressed.</p> <p><strong>Phil Jones:</strong> If she wasn\u2019t taking heroin, she started feeling things, and she couldn\u2019t cope with that because she didn\u2019t know where it would go.</p> <p><strong>James Young:</strong> There was a sea of darkness there. She was born [Christa P\u00e4ffgen] in the Nazi period [in 1938], evacuated to her grandfather\u2019s house [on the outskirts of Berlin] and saw Berlin in flames. And the guilt of being German after Hitler, and having to do things she didn\u2019t want to do to escape. She was an alpha female. It took guts as a teenager to go to Paris and seek out the right circles in the postwar ruins of Europe. When she was modelling for Chanel, she was given amphetamines to stay thin \u2013 that was legal then \u2013 and it normalised drug-taking.</p> <p><strong>Nigel Bagley:</strong> I once asked her why she took heroin. She said: \u201cWell, if I was a drunk, I\u2019d be fat.\u201d In the early years, making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/17/features.worldcinema\" title=\"\">La Dolce Vita</a> with Fellini and everything else, she was the equivalent of today\u2019s reality TV stars: thrust into fame and voted one of the 10 most beautiful women in the world. Then she was a superstar with Andy Warhol in New York, and drugs were around.</p> <p><strong>James Young:</strong> She said: \u201cThe bad thoughts come when I don\u2019t have smack.\u201d She once told me she had been raped as a teenager. People cast doubt on her stories, but why would you make that up?</p> <p><strong>Jane Goldstraw:</strong> She told me that, when she was three years old during the war, she lived on a farm near a death camp, and she remembered treading over bodies. But there are conflicting stories. She was quite an overpowering woman if you let her be one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"07a8a8e804dc4e27f9ab7acdde99bdfaa504bc0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07a8a8e804dc4e27f9ab7acdde99bdfaa504bc0d/0_151_4838_2903/1000.jpg\" alt=\"She said: \u2018The bad thoughts come when I don\u2019t have smack.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">She said: \u2018The bad thoughts come when I don\u2019t have smack.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Noble/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Nigel Bagley:</strong> At one gig, she introduced Deutschland \u00fcber Alles, saying: \u201cMy father was a homosexual and died in a concentration camp.\u201d And, of course, the audience was in floods of tears. The backstory was part of the performance, and it kept changing.</p> <p><strong>Phil Jones:</strong> If she told you something personally, it tended to be true. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/17/reel-history-oliver-stone-the-doors\" title=\"\">Oliver Stone\u2019s Doors film,</a> there\u2019s a scene where she gives Jim Morrison a blowjob in a lift. She would have been really affronted by that. She\u2019d read this sort of thing in books and told me: \u201cThat never fucking happened.\u201d She never was a femme fatale. She just got hit on a lot by very famous people. I think she was abused along the way. She told me five times: \u201cJim Morrison was the only man I ever loved.\u201d She carried resentments, but she must have done something right because she assured her status while in the Velvet Underground and then created an idiosyncratic canon that was unlike anything else in music.</p> <p><strong>James Young:</strong> She found her artistic direction with [1968\u2019s] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/oct/14/difficult-albums-nico\" title=\"\">The Marble Index</a>. <a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/current/top-10-lists/62-paul-morrissey-s-top-10\" title=\"\">Paul Morrissey</a> [a Warhol collaborator] concluded that taking heroin and wearing black clothes was a renunciation of the world, so she could concentrate on being an artist, almost like a nun would do. Black on black, motorcycle boots, pre-goth, badass.</p> <p><strong>Una Baines:</strong> I don\u2019t think she\u2019d have labelled herself a feminist because she hated any form of ideology. She did say her only regret was not being born a man. I think she wanted the same privileges and power that men have. She felt people were only interested in her looks. She wanted something more substantial. She wrote songs in her second language. She was fluent in seven. <a href=\"https://genius.com/Nico-no-one-is-there-lyrics\" title=\"\">The song No One is There</a> was about Nixon. It\u2019s superbly written. She is still not appreciated for her talent.</p> <p><strong>Nigel Bagley:</strong> There are so many stories about her. The ones about racism \u2026 we never saw that in Manchester. She was in a multicultural city and was good friends with Yankee Bill, our American-Jamaican doorman.</p> <p><strong>Graham Dowdall:</strong> She played an Indian instrument, worked with north Africans, and brought that to her music. She was certainly capable of very casual racism about Alan [Wise], who was Jewish, but that was a way of having a go at Al. Their relationship was among the most complex I\u2019ve encountered. They were interdependent. He loved Nico, but it was unrequited.</p> <p><strong>Phil Jones:</strong> She laughed at herself and the absurdity of it all. She\u2019d say: \u201cHow did I get here?\u201d and I\u2019d say: \u201cNico, you turned up for that gig, and you\u2019re still here. And Alan is running your life.\u201d And she\u2019d say: \u201cI hate him!\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD9dZJFcrMI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TD9dZJFcrMI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Nigel Bagley:</strong> The regret is that she didn\u2019t make more music in Manchester. She had signed some messy deals which prevented her recording. She used to sing torch songs in the car. We put her in the studio with <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/joy-division-unknown-pleasures-martin-hannett-producer-2508983\" title=\"\">Martin Hannett</a>, who shared certain behavioural habits [a heroin addiction]. A single, Procession, worked well, and All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties on the B-side was sensational. So we gave her \u00a31,000 to do an album and she ran away to London. It turned out that she didn\u2019t have any songs, but didn\u2019t want to admit it. Like John Cooper Clarke, heroin stopped her writing.</p> <p><strong>Jane Goldstraw:</strong> I don\u2019t think she was interested in the local music scene. When the Ha\u00e7ienda audience were noisy, she just screamed in this piercing voice: \u201cShut up! You are so rude! When you are quiet, I\u2019ll carry on.\u201d And there was silence. She could do that.</p> <p><strong>John Keenan (promoter):</strong> The last time I put her on, she was in her leather trousers, and asked: \u201cWhy don\u2019t more people see me?

      "bodyText": "An imperious blond German ex-model with a voice once described as like \u201ca body falling through a window\u201d, Nico was already extraordinary by the time she leant her vocals to songs including Femme Fatale and All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties on the Velvet Underground\u2019s classic first album, produced by Andy Warhol. Soon after that, she embarked on a solo career, and made records, such as The Marble Index, that were even darker, with despairing lyrics and a wheezing harmonium accompanying Nico\u2019s Teutonic tones. By this time, she was no longer blond \u2013 she disdained her traffic-stopping looks \u2013 and was addicted to heroin. Music and drugs led her to Manchester, where she lived for much of the 80s. As a new show about her, The Nico Project, comes to the Manchester international festival, the Guardian spoke to some of the people who found themselves working and hanging out with a cultural icon. Nigel Bagley (co-manager, promoter): We were booking artists for the Rafters nightclub in Manchester in 1981 when I got a call from an agency telling me that Nico was in a pub in London, was a mess and was borrowing money off everyone. The person said: \u201cYou can book her, but I\u2019ve no idea if she will turn up.\u201d I\u2019d had the Kevin Ayers, John Cale, Brian Eno and Nico June 1, 1974 live album since I was 12, which led me to The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico, so it was a chance to put on my childhood heroine. I booked her for \u00a3200. Then the agency called back, asking: \u201cCan you get her some heroin?\u201d Phil Jones (co-manager, promoter): She turned up with her harmonium. Her arms were horrible, but otherwise she didn\u2019t look as if she\u2019d been taking heroin for years. We realised what an icon she was later when we put her on in London and Siouxsie [Sioux], Duran Duran and all these film stars turned up. At that first Rafters gig, New Order, Tony Wilson and the Factory Records lot were on the guest list. She sang Femme Fatale, All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties and I\u2019m Waiting for the Man. Alan Wise [her manager] was enthralled. She had nowhere to stay and he said: \u201cWe can\u2019t just let her go.\u201d Nigel Bagley: We put her up in a Polish B&amp;B. She put a \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign on the door and was there for three weeks. Phil Jones: She needed to perform to get money for drugs, and the next thing we knew, Wise had bamboozled her into letting us co-manage her. A Polish ex-servicemen\u2019s club gave her a room for a while. She moved into people\u2019s houses because they liked the idea of having Nico in the spare room, but then they would say the kids were scared of her, so she got a flat in Sedgeley Park in Prestwich. We hooked her up with musicians, and Manchester was her home for years. Martin Bramah (guitarist): I think she was aware that there was a scene \u2013 Joy Division, dark music \u2013 or maybe she just liked the cheap heroin. When we were on the road, there was a lot of waiting around unsavoury parts of town \u2013 she would post letters full of heroin to herself at the next hotel \u2013 whereas in Manchester, she had a dealer. But she didn\u2019t see the grubby, industrial city I grew up in. She\u2019d gaze at the Victorian architecture and say: \u201cThis is so romantic.\u201d Phil Jones: She liked the fact that she was a bit of celeb, and people were a bit in awe of her \u2013 Tony Wilson called her \u201cma\u2019am\u201d \u2013 but she also really liked normality. On Sunday nights, we would go to the Kwok Man in Chinatown for a Chinese meal. Alan took her to meet his family at Christmas. She liked the pubs in Prestwich, where she could play pool and be anonymous. Richard Hector-Jones (bystander): I saw her being searched by police in the Spinners Arms \u2013 a then-notorious pub in Hulme. My friend whispered: \u201cThat\u2019s Nico,\u201d and I was thinking: \u201cWhat the fuck is a star from the Velvet Underground doing in this shit-hole?\u201d \u201cSpider\u201d Mike King (guitarist): She was a true bohemian. Her whole world was in a holdall: a change of underwear and a blouse. Jane Goldstraw (friend): I think sometimes she just craved to be herself, and she could be that with me because I didn\u2019t want anything from her \u2013 I didn\u2019t take drugs. She loved my soup. We\u2019d watch a film or sing; I would play piano. She rode her bicycle around Manchester, and we\u2019d take my dog and kids, and walk across the moors. I think she was very lonely, but so was I. Nigel Bagley: She didn\u2019t really socialise with the Manchester glitterati or hang out in clubs. Hooky [Peter Hook from New Order] would occasionally turn up. Later, she shared a flat with John Cooper Clarke in London, but her heroes were from a previous generation; the Bob Dylans and so on. She once asked me round for dinner, and there was this bizarre scene of Nico cooking couscous with one hand and cooking up heroin with the other. I was thinking: \u201cI hope she doesn\u2019t mix them up.\u201d She has such a dark image, but there was so much funny stuff, and she was wonderfully deadpan. We met the film director John Waters who asked if she would sing at his funeral. She said: \u201cCall me when you\u2019re dead.\u201d Una Baines (keyboards): She OD\u2019d on a ferry between the Hook of Holland and Harwich, and was read the last rites. Afterwards, we were all searched by customs and Nico just sat there, cool as a cucumber. They didn\u2019t find anything, and she said: \u201cDid you see how I hypnotised the dog?\u201d Jane Goldstraw: She loved to shock. We\u2019d go to the local shops and she\u2019d go: \u201cThis is Jane, my girlfriend\u201d \u2013 which I wasn\u2019t \u2013 \u201cI love her\u201d. And, of course, this being the 1980s, people\u2019s jaws would drop. Graham \u201cDids\u201d Dowdall (drums): She was very matter-of-fact, very down to earth: \u201cLet\u2019s just do this.\u201d At my first rehearsal, the microphone didn\u2019t work, so she sang without one and every hair on my neck stood on end. Una Baines: She let me sound-check her Indian pump organ. Patti Smith bought it for her. You were with her, learning songs like David Bowie\u2019s Heroes, thinking: \u201cIs this real?\u201d Martin Bramah: In the car, she would get herself nicely stoned and reminisce about her lovers \u2013 Bob Dylan, Brian Jones, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, Jim Morrison. She knew it enthralled people. Lovely, romantic tales. Mike King: I think the relationship with Alain Delon [with whom she had a son, Ari, in 1962] had caused her a lot of pain. She carried with her the separation from these worlds. James Young (keyboards): When she was withdrawing [from heroin], she would become very angry. So there was a lot of anger being suppressed. Phil Jones: If she wasn\u2019t taking heroin, she started feeling things, and she couldn\u2019t cope with that because she didn\u2019t know where it would go. James Young: There was a sea of darkness there. She was born [Christa P\u00e4ffgen] in the Nazi period [in 1938], evacuated to her grandfather\u2019s house [on the outskirts of Berlin] and saw Berlin in flames. And the guilt of being German after Hitler, and having to do things she didn\u2019t want to do to escape. She was an alpha female. It took guts as a teenager to go to Paris and seek out the right circles in the postwar ruins of Europe. When she was modelling for Chanel, she was given amphetamines to stay thin \u2013 that was legal then \u2013 and it normalised drug-taking. Nigel Bagley: I once asked her why she took heroin. She said: \u201cWell, if I was a drunk, I\u2019d be fat.\u201d In the early years, making La Dolce Vita with Fellini and everything else, she was the equivalent of today\u2019s reality TV stars: thrust into fame and voted one of the 10 most beautiful women in the world. Then she was a superstar with Andy Warhol in New York, and drugs were around. James Young: She said: \u201cThe bad thoughts come when I don\u2019t have smack.\u201d She once told me she had been raped as a teenager. People cast doubt on her stories, but why would you make that up? Jane Goldstraw: She told me that, when she was three years old during the war, she lived on a farm near a death camp, and she remembered treading over bodies. But there are conflicting stories. She was quite an overpowering woman if you let her be one. Nigel Bagley: At one gig, she introduced Deutschland \u00fcber Alles, saying: \u201cMy father was a homosexual and died in a concentration camp.\u201d And, of course, the audience was in floods of tears. The backstory was part of the performance, and it kept changing. Phil Jones: If she told you something personally, it tended to be true. In Oliver Stone\u2019s Doors film, there\u2019s a scene where she gives Jim Morrison a blowjob in a lift. She would have been really affronted by that. She\u2019d read this sort of thing in books and told me: \u201cThat never fucking happened.\u201d She never was a femme fatale. She just got hit on a lot by very famous people. I think she was abused along the way. She told me five times: \u201cJim Morrison was the only man I ever loved.\u201d She carried resentments, but she must have done something right because she assured her status while in the Velvet Underground and then created an idiosyncratic canon that was unlike anything else in music. James Young: She found her artistic direction with [1968\u2019s] The Marble Index. Paul Morrissey [a Warhol collaborator] concluded that taking heroin and wearing black clothes was a renunciation of the world, so she could concentrate on being an artist, almost like a nun would do. Black on black, motorcycle boots, pre-goth, badass. Una Baines: I don\u2019t think she\u2019d have labelled herself a feminist because she hated any form of ideology. She did say her only regret was not being born a man. I think she wanted the same privileges and power that men have. She felt people were only interested in her looks. She wanted something more substantial. She wrote songs in her second language. She was fluent in seven. The song No One is There was about Nixon. It\u2019s superbly written. She is still not appreciated for her talent. Nigel Bagley: There are so many stories about her. The ones about racism \u2026 we never saw that in Manchester. She was in a multicultural city and was good friends with Yankee Bill, our American-Jamaican doorman. Graham Dowdall: She played an Indian instrument, worked with north Africans, and brought that to her music. She was certainly capable of very casual racism about Alan [Wise], who was Jewish, but that was a way of having a go at Al. Their relationship was among the most complex I\u2019ve encountered. They were interdependent. He loved Nico, but it was unrequited. Phil Jones: She laughed at herself and the absurdity of it all. She\u2019d say: \u201cHow did I get here?\u201d and I\u2019d say: \u201cNico, you turned up for that gig, and you\u2019re still here. And Alan is running your life.\u201d And she\u2019d say: \u201cI hate him!\u201d Nigel Bagley: The regret is that she didn\u2019t make more music in Manchester. She had signed some messy deals which prevented her recording. She used to sing torch songs in the car. We put her in the studio with Martin Hannett, who shared certain behavioural habits [a heroin addiction]. A single, Procession, worked well, and All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties on the B-side was sensational. So we gave her \u00a31,000 to do an album and she ran away to London. It turned out that she didn\u2019t have any songs, but didn\u2019t want to admit it. Like John Cooper Clarke, heroin stopped her writing. Jane Goldstraw: I don\u2019t think she was interested in the local music scene. When the Ha\u00e7ienda audience were noisy, she just screamed in this piercing voice: \u201cShut up! You are so rude! When you are quiet, I\u2019ll carry on.\u201d And there was silence. She could do that. John Keenan (promoter): The last time I put her on, she was in her leather trousers, and asked: \u201cWhy don\u2019t more people see me? I will be dead soon.\u201d I think she thought that, at 49, she was through; that generation thought everyone was past it when they got to 50. Phil Jones: Al eventually persuaded her on to a methadone programme and we finally got her royalties for her \u2013 a lot of money. So she was able to come off drugs, decamp to Ibiza and live a normal life with her son. Then I saw the headline in Melody Maker: \u201cNico dead.\u201d I was hysterical. I didn\u2019t know I could be so upset. [She died in 1988 of a cerebral haemorrhage while riding a bicycle in Ibiza. She was 49.] Jane Goldstraw: It broke my heart. She liked to hold my hand. James Young: She was wonderful, maddening, beautiful, a monster, incredibly gifted and phenomenally lazy. Hugely contradictory. I learned more musically from her than anyone else. John Keenan: I overheard her being asked how she would like to be remembered. She deadpanned: \u201cBy a tombstone.\u201d Maxine Peake plays Nico in the Manchester international festival\u2019s The Nico Project at the Stoller Hall, Hunts Bank, Manchester, 10-13 July and 16-21 July.

They have to stop their haul looking suspicious, to cleanse it of any criminal taint, or face losing their hard-stolen cash.</p> <p>Money laundering, as this process is known, is notoriously difficult to uncover, investigate and prosecute. Occasionally, however, an insider breaks cover \u2013 someone such as Howard Wilkinson, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/19/whistleblower-reveals-more-players-in-178bn-danske-bank-scandal\" title=\"\">blew the whistle</a> on perhaps the largest money-laundering scheme in history, the movement of \u20ac200bn of suspect funds through the Estonian branch of Denmark\u2019s biggest bank between 2007 and 2015, most of it earned in the dodgier corners of the former Soviet Union, some perhaps belonging to Vladimir Putin himself.</p> <p>\u201cNo one really knows where this money went,\u201d Wilkinson, a former Danske Bank employee, told Denmark\u2019s parliament last year. Once the money had got into the global financial system, \u201cit was clean, it was free.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/aug/05/how-britain-get-away-with-stealing-millions-guide-podcast\">How Britain can help you get away with stealing millions: a five-step guide \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Britain\u2019s most famous money launderer is HSBC, thanks to its systematic cleansing of the earnings of the Latin American drug cartels over the second half of the last decade, for which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/11/hsbc-bank-us-money-laundering\" title=\"\">it was fined</a> $1.9bn by the US government in 2012. But that was a tiny operation compared to the Danske Bank scandal. If gathered together, the suspect funds moved through the bank\u2019s Estonian outpost could <em>buy</em> HSBC, with more than enough left over to buy Danske Bank too.</p> <p>The scandal has been big news in Denmark and Estonia, but barely grazed public consciousness in the UK. This is strange, because Britain played a key role. All of the owners of the bank accounts that first aroused Wilkinson\u2019s suspicions had their identity hidden behind corporate structures registered in the UK \u2013 including Lantana Trade LLP, the one that may have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/26/russian-millions-laundered-via-uk-firms-leaked-report-says\">connected to Putin</a>. That means this is not just a Russian, Estonian or Danish scandal, but something far closer to home. In November, Wilkinson told a European parliament committee that the countries hosting these companies are just as culpable. \u201cWorst of all is the United Kingdom,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/158442/TAX3%20Verbatim%2021%20November%202018_OR.pdf\" title=\"\">he said</a>. \u201cThe United Kingdom is an absolute disgrace.\u201d</p> <p>The British government is supposedly committed to tackling grand corruption and financial crime, yet Britain\u2019s involvement in this mega-scandal has never been mentioned in parliament, or been addressed by ministers. It is far from the first time that British companies have been involved in high-profile money-laundering. Among the characters who have used British shell companies to hide their money are Paul Manafort, disgraced former chairman of Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign, and Viktor Yanukovich, overthrown president of Ukraine, among thousands of lower-profile opportunists.</p> <p>It is increasingly hard to avoid the conclusion that Britain tolerates this kind of behaviour deliberately, because of the money it brings into to our economy.</p> <p>That being so, why should hardened criminals be the only ones getting rich off Britain\u2019s lax enforcement? Here\u2019s how you too can use British shell companies to cleanse your dirty money \u2013 in five easy steps.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f946c4365e8962e192e63348bf8f8ca67684f519\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f946c4365e8962e192e63348bf8f8ca67684f519/0_0_1181_1465/806.jpg\" alt=\"businessman on desert island dreaming of Big Ben/UK\" width=\"806\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Step 1: Forget what you think you know</strong></h2> <p>If you have ambitions to steal a lot of money, forget about using cash. Cash is cumbersome, risky and highly limiting. Even if Danske Bank had used the highest denomination banknotes available to it, that \u20ac200bn would have weighed 400 tonnes, an amount four times heavier than a blue whale. Just moving it would have been a serious logistical challenge, let alone hiding it. It would have been a magnet for thieves, and would have attracted some unwelcome questions at customs.</p> <p>If you want to commit significant financial crime, therefore, you need a bank account, because electronic cash weighs nothing, no matter how much of it there is. But that causes a new problem: the bank account will have your name on it, which will alert the authorities to your identity if they come looking.</p> <p>This is where shell companies come in. Without a company, you have to act in person, which means your involvement is obvious and overt: the bank account is in your name. But using a company to own that bank account is like robbing a house with gloves on \u2013 it leaves no fingerprints, as long as the company\u2019s ownership information is hidden from the authorities. This is why all sensible crooks do it.</p> <p>The next question is what jurisdiction you will choose to register your shell company in. If you Google \u201coffshore finance\u201d, you\u2019ll see photos of tropical islands with palm trees, white sands and turquoise waters. These represent the kind of jurisdictions \u2013 \u201csunny places for shady people\u201d \u2013 where we expect to find shell companies. For decades, places such as Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Gibraltar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/12/nevis-how-the-worlds-most-secretive-offshore-haven-refuses-to-clean-up\" title=\"\">and others</a> sold the companies that people hide behind when committing their crimes. But in recent years, the world has changed \u2013 those jurisdictions have been cajoled, bullied and persuaded to keep good records of company ownership, and to reveal those records when police officers come looking. They are no longer as useful as they used to be.</p> <p>So where is? This is where the UK comes in. When it comes to financial crime, Britain is your best friend.</p> <p>Here is the secret you need to know to get started in the shell company game: the British company registration system contains a giant loophole \u2013 the kind of loophole you can drive a billion euros through without touching the sides. That is why UK shell companies have enabled financial crime all over the world, from giant acts of kleptocratic plunder to sad and squalid frauds that rob pensioners of their retirement savings.</p> <p>So, step one: forget what you think you know about offshore finance. The true image associated with \u201cshell companies\u201d these days should not be an exotic island redolent of the sound of the sea and the smell of rum cocktails, but a damp-stained office block in an unfashionable London suburb, or a nondescript street in a northern city. If you want to set up in the money-laundering business, you don\u2019t need to move to the Caribbean: you\u2019d be far better off doing it from the comfort of your own home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c85dcef61deb9b977c1d1ff018654a714a1170b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c85dcef61deb9b977c1d1ff018654a714a1170b/88_177_2072_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leon Edler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"964\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Step 2: Set up a company</strong></h2> <p>The second step is easy, and involves creating a company on the Companies House website. Companies House maintains the UK\u2019s registry of corporate structures and publishes information on shareholders, directors, accounts, partners and so on, so anyone can check up on their bona fides.</p> <p>Setting up a company costs \u00a312 and takes less than 24 hours. According to the World Bank\u2019s annual Doing Business report, the UK is one of the easiest places anywhere to create a company, so you\u2019ll find the process pretty straightforward.</p> <p>This is another reason not to bother with places like the British Virgin Islands: setting up a company there will cost you \u00a31,000, and you\u2019ll have to go through an agent who will insist on checking your identity before doing business with you. Global agreements now require agents to verify their clients\u2019 identity, to conduct the same kind of \u201cdue diligence\u201d process demanded when opening a bank account. Almost all the traditional tax havens have been forced to comply with the rules, or face being blacklisted by the world\u2019s major economies.</p> <p>This means there are now few jurisdictions left where you can create a genuinely anonymous shell company \u2013 and those that remain look so dodgy that your company will practically scream \u201cBeware! Fraudster!\u201d to anyone you try to do business with.</p> <p>But Britain is an exception. While it has bullied the tax havens into checking up on their customers, Britain itself doesn\u2019t bother with all those tiresome and expensive \u201cdue diligence\u201d formalities. It is true that, while registering your company on the Companies House website, you will find that it asks for information such as your name and address. On the face of it, that might look worrying. If you have to declare your name and address, then how will your company successfully shield your identity when you engage in industrial-scale fraud?</p> <p>Do not be concerned, just read on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5664ef09e1caf0fda4af582aebfc09910d363ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5664ef09e1caf0fda4af582aebfc09910d363ca/76_44_1029_1023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leon Edler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"994\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Step 3: Make stuff up</strong></h2> <p>This third step may be the hardest to really take in, because it seems too simple. Since 2016, the UK government has made it compulsory for anyone setting up a company to name the individual who actually owns it: \u201cthe person with significant control\u201d, or PSC. Before this reform it was possible to own a company with another company and, if that company was not British, the actual owner could hide their identity.</p> <p>In theory, the introduction of the PSC rule should have prevented the use of a British shell company to anonymously commit financial crime. Don\u2019t worry though, because it didn\u2019t. Here is the secret: no one checks the accuracy of the information you provide when you register with Companies House. You can say pretty much anything and Companies House will accept it.</p> <p>So this is step three: when you\u2019re entering the information to create your company, make mistakes. Suspicious typos are everywhere once you start delving into the Companies House database. For instance, many money-laundering investigations involving the former USSR eventually bump against a Belgian-based dentist, whose signature adorns the accounts of hundreds, if not thousands, of different companies, including Lantana Trade LLP. When he was <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/janebradley/shell-companies-money-laundering-uk-paul-manafort\" title=\"\">tracked down</a> to his home address in Belgium last year, the dentist claimed that his signature had been forged and that he had no connection to the companies. Whoever was filing the documents was remarkably imaginative when it came to spelling his name. Every document filed with the UK registry has the same signature, but his name is spelt in at least eight different ways: Ali Moulaye, Alli Moulaye, Aly Moulaye, Ali Moyllae, Ali Moulae, Ali Moullaye, Aly Moullaye and, oddly, Ian Virel.</p> <p>With such boundless opportunities for creativity, why not have fun? Recently, while messing about on the Companies House website, I came across a PSC named Mr Xxx Stalin, who is apparently a Frenchman resident in east London. It is perhaps technically possible that Xxx is a genuine name given to Mr Stalin by eccentric parents \u2013 but, if so, such eccentric parents are remarkably widespread.</p> <p>Xxx Stalin led me to a PSC of a different company, who was named Mr Kwan Xxx, a Kazakh citizen, resident in Germany; then to Xxx Raven; to Miss Tracy Dean Xxx; to Jet Xxx; and finally to (their distant cousin?) Mr Xxxx Xxx. These rabbitholes are curiously engrossing, and before long I\u2019d found Mr Mmmmmmm Yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy, and Mr Mmmmmm Xxxxxxxxxxx (correspondence address: Mmmmmmm, Mmmmmm, Mmm, MMM), at which point I decided to stop.</p> <p>As trolling goes, it is quite funny, but the implications are also very serious, if you think about what companies are supposed to be for. Limited companies and partnerships have their liability for debts limited, which means that if they go bust, their investors are not personally bankrupted. It\u2019s a form of insurance \u2013 society as a whole is accepting responsibility for entrepreneurs\u2019 debts, because we want to encourage entrepreneurial behaviour. In return, entrepreneurs agree to publish details about their companies so we can all check what they are up to, and to make sure they\u2019re not abusing our trust.</p> <p>The whole point of the PSC registry was to stop fraudsters obscuring their identities behind shell companies, and yet, thanks to Companies House\u2019s failure to check the information provided to it and thus to enforce the rules, they are still doing so. How exactly could society find someone who gives their identity as Mr Xxxxxxxxxxx, and their address as the chorus of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTeg1txDv8w\" title=\"\">a Crash Test Dummies song</a>? </p> <p>Even when the company documents provide an actual name, rather than a random selection of letters, the information is often very hard to believe. For example, in September, Companies House registered Atlas Integrate Services LLP, which declared a PSC with a date of birth that showed her to be just two months old at the time. In her two months of life, she had not only found time to get started in business, but also apparently to get married, since she was listed as \u201cMrs\u201d. The LLP\u2019s incorporation document states: \u201cThis person holds the right, directly or indirectly, to appoint or remove a majority of the persons who are entitled to take part in the management of the LLP\u201d. It does not explain how exactly a babe in arms would achieve this.</p> <p>This is not a one-off. The anti-corruption campaign group Global Witness looked into PSCs last year, <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/pursuit-hidden-owners-behind-uk-companies/\" title=\"\">and found</a> 4,000 of them were under the age of two. One hadn\u2019t even been born yet. At the opposite end of the spectrum, its researchers found five individuals who each controlled more than 6,000 companies. There are more than 4m companies at Companies House, which is a very large haystack to hide needles in.</p> <p>You don\u2019t actually even need to list a person as your company\u2019s PSC. It\u2019s permissible to say that your company doesn\u2019t know who owns it (no, you\u2019re not misunderstanding; that just doesn\u2019t make sense), or simply to tie the system up in knots by listing multiple companies in multiple jurisdictions that no investigator without the time and resources of the FBI could ever properly check.</p> <p>This is why step three is such an important one in the five-step pathway to creating a British shell company. If you can invent enough information when filing company accounts, then the calculation that underpins the whole idea of a company goes out of the window: you gain the protection from legal action, without giving up anything in return. It\u2019s brilliant.</p> <p>But don\u2019t dive in just yet; there are two more steps to follow before you can be confident of doing it properly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4c880d9bcb79ab89c0335d15b4d2f5b1b266f89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4c880d9bcb79ab89c0335d15b4d2f5b1b266f89/0_0_1181_1181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leon Edler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Step 4: Lie \u2013 but do so cleverly</strong></h2> <p>Most of the daft examples earlier (Mmmmmmm, Mmmmmm, Mmm, MMM) would not be useful for committing fraud, since anyone looking at them can tell they\u2019re not serious. Cumberland Capital Ltd, however, was a different matter. It looked completely legitimate.</p> <p>It controlled a company called Tropical Trade, which, in October 2016, cold-called a 63-year-old retired postal worker in Wisconsin identified in court filings as \u201cMJ\u201d. On the phone, a salesman offered her an investment product, which \u2013 he said \u2013 would make returns of 81%. He chatted about his wife and family and came across as \u201ckind and trustworthy\u201d, MJ later told police. \u201cDuring two weeks in November of 2016, she allowed Tropical Trade to charge $34,500 on her Mastercard and Visa credit cards,\u201d the filing states. When she tried to get her money back, her emails and calls were ignored, and she never saw it again.</p> <p>She had fallen victim to the global epidemic of binary-options fraud. Binary options are a form of betting on the stock market that are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/dec/19/binary-options-is-this-the-end-for-binary-options-the-worlds-most-useless-financial-product\" title=\"\">now banned</a> in many countries \u2013 including Israel, where much of the industry was based \u2013 since fraudsters used the idea to fix odds, keep winnings and target the vulnerable. According to the FBI, taken as a whole, these fraudsters may have been fleecing their marks of up to $10bn a year.</p> <p>When US police came looking for the people behind Cumberland Capital Ltd, they searched the Companies House website and found that its director was an Australian citizen called Manford Martin Mponda. Anyone researching binary-options fraud might quickly conclude that Mponda was a kingpin. He was a serial company director, with some 80 directorships in UK-registered companies to his name, and features in dozens of complaints.</p> <p>It already looked like a major scandal that British regulation was so lax that Mponda could have been allowed to conduct a global fraud epidemic behind the screen of UK-registered companies, but the reality was even more remarkable: Mponda had nothing to do with it. He was a victim, too.</p> <p>Police officers suspect that, after Mponda submitted his details to join a binary-options website, his identity was stolen so it could be used to register him as a director of dozens of UK companies. The scheme was only exposed after complaints to consumer protection bodies were passed onto the City of London police, who then asked their Australian colleagues to investigate.</p> <p>Companies House has since deleted Mponda\u2019s name from documents related to dozens of other companies, but it was too late for \u201cMJ\u201d and thousands of other victims. A small number of the binary-options masterminds have been caught, but the money they stole has vanished into the labyrinth of interlocking shell companies, and the individuals behind Cumberland Capital have not been identified.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the binary-options firms claimed to be in the UK. People are more likely to deal with a UK company than a company in Israel, as it has a better reputation when it comes to finances,\u201d said DS Alex Eristavi of the City of London Police\u2019s investment fraud team. \u201cCompanies House records are provided in good faith. There\u2019s not so much scrutiny as goes on in, say, Italy or Spain, where you have to go through the lawyers and do it properly. Here the information is submitted voluntarily. People don\u2019t realise that, they take it as being carved in stone.\u201d</p> <p>So here is step four: don\u2019t just lie, lie cleverly. British companies look legitimate, so look legitimate yourself. Steal a real person\u2019s name, and put that on the company documents. Don\u2019t put your own address on the documents, rent a serviced office to take your post: Paul Manafort used one in Finchley, the binary options fraudsters went to Liverpool, and Lantana Trade was based in the London suburb of Harrow.</p> <p>The financial documents you file look better if they\u2019ve been audited by an accountant, so file genuine-looking accounts, and claim they\u2019ve been audited by a proper accountancy firm. That isn\u2019t checked either, so just find an accountant online and claim you\u2019ve employed them. Accountants quite regularly find themselves contacted about accounts they have never seen before, and make the unwelcome discovery they have been personally named as having approved them.</p> <h2><strong>Steps 1-4: A brief recap</strong></h2> <p>So, to summarise the tricks so far, if you want to create an impenetrable weapon for committing fraud: first, forget about the supposed offshore centres and come to the UK; then take advantage of the super-easy Companies House web portal; then enter false information; and finally make sure that information is plausible enough to deceive a casual observer.</p> <p>We\u2019re nearly there. It\u2019s time for the final step.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"137d65f7d802c9534d87a7b2566d2861c9f37af5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/137d65f7d802c9534d87a7b2566d2861c9f37af5/0_202_1181_803/1000.png\" alt=\"Leon Edler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"680\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Step 5: Don\u2019t worry about it</strong></h2> <p>I know what you\u2019re thinking: it cannot be this easy. Surely you\u2019ll be arrested, tried and jailed if you try to follow this five-step process. But if you look at what British officials <em>do</em>, rather than at what they say, you\u2019ll begin to feel a lot more secure. The Business Department has repeatedly been warned that the UK is facilitating this kind of financial crime for the best part of a decade, and is yet to take any substantive action to stop it. (Though, to be fair, it did recently launch a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/corporate-transparency-and-register-reform\" title=\"\">consultation</a>\u201d.)</p> <p>Before 2011, only registered company-formation businesses could access Companies House\u2019s web portal, which meant there was a clear connection between an actual verified individual and companies being created, since you could see who had created them. There was still fraud, of course, but it was relatively easy to understand who was responsible.</p> <p>In 2011, then-business secretary and Liberal Democrat MP Vince Cable decided to open up Companies House, and everything changed. After Cable\u2019s reform, anyone with an internet connection, anywhere in the world, could create a UK company in about as much time as it takes to order a couple of pizzas, and for approximately the same amount of money. The checks were gone; there was no longer any connection to a verifiably existing person; it was as easy to create a UK company as it was to set up a Twitter account. The rationale was that this would unleash the latent entrepreneurship within the British nation by making it easy to turn business ideas into thriving concerns.</p> <p>Instead of unchaining a new generation of British businesspeople, however, Cable let slip the dogs of fraud. At first, this rather technical modification to an obscure corner of the British machinery of state did not garner much attention, but for people who understood what it meant it was alarming. One such person was Kevin Brewer, a Warwickshire businessman who had been in the company forming business for decades, and who attempted to warn Cable of the potential risks inherent in the new policy.</p> <p>The method Brewer chose to make his warning was perhaps slightly unwise. He registered a company \u2013 John Vincent Cable Services Ltd \u2013 with Vince Cable listed as the sole shareholder, then wrote to the business secretary to explain what he had done. It was intended as a demonstration of how easy it is to file unverified information with Companies House, but it failed to focus attention in the way he had hoped. Jo Swinson MP, who worked with Cable, wrote Brewer a stern letter, telling him he should not have done what he did, and assured him that the new system was very good. Brewer concluded that the coalition government was not going to take his concerns seriously.</p> <p>In 2015, there was a general election, Cable lost his seat, the Conservatives formed a majority government, and Brewer decided to try again with the same stunt. He created Cleverly Clogs Ltd, a company apparently owned by three people: James Cleverly MP, Baroness Neville-Rolfe, who was a minister in the business department, and a fictional Israeli called Ibrahim Aman. Brewer was no more successful in persuading Tories than he had been at persuading Liberal Democrats, however. At that point, he gave up on his attempt to show the government it was enabling limitless opportunities for fraud.</p> <p>There is, it turns out, a simple explanation for why successive governments have failed to do anything about it. Last year, when challenged in the House of Commons, Treasury minister John Glen stated that Companies House simply couldn\u2019t afford to check the information filed with it, since that would cost the UK economy hundreds of millions of pounds a year. This is almost certainly an exaggeration. Anti-corruption activists who have looked at the data say the cost would in fact be far less than that, but the key point is that the reform would pay for itself. As Brewer has pointed out, \u201cthe burden of cost is one thing. But the cost of fraud is far greater.\u201d</p> <p>VAT fraud alone costs the UK more than \u00a31bn a year, while the National Crime Agency estimates the cost of all fraud to the UK economy to be \u00a3190bn. The cost to the rest of the world of the money laundering enabled by UK corporate entities is almost certainly far higher. Spending hundreds of millions of pounds to prevent hundreds of billions\u2019 worth of crime looks like a sensible investment, however you look at the data, particularly since the remedy \u2013 obliging Companies House to check the accuracy of the information filed on its registry \u2013 would be so simple. (When I put this to Companies House, they provided the following statement: \u201cWe do not have the statutory power or capability to verify the accuracy of the information that companies provide. However, tackling abuse of the register is a key priority and that\u2019s why we work closely with law enforcement partners to assist their investigations into suspected cases of economic crime and other offences.\u201d)</p> <p>That is not to say that the government has taken no action. It is illegal to deliberately file false information in registering a company, and punishable by up to two years in prison. In late 2017, Companies House at last alerted prosecutors to the activities of one persistent offender. The target of the prosecution was Kevin Brewer, for the crime of trying to inform politicians about how easy it is to create fake companies.</p> <p>He was summonsed to appear at Redditch magistrates\u2019 court and, on legal advice, pleaded guilty in March 2018. After adding together his fine, and the government\u2019s costs, he is \u00a323,324 the poorer \u2013 quite a high price to pay for blowing the whistle. He is paying it off at \u00a31,000 a month, and remains the only person ever convicted of spoofing the UK\u2019s corporate registry, which is quite a remarkable demonstration of Companies House\u2019s failure to do its job.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/19/wolves-of-instagram-jordan-belmont-social-media-traders\">Fake it till you make it: meet the wolves of Instagram</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Following his conviction, Brewer\u2019s company National Business Register was removed from the list that Companies House publishes of company formation agents, which had been a key source of new business for him. \u201cThere are company formation agents on that list who have permitted huge amounts of fraud, and I\u2019ve been excluded for trying to expose it.

      "bodyText": "Kleptocrats, fraudsters and crooks steal hundreds of billions of pounds, dollars and euros from the rest of us every year, but that gives them a problem: how can they stop the rest of us knowing what they\u2019ve done with the proceeds? They have to stop their haul looking suspicious, to cleanse it of any criminal taint, or face losing their hard-stolen cash. Money laundering, as this process is known, is notoriously difficult to uncover, investigate and prosecute. Occasionally, however, an insider breaks cover \u2013 someone such as Howard Wilkinson, who blew the whistle on perhaps the largest money-laundering scheme in history, the movement of \u20ac200bn of suspect funds through the Estonian branch of Denmark\u2019s biggest bank between 2007 and 2015, most of it earned in the dodgier corners of the former Soviet Union, some perhaps belonging to Vladimir Putin himself. \u201cNo one really knows where this money went,\u201d Wilkinson, a former Danske Bank employee, told Denmark\u2019s parliament last year. Once the money had got into the global financial system, \u201cit was clean, it was free.\u201d Britain\u2019s most famous money launderer is HSBC, thanks to its systematic cleansing of the earnings of the Latin American drug cartels over the second half of the last decade, for which it was fined $1.9bn by the US government in 2012. But that was a tiny operation compared to the Danske Bank scandal. If gathered together, the suspect funds moved through the bank\u2019s Estonian outpost could buy HSBC, with more than enough left over to buy Danske Bank too. The scandal has been big news in Denmark and Estonia, but barely grazed public consciousness in the UK. This is strange, because Britain played a key role. All of the owners of the bank accounts that first aroused Wilkinson\u2019s suspicions had their identity hidden behind corporate structures registered in the UK \u2013 including Lantana Trade LLP, the one that may have been connected to Putin. That means this is not just a Russian, Estonian or Danish scandal, but something far closer to home. In November, Wilkinson told a European parliament committee that the countries hosting these companies are just as culpable. \u201cWorst of all is the United Kingdom,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United Kingdom is an absolute disgrace.\u201d The British government is supposedly committed to tackling grand corruption and financial crime, yet Britain\u2019s involvement in this mega-scandal has never been mentioned in parliament, or been addressed by ministers. It is far from the first time that British companies have been involved in high-profile money-laundering. Among the characters who have used British shell companies to hide their money are Paul Manafort, disgraced former chairman of Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign, and Viktor Yanukovich, overthrown president of Ukraine, among thousands of lower-profile opportunists. It is increasingly hard to avoid the conclusion that Britain tolerates this kind of behaviour deliberately, because of the money it brings into to our economy. That being so, why should hardened criminals be the only ones getting rich off Britain\u2019s lax enforcement? Here\u2019s how you too can use British shell companies to cleanse your dirty money \u2013 in five easy steps. Step 1: Forget what you think you know If you have ambitions to steal a lot of money, forget about using cash. Cash is cumbersome, risky and highly limiting. Even if Danske Bank had used the highest denomination banknotes available to it, that \u20ac200bn would have weighed 400 tonnes, an amount four times heavier than a blue whale. Just moving it would have been a serious logistical challenge, let alone hiding it. It would have been a magnet for thieves, and would have attracted some unwelcome questions at customs. If you want to commit significant financial crime, therefore, you need a bank account, because electronic cash weighs nothing, no matter how much of it there is. But that causes a new problem: the bank account will have your name on it, which will alert the authorities to your identity if they come looking. This is where shell companies come in. Without a company, you have to act in person, which means your involvement is obvious and overt: the bank account is in your name. But using a company to own that bank account is like robbing a house with gloves on \u2013 it leaves no fingerprints, as long as the company\u2019s ownership information is hidden from the authorities. This is why all sensible crooks do it. The next question is what jurisdiction you will choose to register your shell company in. If you Google \u201coffshore finance\u201d, you\u2019ll see photos of tropical islands with palm trees, white sands and turquoise waters. These represent the kind of jurisdictions \u2013 \u201csunny places for shady people\u201d \u2013 where we expect to find shell companies. For decades, places such as Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Gibraltar and others sold the companies that people hide behind when committing their crimes. But in recent years, the world has changed \u2013 those jurisdictions have been cajoled, bullied and persuaded to keep good records of company ownership, and to reveal those records when police officers come looking. They are no longer as useful as they used to be. So where is? This is where the UK comes in. When it comes to financial crime, Britain is your best friend. Here is the secret you need to know to get started in the shell company game: the British company registration system contains a giant loophole \u2013 the kind of loophole you can drive a billion euros through without touching the sides. That is why UK shell companies have enabled financial crime all over the world, from giant acts of kleptocratic plunder to sad and squalid frauds that rob pensioners of their retirement savings. So, step one: forget what you think you know about offshore finance. The true image associated with \u201cshell companies\u201d these days should not be an exotic island redolent of the sound of the sea and the smell of rum cocktails, but a damp-stained office block in an unfashionable London suburb, or a nondescript street in a northern city. If you want to set up in the money-laundering business, you don\u2019t need to move to the Caribbean: you\u2019d be far better off doing it from the comfort of your own home. Step 2: Set up a company The second step is easy, and involves creating a company on the Companies House website. Companies House maintains the UK\u2019s registry of corporate structures and publishes information on shareholders, directors, accounts, partners and so on, so anyone can check up on their bona fides. Setting up a company costs \u00a312 and takes less than 24 hours. According to the World Bank\u2019s annual Doing Business report, the UK is one of the easiest places anywhere to create a company, so you\u2019ll find the process pretty straightforward. This is another reason not to bother with places like the British Virgin Islands: setting up a company there will cost you \u00a31,000, and you\u2019ll have to go through an agent who will insist on checking your identity before doing business with you. Global agreements now require agents to verify their clients\u2019 identity, to conduct the same kind of \u201cdue diligence\u201d process demanded when opening a bank account. Almost all the traditional tax havens have been forced to comply with the rules, or face being blacklisted by the world\u2019s major economies. This means there are now few jurisdictions left where you can create a genuinely anonymous shell company \u2013 and those that remain look so dodgy that your company will practically scream \u201cBeware! Fraudster!\u201d to anyone you try to do business with. But Britain is an exception. While it has bullied the tax havens into checking up on their customers, Britain itself doesn\u2019t bother with all those tiresome and expensive \u201cdue diligence\u201d formalities. It is true that, while registering your company on the Companies House website, you will find that it asks for information such as your name and address. On the face of it, that might look worrying. If you have to declare your name and address, then how will your company successfully shield your identity when you engage in industrial-scale fraud? Do not be concerned, just read on. Step 3: Make stuff up This third step may be the hardest to really take in, because it seems too simple. Since 2016, the UK government has made it compulsory for anyone setting up a company to name the individual who actually owns it: \u201cthe person with significant control\u201d, or PSC. Before this reform it was possible to own a company with another company and, if that company was not British, the actual owner could hide their identity. In theory, the introduction of the PSC rule should have prevented the use of a British shell company to anonymously commit financial crime. Don\u2019t worry though, because it didn\u2019t. Here is the secret: no one checks the accuracy of the information you provide when you register with Companies House. You can say pretty much anything and Companies House will accept it. So this is step three: when you\u2019re entering the information to create your company, make mistakes. Suspicious typos are everywhere once you start delving into the Companies House database. For instance, many money-laundering investigations involving the former USSR eventually bump against a Belgian-based dentist, whose signature adorns the accounts of hundreds, if not thousands, of different companies, including Lantana Trade LLP. When he was tracked down to his home address in Belgium last year, the dentist claimed that his signature had been forged and that he had no connection to the companies. Whoever was filing the documents was remarkably imaginative when it came to spelling his name. Every document filed with the UK registry has the same signature, but his name is spelt in at least eight different ways: Ali Moulaye, Alli Moulaye, Aly Moulaye, Ali Moyllae, Ali Moulae, Ali Moullaye, Aly Moullaye and, oddly, Ian Virel. With such boundless opportunities for creativity, why not have fun? Recently, while messing about on the Companies House website, I came across a PSC named Mr Xxx Stalin, who is apparently a Frenchman resident in east London. It is perhaps technically possible that Xxx is a genuine name given to Mr Stalin by eccentric parents \u2013 but, if so, such eccentric parents are remarkably widespread. Xxx Stalin led me to a PSC of a different company, who was named Mr Kwan Xxx, a Kazakh citizen, resident in Germany; then to Xxx Raven; to Miss Tracy Dean Xxx; to Jet Xxx; and finally to (their distant cousin?) Mr Xxxx Xxx. These rabbitholes are curiously engrossing, and before long I\u2019d found Mr Mmmmmmm Yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy, and Mr Mmmmmm Xxxxxxxxxxx (correspondence address: Mmmmmmm, Mmmmmm, Mmm, MMM), at which point I decided to stop. As trolling goes, it is quite funny, but the implications are also very serious, if you think about what companies are supposed to be for. Limited companies and partnerships have their liability for debts limited, which means that if they go bust, their investors are not personally bankrupted. It\u2019s a form of insurance \u2013 society as a whole is accepting responsibility for entrepreneurs\u2019 debts, because we want to encourage entrepreneurial behaviour. In return, entrepreneurs agree to publish details about their companies so we can all check what they are up to, and to make sure they\u2019re not abusing our trust. The whole point of the PSC registry was to stop fraudsters obscuring their identities behind shell companies, and yet, thanks to Companies House\u2019s failure to check the information provided to it and thus to enforce the rules, they are still doing so. How exactly could society find someone who gives their identity as Mr Xxxxxxxxxxx, and their address as the chorus of a Crash Test Dummies song? Even when the company documents provide an actual name, rather than a random selection of letters, the information is often very hard to believe. For example, in September, Companies House registered Atlas Integrate Services LLP, which declared a PSC with a date of birth that showed her to be just two months old at the time. In her two months of life, she had not only found time to get started in business, but also apparently to get married, since she was listed as \u201cMrs\u201d. The LLP\u2019s incorporation document states: \u201cThis person holds the right, directly or indirectly, to appoint or remove a majority of the persons who are entitled to take part in the management of the LLP\u201d. It does not explain how exactly a babe in arms would achieve this. This is not a one-off. The anti-corruption campaign group Global Witness looked into PSCs last year, and found 4,000 of them were under the age of two. One hadn\u2019t even been born yet. At the opposite end of the spectrum, its researchers found five individuals who each controlled more than 6,000 companies. There are more than 4m companies at Companies House, which is a very large haystack to hide needles in. You don\u2019t actually even need to list a person as your company\u2019s PSC. It\u2019s permissible to say that your company doesn\u2019t know who owns it (no, you\u2019re not misunderstanding; that just doesn\u2019t make sense), or simply to tie the system up in knots by listing multiple companies in multiple jurisdictions that no investigator without the time and resources of the FBI could ever properly check. This is why step three is such an important one in the five-step pathway to creating a British shell company. If you can invent enough information when filing company accounts, then the calculation that underpins the whole idea of a company goes out of the window: you gain the protection from legal action, without giving up anything in return. It\u2019s brilliant. But don\u2019t dive in just yet; there are two more steps to follow before you can be confident of doing it properly. Step 4: Lie \u2013 but do so cleverly Most of the daft examples earlier (Mmmmmmm, Mmmmmm, Mmm, MMM) would not be useful for committing fraud, since anyone looking at them can tell they\u2019re not serious. Cumberland Capital Ltd, however, was a different matter. It looked completely legitimate. It controlled a company called Tropical Trade, which, in October 2016, cold-called a 63-year-old retired postal worker in Wisconsin identified in court filings as \u201cMJ\u201d. On the phone, a salesman offered her an investment product, which \u2013 he said \u2013 would make returns of 81%. He chatted about his wife and family and came across as \u201ckind and trustworthy\u201d, MJ later told police. \u201cDuring two weeks in November of 2016, she allowed Tropical Trade to charge $34,500 on her Mastercard and Visa credit cards,\u201d the filing states. When she tried to get her money back, her emails and calls were ignored, and she never saw it again. She had fallen victim to the global epidemic of binary-options fraud. Binary options are a form of betting on the stock market that are now banned in many countries \u2013 including Israel, where much of the industry was based \u2013 since fraudsters used the idea to fix odds, keep winnings and target the vulnerable. According to the FBI, taken as a whole, these fraudsters may have been fleecing their marks of up to $10bn a year. When US police came looking for the people behind Cumberland Capital Ltd, they searched the Companies House website and found that its director was an Australian citizen called Manford Martin Mponda. Anyone researching binary-options fraud might quickly conclude that Mponda was a kingpin. He was a serial company director, with some 80 directorships in UK-registered companies to his name, and features in dozens of complaints. It already looked like a major scandal that British regulation was so lax that Mponda could have been allowed to conduct a global fraud epidemic behind the screen of UK-registered companies, but the reality was even more remarkable: Mponda had nothing to do with it. He was a victim, too. Police officers suspect that, after Mponda submitted his details to join a binary-options website, his identity was stolen so it could be used to register him as a director of dozens of UK companies. The scheme was only exposed after complaints to consumer protection bodies were passed onto the City of London police, who then asked their Australian colleagues to investigate. Companies House has since deleted Mponda\u2019s name from documents related to dozens of other companies, but it was too late for \u201cMJ\u201d and thousands of other victims. A small number of the binary-options masterminds have been caught, but the money they stole has vanished into the labyrinth of interlocking shell companies, and the individuals behind Cumberland Capital have not been identified. \u201cMost of the binary-options firms claimed to be in the UK. People are more likely to deal with a UK company than a company in Israel, as it has a better reputation when it comes to finances,\u201d said DS Alex Eristavi of the City of London Police\u2019s investment fraud team. \u201cCompanies House records are provided in good faith. There\u2019s not so much scrutiny as goes on in, say, Italy or Spain, where you have to go through the lawyers and do it properly. Here the information is submitted voluntarily. People don\u2019t realise that, they take it as being carved in stone.\u201d So here is step four: don\u2019t just lie, lie cleverly. British companies look legitimate, so look legitimate yourself. Steal a real person\u2019s name, and put that on the company documents. Don\u2019t put your own address on the documents, rent a serviced office to take your post: Paul Manafort used one in Finchley, the binary options fraudsters went to Liverpool, and Lantana Trade was based in the London suburb of Harrow. The financial documents you file look better if they\u2019ve been audited by an accountant, so file genuine-looking accounts, and claim they\u2019ve been audited by a proper accountancy firm. That isn\u2019t checked either, so just find an accountant online and claim you\u2019ve employed them. Accountants quite regularly find themselves contacted about accounts they have never seen before, and make the unwelcome discovery they have been personally named as having approved them. Steps 1-4: A brief recap So, to summarise the tricks so far, if you want to create an impenetrable weapon for committing fraud: first, forget about the supposed offshore centres and come to the UK; then take advantage of the super-easy Companies House web portal; then enter false information; and finally make sure that information is plausible enough to deceive a casual observer. We\u2019re nearly there. It\u2019s time for the final step. Step 5: Don\u2019t worry about it I know what you\u2019re thinking: it cannot be this easy. Surely you\u2019ll be arrested, tried and jailed if you try to follow this five-step process. But if you look at what British officials do, rather than at what they say, you\u2019ll begin to feel a lot more secure. The Business Department has repeatedly been warned that the UK is facilitating this kind of financial crime for the best part of a decade, and is yet to take any substantive action to stop it. (Though, to be fair, it did recently launch a \u201cconsultation\u201d.) Before 2011, only registered company-formation businesses could access Companies House\u2019s web portal, which meant there was a clear connection between an actual verified individual and companies being created, since you could see who had created them. There was still fraud, of course, but it was relatively easy to understand who was responsible. In 2011, then-business secretary and Liberal Democrat MP Vince Cable decided to open up Companies House, and everything changed. After Cable\u2019s reform, anyone with an internet connection, anywhere in the world, could create a UK company in about as much time as it takes to order a couple of pizzas, and for approximately the same amount of money. The checks were gone; there was no longer any connection to a verifiably existing person; it was as easy to create a UK company as it was to set up a Twitter account. The rationale was that this would unleash the latent entrepreneurship within the British nation by making it easy to turn business ideas into thriving concerns. Instead of unchaining a new generation of British businesspeople, however, Cable let slip the dogs of fraud. At first, this rather technical modification to an obscure corner of the British machinery of state did not garner much attention, but for people who understood what it meant it was alarming. One such person was Kevin Brewer, a Warwickshire businessman who had been in the company forming business for decades, and who attempted to warn Cable of the potential risks inherent in the new policy. The method Brewer chose to make his warning was perhaps slightly unwise. He registered a company \u2013 John Vincent Cable Services Ltd \u2013 with Vince Cable listed as the sole shareholder, then wrote to the business secretary to explain what he had done. It was intended as a demonstration of how easy it is to file unverified information with Companies House, but it failed to focus attention in the way he had hoped. Jo Swinson MP, who worked with Cable, wrote Brewer a stern letter, telling him he should not have done what he did, and assured him that the new system was very good. Brewer concluded that the coalition government was not going to take his concerns seriously. In 2015, there was a general election, Cable lost his seat, the Conservatives formed a majority government, and Brewer decided to try again with the same stunt. He created Cleverly Clogs Ltd, a company apparently owned by three people: James Cleverly MP, Baroness Neville-Rolfe, who was a minister in the business department, and a fictional Israeli called Ibrahim Aman. Brewer was no more successful in persuading Tories than he had been at persuading Liberal Democrats, however. At that point, he gave up on his attempt to show the government it was enabling limitless opportunities for fraud. There is, it turns out, a simple explanation for why successive governments have failed to do anything about it. Last year, when challenged in the House of Commons, Treasury minister John Glen stated that Companies House simply couldn\u2019t afford to check the information filed with it, since that would cost the UK economy hundreds of millions of pounds a year. This is almost certainly an exaggeration. Anti-corruption activists who have looked at the data say the cost would in fact be far less than that, but the key point is that the reform would pay for itself. As Brewer has pointed out, \u201cthe burden of cost is one thing. But the cost of fraud is far greater.\u201d VAT fraud alone costs the UK more than \u00a31bn a year, while the National Crime Agency estimates the cost of all fraud to the UK economy to be \u00a3190bn. The cost to the rest of the world of the money laundering enabled by UK corporate entities is almost certainly far higher. Spending hundreds of millions of pounds to prevent hundreds of billions\u2019 worth of crime looks like a sensible investment, however you look at the data, particularly since the remedy \u2013 obliging Companies House to check the accuracy of the information filed on its registry \u2013 would be so simple. (When I put this to Companies House, they provided the following statement: \u201cWe do not have the statutory power or capability to verify the accuracy of the information that companies provide. However, tackling abuse of the register is a key priority and that\u2019s why we work closely with law enforcement partners to assist their investigations into suspected cases of economic crime and other offences.\u201d) That is not to say that the government has taken no action. It is illegal to deliberately file false information in registering a company, and punishable by up to two years in prison. In late 2017, Companies House at last alerted prosecutors to the activities of one persistent offender. The target of the prosecution was Kevin Brewer, for the crime of trying to inform politicians about how easy it is to create fake companies. He was summonsed to appear at Redditch magistrates\u2019 court and, on legal advice, pleaded guilty in March 2018. After adding together his fine, and the government\u2019s costs, he is \u00a323,324 the poorer \u2013 quite a high price to pay for blowing the whistle. He is paying it off at \u00a31,000 a month, and remains the only person ever convicted of spoofing the UK\u2019s corporate registry, which is quite a remarkable demonstration of Companies House\u2019s failure to do its job. Following his conviction, Brewer\u2019s company National Business Register was removed from the list that Companies House publishes of company formation agents, which had been a key source of new business for him. \u201cThere are company formation agents on that list who have permitted huge amounts of fraud, and I\u2019ve been excluded for trying to expose it. I find it incredible that they should turn a blind eye,\u201d he told me. \u201cIs it deliberate? Are they actually trying to get this money into the UK? I don\u2019t want to believe it, but I can\u2019t explain it any other way.\u201d We don\u2019t know the answer to that, but it does give us lesson number five: don\u2019t worry about it. Commit as much fraud as you like, fill your boots, the only reason anyone would care is if you kick up a fuss.

Survive that, and you will be starved of oxygen. The tiny number of stowaways who have emerged alive from journeys at the limit of human endurance are medical miracles, a puzzle to doctors. Imagine how desperate a man\u2019s life would have to be, for him to think it worth the risk. Yet so long as there is such vast disparity between the fortunes of a child born in parts of the developing world and one born in Nappy Valley, people will risk death to move themselves and their children from one to another. The more hyperconnected the world becomes, pulled together not only by systems of mass transportation but by the internet and TV and social media pouring forth sometimes rose-tinted views of life in the rich west, arguably the more it will happen. Where they can, people will come by legal means. But where they can\u2019t, there is no wall high enough, no border security tight enough, no detention regime callous enough to stop the desperate from trying. People will swim rivers, and some will drown doing it. They will set out to sea in leaky dinghies, risk suffocating in the back of lorries or getting shot forcing their way through hostile borders; they will hand over life savings to unscrupulous people traffickers. The moral dilemma created for the countries they are trying to reach is so enormous, the political choices emerging so difficult, that most of us would rather not think about it most of the time. But there can be few more powerful metaphors for a global crisis building unseen over our heads than a body falling out of a clear blue sky; few clearer reminders that it is simply not possible to shut ourselves off completely from the world, no matter how much some Brexiters might like there to be. No man is an island, even in his own back garden. No two lives are so far apart that they cannot, even for one split second, sometimes come together. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

In small groups, the children take different roles and are asked to create poses that reflect the dynamics between the characters.

Four thousand children take part in the project every year, many experiencing Shakespeare for the first time.</p> <p>In the school hall, Cammock sketches out the plot and the children create sounds for Prospero\u2019s island.

A donation of 200 rupees (\u00a32.30) is enough to recycle one shoe. Shriyans says that his \u201cambitious mission is now to make sure that every person in the country has a pair of shoes by 2023.\u201d</p> \n<p>The hope is that footwear will encourage school attendance.

      "bodyText": "In the vast Indian interior, it is not unusual to see shoeless infants \u2013 whether walking barefoot to school or hopping around on makeshift sports pitches. Injuries are common and lead to infections such as hookworm and elephantiasis. More than 250 million Indians live below the poverty line and footwear is usually a luxury. Tens of millions of children have no shoes. (By contrast, roughly 300m pairs of shoes are discarded in the US every year). Now, two young athletes in Mumbai have come together to convert old shoes into new footwear for unshod schoolchildren in small villages. Green Sole has teamed up with schools and colleges to distribute remade footwear across states such as Odisha, Assam, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. So far they have provided more than 150,000 pairs of flip-flops and slippers. \u201cWe have also started retailing our recycled footwear through stores and online portals,\u201d said one of the founders, Shriyans Bhandari. \u201cBesides making footwear and distributing it, we are very proud of having set up a skill centre in Jharkhand, to train tribal women in recycling footwear.\u201d The duo is working with large companies such as Adidas, Sketchers and H&amp;M to collect old shoes, and absorb the cost of converting them into new slippers for children. A donation of 200 rupees (\u00a32.30) is enough to recycle one shoe. Shriyans says that his \u201cambitious mission is now to make sure that every person in the country has a pair of shoes by 2023.\u201d The hope is that footwear will encourage school attendance. Some children initially did not wear the flip-flops, storing them safely in a cupboard because they were precious. But more typical is the story of one 14-year-old girl called Radha. Her daily walk to school was a 4km round trip. In the summer heat, it was sometimes impossible to walk barefoot and her schooling suffered. Her new shoes have improved her attendance. A proliferation of companies and social enterprises in India are working to repurpose and recycle old materials into new products and items of clothing, from Goonj, which revives garments and distributes to the needy, to HelpUsGreen which converts old flowers from temples and mosques into incense sticks, organic fertilisers and insulation.

      "body": "<p>As chugging guitars reverberated over Finsbury Park last Sunday afternoon, crowds streamed through the Manor House gate past a banner commemorating the park\u2019s 150th anniversary. Next to it was another temporary sign: \u201cWelcome! Your park is open as usual.\u201d The statement was at best disingenuous \u2013 the gates were certainly open, and so were many of the facilities, but it rather overlooked the 49,000-capacity festival surrounded by 12-foot-high grey metal fencing and audible a mile away.</p> <p>The festival was called Community, but at \u00a350 a ticket, and with a narrow lineup of indie rock, it\u2019s not <em>that </em>kind of community festival. Outside the perimeter fencing a father and two children on their bikes took advice from security staff in hi-vis jackets on where they were still able to cycle, and when the fencing would come down.</p> <p>In Blur\u2019s 1994 single, it was \u201call the people\u201d who went hand-in-hand through their parklife. In 2019 London, we should be so lucky. The rapid rise of city-based summer music festivals has become the latest fight in the attritional war over the privatisation of public space, which now includes the question of who has the right to use London\u2019s parks in the warmest months of the year. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc290d529f9f8d286d522b53aa2cb165c6990ae8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc290d529f9f8d286d522b53aa2cb165c6990ae8/0_81_4693_2815/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People relax in the sun in Finsbury Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People relax in the sun in Finsbury Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Mirzoeff/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Exclusive new figures obtained by Guardian Cities through freedom of information (FoI) requests show that London\u2019s councils are hiring out public parks for commercial, paid-for events, such as music festivals, for large portions of the summer. Local authorities were asked for the number of days that areas of their public parks would be off-limits to local residents from May-August because of events with an entry fee. Of the 30 out of 32 councils that responded, the outer London boroughs of Brent and Enfield scored the highest, with 41 and 42 days respectively; Hackney and Southwark, with 35 and 38 days, scored the highest in inner London.</p> <p>Moreover, as park users know, it\u2019s not just the days when the festivals are taking place that are disruptive: the heavy-duty stage infrastructure and fencing require days or sometimes weeks to set up and de-rig, cutting off access to substantial parts of London\u2019s parks for large portions of the summer. Councils were also asked how long that infrastructure would stay up: in many cases this number was more than 40 days; in Enfield\u2019s case, over 100, the equivalent of a major park being privatised for more than three months.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/archive-zip/giv-3902TUF2PXbXkwuJ/\" data-alt=\"London boroughs with 40 or more days of festival disruption (May-August 2019)\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/archive-zip/giv-3902TUF2PXbXkwuJ/\">London boroughs with 40 or more days of festival disruption (May-August 2019)</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cParks have become a very significant commodity,\u201d says University of Westminster academic Andrew Smith, whose research focuses on live events and urban tourism. He says the last decade has seen a much greater use of parks for big commercial music festivals, sporting and entertainment events. \u201cWe live in what is called an \u2018experience economy\u2019 now, where these kinds of events are an increasingly large part of the way in which people spend their money.\u201d</p> <p>Along with this heightened demand from Londoners with disposable income to spend, he says, there is the key push factor: almost a decade of swingeing cuts from central government. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/feb/11/uks-cash-starved-parks-at-tipping-point-of-decline-mps-warn\">report by MPs</a> in 2017 found that a staggering 92% of parks budgets had been cut since 2010-11. \u201cLocal authorities have become desperate to subsidise their budgets.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5d332a20e04bd16486f666e74ac0ef6c519e9cb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d332a20e04bd16486f666e74ac0ef6c519e9cb4/0_78_2800_1680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Nash performs at Community festival in Finsbury Park last weekend\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Nash performs at Community festival in Finsbury Park last weekend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Lewis Photography/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Inevitably, the largest, loudest and longest-lasting events attract the highest hire fee. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a financial calculation,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all combined with the overriding context, which is increasing concern about the restriction of access to public space \u2013 I think people are more aware now of this issue of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jul/24/revealed-pseudo-public-space-pops-london-investigation-map\">privatisation of public space</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Opposition to the commercial use of the parks is growing.

But five years ago, Haringey decided to change their major events policy to allow for up to five major festivals a year in Finsbury Park, and an unlimited number of smaller festivals. And suddenly the number of events increased enormously.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, the phenomenon seems linked to the equally strong desire to keep parks free at a time of squeezed council budgets. Enfield council\u2019s head of finance and procurement, Mary Maguire, points the finger at austerity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not just the days where the events are on, but the weeks either side</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAs a result of government spending cuts and increased pressures on services, Enfield council has had to save \u00a3178m since 2010.

      "bodyText": "As chugging guitars reverberated over Finsbury Park last Sunday afternoon, crowds streamed through the Manor House gate past a banner commemorating the park\u2019s 150th anniversary. Next to it was another temporary sign: \u201cWelcome! Your park is open as usual.\u201d The statement was at best disingenuous \u2013 the gates were certainly open, and so were many of the facilities, but it rather overlooked the 49,000-capacity festival surrounded by 12-foot-high grey metal fencing and audible a mile away. The festival was called Community, but at \u00a350 a ticket, and with a narrow lineup of indie rock, it\u2019s not that kind of community festival. Outside the perimeter fencing a father and two children on their bikes took advice from security staff in hi-vis jackets on where they were still able to cycle, and when the fencing would come down. In Blur\u2019s 1994 single, it was \u201call the people\u201d who went hand-in-hand through their parklife. In 2019 London, we should be so lucky. The rapid rise of city-based summer music festivals has become the latest fight in the attritional war over the privatisation of public space, which now includes the question of who has the right to use London\u2019s parks in the warmest months of the year. Exclusive new figures obtained by Guardian Cities through freedom of information (FoI) requests show that London\u2019s councils are hiring out public parks for commercial, paid-for events, such as music festivals, for large portions of the summer. Local authorities were asked for the number of days that areas of their public parks would be off-limits to local residents from May-August because of events with an entry fee. Of the 30 out of 32 councils that responded, the outer London boroughs of Brent and Enfield scored the highest, with 41 and 42 days respectively; Hackney and Southwark, with 35 and 38 days, scored the highest in inner London. Moreover, as park users know, it\u2019s not just the days when the festivals are taking place that are disruptive: the heavy-duty stage infrastructure and fencing require days or sometimes weeks to set up and de-rig, cutting off access to substantial parts of London\u2019s parks for large portions of the summer. Councils were also asked how long that infrastructure would stay up: in many cases this number was more than 40 days; in Enfield\u2019s case, over 100, the equivalent of a major park being privatised for more than three months. \u201cParks have become a very significant commodity,\u201d says University of Westminster academic Andrew Smith, whose research focuses on live events and urban tourism. He says the last decade has seen a much greater use of parks for big commercial music festivals, sporting and entertainment events. \u201cWe live in what is called an \u2018experience economy\u2019 now, where these kinds of events are an increasingly large part of the way in which people spend their money.\u201d Along with this heightened demand from Londoners with disposable income to spend, he says, there is the key push factor: almost a decade of swingeing cuts from central government. A report by MPs in 2017 found that a staggering 92% of parks budgets had been cut since 2010-11. \u201cLocal authorities have become desperate to subsidise their budgets.\u201d Inevitably, the largest, loudest and longest-lasting events attract the highest hire fee. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a financial calculation,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all combined with the overriding context, which is increasing concern about the restriction of access to public space \u2013 I think people are more aware now of this issue of privatisation of public space.\u201d Opposition to the commercial use of the parks is growing. Angry residents are organising to demand access to fenced-off parks and contesting damage to plants and wildlife, as well as noise and anti-social behaviour. The campaign by residents near Battersea Park against Formula E racing eventually triumphed, and the race has not returned. In north London, meanwhile, Friends of Finsbury Park has mounted a high-profile struggle against the summer festivals there, particularly over the noise and anti-social behaviour connected to Wireless festival. In October 2018, it secured licence conditions that included lower volume limits, and a restriction on \u201cvulgar, obscene or banned songs\u201d, and even \u201cvulgar gestures, actions or remarks during the performance\u201d. These objections drew accusations of Nimbyism and of racist undertones, as Wireless has become Britain\u2019s premier black music festival. But for Simon Hunt, chair of the group, the problem isn\u2019t Wireless festival per se. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the days where the events are on, but the weeks either side,\u201d he said, echoing the FoI results. \u201cBy the time the festivals are finally gone, there are huge parts of the park without any grass any more, there\u2019s litter strewn everywhere, broken pathways and fences.\u201d He also emphasises the group\u2019s fears that Haringey council has been using their local park as a cash cow to fund depleted parks services. \u201cTen years ago this wasn\u2019t really a huge issue,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThere would be one festival or concert every year or two.

      "bodyText": "A second major spill has hit the pristine Solomon Islands bay where a bulk carrier ran aground on a coral reef and leaked oil earlier this year. On Monday, an estimated 5,000 tonnes of bauxite, the ore used in aluminium smelting, slipped into the water at Kangava Bay, Rennell Island, while it was being loaded on to a barge. \u201cThe water is red. It\u2019s like a scene from the Exodus,\u201d a source on the island told the Guardian. It is the second major environmental disaster for the area this year. MV Solomon Trader ran aground on a reef in February, spilling about 80 tonnes of heavy fuel oil. The vessel was there to load bauxite from the island\u2019s mining operations, which lies on the doorstep of a world heritage site in the island\u2019s east. The Guardian understands the Solomon Islands government is expected to sign off on the four-month oil spill clean up on 17 July, following the completion of the environmental assessment. While local villagers have been told not to eat fish, it is understood many still are, in the absence of other food sources on the remote island. Test results are yet to come back to determine whether fish stocks have been contaminated with hydrocarbons. \u201cThe impact of the oil is not nearly as bad as you would expect. The oil isn\u2019t likely to cause any long-term damage,\u201d a seperate person on the ground told the Guardian. \u201cThe bauxite is the overwhelming issue by a long shot and that is causing substantial long term changes to the marine ecosystem.\u201d Ongoing mismanagement of bauxite loading has resulted in the whole bottom of the bay, down to several hundred metres, being covered in the mineral, the source said. \u201cIt\u2019s just totally out of control,\u201d he said. University of Technology Sydney water and ecology expert Martina Doblin warned the bauxite powder was likely to smother and bury what is on the ocean floor and will be spread around in tidal currents. \u201cIt could limit the amount of light, so the water is cloudy and that means less light penetration for coral and sea grasses \u2026 it would have a harmful effect,\u201d Doblin said. OceansWatch Solomon Islands spokesman Lawrence Nodua said the contamination would cause problems for fish breeding. \u201cNormally fish come to where the coral are, so if the coral dies, they won\u2019t be there, and [will lose the reef protection],\u201d he said. He claimed there were reports that children swimming in the bay were experiencing skin irritation from the poor water quality. A Bintan Mining Solomon Islands company spokesman told the Guardian on Thursday that loading operations were suspended following the incident on Monday. The company would not comment further. Sources on the ground said the company had moved loading operations to other parts of the island. During the height of the oil spill disaster, Bintan Mining Solomon Islands faced criticism for continuing with its bauxite loading operations. While currents pushed slick away from the world heritage site, the Guardian has been told small amounts have washed up in the area. \u201cNothing significant, literally the size of a 50c piece here or there,\u201d another source said. Since 2013 the site has been on a Unesco danger list because of logging and overfishing. The bulk carrier\u2019s insurer, KP&amp;I, said negotiations over clean-up operation costs would kick off soon but warned compensation claims would take time. Although matters of liability are yet to be determined, the insurer and ship owner have previously \u201cexpressed deep remorse\u201d and characterised the situation as \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d. Comment has been sought from the Solomon Islands Maritime Authority, National Disaster Management Office and mining ministry.",

Dog rose has the run of the waysides and wastes to express itself in a thousand subtle ways, and an ancient lineage that refuses to be fixed; it is vernacular and unrepeatable, spontaneous and largely uncultivated, although some garden forms do exist, such as the pink-flowered, fragrant, R canina \u201cAndersonii\u201d. The promiscuity of the dog rose contrasts with the meticulous breeding of the cultivated rose varieties. The latter are symbols of civilisation, a measure of artistic achievement, skill and taste, growing sensually and proudly from the symbiosis between cultivation and culture. Friedrich Nietzsche made a similar distinction between people: between the peasants and forest-dwellers of a lower culture who, like oak trees, are hardly touched by the passing of time, and those of a higher culture, who are moved to self-pity and suffer because of time\u2019s passing. \u201cHe who wants to harvest happiness and contentment from life,\u201d says Nietzsche, \u201chas only to avoid acquiring a higher culture.\u201d I wonder if the soldier beetle is happy and content on the dog rose. These two beings share a magic rich with ecological connections that are almost unimaginable to us, yet watching them brings such joy. In a war of the roses \u2013 wild versus cultivated \u2013 I think I\u2019ll avoid the higher culture.",

      "bodyText": "It was a landmark moment for LGBT rights. When Taiwan passed a law allowing same-sex couples to marry, crowds in Taipei erupted into cheers, chanting: \u201cFirst in Asia\u201d. For those watching from across the Taiwan strait in China, where gay couples do not have that right, the moment was heartening but also profoundly sad. Matthew, 27, an LGBT activist in Chengdu, spent the day following the proceedings online on his own. A few days later he flew to Taiwan to watch two male friends register their marriage after 14 years together. While he was happy for his friends, the moment only highlighted how far away his own country was from doing the same. \u201cDefinitely there is a sense of disappointment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we want to make what happened in Taiwan happen in China in the same way, it\u2019s impossible.\u201d The legalisation of same-sex marriage just 100 miles from the mainland has heightened the contrast between China and Taiwan, where civil society groups and democratically elected officials pushed through the initiative. Beijing insists Taiwan, where a rival government was established in 1949 and has since functioned entirely separately from China, is still part of the mainland. Now, making that claim has become more awkward. \u201cFor some people, they say: \u2018Our government says Taiwan belongs to China.

LGBT netizens use phrases such as NTXL, the pinyin transliteration for the Chinese term for n\u00fc (female) or nan (male) tongxinglian (gay), to get around blocked terms. Those who violate the content rules are punished. Last year, an author of gay erotica was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Conversion therapy is still common.

      "bodyText": "The death of an Aboriginal woman in custody in 2016 could have been prevented if police had called an ambulance or conducted more thorough searches while she was in custody, the state\u2019s coroner has found. Rebecca Maher, 36, was found dead inside a police cell at the Maitland police station in the NSW Hunter region just before 6am on 19 July 2016, about five hours after being taken into protective custody because she appeared intoxicated and had wandered into oncoming traffic. The inquest had previously heard that when Maher was taken into custody she was stumbling, had slurred speech and could not sit upright on the bench in the observation cell. It also heard that police initially had concerns about her health, specifically her breathing. On Friday, the acting state coroner, Therese O\u2019Sullivan, handed down her findings into the death, saying given the level of Maher\u2019s intoxication the police\u2019s failure to call an ambulance was in breach of policy and that she \u201cwould have survived\u201d if they had. \u201cPolice should have concluded at that early stage that Rebecca was severely intoxicated,\u201d she said. If an ambulance had been called, she said \u201cexpert evidence suggests that Rebecca would have survived\u201d. She said the level of her intoxication meant Maher \u201cshould not have been kept in police detention and should have instead taken immediately to hospital\u201d. \u201cThere seemed to be a consensus among various officers that the power to detain an intoxicated person was to be exercised to allow [the person] to sleep off,\u201d she said. \u201cI am troubled by this attitude.\u201d After Maher was detained in Cessnock she was placed in the cell at 1.24am and ordered 10 minutes later to lie down, because she was sitting slumped on the mattress and looked likely to fall over. A custody officer walked to the door of the cell seven times between then and discovering her death and looked at her through the perspex wall, but did not enter the cell or try to shake her awake, despite earlier noting problems with her breathing. When the officer did enter her cell at 5.54am, Maher was unresponsive and surrounded by vomit. She was declared dead just over 10 minutes later after police and paramedics were unable to revive her. Maher \u2013 who had a long history of drug addiction \u2013 was found to have died from mixed drug toxicity, with fatal levels of the prescription benzodiazepine Alprazolam in her system, as well as methadone which she had been using to deal with heroin addiction. After her death two pill bottles containing 29 Alprazolam or Xanax tablets were found in the left leg of her pants. O\u2019Sullivan found police had failed to conduct adequate searches on Maher because of a \u201cmisguided\u201d fear of contracting an infectious disease, and had not conducted adequate checks on her while she was in the prison cell. She said it was \u201clikely\u201d that at least one of the pill bottles were inside Maher\u2019s pants leg at the time she entered the police cell, and that had a pat down search been conducted the bottle \u201cmay have been located\u201d and \u201calerted [the officers] to the nature of her intoxication\u201d. She found the search was not conducted because of a \u201cmisguided fear of contracting an infectious disease\u201d after a dispatcher had incorrectly told officers Maher was HIV positive. O\u2019Sullivan said the checks conducted on Maher\u2019s welfare during the night were \u201cnot consistent\u201d with police requirements, and that if the officer on duty had performed his duty adequately \u201cit is very likely\u201d he would have found Maher unconscious earlier and called an ambulance. The 36-year-old Wiradjuri woman is the only Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person to die in a NSW police cell since the state introduced the mandatory custody notification service (CNS) in 2000. Under the terms of the CNS, police must notify the Aboriginal Legal Service when an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person is is in custody for an offence, but not for a person detained for intoxication. On Friday, O\u2019Sullivan recommended the NSW attorney general consider amending the law to extend the CNS to intoxicated persons, and that the commonwealth minister consider expanding the funding of the program. She also recommended further training for police officers about infectious diseases, improved reporting for custody managers checking on people detained for intoxication and to be required to record efforts to identify and locate a \u201cresponsible person\u201d.",

Friedman is unbothered by the reduction in revenue to fund the business of government \u2013 for Wilson\u2019s guru, the role of government is but to provide defence and protect private property.</p> <p>Surprise! That\u2019s the overt and covert basis of what the Coalition just legislated! By flattening the tax rate, the government is not merely gifting more treats to those on an annual salary of $200k plus. It is gouging $40bn a year from the commonwealth\u2019s capacity to spend on those trivial things \u2013 pensions, schools, hospitals, housing, roads, action against impending environmental catastrophe \u2013 that citizens imagine are state obligations but which Friedman and acolytes consider distractions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Not fighting the tax cuts on a jobs message was a staggering squib</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The AFR was <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/news/politics/national/morrison-s-plan-requires-40b-cut-20190415-p51e6l\">delightfully unadorned</a> in its assessment. \u201cThe Morrison government \u2013 and potentially future governments,\u201d it wrote \u201cwill need to exhibit spending discipline to afford the tax cuts and avoid driving the budget into a sustained deficit\u201d.</p> <p>Dear Australian Labor party; the impacts aren\u2019t just cut services and crumbling buildings.

      "bodyText": "The modern Liberal MP Tim Wilson gripped a copy of Milton Friedman\u2019s Capitalism and Freedom as he affirmed his allegiance to the Queen before the new parliament this week. There could not have been a clearer, more brightly-lit warning to Labor as to what defined the newly-reconstituted government they now faced, and what the tax cut debate was really about. Alas, those bright lights went unnoticed, or unheeded. Observe: politicians either make their affirmation unencumbered by a text, or swear an oath on a holy book. Wilson\u2019s choice to elevate Friedman\u2019s libertarian-conservative \u201cfree market\u201d polemic to the status of religious text defines the neoliberal zealotry of the modern Liberal party. In Capitalism and Freedom, Friedman makes a case against medical licensing, denounced as a market obstruction. The logic goes that if doctors mutilate or kill people, the appropriate punishment is fewer paying customers. In the very same tome, he demands replacing progressive taxation with a flat tax on income. Friedman is unbothered by the reduction in revenue to fund the business of government \u2013 for Wilson\u2019s guru, the role of government is but to provide defence and protect private property. Surprise! That\u2019s the overt and covert basis of what the Coalition just legislated! By flattening the tax rate, the government is not merely gifting more treats to those on an annual salary of $200k plus. It is gouging $40bn a year from the commonwealth\u2019s capacity to spend on those trivial things \u2013 pensions, schools, hospitals, housing, roads, action against impending environmental catastrophe \u2013 that citizens imagine are state obligations but which Friedman and acolytes consider distractions. The AFR was delightfully unadorned in its assessment. \u201cThe Morrison government \u2013 and potentially future governments,\u201d it wrote \u201cwill need to exhibit spending discipline to afford the tax cuts and avoid driving the budget into a sustained deficit\u201d. Dear Australian Labor party; the impacts aren\u2019t just cut services and crumbling buildings. They\u2019re mass layoffs. Opportunities for governments to create jobs in the future will be sacrificed on the neoliberal altar. The Morrison government insists the tax cuts will stimulate our slowing economy from the per capita recession we entered three financial quarters ago and \u2013 now that the election is over \u2013 they finally admit exists. Ah, yes \u2013 \u201cfrom the prophets, deserts come\u201d. What the Liberals won\u2019t admit, of course, is that the crisis of low wages, underemployment and poor economic growth underneath that slowdown results precisely from all these years of their own Friedmanesque policies. For six years, they\u2019ve cut services, sacked public servants, capped and cut wages, stomped on unions and wage demands \u2026 The problems get worse. Their remedy? To apply more of the problem! It\u2019s actually the remaining government investments \u2013 such as state government infrastructure spending \u2013 that have been propping up struggling growth figures and a poorly performing employment market. The promise to workers of tax cuts improving their prospects has already proven empty in America. But zealots do not truck in facts. Instead, they evangelise their beliefs with such conviction they inveigle others into their fantasies. Repeating the government\u2019s \u201cstimulus\u201d mantra, independent senator Jacqui Lambie voted up tax cuts to get modest social housing investment in Tasmania. The $157m for life-changing housing represents 0.1% of the potential spend the senator has traded away from everyone else.

Her claim that the Liberals will surely reverse the policy should it become too costly sure is an act of faith. Alas, her vote, plus that of other crossbenchers, got the tax cuts over the line. Why, then, the Labor party \u2013 whose very platform commits them to progressive taxation, who barely lost a very close election two months ago on an explicit social-democratic platform, whose most notorious neoliberal has renounced the ideology of Friedman as \u201ca dead end\u201d \u2013 chose to throw their powerless votes behind failed economics and recruit themselves into complicity with an inevitable destruction of jobs \u2026 is just unfathomable. Waleed Aly penned an articulate ideological riposte to Labor\u2019s betrayal of principle. My criticism is pragmatic. There are 15 months before even a territory election obliges more caution. There is no cost to Labor now battling every parliamentary bout around the one simple, economic offer it can make to the electorate but which Liberal ideology prevents: Labor will protect jobs, and create jobs in the places \u2013 and spaces, like for the climate \u2013 where jobs are needed.

Indeed, in a rare plea for unity as he spoke beneath the statue of Abraham Lincoln, he told the crowd: \u201cWe are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny. We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart, and we are all made by the same almighty God.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The president did, however, provide the bombastic show of military might that had been widely predicted. Whereas he once liked to build suspense as host of the reality TV show The Apprentice, Trump now has the world\u2019s most fearsome arsenal at his disposal \u2013 and he showed it off.</p> \n   <p>He relished introducing F-22 Raptors and a B-2 stealth bomber that roared loudly over the Washington monument, the reflecting pool and the Lincoln memorial. The rain-soaked crowd whooped, clapped, waved hats in the air and chanted: \u201cUSA!

of each military branch was played.<br><br></li> \n   <li>Despite fears from his critics that Trump would use his speech to politicise the day, his speech was largely patriotic and non-partisan, with only a few attempts by Trump to link the achievements of the country with his administration.<br><br></li> \n   <li>Mention of \u201cSpace Force\u201d resurfaced, with Trump promising that America would \u201cplant the American flag on Mars\u201d.<br><br></li> \n   <li>Trump also urged people present in the crowds to join up to the military and \u201cmake a truly great statement in life.\u201d

      "bodyText": "David Smith, our Washington DC bureau chief, has written up this piece of analysis of Trump\u2019s speech. I\u2019ll leave you with some quotes from that and we\u2019ll wrap up the live blog for the day. Thanks for following along. All men are created equal. But one is created more equal than others. And his name is Donald Trump. The US president\u2019s unique interpretation of the declaration of independence was on full display on Thursday when he staged a militaristic, jingoistic and untraditional jamboree at the Lincoln memorial in Washington to celebrate the Fourth of July. Trump did not fulfill his critics\u2019 worst fears of a politically partisan, campaign-style rally with his \u201cSalute to America\u201d event. Indeed, in a rare plea for unity as he spoke beneath the statue of Abraham Lincoln, he told the crowd: \u201cWe are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny. We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart, and we are all made by the same almighty God.\u201d The president did, however, provide the bombastic show of military might that had been widely predicted. Whereas he once liked to build suspense as host of the reality TV show The Apprentice, Trump now has the world\u2019s most fearsome arsenal at his disposal \u2013 and he showed it off. He relished introducing F-22 Raptors and a B-2 stealth bomber that roared loudly over the Washington monument, the reflecting pool and the Lincoln memorial. The rain-soaked crowd whooped, clapped, waved hats in the air and chanted: \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d The showman president, speaking behind rain-streaked bulletproof glass screens, grinned widely and declared: \u201cGreat country!\u201d The fireworks display is now in progress, and is audible all over downtown Washington. Fortunately it has stopped raining. Some Independence Day messages from some of the Democratic candidates for president. A reminder of where Trump may have got the inspiration for today\u2019s show of patriotism. When Trump visited France back in July 2017, before his relationship with Emmanuel Macron soured, he was reportedly awed by the show of military force and pomp at their Bastille Day celebrations. As Angelique Chrisafis wrote: Trump loves military parades \u2013 he had reportedly hoped for something on this scale at his own inauguration \u2013 and was frequently on his feet and applauding as the French military showcased its troops, tanks and fighter jets, including many US-made planes. White House observers said they had not seen him so happy for months. Donald Trump gave a speech at the Lincoln Memorial as part of his Fourth of July \u201cSalute to America\u201d celebrations, making him the first US president in nearly 70 years to address the country on Independence Day. Trump gave a surprisingly scripted speech in which he outlined the history of Independence Day, the history of American achievement in various fields, in which he singled out various special invited guests, and then paid tribute to each branch of the military in turn, with each section followed by a fly over of aircraft, as the official song of each military branch was played. Despite fears from his critics that Trump would use his speech to politicise the day, his speech was largely patriotic and non-partisan, with only a few attempts by Trump to link the achievements of the country with his administration. Mention of \u201cSpace Force\u201d resurfaced, with Trump promising that America would \u201cplant the American flag on Mars\u201d. Trump also urged people present in the crowds to join up to the military and \u201cmake a truly great statement in life.\u201d \u201cAnd you should do it!\u201d Trump added in one of the few clearly unscripted moments in the speech. More pictures here: A little more from the White House: The White House sends the following list of aircraft involved in today\u2019s flyovers and other equipment present for the event: Air Platforms participating in Salute to America: Air Force One Blue Angels (F-18 (6)) US Coast Guard Aircraft: MH-60 (1)/ MH-65 (1) / C-130 (1) US Air Force Aircraft: B-2 (1) / F-22 (2) US Marine Corps Aircraft: V-92 (1) / V-22 (2) US Army: Aircraft: AH-64 (4) US Navy: F-35 (2) / F-18 (2) Other Equipment: M1A2 Abrams Tanks (2) M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles (2) M88 Recovery Vehicle (1) Contact Truck with crew (1) Additionally, co-pooler Nikki Schwab noted that an individual in the crowd required medical attention part way through Trump\u2019s remarks after a hot and muggy day. The president did not stop his speech for the incident, but his view of the incident may have been obstructed by equipment set up near the Lincoln Memorial. The White House press office has just released the list of those \u201cexpected to attend\u201d today\u2019s event. (White House pool reports are always a little bit behind events). The following individuals are expected to attend: The White House President Donald J. Trump First Lady Melania Trump Vice President Mike Pence Second Lady Karen Pence Acting Secretary Mark T. Esper, Department of Defense Secretary David Bernhardt, Department of the Interior Secretary Alex Acosta, Department of Labor Secretary Alex Azar, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Elaine Chao, Department of Transportation Administrator Andrew Wheeler, Environmental Protection Agency Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, United States Trade Representative United States Military Leaders Gen Joseph F. Dunford, Jr., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff James McPherson, Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary of the Army LTG (P) Joseph M. Martin, Incoming Vice Chief of the Staff of the Army Secretary Richard Spencer, Secretary of the Navy ADM Bob Burke, Vice Chief of Naval Operations LtGen Eric Smith, Deputy Commandant, Marine Corps Development Command Acting Secretary Matthew Donovan, Acting Secretary of the Air Force Gen Stephen Wilson, Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force LTG Daniel Hokanson, Director of the Army National Guard ADM Karl Schultz, Commandant of the Coast Guard The Associated Press has noted how on-script Trump remained today. \u201cHe largely adhered to his script, avoiding diversions into his agenda or re-election campaign,\u201d says AP. This is certainly how the speech felt listening to it. There were long sections where Trump seemed to be reading, listing dates and facts as he gave historical accounts of many of the armed forces. Indeed, there were some points when the crowd \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 even seemed a little bored. Certainly, at some moments during these scripted historical sections when Trump stopped for applause, it took a long while for a very muted cheer to struggle free from the crowd. Mollie Hemingway on Fox News says that those who were critical of Trump\u2019s idea of holding the event and delivering a speech today, will \u201cfeel foolish\u201d after hearing Trump\u2019s speech, which she says was unifying. Another Fox commentator says that the speech was \u201can ode to American exceptionalism\u201d. We\u2019ll bring you verdicts of Trump\u2019s speech and the entire event as it rolls in. Starting with Fox News , which says Trump\u2019s speech had \u201cquite a State of the Union feel\u201d about it, running through the US\u2019s achievements and 243 history in a one hour speech. We\u2019ve now got Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m proud to be an American/God bless the USA\u201d playing as the Blue Angels fly over. The lyrics of the chorus of that song go: And I\u2019m proud to be an American where at least I know I\u2019m free. And I won\u2019t forget the men who died, who gave that right to me. And I\u2019d gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today. \u2018Cause there ain\u2019t no doubt I love this land God bless the USA. \u201cGlory, glory, hallelujah, his truth is marching on!\u201d No complaints about the music, which has all been performed with great aplomb today. Trump will be loving the degree of pomp and ceremony. He is inviting Melania Trump, Mike Pence and others up onto the stage as the Battle Hymn of the Republic is performed by the military band. \u201cThe spirit of America will never fade, never fail, but will reign forever and ever and ever!\u201d Trump is signing off now, wishing everyone a happy Independence Day. We have celebrated the armed forces, says Trump, \u201cnow we must go forward with the same purpose.\u201d \u201cAs long as we stay true to our purpose... as long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future, there will be nothing that America can not do.\u201d (\u201cUSA! USA!\u201d) \u201cThe future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud and the free,\u201d says Trump. \u201cWe all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart, and we are all made by the same Almighty God.\u201d Trump is celebrating the Army\u2019s involvement in the second world war, praising them for their work as \u201cthey held the line of civilisation in Korea\u201d, he mentions the Vietnam War, \u201craining fire\u201d down on Al-qaeda, the liberation of Fallujah and the \u201cobliteration\u201d of the Isis caliphate in Syria, \u201cjust recently \u2013 100% gone\u201d, says Trump. A fly-over for the army. Praise for the army now. More Latin from Trump at the end of a story about a Marine who was gravely injured in battle and when visited by his general wrote two words on a piece of paper: \u201cSemper fi\u201d (short for semper fidelis: always faithful, the mott of the Marines). And we have another fly-by. Trump is praising the Marines now. Fly-over in honour of the navy now. Praise for the Navy Seals now and the Navy now. Trump says the \u201cjustice sails those waters\u201d and its sailors \u201care forged by the sea\u201d and are rich with \u201cthe salt and the blood\u201d. Of the Seals, Trump praises them in their role in killing Osama Bin Laden, saying they are force that brings \u201crighteous retribution in deserts and jungles for those who seek to do us harm\u201d. And we just had a fly-over, which the crowd loved. \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d A reminder of what\u2019s going on right now. Trump is about 25 minutes into his Fourth of July speech. He is currently paying tribute to each branch of the US military in turn. We\u2019ve had the Coast Guard, we\u2019re now at the Air Force. We\u2019re hearing about the American bombers that \u201ccrippled the Nazi war machine\u201d. He quotes Roosevelt who said: \u201cHitler built walls around his \u2018Fortress Europe\u2019 but he forgot to put a roof on it.\u201d Trump says that the safety of Americans and America is due to the force of the US\u2019s air capabilities, or those, as Trump puts it, \u201cwho leave the earth ... and soar into the wild blue yonder.\u201d \u201cThe skies belong to the United States of America,\u201d says Trump. Trump has tried out some Latin, saying the Coast Guard \u201cthe guardians of the sea\u201d stand \u201cSemper paratus\u201d, which for those of you who didn\u2019t take your Latin, is the motto of the United States Coast Guard and means \u201cAlways prepared\u201d. Trump paused for effect after saying it, but it went down like a lead balloon. Trump is celebrating the Coast Guard now. He has lost the crowd a little bit, seems they prefer his more general nationalistic language to the more specific praise of military branches. Trump is honouring the armed forces in attendance today including three recipients of the Congressional medal of honour, who served in the military and, Trump says, \u201cloved every minute of it\u201d. And now Trump is urging people to \u201cjoin our military and make a truly great statement in life. And you should do it!\u201d It\u2019s easy to hear the ad-libbed moments in this speech. Some very damp crowds. Trump is celebrating the suffrage movement and the civil rights movement and has singled out one man who was involved in the Woolworths lunch counter sit-in. Trump is praising law enforcement now, including ICE, police and firefighters. \u201cWe pay special tribute to the service members and the military,\u201d says Trump. Trump is honouring the family members of military personnel who \u201cmade the supreme sacrifice \u2013 thank you.\u201d We\u2019re hearing about US achievements in the arts (Westerns etc), the automobile industry, about individuals involved in charitable work. Trump is giving a list of American achievements and impressive Americans. Now he\u2019s talking about the moon landing. \u201cWe are thrilled to have here tonight the famed flight commander, Gene Kranz\u201d, who led the moon landing mission. He promises Kranz that soon \u201cwe will plant the American flag on [long pause] Mars.\u201d Trump is celebrating the American spirit, which he says was responsible for ending slavery. He also says: \u201cOur quest for greatness unleashed a culture of discovery that led Thomas Edison to imagine his lightbulb... and the Wright brothers to look to the sky and imagine the next great frontier.\u201d \u201cThat same American spirit that emboldened our fathers... lives on in each and every one of you,\u201d says Trump. The American spirit is: \u201ccourage and confidence, loyalty and love, excellence and adventure\u201d and Trump says it \u201cbuilt this country into the most exceptional nation in history and it is stronger now that it ever was before, it is at its strongest now.\u201d The crowd love this: \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d Trump is telling the story of Independence Day, extolling the creation 243 years ago of \u201cthe most just and virtuous republic ever conceived\u201d. \u201cOn this day 243 years ago our founding fathers pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sovereign honour to ... defend our God-given rights.\u201d We are getting a history lesson now, hearing about the troops, the delegates debating the Declaration of Independence, the British coming to crush the revolutionaries etc. etc. Not a huge amount of audience response here. Trump just paused for applause and it was very slow in coming and very muted. This is not what his crowds are used to. Trump begins by saying they are here to celebrate the \u201cheroes who defend our country\u201d the servicemen and women of America. He is naming the branches of the US military who are there to celebrate the event: \u201cArmy, Navy, Air force, Coastguard, Marines and very soon, Space force.\u201d Donald Trump is addressing the assembled crowd at the Lincoln memorial in Washington DC in the first speech delivered by a US president on Independence Day in nearly seven decades. \u201cHello America! The first lady and I wish everyone of you a truly happy Independence Day. Today we come together as one nation, with this very special salute to America,\u201d he begins. The crowd have greeted Trump\u2019s arrival with chants of \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d Donald Trump and Melania Trump have arrived at the event. The presenting of the colours and the national anthem are underway. Service people carrying flags have marched onstage a military band are performing the national anthem, lots of hands on hearts and boisterous crowd singing. What has Donald Trump been tweeting today? Trump has been defending the size of the crowds who have come out to hear him speak, which have reportedly been hard to scrape together as service chiefs for the Army, Navy, Air Force or Marine Corps set to skip the planned display of military might. As we know, people suggesting he has small crowds is a particular bugbear of the president\u2019s. And he\u2019s optimistic about the weather. And a reminder that not everyone is happy about Trump\u2019s speech today. What can we expect from Trump\u2019s speech today \u2013 the first Fourth of July address delivered by a US president in nearly 70 years? According to excerpts of the speech released by the White House, Trump will say \u201cfuture of American Freedom\u201d lies with the men and women who are willing to defend it, as it did when America was founded. Trump says \u201cthere will be nothing that America cannot do\u201d as long as Americans remember the nation\u2019s history and \u201cnever stop fighting for a better future.\u201d Trump has ordered the Pentagon to stage military demonstrations, including a flyover of jets, helicopters and other aircraft, for the event that critics are calling a waste of taxpayer dollars and a needless glorification of Trump. Donald Trump is en route to the Lincoln memorial. He was pictured getting into the Beast a few minutes ago and should arrive to address crowds shortly. Mike Pence has arrived at the Lincoln memorial where supporters of the president have gathered, many wearing raincoats, to hear him speak. Though the crowds may not be what Trump has hoped for, as Edward Helmore reports for us. White House aides have reportedly struggled to draw crowds to Donald Trump\u2019s Fourth of July celebrations, with service chiefs for the Army, Navy, Air Force or Marine Corps set to skip the planned display of military might. Despite facing accusations that he is politicizing an important holiday, emulating displays in authoritarian countries and wasting taxpayers\u2019 money, Trump is set to mark Independence Day by delivering a speech about patriotism on the steps of the Lincoln memorial. The event, which Trump said would be the \u201cshow of a lifetime,\u201d will also feature a flyover by Air Force One, a display of tanks and a lengthier-than-usual fireworks display. In a morning tweet, Trump called the event \u201cSALUTE TO AMERICA\u201d and claimed people \u201care coming from far and wide to join us today and tonight for what is turning out to be one of the biggest celebrations in the history\u201d. That full story from Edward Helmore is here. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Independence Day celebrations in Washington DC, where Donald Trump is due to give a speech in about 20 minutes. A late afternoon downpour drenched the capital\u2019s Independence Day crowds and presaged an evening of possible on-and-off storms, raising some suspense about whether Trump\u2019s program of military flyovers and the city\u2019s annual 4 July fireworks would be interrupted. Trump will become the first president in nearly seven decades to address a crowd at the National Mall on Independence Day. \u201cI will speak on behalf of our great Country!\u201d he said in a morning tweet. \u201cPerhaps even Air Force One will do a low &amp; loud sprint over the crowd.\u201d",

This song hits all the right notes, with the avant-garde appeal and sturdy song craft of Sarah Blasko and Lorde, the unapologetically commercial sensibilities of Sia, and an absolute onslaught of impossibly high notes and Idol-worthy moments that the likes of Pink and Katy Perry repeatedly reach for. The difference is Montaigne reaches them. Simply put: forget community radio play. This song needs to start being spun on the hour, every hour, on the types of commercial radio stations that employ garishly painted Thunder-trucks to lap the city streets, giving away petrol vouchers and icy cold cans of Coke. This is a world-beating tune.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Montaigne\u2019s album Complex is out 30 August. She\u2019ll be touring Australia in November.</p> <h2><strong>Stephen Cummings \u2013 Shifting Heavy Circles</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>the Sports, the Modern Lovers, Bob Dylan</p> <p>Trying to sum up the quintessential sound of Stephen Cummings is a fruitless task. There\u2019s the tight Elvis Costello strut of his late-70s new wave group the Sports; the cabaret wanderings and dancefloor flirtations of his work in the 80s, and a run of successful largely acoustic confessionals throughout the 90s. Now there is this, the latest single plucked from the Melbourne musician\u2019s 20th solo album Prisoner Of Love. Shifting Heavy Circles is a swaggering rock\u2019n\u2019roll song, the type they made before metronomes were used, when the first take was the only take. The playing and the production are taut and economical, with a snaking backwards guitar solo the only concession to production trickery. Cummings\u2019 wayward and untreated vocal is pushed to the forefront, to great effect.

It was icy and solemn, with atmospheric synths, militaristic drumming and emotive vocals that whispered tales of pain and longing, love and death.

Sydney mainstay Spod moves in this same sonic universe, despite being the type of musician who could equally share the stage with Tripod or New Order, shamelessly self-promoting his own legendary status through hilarious videos, album covers and career moves made with tongue firmly in cheek.

Built around an insistently cheery big-band sample, Final Form is a striking and rewarding listen \u2013 from the intriguing, jolting instrumental that opens the track and loops for 40 seconds as if to build anticipation for what follows, all the way through to the sudden skidding soul cut that skips in and fades out within the song\u2019s final 10 seconds: a scratchy 45 hijacking a jukebox.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Sampa the Great\u2019s debut album is expected later this year.</p> <h2><strong>Miami Horror \u2013 Restless</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Hall and Oates, Pharrell Williams, Terence Trent Darby</p> <p>In 2019, the gap between \u201clegitimate, club-filling disco banger\u201d and \u201cMichael McDonald-inspired yacht rock that your dad would smoke cigars to in ball-squashing short shorts\u201d is a negligible one.

This is a mix of the Daria soundtrack, chart-friendly bubblegum pop, riot grrrl records, films starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, the music that Evan Dando\u2019s many muses would create and tunes that you first heard from all-girl punk bands that play all-ages shows at the local PCYC.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Ali Barter\u2019s new album Hello, I\u2019m Doing My Best is out 18 October, which she\u2019ll follow with a national tour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8eacc5400ec9830138c7ea14578718d13ab2bb0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8eacc5400ec9830138c7ea14578718d13ab2bb0b/0_0_2902_2177/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian singer-songwriter Ali Barter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian singer-songwriter Ali Barter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kane Hibberd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Pluto Jonze \u2013 I\u2019ll Try Anything</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Tame Impala, White Fence, Liam Gallagher</p> <p>I\u2019ll Try Anything sounds like vintage Lennon.

      "bodyText": "Montaigne \u2013 Ready For fans of: Sarah Blasko, Lorde, Sia Ready continues Montaigne\u2019s heady ascent into the realm of fully formed pop queens. This song hits all the right notes, with the avant-garde appeal and sturdy song craft of Sarah Blasko and Lorde, the unapologetically commercial sensibilities of Sia, and an absolute onslaught of impossibly high notes and Idol-worthy moments that the likes of Pink and Katy Perry repeatedly reach for. The difference is Montaigne reaches them. Simply put: forget community radio play. This song needs to start being spun on the hour, every hour, on the types of commercial radio stations that employ garishly painted Thunder-trucks to lap the city streets, giving away petrol vouchers and icy cold cans of Coke. This is a world-beating tune. For more: Montaigne\u2019s album Complex is out 30 August. She\u2019ll be touring Australia in November. Stephen Cummings \u2013 Shifting Heavy Circles For fans of: the Sports, the Modern Lovers, Bob Dylan Trying to sum up the quintessential sound of Stephen Cummings is a fruitless task. There\u2019s the tight Elvis Costello strut of his late-70s new wave group the Sports; the cabaret wanderings and dancefloor flirtations of his work in the 80s, and a run of successful largely acoustic confessionals throughout the 90s. Now there is this, the latest single plucked from the Melbourne musician\u2019s 20th solo album Prisoner Of Love. Shifting Heavy Circles is a swaggering rock\u2019n\u2019roll song, the type they made before metronomes were used, when the first take was the only take. The playing and the production are taut and economical, with a snaking backwards guitar solo the only concession to production trickery. Cummings\u2019 wayward and untreated vocal is pushed to the forefront, to great effect. He sounds at turns energised and world-weary, skipping over the syllables like Bob Dylan before he found religion. Regardless of the lyrics\u2019 literal meaning, the feeling comes across loud and clear: the mechanics of day-to-day life is a load we have to bear. Bemoaning daily drudgery is a time-honoured rock trope \u2013 and it will continue to be until both rock\u2019n\u2019roll and the 40-hour week die merciful deaths. For more: Prisoner of Love is out now, as is a 50-song anthology, A Life Is A Life, spanning all 20 of his solo records. Baker Boy \u2013 In Control For fans of: Kendrick Lamar, Anderson Paak, A Tribe Called Quest Baker Boy is in the middle of a purple patch that shows no signs of slowing \u2013 and In Control is another instant earworm. Over a vamping musical bed that sits somewhere between ABC by Jackson 5 and Livin It Up by Ja Rule, Baker Boy weaves a tale of resilience and bravery that acts as a bellwether without overly preaching or teaching. The cute crowd participation is courtesy of the kids at Thornbury primary school, furthering Baker Boy\u2019s mission to create inclusive, non-compromising music aimed squarely at the masses while incorporating the local community, his native Yol\u014bu Matha, and an infectious confidence that has had the current Young Australian of the Year already break down a number of barriers that sadly still stand in the way of so many Australians. Sonically, he continues to lean on the spitfire delivery of Kendrick Lamar while adopting the carefree bravado of Kanye West. \u201cI am in control,\u201d Baker Boy declares in the chorus \u2013 and we have no reason to doubt it. For more: Baker Boy will be performing at Yours &amp; Owls festival in Wollongong in NSW in October, and at the free Palmy Street Party on 20 July for Youth Week in Palmerston, Northern Territory.

For more: Check out the band\u2019s 2017 EP The Shapes for more of this breezy sound. Ali Barter \u2013 Backseat For fans of: Flop, Le Tigre, Juliana Hatfield Ali Barter\u2019s music sounds like the soundtrack to a 90s misspent in the suburbs while dreaming of skyscrapers: the lives led by pre-net teenagers who relied on monthly magazines, friends\u2019 older siblings and late-night Rage for a glimpse into what those in the \u201creal world\u201d were getting up to.

Kimmince\u2019s current author of choice for those bath retreats is Michelle Obama, someone who could pass on a lot of lessons about dreaming big and getting there.",

And other recalls have been issued for Jeep and Dodge cars, with faults that could cause the windshield to detach, and issues with braking. The 2019 Mazda 3 hatchback has an issue with the wheel studs that connect the wheels to the car. According to a statement from Mazda, \u201crattling noise occurs prior to a wheel detachment from the vehicle\u201d. There are 3,323 cars affected, sold between 8 April and 21 June 2019. Drivers can check their car on the Mazda site, using their vehicle identification number, which can be found on the user manual \u2013 not on the license plate. Repairs will come at no extra cost. At the same time, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also issued recalls for older Jeep and Dodge cars, made between 2007 and 2010. The faults range from the windshield falling off to the brakes failing. This includes the Jeep Cherokee between 2008-2010, Jeep Compass 2007, the Dodge Caliber 2007, Dodge Nitro 2007-2009 and Dodge RAM 2010. Product Safety Australia said that, for the Mazda 3, \u201cduring manufacture, wheel studs may not have been fully seated\u201d. \u201cA small gap may exist between the wheel studs and the hub assembly. Continued use of the vehicle may cause: the wheel nuts to loosen [and] a knocking or clunking noise. \u201cThe stability of the vehicle may be affected, increasing the risk of loss of vehicle control and potentially resulting in an accident injuring vehicle occupants and other road users.\u201d For the Jeep and Dodge cars, Product Safety Australia said the problems ranged from braking issues to incorrect numbers on the tyre placard. The Jeep Cherokee 2010 model has a fault where the brake pedal linkage clip \u201cmay have been manufactured incorrectly\u201d, the recall said. \u201cA defective or missing brake pedal linkage clip could cause the brake booster input rod to detach from the brake pedal. \u201cIf the brake booster rod detaches from the brake pedal, the vehicle may lose its service brakes, increasing the risk of an accident that may cause injury to the vehicle occupants and other road users.\u201d The fault affects 55 vehicles. The Jeep Compass and Dodge Caliber 2007 models have an issue where \u201clength of the rear wheel hub mounting bolts may prevent use of the park brake\u201d. The fault affects 20 vehicles. The Jeep Cherokee 2008 model has a fault where \u201cthe windshield and/or quarter glass may have been installed using an incorrect urethane adhesive\u201d. This means \u201cthe glass can separate from the vehicle while driving\u201d. It affects 12 vehicles.",

When discussions arise regarding content, practices, policies and support within Australian schools it is important that historical and ongoing structural racism and discrimination are considered and included within the dialogue. In order to have honest and open discussions around the future of education, we must engage in questioning what the purpose of schooling is and ensure we have a shared understanding of the history of the schooling systems. Within New South Wales, where I reside and where I was originally trained as a school teacher, the formal education system has evolved from a foundation which at first was designed to exclude Indigenous children, and later was used to attempt to erase their culture and identity.

Repeatedly we see throughout the historical records that formal education was created and used as a weapon to disrupt Indigenous families, culture and sovereignty. Schooling not only perpetuated the myths of terra nullius and Indigenous \u201csavagery\u201d to non-Indigenous students and society, it also acted as a site of forcible removal for those who we now refer to as members of the Stolen Generations. Policy proposals which emphasise good intentions still need to be scrutinised, and such scrutiny must take place through more than a white, wealthy gaze. Another simple example of how schooling unfairly impacted Indigenous peoples include the exclusion on demand policy. In place until the 1970s, this empowered school principals to expel Indigenous students based on nothing more than a request from a non-indigenous student\u2019s parent or caregiver. While this policy has negatively impacted generationally on Indigenous families, it is also worth reflecting on what such a policy taught the non-Indigenous staff, students and community of the day. To have honest conversations around education we must acknowledge that Australian societal attitudes and understanding of the sovereign people of this land are not purely reflective of an innate racism, but of racism which has been taught overtly and covertly through political, media and formal educational systems. While some might argue this is \u201cin the past\u201d, there has not been a huge \u201creset\u201d button \u2013 schools which were literally and figuratively built in the 19th and 20th century still stand and operate today. While there have been notable improvements since the 1970s in terms of access and curriculum content, thanks to concerted campaigning and engagement by community members and organisations such as the Aboriginal Education Consultative Group, the fact remains that the structure of schooling, what is valued and how it is delivered and measured remains heavily Eurocentric. Indigenous students\u2019 engagement, attendance and \u201csuccess\u201d within schooling is measured against their non-Indigenous peers, within a primarily Eurocentric system, as though these assessments and values take place within a vacuum. Indigenous children are growing up being over-policed, over-incarcerated and forcibly removed from family in numbers higher now than during the period now known as the Stolen Generations. These figures are representative of the systems being imposed upon us, not an internal deficit or a deficiency within Indigenous culture. I spoke with Tim Ireland, the CEO of AbSec, the peak body for Aboriginal children, families and communities in NSW, who said: While the stated intent might have changed, the result remains the same. More Aboriginal children are separated from their families than ever before. This will not change until Aboriginal-led solutions and decisions are backed by government. If we want to see an end to Aboriginal children being separated from their families in their thousands, governments must finally back Aboriginal communities to build a better system. These figures, this history, is not a secret and while I am here writing about the problems, it is important that you understand that the solutions have already been put forward in numerous reports, inquiries and commissions. They\u2019re just not being implemented by those with the power to do so. These systems are not accidental. Platitudes and declarations of good intentions by those in power mirror the same approach recorded of government and departmental policy through the era of the Stolen Generations. It is time for those in positions of power to put their ego and cheques to the side and implement the recommendations they repeatedly choose to ignore \u2013 including those made in the Bringing Them Home Report. If you want to \u201cclose the gap\u201d between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children in the classroom, then you need to close the gap of how they are treated on the street.
