      "body": "<p>\u201cLet me take you down, \u2019cause I\u2019m going to Strawberry Fields\u201d urged John Lennon in 1967. Now, for the first time, everyone will be able to walk in his footsteps, when the gardens immortalised in the classic Beatles song are opened to the public on 14 September, alongside a new visitors\u2019 centre, cafe and shop. </p> <p>Housed in a sleek, modern, light-filled building, it is a stark contrast to the original Gothic mansion that stood there when Lennon was a young boy and would bunk over the wall to climb trees and play hide-and-seek in its garden. Built in 1878 for a shipping magnate in the wealthy Liverpool suburb of Woolton (the family of prime minister William Gladstone lived nearby, in another long-gone pile) it was bought by the Salvation Army in 1934 and turned into a children\u2019s home.</p> <p>Lennon lived round the corner with his Uncle George and Aunt Mimi, and as well as sneaking into the garden with friends, he loved the summer fete held at Strawberry Field<strong> </strong>(in the singular, Lennon added the \u201cs\u201d). His aunt once recalled: \u201cAs soon as we could hear the Salvation Army band starting, John would jump up and down shouting, \u2018Mimi, come on. We\u2019re going to be late!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d8dc0cdec0e6f02440613df2c8b5cb142edac9da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8dc0cdec0e6f02440613df2c8b5cb142edac9da/0_0_4440_2664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Strawberry Fields visitor Centre and Exhibition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The interactive exhibition, including a projection of the original Strawberry Field mansion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gavin Trafford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Years later, Lennon took this nostalgic post-war memory of summer tea parties and brass bands and, through the prism of psychedelia and LSD, used it as the inspiration for one of the most groundbreaking songs of the 1960s. The Beatles spent a then unheard-of 55 hours of studio time on the record, creating what Time magazine called a song of \u201castonishing inventiveness\u201d, adding, the band \u201chave bridged the heretofore impassable gap between rock and classical, mixing elements of Bach, Oriental and electronic music with vintage twang to achieve the most compellingly original sounds ever heard in pop music.\u201d</p> <p>The old house was demolished six years after the song\u2019s release, and replaced by a smaller children\u2019s home, which closed for good in 2005. But the locked gates didn\u2019t deter Beatles fans turning up to peek through at the overgrown Strawberry Field \u2013 the Liverpool tourist board estimated that about 60,000 visitors did so last year.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/285935789\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"300\" width=\"400\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/285935789?app_id=122963\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The Beatles Strawberry Fields Forever promotional film, shot in Knole Park, Sevenoaks, Kent.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Owned and run by the Salvation Army, the attraction gives fans access to the last major missing piece in the Beatles jigsaw: the band has been so forensically analysed \u2013 with books chronicling every day of their existence and every note of music. Income generated from the exhibition will fund the charity\u2019s Steps to Work programme, which helps young people with learning disabilities find employment through training, mentoring and work experience.<br></p> <p>The interactive exhibition (adults \u00a312.95, concessions \u00a38, family of 3+2 \u00a335) explores the history of both the Salvation Army and Lennon\u2019s life, focusing on his childhood and the writing and recording of Strawberry Fields through archival footage, multimedia and interviews with Paul McCartney, George Martin and Julia Baird, his younger half-sister and president of the project. The most fun feature is the virtual Mellotron that teaches visitors to play the song\u2019s unmistakable opening notes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0840378f120e6e4947830511c7a9381d41c7a19f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0840378f120e6e4947830511c7a9381d41c7a19f/0_145_5359_3216/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Strawberry Fields visitor Centre and Exhibition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The visitor centre and garden.

The originals were stolen in 2000 but when the crime made the news the thieves realised what they had on their hands and dumped the gates at a local scrap metal merchant, who returned them the following day. Kept in storage ever since, they will now sit in a quiet corner of the garden, while the heavily-graffitied replicas \u2013 the site of a million selfies \u2013 will remain in place on the road at the former entrance.</p> <p>The smart red-and-white cafe and landscaped gardens are free to enter, the latter designed to encourage meditation and spiritual reflection. The trees Lennon may once have climbed are still here, and in a clever touch, sections of the original mansion walls and steps (made from the same local red sandstone as Liverpool\u2019s Anglican cathedral) are scattered around the garden, to be used as benches.</p> <p>Lennon\u2019s sister, Julia Baird, 72, who is honorary president of the Strawberry Field project, said the grounds of the home had been a \u201csanctuary\u201d for the musician as a youngster.</p> <p>She said: \u201cI suppose as children we all have somewhere that\u2019s a bit ours, a bit special. It might be a little hidey-hole under the stairs or it might be up an oak tree but it\u2019s somewhere we take ourselves. It seems from the song that this was John\u2019s special place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe first time I visited John in New York I was struck just how closely his gothic Dakota Apartment building resembled the old Strawberry Field mansion. Perhaps he was searching for another sanctuary.\u201d<br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://www.strawberryfieldliverpool.com/strawberry-field-exhibition\">strawberryfieldliverpool.com</a></em></p> <h2><strong>MAGICAL HISTORY TOUR: five more Fab sites</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Where they grew up</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3b10ede48d8dde7d02c686171556eda442312f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3b10ede48d8dde7d02c686171556eda442312f4/0_0_2464_1478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The lounge at \u2018Mendips\u2019, the childhood home of former Beatle, John Lennon in Liverpool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The lounge at \u2018Mendips\u2019, the childhood home of John Lennon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The childhood homes of John and Paul have been painstakingly restored by the National Trust to look almost exactly as they did in the 1950s. There is quite a contrast between Paul\u2019s modest council house and John\u2019s large middle-class semi, though the respective bedrooms \u2013 where John wrote Please, Please Me and his partner first strummed Love Me Do \u2013 are very similar. The attention to detail creates a wonderfully intimate atmosphere but what really brings the houses to life are the cracking family tales told by the guide/custodians: Sylvia at Paul\u2019s and her husband Colin at John\u2019s. At Paul\u2019s house, even the aromas of the period have somehow been preserved: as I walked in I was instantly transported back to my great-aunts\u2019 front parlours of the early 1970s.<br>\u2022 <em>Entrance by tour only, booking essential, adult \u00a325, child \u00a312.50 (\u00a39.50/\u00a34.75 for Trust members), <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/beatles-childhood-homes/features/visit-the-beatles-childhood-homes\">nationaltrust.org.uk</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Where they met</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"158ff8599fa00a2421d9e91bc6c80136806fb7ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/158ff8599fa00a2421d9e91bc6c80136806fb7ea/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The headstone of Eleanor Rigby in the cemetery of St. Peter\u2019s Church, Woolton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The headstone of Eleanor Rigby in the cemetery of St. Peter\u2019s Church, Woolton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gavin McOwan/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lennon and McCartney famously met on July 6, 1957 at a summer fete at <a href=\"https://www.stpeters-woolton.org.uk/the-beatles-connection/\">St Peter\u2019s Church</a> in Woolton, when Paul was introduced to John and his ragtag skiffle band, the Quarrymen. He impressed John with his superior playing of rock\u2019n\u2019roll numbers and was invited to join the group soon after. The church hall is occasionally open to visitors for tours and events, especially during <a href=\"https://www.internationalbeatleweek.com/\">Beatle Week</a>, but perhaps of more interest is the gravestone of Eleanor Rigby (1894-1939) in the church cemetery over the road. While Paul has always denied the headstone inspired his 1966 composition, it is hard to believe he didn\u2019t clock the name at some point, at least subconsciously \u2013 a mystery which adds a layer of intrigue to the song. Football fans should also look out for the grave of Liverpool legend Bob Paisley, the most successful manager in the history of English football.</p> <h2><strong>Where they started out</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2060e62d1b6981f2fdfae24e0dafbf5a6e1cb0c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2060e62d1b6981f2fdfae24e0dafbf5a6e1cb0c4/0_0_3140_2034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul McCartney on John Lennon, then still known as the Quarrymen perform at their first concert at the Casbah Coffee House on August 29, 1959 in Liverpool, England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul and John at the Quarrymen\u2019s first concert at the Casbah Coffee House, on August 29, 1959.

It\u2019s a far more atmospheric venue than the Cavern Club, the DIY interior has hardly been touched since the Quarrymen/Beatles played here. In fact the handiwork Paul refers to is still on show, inches above your head on the low basement ceilings that Mona ordered them to paint, as well as a silhouette of John on the wall by his wife-to-be Cynthia. Because they were done in lead-based paint, they have stood the test of time. The Casbah is run by Pete\u2019s younger brother, Roag, who is also the founder and curator of the <a href=\"https://magicalbeatlesmuseum.com/\">Magical Beatles Museum</a>, which opened in Mathew Street last year. Growing up around the band and later writing about them, he has amassed an enormous personal collection of Beatles memorabilia, which has been intelligently curated here.<br>\u2022 <em>One-hour Casbah tours by arrangement, adults \u00a315, 10-16s \u00a37.50, under 10s free.

But it\u2019s not all peace, love and bed-ins at posh hotels. Given how protective Yoko has been of John\u2019s legacy it seems surprising that she agreed to include recollections of their split in the 1970s; and one extract, about her husband\u2019s infidelity at a party they arrived at together, really does show a differnet side of the man..<br><em>\u2022 Entrance free, <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/double-fantasy/\">liverpoolmuseums.org.uk</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Where to stay</strong></h2> <p>The Hard Days Night Hotel in the city centre, around the corner from the Cavern, is the place for the full Fab experience.

      "bodyText": "\u201cLet me take you down, \u2019cause I\u2019m going to Strawberry Fields\u201d urged John Lennon in 1967. Now, for the first time, everyone will be able to walk in his footsteps, when the gardens immortalised in the classic Beatles song are opened to the public on 14 September, alongside a new visitors\u2019 centre, cafe and shop. Housed in a sleek, modern, light-filled building, it is a stark contrast to the original Gothic mansion that stood there when Lennon was a young boy and would bunk over the wall to climb trees and play hide-and-seek in its garden. Built in 1878 for a shipping magnate in the wealthy Liverpool suburb of Woolton (the family of prime minister William Gladstone lived nearby, in another long-gone pile) it was bought by the Salvation Army in 1934 and turned into a children\u2019s home. Lennon lived round the corner with his Uncle George and Aunt Mimi, and as well as sneaking into the garden with friends, he loved the summer fete held at Strawberry Field (in the singular, Lennon added the \u201cs\u201d). His aunt once recalled: \u201cAs soon as we could hear the Salvation Army band starting, John would jump up and down shouting, \u2018Mimi, come on. We\u2019re going to be late!\u2019\u201d Years later, Lennon took this nostalgic post-war memory of summer tea parties and brass bands and, through the prism of psychedelia and LSD, used it as the inspiration for one of the most groundbreaking songs of the 1960s. The Beatles spent a then unheard-of 55 hours of studio time on the record, creating what Time magazine called a song of \u201castonishing inventiveness\u201d, adding, the band \u201chave bridged the heretofore impassable gap between rock and classical, mixing elements of Bach, Oriental and electronic music with vintage twang to achieve the most compellingly original sounds ever heard in pop music.\u201d The old house was demolished six years after the song\u2019s release, and replaced by a smaller children\u2019s home, which closed for good in 2005. But the locked gates didn\u2019t deter Beatles fans turning up to peek through at the overgrown Strawberry Field \u2013 the Liverpool tourist board estimated that about 60,000 visitors did so last year. Owned and run by the Salvation Army, the attraction gives fans access to the last major missing piece in the Beatles jigsaw: the band has been so forensically analysed \u2013 with books chronicling every day of their existence and every note of music. Income generated from the exhibition will fund the charity\u2019s Steps to Work programme, which helps young people with learning disabilities find employment through training, mentoring and work experience. The interactive exhibition (adults \u00a312.95, concessions \u00a38, family of 3+2 \u00a335) explores the history of both the Salvation Army and Lennon\u2019s life, focusing on his childhood and the writing and recording of Strawberry Fields through archival footage, multimedia and interviews with Paul McCartney, George Martin and Julia Baird, his younger half-sister and president of the project. The most fun feature is the virtual Mellotron that teaches visitors to play the song\u2019s unmistakable opening notes. Another star attraction is the set of iconic wrought-iron red gates \u2013 or rather, both sets. The originals were stolen in 2000 but when the crime made the news the thieves realised what they had on their hands and dumped the gates at a local scrap metal merchant, who returned them the following day. Kept in storage ever since, they will now sit in a quiet corner of the garden, while the heavily-graffitied replicas \u2013 the site of a million selfies \u2013 will remain in place on the road at the former entrance. The smart red-and-white cafe and landscaped gardens are free to enter, the latter designed to encourage meditation and spiritual reflection. The trees Lennon may once have climbed are still here, and in a clever touch, sections of the original mansion walls and steps (made from the same local red sandstone as Liverpool\u2019s Anglican cathedral) are scattered around the garden, to be used as benches. Lennon\u2019s sister, Julia Baird, 72, who is honorary president of the Strawberry Field project, said the grounds of the home had been a \u201csanctuary\u201d for the musician as a youngster. She said: \u201cI suppose as children we all have somewhere that\u2019s a bit ours, a bit special. It might be a little hidey-hole under the stairs or it might be up an oak tree but it\u2019s somewhere we take ourselves. It seems from the song that this was John\u2019s special place.\u201d \u201cThe first time I visited John in New York I was struck just how closely his gothic Dakota Apartment building resembled the old Strawberry Field mansion. Perhaps he was searching for another sanctuary.\u201d \u2022 strawberryfieldliverpool.com MAGICAL HISTORY TOUR: five more Fab sites Where they grew up The childhood homes of John and Paul have been painstakingly restored by the National Trust to look almost exactly as they did in the 1950s. There is quite a contrast between Paul\u2019s modest council house and John\u2019s large middle-class semi, though the respective bedrooms \u2013 where John wrote Please, Please Me and his partner first strummed Love Me Do \u2013 are very similar. The attention to detail creates a wonderfully intimate atmosphere but what really brings the houses to life are the cracking family tales told by the guide/custodians: Sylvia at Paul\u2019s and her husband Colin at John\u2019s. At Paul\u2019s house, even the aromas of the period have somehow been preserved: as I walked in I was instantly transported back to my great-aunts\u2019 front parlours of the early 1970s. \u2022 Entrance by tour only, booking essential, adult \u00a325, child \u00a312.50 (\u00a39.50/\u00a34.75 for Trust members), nationaltrust.org.uk Where they met Lennon and McCartney famously met on July 6, 1957 at a summer fete at St Peter\u2019s Church in Woolton, when Paul was introduced to John and his ragtag skiffle band, the Quarrymen. He impressed John with his superior playing of rock\u2019n\u2019roll numbers and was invited to join the group soon after. The church hall is occasionally open to visitors for tours and events, especially during Beatle Week, but perhaps of more interest is the gravestone of Eleanor Rigby (1894-1939) in the church cemetery over the road. While Paul has always denied the headstone inspired his 1966 composition, it is hard to believe he didn\u2019t clock the name at some point, at least subconsciously \u2013 a mystery which adds a layer of intrigue to the song. Football fans should also look out for the grave of Liverpool legend Bob Paisley, the most successful manager in the history of English football. Where they started out \u201cPeople know about the Cavern ... but the Casbah was the place where it all started,\u201d Paul McCartney has said. \u201cWe helped paint it and stuff. We looked upon it as our personal club.\u201d The Casbah Coffee Club was opened in 1959 by Mona Best, mother of the band\u2019s original drummer, Pete, in the basement of their large house in West Derby. It\u2019s a far more atmospheric venue than the Cavern Club, the DIY interior has hardly been touched since the Quarrymen/Beatles played here. In fact the handiwork Paul refers to is still on show, inches above your head on the low basement ceilings that Mona ordered them to paint, as well as a silhouette of John on the wall by his wife-to-be Cynthia. Because they were done in lead-based paint, they have stood the test of time. The Casbah is run by Pete\u2019s younger brother, Roag, who is also the founder and curator of the Magical Beatles Museum, which opened in Mathew Street last year. Growing up around the band and later writing about them, he has amassed an enormous personal collection of Beatles memorabilia, which has been intelligently curated here. \u2022 One-hour Casbah tours by arrangement, adults \u00a315, 10-16s \u00a37.50, under 10s free.

They\u2019ve not won there since Steve Watson knocked Roy Evans\u2019s side out of the League Cup in 1995; they\u2019ve not tasted league victory there since Andrew Cole and Robert Lee secured a 2-0 win in 1994. It\u2019s been mainly defeats ever since, though they did get a point three years ago against a starting XI featuring Alberto Moreno, Connor Randall and Kevin Stewart. The Magpies won\u2019t be flying down the A1 with too much hope in their hearts, then. Liverpool are on a 13-match Premier League winning run, and Mo Salah and Sadio Man\u00e9 have had their feet up during the international break. <strong>SM</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;number=1995&amp;title=Newcastle%20last%20won%20at%20Anfield%2024%20years%20ago\" data-alt=\"1995: Newcastle last won at Anfield 24 years ago\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=Sport&number=1995&title=Newcastle%20last%20won%20at%20Anfield%2024%20years%20ago\">1995: Newcastle last won at Anfield 24 years ago</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>2) \u2026 but their manager may have a workable plan</strong></h2> <p>But here\u2019s a sliver of historical hope for the Toon! Steve Bruce has masterminded six wins from 24 over Liverpool during his managerial career, not a bad return for a journeyman usually working with modest resources. His 25% success rate might not sound super-promising, but look at it this way: a one-in-four shout is a big improvement on the bookies\u2019 odds of 14-1. It\u2019s also exactly the same win ratio against the Reds achieved by a certain Rafa Ben\u00edtez, and nobody would be writing off one of his sides completely. Some straw-clutching? Perhaps \u2026 but then no one thought Bruce\u2019s Birmingham would win at Anfield in 2004 either, and look what happened there. <strong>SM</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e89cb2b3a0686bda1e1b79c61af600a16effc37a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e89cb2b3a0686bda1e1b79c61af600a16effc37a/0_54_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Bruce\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Bruce: Anfield miracle worker?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Mayhew/Sportsphoto/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Attack remains best form of defence for Norwich</h2> <p>Manchester City\u2019s visit to Carrow Road has the potential to make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/10/england-kosovo-euro-2020-qualifying-match-report\">England 5-3 Kosovo</a> feel like a study in <em>catenaccio</em> and the odds on another thriller can only have shortened in light of the Canaries\u2019 injury woes. Christoph Zimmermann has joined Timm Klose on the sidelines while doubts over Grant Hanley\u2019s fitness, leave them worryingly thin at centre-back. Max Aarons, the outstanding right-back, also looks likely to miss out after injuring his ankle on England Under-21 duty and the only blessing might be that defending hardly seems Norwich\u2019s priority at the best of times. Matches such as Saturday\u2019s assume free-hit status for Daniel Farke\u2019s side and the expectation is that they will look to exploit any City weaknesses \u2013 occasionally suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/31/manchester-city-brighton-premier-league-match-report\">by Brighton a fortnight ago</a> \u2013 by playing their usual front-footed game. The danger is that they risk the kind of hiding they took <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/liverpool-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report\">at Liverpool</a>, and a team can only take so many if they are to retain their sparkle. Perhaps Farke might have looked to tighten things up given a clean bill of health; in the event Norwich probably have no choice but to pour forward again. <strong>NA</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2019/sep/12/england-and-kosovo-thrill-scotland-slump-and-marvin-sordell-football-weekly-extra\">England and Kosovo thrill, Scotland slump and Marvin Sordell \u2013\u00a0Football Weekly Extra</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>4) The first six-pointer of the season?</strong></h2> <p>Is it too early for a relegation six-pointer? Hell, it\u2019s never too early for a relegation six-pointer. Both Brighton and Burnley flew out of the traps on the opening day with three-goal wins, but since then it\u2019s been a bit of a struggle. Six matches between them have produced two points and three goals. The Clarets can point to a few caveats: they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/17/arsenal-burnley-premier-league-match-report\">fought hard at Arsenal</a>, nearly ground out a win <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/25/wolves-burnley-premier-league-match-report\">at Wolves</a>, and nobody gets much from Liverpool right now. The Seagulls by comparison couldn\u2019t be expected to get anything at Manchester City, it\u2019s true, but a supine loss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/24/brighton-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">at home to a stuttering Southampton</a> was more of a worry. This might not be a classic \u2013 three of the last four matches between these sides have ended 0-0, 0-0 and 1-0 \u2013 so remember to thank us for tempting fate when it ends 3-3. <strong>SM</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c220cd65135a608cd6875ba3cdd890bf53c3e454\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c220cd65135a608cd6875ba3cdd890bf53c3e454/0_426_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Davies attempts a scissor kick in England training.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Davies is a regular for England\u2019s under-21 side, but is struggling for game time at Everton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Keogh for The FA/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5) Davies running out of chances at Everton?</h2> <p>Everton splashed out more than \u00a3115m this summer, signing three midfielders \u2013 Andr\u00e9 Gomes, Jean-Philippe Gbamin and Fabian Delph \u2013 and while new faces have undoubtedly helped reinvigorate his squad, it has created something of a roadblock for Tom Davies. Since 7 February the Liverpudlian, who joined the club as an 11-year-old, has played more minutes for the England Under-21s than he has Everton. On the face of it, the \u00a330m sale of Idrissa Gueye to PSG seemed to play into Davies\u2019s hands while Gbamin, a \u00a325m recruit from Mainz, is expected to be out until November with a thigh injury. First-team chances have remained hard to come by, with Morgan Schneiderlin\u2019s renaissance pushing him further down the pecking order. Another home-grown midfielder, Kieran Dowell, and the full-back Jonjoe Kenny departed on loan in search of game time and perhaps Davies will soon have to follow suit. <strong>BF</strong></p> <h2><strong>6) The Premier League crisis baton, part one</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s way too early for any club to be in full-blown crisis mode. But you know how folk are, and a couple of slow-starting big clubs might find themselves under pressure should things not go their way this weekend. Unbeaten Leicester City are everyone\u2019s tip to break up the Champions League cartel, and midfield maestro James Maddison has had a fortnight conserving his energy on England\u2019s bench. The Foxes haven\u2019t won at Old Trafford since Tony Cottee scored a first-half winner in 1998, and with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side currently partying like it\u2019s 1962, they might not have a better chance to end that barren run for a while. Should they frustrate the hosts, expect the wholly unreasonable noise around Manchester United \u2013 a team right at the start of a rebuild \u2013 to get a little louder. <strong>SM</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6f7035675834e7bfa1a125daa33be0892b44a6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6f7035675834e7bfa1a125daa33be0892b44a6a/0_148_3036_1822/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r will be keen to avoid another defeat at Old Trafford, following the loss to Crystal Palace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r will be keen to avoid another defeat at Old Trafford, following the loss to Crystal Palace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>7) The Premier League crisis baton, part two</strong></h2> <p>Or perhaps it will be Tottenham who\u2019ll feel the full force of some confected crisis instead.

Well, up to a point. Watford being Watford, only six of the players Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores managed in his previous spell are still on the scene so it may take time before he is fully reacquainted with the place he describes as \u201cmy home\u201d. It was no surprise Watford\u2019s owners <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/07/watford-sack-head-coach-javi-gracia-after-poor-start-to-the-season\">blinked at the first sign of trouble</a> for Javi Gracia and it would take some bravery to predict Flores\u2019s return lasting longer than his previous 11-and-a-half-month tenure. He has a tough job and, given Manchester City await after Arsenal, things may deteriorate before he can steady the ship. Even if he is not familiar with most of his new charges yet, one of them knows Sunday\u2019s opponents especially well. Danny Welbeck was eased back by Gracia, having missed most of last season. But 90 minutes in last month\u2019s League Cup win over Coventry boded well and a fortnight\u2019s training over the international break cannot have hurt.

      "bodyText": "1) Newcastle travel to Anfield without much hope \u2026 Newcastle don\u2019t have much of a record at Anfield. They\u2019ve not won there since Steve Watson knocked Roy Evans\u2019s side out of the League Cup in 1995; they\u2019ve not tasted league victory there since Andrew Cole and Robert Lee secured a 2-0 win in 1994. It\u2019s been mainly defeats ever since, though they did get a point three years ago against a starting XI featuring Alberto Moreno, Connor Randall and Kevin Stewart. The Magpies won\u2019t be flying down the A1 with too much hope in their hearts, then. Liverpool are on a 13-match Premier League winning run, and Mo Salah and Sadio Man\u00e9 have had their feet up during the international break. SM 2) \u2026 but their manager may have a workable plan But here\u2019s a sliver of historical hope for the Toon! Steve Bruce has masterminded six wins from 24 over Liverpool during his managerial career, not a bad return for a journeyman usually working with modest resources. His 25% success rate might not sound super-promising, but look at it this way: a one-in-four shout is a big improvement on the bookies\u2019 odds of 14-1. It\u2019s also exactly the same win ratio against the Reds achieved by a certain Rafa Ben\u00edtez, and nobody would be writing off one of his sides completely. Some straw-clutching? Perhaps \u2026 but then no one thought Bruce\u2019s Birmingham would win at Anfield in 2004 either, and look what happened there. SM 3) Attack remains best form of defence for Norwich Manchester City\u2019s visit to Carrow Road has the potential to make England 5-3 Kosovo feel like a study in catenaccio and the odds on another thriller can only have shortened in light of the Canaries\u2019 injury woes. Christoph Zimmermann has joined Timm Klose on the sidelines while doubts over Grant Hanley\u2019s fitness, leave them worryingly thin at centre-back. Max Aarons, the outstanding right-back, also looks likely to miss out after injuring his ankle on England Under-21 duty and the only blessing might be that defending hardly seems Norwich\u2019s priority at the best of times. Matches such as Saturday\u2019s assume free-hit status for Daniel Farke\u2019s side and the expectation is that they will look to exploit any City weaknesses \u2013 occasionally suggested by Brighton a fortnight ago \u2013 by playing their usual front-footed game. The danger is that they risk the kind of hiding they took at Liverpool, and a team can only take so many if they are to retain their sparkle. Perhaps Farke might have looked to tighten things up given a clean bill of health; in the event Norwich probably have no choice but to pour forward again. NA 4) The first six-pointer of the season? Is it too early for a relegation six-pointer? Hell, it\u2019s never too early for a relegation six-pointer. Both Brighton and Burnley flew out of the traps on the opening day with three-goal wins, but since then it\u2019s been a bit of a struggle. Six matches between them have produced two points and three goals. The Clarets can point to a few caveats: they fought hard at Arsenal, nearly ground out a win at Wolves, and nobody gets much from Liverpool right now. The Seagulls by comparison couldn\u2019t be expected to get anything at Manchester City, it\u2019s true, but a supine loss at home to a stuttering Southampton was more of a worry. This might not be a classic \u2013 three of the last four matches between these sides have ended 0-0, 0-0 and 1-0 \u2013 so remember to thank us for tempting fate when it ends 3-3. SM 5) Davies running out of chances at Everton? Everton splashed out more than \u00a3115m this summer, signing three midfielders \u2013 Andr\u00e9 Gomes, Jean-Philippe Gbamin and Fabian Delph \u2013 and while new faces have undoubtedly helped reinvigorate his squad, it has created something of a roadblock for Tom Davies. Since 7 February the Liverpudlian, who joined the club as an 11-year-old, has played more minutes for the England Under-21s than he has Everton. On the face of it, the \u00a330m sale of Idrissa Gueye to PSG seemed to play into Davies\u2019s hands while Gbamin, a \u00a325m recruit from Mainz, is expected to be out until November with a thigh injury. First-team chances have remained hard to come by, with Morgan Schneiderlin\u2019s renaissance pushing him further down the pecking order. Another home-grown midfielder, Kieran Dowell, and the full-back Jonjoe Kenny departed on loan in search of game time and perhaps Davies will soon have to follow suit. BF 6) The Premier League crisis baton, part one It\u2019s way too early for any club to be in full-blown crisis mode. But you know how folk are, and a couple of slow-starting big clubs might find themselves under pressure should things not go their way this weekend. Unbeaten Leicester City are everyone\u2019s tip to break up the Champions League cartel, and midfield maestro James Maddison has had a fortnight conserving his energy on England\u2019s bench. The Foxes haven\u2019t won at Old Trafford since Tony Cottee scored a first-half winner in 1998, and with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side currently partying like it\u2019s 1962, they might not have a better chance to end that barren run for a while. Should they frustrate the hosts, expect the wholly unreasonable noise around Manchester United \u2013 a team right at the start of a rebuild \u2013 to get a little louder. SM 7) The Premier League crisis baton, part two Or perhaps it will be Tottenham who\u2019ll feel the full force of some confected crisis instead. Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side are understandably suffering from a little post-Madrid hangover, the disappointment of coming so close in the Champions League still very real. They should have enough to see off Crystal Palace \u2013 they\u2019ve won their past six league meetings, and were excellent while going two up at Arsenal a fortnight ago. On the other hand, they let that lead against the Gunners slip, went down in their last home match to Newcastle, and Palace are flying after their confidence-boosting smash-and-grab at Old Trafford three weeks ago. Should Palace take the lead \u2013 and remember how Spurs struggled in the main after falling behind against Aston Villa \u2013 Spurs could get a little agitated. Should Palace frustrate the hosts, here comes some more of that wholly unreasonable noise! SM 8) Welbeck gamble could give Flores a glorious return Meet the new boss, same as the old boss? Well, up to a point. Watford being Watford, only six of the players Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores managed in his previous spell are still on the scene so it may take time before he is fully reacquainted with the place he describes as \u201cmy home\u201d. It was no surprise Watford\u2019s owners blinked at the first sign of trouble for Javi Gracia and it would take some bravery to predict Flores\u2019s return lasting longer than his previous 11-and-a-half-month tenure. He has a tough job and, given Manchester City await after Arsenal, things may deteriorate before he can steady the ship. Even if he is not familiar with most of his new charges yet, one of them knows Sunday\u2019s opponents especially well. Danny Welbeck was eased back by Gracia, having missed most of last season. But 90 minutes in last month\u2019s League Cup win over Coventry boded well and a fortnight\u2019s training over the international break cannot have hurt.

A fifth of people never visit the woods, it says.</p> <p>Patrick Begg, the trust\u2019s director of outdoors and natural resources director, said: \u201cSometimes a simple walk in woodlands, where you\u2019re surrounded by the echoes of calling birds, and that satisfying crunch of fallen leaves and twigs underfoot, is the perfect remedy for reducing stress.\u201d</p> <p>The National Trust cares for 26,000 hectares of woodland in England, Wales and Northern Ireland across 400 different sites, accounting for around 12m trees, 40,000 of which are classified as ancient, veteran and notable trees.</p> <p>It extols the virtue of <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lists/a-beginners-guide-to-forest-bathing\">\u201cforest bathing\u201d or </a><em><a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lists/a-beginners-guide-to-forest-bathing\">shinrin-yoku</a></em>, the mindful exploration of woodland first developed in Japan in the 1980s.</p> <p>Eleanor Ratcliffe, a lecturer in environmental psychology at the University of Surrey, said: \u201cThere is a large body of scientific evidence demonstrating that experience of nature can benefit health and wellbeing, including recovery from everyday psychological stress.</p> <p>\u201cMuch of this research has focused on visual experiences, but more recent work has shown that the sounds of the outdoors, such as birdsong, wind, and water, can also improve mood and reduce stress. These sounds offer a way to connect with nature no matter where you are.\u201d</p> <p>The experiment was carried out by the research agency Walnut Unlimited. It took place in laboratory conditions rather than in the wilds and involved 600 people.</p> <p>Researchers used a system called mental chronometry in which reaction times are used to help judge how strongly people react to the different stimuli.</p> <p>When asked to relax with woodlands sound for one minute, people said they felt 30% more relaxed, 25% less stressed and 20% less anxious.</p> <p>Ratcliffe said there were a number of explanations for the findings. \u201cSome are psycho-evolutionary, that we are adapted to be in a natural environment like woodland.</p> <p>\u201cIt could also be cultural association so we associate going into nature with an opportunity to relax. If we can hear those sounds we\u2019re reminded of being in a relaxing place even if we\u2019re in a laboratory.\u201d</p> <p>Ratcliffe said people may also associate such sounds with actively helping themselves, but cautioned against exaggerating the findings. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give the impression that going outside can solve everyone\u2019s problems,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Forestry England gathered data earlier this year from a string of studies that it said showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/13/woodland-walks-good-for-mind-and-body-studies-show\">strong scientific evidence that visiting a forest can improve mood and attention span</a>, and even enhance psychological stress recovery.</p> <p>It said walking among trees reduced levels of cortisol, a hormone associated with stress, and that a forest walk could boost the immune system by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/06/health/06real.html\">inhaling phytoncides</a>, which trees emit to protect themselves from germs and insects.</p>",

Silence also proved a tiny bit better at making people feel less anxious. The National Trust commissioned the research as part of an effort to get more people out into environments such as woodland. It is flagging up the fact that the UK\u2019s 3.19m hectares (7.8m acres) of woodlandprovide one of the most accessible places for people to relax in. A fifth of people never visit the woods, it says. Patrick Begg, the trust\u2019s director of outdoors and natural resources director, said: \u201cSometimes a simple walk in woodlands, where you\u2019re surrounded by the echoes of calling birds, and that satisfying crunch of fallen leaves and twigs underfoot, is the perfect remedy for reducing stress.\u201d The National Trust cares for 26,000 hectares of woodland in England, Wales and Northern Ireland across 400 different sites, accounting for around 12m trees, 40,000 of which are classified as ancient, veteran and notable trees. It extols the virtue of \u201cforest bathing\u201d or shinrin-yoku, the mindful exploration of woodland first developed in Japan in the 1980s. Eleanor Ratcliffe, a lecturer in environmental psychology at the University of Surrey, said: \u201cThere is a large body of scientific evidence demonstrating that experience of nature can benefit health and wellbeing, including recovery from everyday psychological stress. \u201cMuch of this research has focused on visual experiences, but more recent work has shown that the sounds of the outdoors, such as birdsong, wind, and water, can also improve mood and reduce stress. These sounds offer a way to connect with nature no matter where you are.\u201d The experiment was carried out by the research agency Walnut Unlimited. It took place in laboratory conditions rather than in the wilds and involved 600 people. Researchers used a system called mental chronometry in which reaction times are used to help judge how strongly people react to the different stimuli. When asked to relax with woodlands sound for one minute, people said they felt 30% more relaxed, 25% less stressed and 20% less anxious. Ratcliffe said there were a number of explanations for the findings. \u201cSome are psycho-evolutionary, that we are adapted to be in a natural environment like woodland. \u201cIt could also be cultural association so we associate going into nature with an opportunity to relax. If we can hear those sounds we\u2019re reminded of being in a relaxing place even if we\u2019re in a laboratory.\u201d Ratcliffe said people may also associate such sounds with actively helping themselves, but cautioned against exaggerating the findings. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give the impression that going outside can solve everyone\u2019s problems,\u201d she said. Forestry England gathered data earlier this year from a string of studies that it said showed strong scientific evidence that visiting a forest can improve mood and attention span, and even enhance psychological stress recovery. It said walking among trees reduced levels of cortisol, a hormone associated with stress, and that a forest walk could boost the immune system by inhaling phytoncides, which trees emit to protect themselves from germs and insects.",

      "bodyText": "Momentum is launching a new digital tool for students to decide whether to vote at university or at home in an effort to drive up the Labour vote in marginal seas. Boris Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat \u2013 home to students of Brunel University London \u2013 will be targeted by the campaign group who believe they can overturn the prime minister\u2019s 5,000-strong majority. The new tool will allow students to put in both their home and university postcodes and will indicate which location will ultimately be more advantageous to register to vote in order to enable a Labour victory. The technology, developed by volunteer coders, follows Momentum\u2019s popular My Nearest Marginal website which helped activists get out and campaign in key seats at the 2017 general election. Laura Parker, Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, said: \u201cYoung people surged to Labour in the last election because we offered a concrete vision of hope. \u201cThey turned seats like Canterbury and Newcastle-under-Lyme red, and we\u2019re going to register tens of thousands of young people in key marginals to make sure they\u2019re part of the movement against this government which treats them with such contempt.\u201d The organisation also plans to spend thousands of pounds on Facebook adverts targeting young Labour voters in marginals. They will also attend university freshers fairs to explain how to register to vote. There are five target seats with a sitting Tory MP and high youth populations on which Momentum are keen to focus. They have worked out that if 19,000 young voters register across the seats of Walsall North, Truro and Falmouth, Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Loughborough and Cities of London and Westminster, they could all switch to Labour. They also want to protect Labour marginals that have large youth populations but majorities smaller than 1,600. This includes Kensington, which is held by Labour with a majority of just 20, Lincoln, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Portsmouth South, Warwick and Leamington, and Canterbury. All of these seats typically have a university or a large further education college in the constituency. Thousands of people are understood to have registered to vote since the prorogation of parliament. Momentum\u2019s drive to ensure students are signed up was sparked in part over fears the Tories were trying to hold an election on a date that would have made it very difficult for students to register to vote in time. The Times reported how Boris Johnson\u2019s election campaign team had factored in that an 15 October polling date would have restricted the number of students registering to vote as many would be moving house and may not be able to provide an address until the registration date had passed. According to the newspaper, No 10 believed if students remained registered at their home address, they would have been less inclined to vote when election day came around. Parker said: \u201cJohnson\u2019s attempt to rig the election and stop students from registering is deplorable, and it\u2019s heartening to see so many young people getting registered in response.\u201d Labour is far more popular among students than any other political party according to polls, although this summer the party hit a four-year low in support from students. At the next election, Johnson is facing a challenge from 24-year-old Labour candidate Ali Milani and also Liberal Democrat Elizabeth Evenden-Kenyon.",

Having crunched the numbers from delicately placed sensors, Mieusset only deepened the mystery. According to his studies, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/22/8/2178/643997\">the left one is warmer</a>, but only when a man has his clothes on. Mieusset has invented heated pants for men to wear as an aid to contraception \u2013 he appears to be the sole purveyor of the unorthodox intervention.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s pride was upheld by Francis McGlone, a researcher at Liverpool John Moores University, who shared the Ig Nobel peace prize. As part of an international team, McGlone helped map out which parts of the body are most pleasurable to scratch. The ankles ranked highest, the researchers found, and then the back and forearm.</p> <p>\u201cI was over the moon when I heard. It\u2019s nice for all of us. It\u2019s an honour,\u201d McGlone said on hearing he had won. \u201cThe thing that\u2019s fascinated me for a long while now is why is scratching an itch so bloody nice?\u201d</p> <p>But there is a serious side to the research, he said. \u201cPeople always laugh about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/mar/09/scratching-that-itch-tests-on-mice-show-urge-is-hard-wired-into-brain\">itching</a>, but chronic itch is devastating. People with chronic itch will scratch until it bleeds because the pain is preferable to the itching.\u201d</p> <p>By understanding which parts of the body are most prone to itch, and those which are most susceptible to relief, scientists hope to find new treatments for the condition. McGlone, who could not attend the ceremony, accepted the award in a video message recorded with a homunculus on his shoulder.</p> <p>As is standard for the annual event, winners pay their own way to Harvard, where the prizes are handed out by bona fide Nobel laureates. The winners each receive a cash prize: a now-obsolete $10tn bill from Zimbabwe.</p> <p>Patricia Yang and David Hu, both engineers at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, celebrated their second Ig Nobel prize at the ceremony. The researchers bagged their first in 2015 for discovering the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/18/ig-nobel-prizes-2015\">law of urination</a>\u201d, which states that all mammals empty their bladders in about 21 seconds. This year, as part of a larger team, the two share the physics prize for working out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/18/scientists-unravel-secret-of-cube-shaped-wombat-faeces\">how wombats make </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/18/scientists-unravel-secret-of-cube-shaped-wombat-faeces\">cube-shaped faeces</a>. The feat, thought to be unique in the animal world, helps them construct stable piles of dung to mark their territory. Contacted about the prize, Yang said: \u201cIt solidifies my belief that curiosity brings joy and surprise in science.\u201d</p> <p>Other awards included the biology prize for an international team that found that dead, magnetised cockroaches <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23005-1\">behave differently</a> to living, magnetised cockroaches when studied with a quantum sensor; and the medical education prize for a US group that showed that acoustic clickers used in dog training also<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11999-015-4555-8\"> boost the skills of surgical students</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 September 2017 because we misdescribed the award winners for the study of cockroaches as \u201ca Chinese-lead team\u201d. It was an international team. </p>",

Mieusset has invented heated pants for men to wear as an aid to contraception \u2013 he appears to be the sole purveyor of the unorthodox intervention. Britain\u2019s pride was upheld by Francis McGlone, a researcher at Liverpool John Moores University, who shared the Ig Nobel peace prize. As part of an international team, McGlone helped map out which parts of the body are most pleasurable to scratch. The ankles ranked highest, the researchers found, and then the back and forearm. \u201cI was over the moon when I heard. It\u2019s nice for all of us. It\u2019s an honour,\u201d McGlone said on hearing he had won. \u201cThe thing that\u2019s fascinated me for a long while now is why is scratching an itch so bloody nice?\u201d But there is a serious side to the research, he said. \u201cPeople always laugh about itching, but chronic itch is devastating. People with chronic itch will scratch until it bleeds because the pain is preferable to the itching.\u201d By understanding which parts of the body are most prone to itch, and those which are most susceptible to relief, scientists hope to find new treatments for the condition. McGlone, who could not attend the ceremony, accepted the award in a video message recorded with a homunculus on his shoulder. As is standard for the annual event, winners pay their own way to Harvard, where the prizes are handed out by bona fide Nobel laureates. The winners each receive a cash prize: a now-obsolete $10tn bill from Zimbabwe. Patricia Yang and David Hu, both engineers at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, celebrated their second Ig Nobel prize at the ceremony. The researchers bagged their first in 2015 for discovering the \u201claw of urination\u201d, which states that all mammals empty their bladders in about 21 seconds. This year, as part of a larger team, the two share the physics prize for working out how wombats make cube-shaped faeces. The feat, thought to be unique in the animal world, helps them construct stable piles of dung to mark their territory. Contacted about the prize, Yang said: \u201cIt solidifies my belief that curiosity brings joy and surprise in science.\u201d Other awards included the biology prize for an international team that found that dead, magnetised cockroaches behave differently to living, magnetised cockroaches when studied with a quantum sensor; and the medical education prize for a US group that showed that acoustic clickers used in dog training also boost the skills of surgical students. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 September 2017 because we misdescribed the award winners for the study of cockroaches as \u201ca Chinese-lead team\u201d. It was an international team.",

The prime minister, who is due to give a speech in the north of England on Friday, highlighted a differing judgment by the high court in London and said it was for the supreme court to make a final adjudication next week.</p> \n<p>Johnson also sought to play down a row about the role of Scottish judges in ruling prorogation unlawful after the business minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, claimed \u201cmany people\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/12/brexit-kwasi-kwarteng-criticised-for-biased-judges-comment\">thought judges were biased in relation to Brexit</a>.</p> \n<p>With his options narrowing, Johnson appears to be increasing efforts to secure a deal with the EU, possibly by moving more towards a watered-down form of Northern Ireland-only backstop. However, he maintains that a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is still possible and sought to minimise the significance of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/operation-yellowhammer-fears-no-deal-brexit-chaos-forced-to-publish-secret-papers\">Operation Yellowhammer documents published by order of parliament on Wednesday</a>. These set out the threat of food and medicine shortages, travel disruption and public disorder in a worst-case no-deal scenario.</p> \n<p>The prime minister has pledged to abide by the law in general but he has also said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than ask the EU for another Brexit extension and suggested in a letter to Tory members that he is only bound by the legislation forbidding a no-deal exit on 31 October \u201cin theory\u201d. His top adviser, Dominic Cummings, is said to believe that the law does not make the government bound to secure a delay from the EU, but various options \u2013 such as sending a contradictory letter to Brussels \u2013 have been dismissed as illegal by experts.

      "bodyText": "John Bercow has threatened Boris Johnson that he will be prepared to rip up the parliamentary rulebook to stop any illegal attempt by the prime minister to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. In a direct warning to No 10, the Speaker of the House of Commons said he is prepared to allow \u201cadditional procedural creativity\u201d if necessary to allow parliament to block Johnson from ignoring the law. \u201cIf we come close to [Johnson ignoring the law], I would imagine parliament would want to cut off that possibility \u2026 Neither the limitations of the existing rulebook or ticking of the clock will stop it doing so,\u201d he said, delivering the annual Bingham lecture in London. \u201cIf I have been remotely ambiguous so far, let me make myself crystal clear. The only form of Brexit that we have, whenever that might be, will be a Brexit that the House of Commons has explicitly endorsed.\u201d He also proposed a written constitution to stop \u201cexecutive malpractice or fiat\u201d, which could potentially have avoided the constitutional crisis that the UK has found itself in over Brexit. Bercow\u2019s dramatic intervention will be one of his last as Speaker, as he has announced that he will stand down at the end of October just two weeks after parliament is due to return from its current state of suspension. Johnson faced yet another difficult day on Thursday as he was forced to deny having misled the Queen over his reasons for proroguing parliament, which was judged unlawful this week by a Scottish court. The full ruling of three appeal court judges was published on Thursday, in which they agreed unanimously it was to prevent proper parliamentary scrutiny of his Brexit strategy, and for no other reason. Lord Carloway, the Lord President, said prorogation was sought \u201cin a clandestine manner\u201d during a time when Downing Street knew that 75 MPs and peers were taking the government to court to block prorogation. Speaking after an event about shipbuilding, Johnson said it was \u201cabsolutely not true\u201d that he lied to the monarch in advising her to suspend parliament, insisting it was a decision taken to facilitate a Queen\u2019s speech in mid-October. The prime minister, who is due to give a speech in the north of England on Friday, highlighted a differing judgment by the high court in London and said it was for the supreme court to make a final adjudication next week. Johnson also sought to play down a row about the role of Scottish judges in ruling prorogation unlawful after the business minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, claimed \u201cmany people\u201d thought judges were biased in relation to Brexit. With his options narrowing, Johnson appears to be increasing efforts to secure a deal with the EU, possibly by moving more towards a watered-down form of Northern Ireland-only backstop. However, he maintains that a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is still possible and sought to minimise the significance of the Operation Yellowhammer documents published by order of parliament on Wednesday. These set out the threat of food and medicine shortages, travel disruption and public disorder in a worst-case no-deal scenario. The prime minister has pledged to abide by the law in general but he has also said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than ask the EU for another Brexit extension and suggested in a letter to Tory members that he is only bound by the legislation forbidding a no-deal exit on 31 October \u201cin theory\u201d. His top adviser, Dominic Cummings, is said to believe that the law does not make the government bound to secure a delay from the EU, but various options \u2013 such as sending a contradictory letter to Brussels \u2013 have been dismissed as illegal by experts. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, has suggested Johnson could be a \u201cBrexit martyr\u201d if he holds out against requesting an extension. In his speech Bercow lambasted the idea that Johnson could even consider ignoring legislation passed by MPs, which mandates the prime minister to seek a three-month Brexit delay if no deal is struck by mid-October. He went on to compare any attempt by Brexit advocates to ignore the law in pursuit of what they believe to be a higher cause to \u201crobbing a bank on the basis that the cash stolen would be donated to a charitable cause immediately afterwards\u201d. \u201cNot obeying the law must surely be a non-starter. Period. Surely. In 2019, in modern Britain, in a parliamentary democracy, we parliamentarians, legislators, cannot in all conscience be conducting a debate as to whether adherence to the law is or is not required,\u201d Bercow said. \u201cWhat conceivable moral force do the public\u2019s representatives have in seeking to tackle antisocial behaviour, in seeking to prosecute the fight against knife crime and seeking to argue the state should protect itself against all sorts of nefarious illegality if we are to treat for a moment the proposition it might be in order in the name of some higher cause to disregard \u2026 It is astonishing that anyone has even tried to entertain the notion. It would be the most terrible example to set to the rest of society.\u201d Bercow, who is standing down after 10 years in the Speaker\u2019s chair, said the \u201cBrexit maelstrom\u201d had exposed weaknesses in the country\u2019s political framework. \u201cI have been a sceptic in the past about the desirability of a written constitution for the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cI have come to the conclusion that it\u2019s worth establishing a royal commission or a Speaker\u2019s conference to explore [the options].\u201d It should aim to ensure, he said, that the authority of the House of Commons is \u201cnever distorted by executive malpractices or fiat ... We must consider whether a written constitution is what we need.\u201d Three outcomes, Bercow explained, were most likely when parliament returns on 14 October: a new withdrawal agreement supported by parliament, a no-deal Brexit backed by a Commons majority, or a request by the government to Brussels for a future temporary extension of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU. Bercow has become a vilified figure among Brexiters who believe he has been complicit in thwarting efforts to leave the EU. Addressing his critics, Bercow said he believed he had never bent or broken the rules of the House of Commons. He condemned those \u201cbigots\u201d who conduct personal attacks on MPs. Portraying MPs such as Dominic Grieve in newspapers as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d is a dangerous development, he said. And using such terms as \u201cGo back\u201d is noxious and repellent, he added.",

Late Wednesday, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the administration to enforce it while legal challenges move forward.</p> <p>Migrants who make their way to the U.S. overland from places like Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador would be largely ineligible for asylum, along with people from Africa, Asia and South America who try to get in by way of the US-Mexican border.</p> <p><strong>\u201cOur Supreme Court is sentencing people to death.

I thought so. There is anything but harmony among the Democrats in Washington on this - with House speaker Nancy Pelosi trying to hold off the \u201ci\u201d word indefinitely, it seems. But with Republicans surely dismissing the whole thing as a farce, the session will be lively. And live streamed here.</li> <li>It\u2019s the first Democratic debate today where all the main contenders will be on one stage, in Houston, Texas. The Guardian\u2019s team are on their way there and we\u2019ll have some previews and pontifications on what to expect.

Ten Democratic presidential contenders are making final preparations for tonight\u2019s presidential debate in Houston, Texas. The debate is three hours long, from 8pm to 11pm ET, and will feature a thinned Democratic lineup. The event is likely to feature debate on gun control and healthcare, both issues which will be top of mind for Texas. Last month in El Paso, a gunman killed 22 people in a Walmart, and 5.5 million Texans lack health insurance. Here\u2019s an updated recap of today\u2019s political news... A 14-foot inflatable rat is awaiting Donald Trump in Baltimore, as he makes is first visit to the city after calling it a \u201crodent-infested mess. The Trump administration began enforcing a new asylum policy to force migrants to apply for asylum in a country they travel through before reaching the US, in order to qualify for asylum in America. The policy is expected to severely restrict claims, and force migrants into many months of waiting, predominantly in Mexico. Former Vice President Joe Biden released a new ad defending the Obama presidency, a move made to defend his lead. US Senator Elizabeth Warren released a health plan, a platform which had been notably absent from her campaign. The House Judiciary Committee held impeachment investigations, although not all Democrats were certain they wanted to call it an impeachment. The shooting suspect in the El Paso massacre was indicted. Democrats passed a ban on oil and gas drilling in the arctic, a symbolic bill expected to die in the Republican-controlled Senate, and the Trump administration was said to be finalizing the rollback of clean water regulations. The CEOs of 145 companies including Airbnb, Uber and Twitter \u2014 sent a letter to the senate, asking lawmakers to expand background checks and \u201cred flag\u201d laws that allow courts to confiscate guns from people who might threaten themselves or others. From the AP: Signing a letter with other CEOs isn\u2019t exactly a bold move, marketing experts say. Polls have shown the majority of Americans favor more restrictions on guns; those who don\u2019t aren\u2019t likely to quit using Twitter or Uber because their CEOs signed a letter. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything risky about trying to stem gun violence,\u201d said Paul Argenti, a Dartmouth College professor of corporate communication. \u201cThe majority of people in this country agree with this.\u201d But it\u2019s unclear how much impact the letter will have. Many heavyweights \u2014 like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Starbucks, Tesla and General Motors \u2014 didn\u2019t sign. Those companies didn\u2019t respond Thursday to messages asking about the letter. And the House, Senate and President Donald Trump have yet to come to an agreement on the various gun policies they\u2019re debating. A 14-foot inflatable rat is awaiting Donald Trump in Baltimore. According to The Baltimore Sun, \u201cthe inflatable rat, complete with the Republican president\u2019s signature lengthy red tie, came to town with Claude Taylor, a Twitter-famous provocateur who said it\u2019s been coast to coast, even to Trump\u2019s Palm Beach, Florida, club.\u201d Two years ago, New York City banned conversion therapy, a discredited, damaging practice that promotes the false idea that a person\u2019s gender or sexuality can be changed. But today, the New York City Council speaker Corey Johnson, who is gay, said the city will repeal the ban. The move would LGBTQ+, officials said, by neutralizing a legal challenge from a Christian group. If the lawsuit were to reach the Supreme Court, LGBTQ+ advocates worry the ruling could severely damage attempts to ban conversion theraphy across the country. From the NY Times: Supporters of repealing the conversion therapy ban say that it is a regrettable but necessary step given the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative makeup under the Trump administration. \u201cObviously I didn\u2019t want to repeal this. I don\u2019t want to be someone who is giving in to these right-wing groups,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in an interview. \u201cBut the Supreme Court has become conservative; the Second Circuit, which oversees New York, has become more conservative.\u201d Mr. Johnson introduced a bill on Thursday to repeal the ban; once the full Council approves the measure and Mayor Bill de Blasio signs it, the city would then be governed by a less restrictive state law, which applies only to minors. A vote could come by the end of the month, after a hearing, council officials said. \u201cWe think this is the most responsible, prudent course,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. Ten Democratic presidential contenders are making final preparations for tonight\u2019s presidential debate in Houston, Texas. The debate is three hours long, from 8pm to 11pm ET, and will feature a thinned Democratic lineup. The event is likely to feature debate on gun control and healthcare, both issues which will be top of mind for Texas. Last month in El Paso, a gunman killed 22 people in a Walmart, and 5.5 million Texans lack health insurance. Before the debates... The Trump administration began enforcing a new asylum policy to force migrants to apply for asylum in a country they travel through before reaching the US, in order to qualify for asylum in America. The policy is expected to severely restrict claims, and force migrants into many months of waiting, predominantly in Mexico. Former Vice President Joe Biden released a new ad defending the Obama presidency, a move made to defend his lead. US Senator Elizabeth Warren released a health plan, a platform which had been notably absent from her campaign. The House Judiciary Committee held impeachment investigations, although not all Democrats were certain they wanted to call it an impeachment. The shooting suspect in the El Paso massacre was indicted. Democrats passed a ban on oil and gas drilling in the arctic, a symbolic bill expected to die in the Republican-controlled Senate, and the Trump administration was said to be finalizing the rollback of clean water regulations. Here is more from the Associated Press, on the US Supreme Court decision which will allow the Trump administration to severely restrict asylum claims at the border. With a go-ahead from the Supreme Court, the Trump administration Thursday began enforcing a radical new rule that would deny asylum to nearly all migrants arriving at the southern border a move that spread despair among those fleeing poverty and violence in their homelands. A spokeswoman for the Homeland Security agency that manages asylum cases said the policy will be retroactive to July 16, when the rule was announced. The new policy would deny asylum to anyone at the U.S.-Mexico border who passes through another country on the way to the U.S. without first seeking asylum there. Late Wednesday, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the administration to enforce it while legal challenges move forward. Migrants who make their way to the U.S. overland from places like Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador would be largely ineligible for asylum, along with people from Africa, Asia and South America who try to get in by way of the US-Mexican border. \u201cOur Supreme Court is sentencing people to death. There are no safeguards, no institutions to stop this cruelty,\u201d the immigration-assistance group Al Otro Lado said in a statement. The Mexican government likewise called the high court\u2019s action \u201castonishing.\u201d The effects of the new policy could fall heavily on Mexico, leaving the country with tens of thousands of poor and desperate migrants with no hope of getting into the U.S. Acting US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan called the Supreme Court\u2019s go-ahead a \u201cbig victory\u201d in the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to curb the flow of migrants. In Tijuana, Dunea Romero, a 31-year-old Honduran woman, started to tear up at the thought of not being allowed to take refuge in the US. She said she packed a bag and fled her homeland with her two boys, ages 7 and 11, after hearing that her ex-husband, a powerful gang leader, was going to have her killed. \u201cI did this so I didn\u2019t lose my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave my sons without a mother.\u201d A Nicaraguan who has been waiting in Ciudad Juarez to request asylum in the U.S. could be among those who would be affected. He said he fled his home country after running afoul of the Nicaraguan government with many acts of civil disobedience. He passed through Honduras on his way to the border, meaning he would have to return to that violence-ridden country under the new rule. He asked that his name not be used because a past news report quoting him led to retaliation against relatives in Nicaragua. \u201cThe president of Nicaragua is friends with the president of Honduras, and what the Honduran president could do is send all of the Nicaraguans back to their country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd me, setting foot in Nicaragua again, what could happen to me is I could get locked up, be detained, and processed in Nicaragua for the crimes that they accuse me of terrorism and high treason against the government of Nicaragua.\u201d In Tijuana, Ngoh Elliot Takere of Cameroon stood only steps from the US and felt overwhelmed by frustration after learning that he could be blocked from getting in. He has been waiting for two months in Mexico for his number to be called so he can submit a request for asylum in the US. The 28-year-old furniture maker said he left his war-torn African homeland after being jailed by police for being part of the English-speaking minority. He was released on the condition that he leave the country or be killed, he said. He said the military burned his family\u2019s home, killing his mother. As for the possibility of being turned away by the United States, Takere said: \u201cI can\u2019t think of that.\u201d An estimated 45,000 migrants who have been turned back by the U.S. government and forced to wait out their asylum requests on the Mexican side of the border under yet another new, more stringent Trump administration policy. From our story Wednesday: The supreme court ruled on Wednesday to allow the Trump administrationto enforce nationwide restrictions that would prevent most Central American immigrants from seeking asylum in the US. The administration announced in July a new policy that would deny asylumto anyone who passes through another country on their way to the US without seeking protection there first, therefore affecting almost all migrants who arrive at the US-Mexico border. The justices\u2019 order late Wednesday temporarily undoes a lower-court ruling that had blocked the new asylum policy in some states along the southern border. Most people crossing the southern border are Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty. They are largely ineligible under the new rule, as are asylum seekers from Africa, Asia and South America who arrive regularly at the southern border. Groups challenging the policy in court say that it violates the US refugee act and the UN refugee convention guaranteeing the right to seek asylum to those fleeing persecution. The shift reverses decades of US policy. The administration has said that it wants to close the gap between an initial asylum screening that most people pass and a final decision on asylum that most people do not win. In a scathing dissent, justices Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Sonya Sotomayor say that the supreme court \u201csidesteps the ordinary judicial process\u201d by overriding proceedings in the lower courts. \u201cOnce again, the Executive Branch has issued a rule that seeks to upend longstanding practices regarding refugees who seek shelter from persecution,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. Socialism_Is_Very_Very_Bad Vice President Mike Pence will speak tonight at an event for the nonprofit Concerned Women for America, a stalwart conservative thinktank which promotes, \u201cBiblical values and Constitutional principles.\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks tomorrow, at a \u201ccelebration luncheon\u201d. More from the Washington Post: Spokespeople for Pence and Pompeo defended the speeches, saying the appearances did not steer this business to the president\u2019s hotel, as the nonprofit had already chosen the venue before inviting the two officials. They said the appearances had been vetted for ethical or legal concerns and approved by others in the White House and the State Department. ... Pompeo and Pence visit the hotel at a time when Trump and his administration seem to be giving up on a bedrock promise of his presidency: that he would never use his public power to boost his private business.\u201d McCarthy, surprisingly, cites plastics contamination in the ocean as a crisis Republicans would solve if they retake the House in 2020. He then used a plastics industry talking point to describe the problem. McCarthy said the vast majority all ocean plastic contamination comes from 10 rivers, none of which are located in the US. However, that figure does not tell the full story. A Guardian US investigation recently revealed the US exports the equivalent of 680,000 shipping containers of plastic refuse to developing countries which mismanage most of their own waste. (Reminder: only 9% of the world\u2019s plastic has ever been recycled.) In other environmental news today, Republicans are expected to formally end clean water regulations meant to protect wetlands and streams from pollution; and a bill to ban oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is expected to die in the Republican-controlled Senate. A reporter asked Republican House minority leader Kevin McCarthy whether it was appropriate for President Trump to call Baltimore a, \u201crodent infested mess\u201d. This is how McCarthy responded: The president \u201cmade a case why many major cities have challenges.\u201d \u201cThe president coming here symbolizes \u2013 yes, he cares about Baltimore... He has found for his entire life how to bring people out of poverty.\u201d Here is that original tweet: Background checks for guns? A reporter asks Republican House Minority Kevin McCarthy if President Trump supports background checks for guns \u2013 like the vast majority of Americans. Republican minority leader Kevin McCarthy deflects. [Trump] wants to make sure whatever we do solves the problem, so he\u2019s gathering all the information.\u201d Republican minority leader Representative Kevin McCarthy is now criticizing Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler for holding impeachment investigations. \u201cThe American public does not want it,\u201d McCarthy said. We are now watching a press conference with the House Republican leaders. They are speaking as part of the House Republican retreat in Baltimore, sponsored by the Congressional Institute. Watch along with us. El Paso shooting suspect indicted A man accused of gunning down people at a busy Walmart in El Paso last month was indicted Thursday for capital murder, prosecutors announced. Patrick Crusius, 21, of Allen, Texas, was indicted on one count in connection with the August 3 mass shooting that left 22 dead, district attorney Jaime Esparza said. El Paso prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the man, who remains jailed without bond. His defense lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment today, the AP writes. Attorney Mark Stevens previously said he will use \u201cevery legal tool available\u201d to prevent his client from being executed. The El Paso county district clerk\u2019s office said Crusius\u2019 indictment would not be publicly available until next week because it takes a few days to process and assign the case to a court. Prosecutors have said Crusius surrendered to police after the attack saying, \u201cI\u2019m the shooter,\u201d and that he was targeting Mexicans. In court documents, prosecutors alleged that Crusius was the author of a screed published shortly before the shooting that said it was \u201cin response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.\u201d Federal prosecutors have said they are weighing hate-crime charges against Crusius that could also carry the death penalty. The massacre, along with another August mass shooting in the Texas cities of Midland and Odessa , has fueled anger among gun control and immigration advocates, and caused political blowback. Texas Governor Greg Abbott acknowledged weeks after the attack that \u201cmistakes were made \u201c when he sent a fundraising mailer encouraging supporters to \u201ctake matters into our own hands\u201d and \u201cDEFEND\u201d Texas. The shooter\u2019s screed was straight out of Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant lexicon. A Tennessee law which would have potentially criminalized voter registration drives has been blocked by a federal court. Here is an excerpt from the decision: The unrefuted evidence before the court suggests that the defendants will be required or are likely to curtail their voter registration efforts in response to the Act. hey may even be forced to discontinue their activities altogether... Forcing the plaintiffs to wait while a case winds its way through litigation would mean taking away chances to participate in democracy that will never come back.\u201d Important: Democrats voted today to ban drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The move is largely symbolic, since the Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to take up the measure. Here is more from our previous reporting on the subject: The move would also increase greenhouse gas pollution. With high oil production, the department said, the increase each year could be 5m metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, equal to putting about a million more cars on the road and up to .01% of global greenhouse gas emissions. There could also be negative effects for birds, marine mammals and polar bears, as well as a loss of permafrost, vegetation and wetlands. An internal memo obtained by Mother Jones warned that the department could have trouble advancing the plan because oil exploration and seismic testing could be particularly bad for polar bears. Coat of controversy Even as they attended a 18th anniversary commemoration yesterday of the terrorist attacks on the US on September 11, 2001, Donald and Melania Trump both managed to stir up controversy. Although she didn\u2019t say anything at the event the president and she went to at the Pentagon, a minor tempest blew up on social media about the first lady\u2019s coat, Joanna Walters writes. Some observers thought that the stitching and button clasp on the back of the coast resembled, in outline, a depiction or something that could be mistaken for a depiction of a plane flying into a skyscraper. That is a reference to the passengers aircraft that were hijacked by Al-Qaida terrorists and flown at high speed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City on that tragic day, killing almost 3,000 people. Another hijacked plane was flown into the Pentagon building just outside Washington, DC, and a fourth plane was diverted by rebelling passengers and crashed into a field in Pennsylvania shortly after. White House press spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham dismissed the idea that Melania Trump\u2019s coat might have been insensitive as \u201cridiculous\u201d. Here\u2019s a tweet of protest on the topic: Meanwhile Donald Trump attracted criticism over his conduct surrounding the ceremony for, among other things, once again bringing up dubious implications that he had rushed down to Ground Zero on the fateful day 18 years ago and he and some his workers offered help and somehow became involved in the long and arduous recovery effort that followed. He\u2019s previously said he spent \u201ca lot of time\u201d at Ground Zero, a claim that has been disputed. The president also got a mixed reception for fist-pumping skywards in apparent glee, with a big grin, and giving a bouncy greeting when he arrived at an airport in Pennsylvania for a service on the somber day. \u201cHey, how are ya! What a good-looking group! What a good-looking group of people!\u201d the president gushed as the crowd cheered, the New York Post reported. Others were less charitable. \u201cIt\u2019s the anniversary of one of the worst tragedies in American history \u2013 and Donald Trump is PUMPED!!\u201d tweeted Chicago Tribune columnist Rex Huppke. Judiciary committee hearing has wrapped up. It\u2019s unclear whether the impeachment process will ever move beyond the committee\u2019s investigation. The committee would have to introduce impeachment articles against Donald Trump and win approval from the House to bring charges, the AP writes. The Republican-led Senate is unlikely to convict Trump and remove him from office. Still, the committee has persisted in advancing the impeachment issue, partly to bolster two lawsuits against the Trump administration as the White House has repeatedly blocked witness testimony and document production. The suits say the material is needed so the committee can decide whether to recommend articles of impeachment. The resolution the committee approved along party lines would allow the committee to designate certain hearings as impeachment hearings, empower staff to question witnesses, allow some evidence to remain private and permit the president\u2019s counsel to officially respond to testimony. The committee says the resolution is similar to procedural votes taken at the beginning of the impeachment investigations into Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. \u201cUnder these procedures, when we have finished these hearings and considered as much evidence we are able to gather, we will decide whether to refer articles of impeachment to the House floor,\u201d Nadler had said in his opening statement. The first hearing scheduled under the new impeachment rules is with onetime Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on September 17. A grand jury in El Paso, Texas, has indicted the suspect in the August mass shooting on capital murder charges in the fatal shooting of 22 people at a Walmart in the border city, the AP reports. More details on this ASAP. Also, have a read back at the Guardian article referenced in Senators\u2019 letter to Amazon. Amazon is a very big company. They need to have a union put in place,\u201d said an Amazon worker who requested to remain anonymous. The worker has been with the company for two years and was transferred to Staten Island when it opened in October 2018. \u201cThey overwork you and you\u2019re like a number to them. During peak season and Prime season, they give you 60 hours a week. In July, I had Prime week and worked 60 hours. The same day I worked overtime, I got into a bad car accident because I was falling asleep behind the wheel.\u201d Three US Senators, including 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, have written to Amazon to \u201cexpress our concerns\u201d about the intense pressures the company has put on delivery drivers. \u201cAmazon\u2019s pursuit of larger profit margins, increasingly unstable delivery expectations, and methods to avoid regulatory and legal oversight are alarming,\u201d the senators wrote, before a list of questions for the company. Here is a link to that letter. Just before Thursday\u2019s 2020 Democratic Presidential debate, former Vice President Joe Biden released an ad defending his former boss, Barrack Obama. \u201cHe was a president our children could and did look up to,\u201d said Biden, in footage from a campaign speech. \u201c... I was proud to serve as his Vice President, but never more proud than the day we passed healthcare,\u201d Biden said. The ad then goes through a series of Obama-Biden accomplishments, including reforming prison sentencing guidelines, protecting migrants brought to the US as children and advancing LGBT rights. The rule protects drinking water for one-third of Americans. We are expecting a press conference later today. Here is more from the Associated Press: The Trump administration plans to revoke an Obama-era regulation which provided federal protection to many US wetlands and streams. Two Environmental Protection Agency officials with knowledge of the plan told The Associated Press the administration plans to substitute the rule with its own version. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works R.D. James scheduled a news conference for later Thursday to discuss the decision. President Donald Trump has promised to repeal the 2015 Obama rule, which defines what bodies of water fall under federal jurisdiction. Farmers, homebuilders and other business interests say the rule harmed economic development and violates property rights. Environmentalists said the move would leave millions of Americans with less safe drinking water and damage wetlands that prevent flooding. The American Farm Bureau Federation said the Trump administration\u2019s plan to revoke an Obama-era clean water rule is a good move for farmers. Congressional relations director Don Parrish said the 2015 regulation to protect wetlands and waterways created uncertainty about where farmers could cultivate land. \u201cIt would be great if farmers didn\u2019t have to hire an army of consultants and lawyers just to be able to farm,\u201d said Parrish. Evironmentalists said the Trump administration move would leave millions of Americans with less safe drinking water and damage wetlands that prevent flooding. Ahead of the 2020 Democratic presidential debates scheduled for tonight, US Senator Elizabeth Warren released details of her health plan. The plan comes after some raised questions about why Warren \u2013 who has carried her campaign on the slogan that she \u201chas a plan for that\u201d \u2013 had not released specifics on her health platform. The plan calls for single-payer, public health insurance for \u201cphysical\u201d ailments, and \u201caffordable, high-quality\u201d mental healthcare. Physical ailments would be covered by a version of Medicare-for-all, which would expand the existing public health insurance program for the elderly and disabled to all Americans. Excluding prescription drugs and mental healthcare from a Medicare-for-all platform puts Warren in a more moderate position than her liberal rival, US Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Look for that policy difference to be sussed out at tonight\u2019s debate. Greta Thunberg, the Swedish youth climate activist who sailed to New York on a carbon-neutral yacht, will appear in Washington DC next week at the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. Our young global leaders are going to move us forward toward addressing the climate crisis,\u201d said Subcommittee Chairman William Keating, Representative from Massachusetts. \u201cThat is both inspiring and disheartening - disheartening because we should have been acting on this long before our youth needed to stand up and demand it.\u201d Hillary Clinton read her emails at a mock resolute desk at the Venice Biennale. The performance art piece was designed by Kenneth Goldsmith, an American poet and critic. Goldsmith used techniques of \u201cappropriation and collage,\u201d to create the work, which includes 60,000 pages of double-sided copies. Curators for the piece, titled HILLARY: The Hillary Clinton Emails, described it this way: The pile of papers is rather unimpressive, rebutting Trump\u2019s efforts to make them monumental. In this way, Goldsmith creates an anti-monument to the folly of Trump\u2019s heinous smear campaign against Clinton. In an ambient somewhere between a library, a theatre stage and an embassy, the language of digital bureaucracy is transformed by Goldsmith into a work of literature. House Democrats are divided over whether to impeach President Trump. Today, as they hold hearings investigating the president, they argue about whether they are conducting an impeachment proceeding. Here is more from the Associated Press: House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler says, plain and simple, what his committee is doing is an impeachment investigation, no matter how you want to phrase it. \u201cSome call this process an impeachment inquiry. Some call it an impeachment investigation. There is no legal difference between these terms, and I no longer care to argue about the nomenclature,\u201d Nadler said at the panel session. \u201cBut let me clear up any remaining doubt: The conduct under investigation poses a threat to our democracy. We have an obligation to respond to this threat. And we are doing so,\u201d he added. Republicans disagree with Nadler and argue the House has never voted to open an official inquiry. \u201cMy colleagues know very well they don\u2019t have the votes to authorize impeachment proceedings on the House floor, but they want to impeach the president anyway,\u201d the panel\u2019s GOP ranking member, Doug Collins of Georgia, said. \u201cSo, they are pretending to initiate impeachment.\u201d Nadler and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have been talking about impeachment very differently. Nadler has been clear that his committee is moving ahead, Pelosi is reluctant to mention the \u201cI\u201d word and has repeatedly said the strategy is to \u201clegislate, investigate and litigate.\u201d In private meetings, she has urged caution and told the caucus that the public isn\u2019t there yet on impeachment. At the same time, she has signed off on the committee\u2019s moves. Some of the leading Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 presidential candidates have spoken out strongly in favor of impeachment. The topic will surely come up again tonight in the debate in Houston that will see the top 10 contenders take the stage together for the first time. The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an agency meant to work against workplace discrimination, will stop collecting information on the wage gap by race and gender. The data collection only started in 2016. The agency, now headed by a Trump nominee, announced its intention to stop collecting the data Wednesday. Businesses with more than 100 employees were required to report the data. In the UK, all businesses with more than 250 employees are required to report wage gap details. The effort revealed lingerie company Boux Avenue, Apple and Ryanair had some of the largest pay gaps between men and women. The Trump administration has reportedly given up efforts to write an Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) replacement bill. After campaigning to repeal the law for eight years, Republicans have struggled to piece together a cohesive strategy for caring for the staggering 27.5m Americans locked out of the healthcare system. As well, the Trump administration has joined Republican-led states in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Obamacare. If they prevail, millions of Americans who rely on the healthcare provided by the law could be caught in the middle, as either side appeals to the US Supreme Court. \u201cRehashing \u2018repeal the ACA and replace with something better\u2019 isn\u2019t a winning message, and I\u2019m guessing they know that,\u201d Shawn Gremminger, senior director of federal relations at Families USA told the Washington Post. The Trump administration said reports work had stopped were false. A little live fact-checking from the Guardian\u2019s reporter Joan Greve. A new poll found broad support for gun control measures. The news comes the same day that 145 business executives signed an open letter calling on Republican US senators to enact legislation also passed by the Democrat-led House. Every day, 100 Americans are shot and killed and hundreds more are wounded. These are more than mass shootings; in recent weeks, gun violence has devastated Chicago, Canoga Park, Newport News, Gilroy and Brooklyn, among others. This is a public health crisis that demands urgent action,\u201d the executives wrote, in the letter published by the New York Times. Also today, Trump is expected to attend the House Republican retreat in Baltimore, Maryland, a city he described as a \u201cdisgusting ... rodent infested mess\u201d in July. There is no public agenda for the meeting, which is being held behind closed doors, the Baltimore Sun reported. Baltimore residents have responded with a slate of planned protests, including a \u201cMusical Labor Protest\u201d from the Baltimore Welcome Committee and an LGBTQ dance party. The judiciary committee chairman, Jerry Nadler, has also announced that the panel will hold a hearing on 17 September with Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager. Nadler said Trump \u201casked Lewandowski twice to deliver a message to former attorney general Jeff Sessions to limit the Mueller investigation, making Lewandowski a critical witness to presidential obstruction of justice\u201d. The committee has also subpoenaed Rob Porter and Rick Dearborn, who also witnessed Trump\u2019s \u201crepeated obstruction\u201d, for the same hearing, Nadler said. Jerry Nadler makes his case Trump \u201cwent to great lengths to obstruct special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation\u201d into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election in favor of Donald Trump and whether his campaign colluded with that meddling, Nadler explains in a statement made public on the eve of this committee session. He cites also \u201cthe president\u2019s attempts to remove the special counsel and encourage witnesses to lie and to destroy or conceal evidence. Anyone else who did this would face federal criminal prosecution. \u201cThe Mueller report resulted in 37 criminal indictments, 7 guilty pleas, and revealed 10 possible instances where President Trump obstructed justice, at least five of which we now know to be clearly criminal. \u201cTrump\u2019s crimes and corruption extend beyond what is detailed in the Mueller report. The president is in violation of the emoluments clauses of the constitution as he works to enrich himself, putting the safety and security of our nation at risk. He has dangled pardons, been involved in campaign finance violations and stonewalled Congress across the board, noting that he will defy all subpoenas,\u201d Nadler writes in his statement. He concludes: \u201cNo one is above the law. The unprecedented corruption, coverup, and crimes by the president are under investigation by the committee as we determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment or other ... remedies.\u201d Is it an impeachment inquiry or not? Democrats can\u2019t seem to agree In the spirit of open journalism, that\u2019s the headline in an excellent analysis piece in the New York Times this morning ahead of the judiciary committee session that\u2019s now underway this morning. It\u2019s well worth a read, here. Meanwhile, Dan Pfeiffer, top adviser to Barack Obama, had this to say on Twitter late last night. So this session on the Hill is not popular with many. \u2018Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter ...\u2019 \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, we are not in an impeachment inquiry,\u201d says Republican Doug Collins, with vigor and volume. He\u2019s talking about his earlier remark that the committee\u2019s session is like an Instagram filter, making something like something it\u2019s not. But he might have meant Snapchat, he now thinks. This is the level of debate we\u2019re at right now. \u2018This is a walk down the yellow brick road\u2019 Doug Collins, the Georgia Republican and ranking member of the judiciary committee, is opening his remarks by, of course, making fun of this session. \u201cThis is a walk down the yellow brick road. The Emerald City is impeachment,\u201d he says. Wait, Collins has now said the committee session is a trip to Fantasy Island. He says bring on the popcorn and \u201clet the show begin\u201d. Indeed. \u2018It\u2019s not about misguided policy or personal behavior\u2019 Nadler explains that this whole process is about whether to recommend articles of impeachment against Donald Trump \u2013 the process, effectively, by which Congress prosecutes a president. He says America is facing a threat to its democracy. There aren\u2019t completely fixed rules about how all this happens, if and when there is an impeachment, it will be open to a lot of interpretation and, you can be sure, fierce argument. Nadler said that the forthcoming decision about an impeachment inquiry \u201ccannot be based on our feelings about Donald Trump. It\u2019s not about misguided policy or personal behavior, it\u2019s based on the evidence before us and the evidence that keeps coming in. This will all lead to a vote on whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the full floor of the House of Representatives. He\u2019s handing over now to the top Republican on the committee, Doug Collins, of Georgia. He says, basically, that the session is a mirage. Nothing happening, it\u2019s like \u201can Instagram filter that makes something appear as something it\u2019s not\u201d. House Judiciary Committee prepares for its first impeachment-related vote The chairman, Jerry Nadler, is calling the committee to order, says the Trump 2016 election campaign got help from Russia and that the president interfered with the resulting inquiry. The session is set to define procedures for upcoming hearings on Donald Trump even as some moderates in the caucus are urging the panel to slow down. The vote today, while technical, is an escalation as the judiciary panel has said it is examining whether to recommend articles of impeachment, the Associated Press writes. It would allow the committee to designate certain hearings as impeachment hearings, empower staff to question witnesses, allow some evidence to remain private and permit the president\u2019s counsel to officially respond to testimony. Good Morning, watchers of American politics, we are firing up our Guardian US pol live blog earlier than usual today in order to catch live a committee session on Capitol Hill to discuss procedures for possible impeachment of the president. There\u2019s so much going on today so please buckle in and stay tuned. Here are the main events: The House Judiciary Committee under chairman Jerrold Nadler, Democratic congressman of New York, is holding what is called a markup session this morning at 8AM ET. To quote the committee\u2019s own words, the committee \u201cwill consider procedures for future hearings related to its investigation to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment with respect to President Donald Trump.\u201d Got that? I thought so. There is anything but harmony among the Democrats in Washington on this - with House speaker Nancy Pelosi trying to hold off the \u201ci\u201d word indefinitely, it seems. But with Republicans surely dismissing the whole thing as a farce, the session will be lively. And live streamed here. It\u2019s the first Democratic debate today where all the main contenders will be on one stage, in Houston, Texas. The Guardian\u2019s team are on their way there and we\u2019ll have some previews and pontifications on what to expect. This is the third round of debates and the first time stand-out contenders Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren will face off on the same stage. There will surely be fall-out today from last night\u2019s Supreme Court ruling to allow the Trump administration to enforce nationwide restrictions that would prevent most Central American immigrants from seeking asylum in the US. There will also be reverberations from the president\u2019s announcement yesterday that, essentially, he want to ban flavored e-cigarettes. My colleague and health reporter Jessica Glenza will be taking over this blog shortly and will have more to say about that, no doubt. I encourage you to read Jessica\u2019s terrific article about e-cigs earlier this week.",

      "bodyText": "All six crew members were asleep when a fire broke out aboard the scuba diving boat Conception in southern California, killing 34 people trapped below deck, federal investigators announced on Thursday. A preliminary two-page report by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which has been investigating the tragedy, said five crew members had been sleeping in their quarters behind the wheelhouse on the second deck and another below deck when the fire broke out. All but one survived the inferno; the cause of the blaze has yet to be determined. Boats like the Conception, which caught fire around 3am on 2 September and sank off the coast of Santa Barbara, are required to have a crew member keep watch at night. Federal authorities are conducting a criminal investigation into the deadly fire and could bring charges under a statute known as seaman\u2019s manslaughter. Five crew members, including the captain, managed to escape by jumping overboard but dozens trapped in the boat\u2019s bunkroom are believed to have died of smoke inhalation. The disaster was the worst in California\u2019s recent maritime history and sent shockwaves through the diving community and across the state. The remains of the final victim still unaccounted for were recovered on Wednesday. The victims included a family of five, a girl celebrating her 17th birthday with her parents and a friend, and a 26-year-old crewmember who was thrilled by her recent promotion to deckhand. Others included the marine biologist who led the three-day tour and couples who shared a love of the water. So far nine victims have been officially identified, ranging in age from 25 to 62. The report comes as investigators seek to determine the cause and try to recover the wreckage of the Conception from the bottom of the sea amid an ongoing criminal investigation conducted by the FBI, Coast Guard and the US attorney\u2019s office. The NTSB says one of the crewmembers on the upper deck awoke to a noise and saw flames rising from the middle deck. He alerted the rest of the crew as the captain issued a panicked mayday call to the Coast Guard. The crew, finding the ladder to the main deck on fire, jumped down \u2013 with one breaking a leg in the process. They tried to reach the others through a window but couldn\u2019t open it. They were forced to jump overboard when they became \u201coverwhelmed by smoke\u201d. The captain and two crewmembers swam to the vessel\u2019s stern and reboarded the boat, according to the report. They opened the engine room\u2019s hatch but didn\u2019t find any fire. With other access routes blocked, they launched the boat\u2019s skiff, picked up the other two crewmembers and went to a nearby vessel. Once onboard, the captain continued to send mayday calls as two crewmembers returned to the Conception to search for survivors near the burning wreckage. There were none. As crews work to recover the wreckage of the burned-out Conception from the bottom of the sea, the Coast Guard has issued additional safety recommendations in the wake of the tragedy, such as limiting the unsupervised charging of lithium-ion batteries and the use of power strips and extension cords. The recommendations also suggest owners and operators of vessels review emergency duties with the crew, identify emergency escapes, check all firefighting and lifesaving equipment onboard, and look at the condition of passenger accommodation spaces for \u201cunsafe practices or other hazardous arrangements\u201d. Coast Guard records show the Conception passed its two most recent inspections with no safety violations. Previous customers said the company that owns the vessel, Truth Aquatics, and the captains of its three boats, were very safety conscious. Truth Aquatics filed a lawsuit last week in US district court under a pre-civil war provision of maritime law that allows it to limit its liability.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 13 September. Top stories Boris Johnson has been accused of seriously misleading the British public with his controversial \u00a3100m Get Ready for Brexit advertising campaign, with MPs calling on the head of the civil service to take action and halt the expensive and potentially inaccurate campaign, given the uncertainty surrounding the 31 October departure date. The outgoing Speaker, John Bercow, urged Johnson not to break the law preventing a no-deal Brexit, and the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, reported that Johnson\u2019s envoys were yet to offer a credible plan that would justify reopening formal negotiations over the Irish backstop. Queensland authorities warn that dire weather conditions could last weeks or even months, putting the state at risk of another bushfire crisis. While conditions have eased in NSW, parts of the state remain on hire fire danger alert. Authorities say it is the worst start to the bushfire season on record, with winds and hotter than average temperatures forecast in the coming days. Queensland\u2019s acting fire commissioner, Mike Wassing, has said the state is in the grip of no ordinary bushfire season. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is extraordinary dry conditions, with the extremes of high winds and high temperatures. This will continue for weeks and potentially months. There is no outlook for rain.\u201d A proposed shipment of more than 5,000 Australian cattle bound for China has been halted after suspicions that ear tags \u2013 used to trace cattle origin \u2013 had been tampered with. Department of Agriculture officials have categorically ruled out disease as being the cause for the delay, and will conduct an investigation into the case to ensure exports meet China\u2019s strict protocols. It follows a second investigation within the live export sector after confronting footage emerged of Australian cattle being improperly slaughtered in Indonesia last month during Eid. World A leading West Papuan activist is feared \u201cabducted\u201d by Indonesian police, after supporters reported a joint strike force raid by police and military on the home of Buchtar Tabuni. A witness told Guardian Australia the death toll from recent clashes has risen to eight, with footage showing soldiers firing on demonstrators. Russian state security services have conducted nationwide raids on opposition headquarters, four days after pro-Putin candidates suffered massive losses in Moscow city elections. Israel has been accused of planting spy devices near the White House, a claim the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has strongly rejected. Heavy storms have killed two people and wreaked destruction in eastern Spain, with some locations recording the heaviest rainfall on record. A transatlantic flight from Frankfurt to Canc\u00fan was forced to divert to Ireland after a pilot spilled coffee inside the cockpit. The hot drink damaged an audio control panel, causing electrical burning and smoke, preventing safe communications. Opinion and analysis When she was five years old, Rebecca Varcoe loved to listen to the music of the Hillsong church. Now she\u2019s 30 and grappling with this music, this church and this God. \u201cI have become obsessed with a song I used to listen to as a child. It\u2019s called Shout to the Lord, and we used to sing it at church most Sundays. Shout to the Lord was written by a woman named Darlene Zschech, from the Hillsong church. Darlene and this song are enduring symbols of my own deep hypocrisy \u2013 so just bear with me.\u201d Reported rapes in the UK have doubled in a year, yet prosecutions are at their lowest level for a decade. With new figures showing that only 1,925 cases ended in a conviction from 54,000 reports filed, thousands of vulnerable women are being badly let down by the Crown Prosecution Service, writes Julie Bindel. \u201cAs a lifelong feminist campaigner against male violence, I feel more pessimistic about the prospect of ending rape \u2013 which is what any civilised society should aim for \u2013 than I did 40 years ago.\u201d Sport A single match-up rarely dictates the outcome of any game but in Sunday\u2019s Super Netball grand final the contest between the Swifts\u2019 Helen Housby and the Lightning\u2019s Karla Pretorius could do precisely that, writes Erin Delahunty. The Rabbitohs and the Roosters\u2019 rivalry goes back to NRL\u2019s foundation, writes Matt Cleary. With 35 premierships between them and finals footy on the line a new chapter could be written Friday night at the SCG. Tim Paine\u2019s decision to send England in to bat first was nearly vindicated, as a rejuvenated Mitchell Marsh took four for 35, before Jos Buttler belted England to 271-8 at stumps on day one at the Oval in the final Ashes Test. Thinking time: The deep sea ship of horrors A battered 38-year-old trawler with more than a dozen documented safety violations, a sullen, angry, alcoholic captain, work shifts lasting over 24 consecutive hours and, suddenly, water filling the engine room. As investigators would hear, racial abuse, brown drinking water and inadequate safety equipment were the least of sailors\u2019 problems on the fateful night of 14 August 2010, as an inevitable tragedy unfolded that cost the lives of six seamen. With a notorious track record of callous disregard for its staff, how did the company that owned the ill-fated trawler escape punishment? Ian Urbina examines the Russian dolls-style corporate structure of the Sajo Group, and the \u201cship of horrors\u201d voyage of the Oyang 70. Media roundup National party MPs are calling for a nationwide rollout of cashless debit cards for welfare recipients, report the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, as the party meets to debate policy including welfare reform. A researcher gathering accounts of modern-day slavery has urged a comprehensive audit of businesses surrounding Adelaide Central Market, writes the Adelaide Advertiser, amid allegations of human trafficking and forced marriage. And the foreign minister, Marise Payne, has made a direct plea to her Iranian counterpart to free three Australians detained in Tehran, reports the Australian.

He finished his career with 521 receptions for 7,861 yards and 79 touchdowns and was one of the most dominant receivers in the game when he was fully fit. He was also known for his colorful personality on and off the field. Last month Gronkowski reflected on the hours after Super Bowl LIII \u2013 the final game of his career \u2013 saying he was in bed in tears after playing a vital role in the Patriots\u2019 13-3 victory over the Los Angeles Rams. He couldn\u2019t enjoy it because of the pain. Gronkowski was hit in the quadriceps during the game, leaving him with the deepest bruise he had ever had in his life. He spent weeks unable to walk properly, sleeping just 20 minutes per night. His mood was volatile \u2013 one moment, he\u2019d be feeling fine, as if he overcame the discomfort. The next moment, he\u2019d be aching, unable to even sit down without focusing on the pain. Over the next month, he had to drain a liter of blood from his thigh. That\u2019s when he knew it was time to retire. \u201cI was like all right. This is a sign,\u201d he told the Associated Press in August. \u201cI was saying to my friends that this is a goodbye present from the NFL.\u201d",

While 27 attorneys general said they had \u201cagreed to a framework to resolve claims against Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family\u201d, the deal was condemned by many others, including the Connecticut attorney general, William Tong; the anti-Sackler campaigner and artist Nan Goldin; and the addiction specialist Dr Andrew Kolodny. Tong told the Guardian that Connecticut had rejected the settlement because \u201cthe scope and scale of the pain, death and destruction that Purdue and the Sacklers have caused far exceeds anything that has been offered thus far\u201d.

Scientists in Utah measured exhaust emissions from a test car driven by volunteers over a set route. Contrary to the stereotypical view of the \u201cboy racer\u201d, the study showed the older male participants were the most polluting drivers. Experienced motorists produced about 50% more hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxides compared with younger drivers, who accelerated more gently and used less power on hills. This demonstrates that more skilful driving can help reduce air pollution. Other studies have shown motorists who are inexperienced at driving electric vehicles tend to accelerate faster than petrol and diesel drivers, leading to more energy use and greater particle pollution from tyre wear. This is because electric motors respond quickly when the accelerator is pressed. When retested after five months, however, electric vehicle owners had optimised their driving and were less polluting. A study of hybrid vehicles showed how technical knowledge and dashboard feedback enabled drivers to use less fuel and produce less pollution. However, with 40% of car journeys in England being less than two miles, the best behaviour change is to walk or cycle on short trips.",

I find it impossible to see that it could serve any other rational purpose.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Lord Brodie</strong>, the third judge, said that, despite the weight courts need to give to the royal prerogative and a government\u2019s right to use procedures to suit its purposes, this was an \u201cegregious\u201d case of misuse of prorogation.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Procedural manoeuvres are the stuff of politics, whether conducted in parliament or in lesser bodies. However, when the manoeuvre is quite so blatantly designed \u2018to frustrate parliament\u2019 at such a critical juncture in the history of the United Kingdom, I consider that the court may legitimately find it to be unlawful.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T21:30:42.983Z\">at 10.30pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7a8c928f082514879f313c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T18:23:23.641Z\">7.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Bercow draws his address to a close, saying that the evolution and renaissance of parliament has been a positive development in the last decade.

Here is an extract from the interview.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[Letwin] would definitely oppose trying to decide Brexit in the hurly-burly of a general election campaign.

Sir Oliver replied: \u201cWe need to resolve this issue of Brexit before there is a general election so that the election can be about who you want to have govern you, and so the resolution of the Brexit issue is separate. I would prefer that and, like Tom, I would prefer that to be done through the acceptance of a deal in parliament.\u201d</p> \n   <p>And where would that leave the prime minister\u2019s plea for an immediate general election with Brexit on the ballot paper? </p> \n   <p>Sir Oliver replied in a musing tone: \u201cI\u2019ve heard all sorts of predictions of the election timing \u2013 next week, next minute, next day \u2013 but I have never been confident they were right because I think we will get a majority in the House of Commons who agree with the view that I take, which is that it is better to get the Brexit issues resolved first and have an election after.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThat means either you get a deal and get it in place, which is relatively quick, or you have a deal followed by a referendum, which is relatively long.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T12:27:12.522Z\">at 1.27pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7a2f808f082514879f2bcf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T11:52:07.233Z\">12.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In his broadcast interview this morning <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> claimed that the government\u2019s position on prorogation had been endorsed by the high court in London.

These include the market system, but they also include cultural norms and the ways in which power and wealth are distributed inside and outside the market. At present, the rules governing employment are largely set by financial logic. This is inimical to a civilised reduction in hours. There is therefore a strong argument for setting up countervailing institutions to \u2018nudge\u2019 society in a direction which science and technology makes possible, and which is also desired by most people. A balance will need to be struck between what workers want from employment and what employers can afford to give.

She was on the Today programme this morning, and here are some other points she made.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Rudd claimed the Tories could face challenges from up to 20 candidates standing at the next election as independent Conservatives.</strong> She said there were 22 former Tories in the party who do not take the party whip (the 21 who had the whip removed last week after rebelling over Brexit, and Rudd herself, who resigned the whip at the weekend). She said she had been \u201cstruck by how effectively they [the 21] are organised as a group\u201d and she said she hoped No 10 would agree to restore the whip to all of them. She would like to be able to retake the whip herself, she said, but it would depend on how others were treated. Asked what she would do at the election, she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I am a Conservative, and if it comes to a general election in the short term, although of course none of us know when that might be, if I\u2019m not back with the Conservative whip then I\u2019m likely to fight as an independent Conservative. And I\u2019m looking at options at the moment \u2026</p> \n   <p>I will not be fighting for another party. I hope to be fighting as a Conservative and, if not, with up to 20 people, as an independent Conservative, depending on whether the whip has been returned. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Rudd has already made it clear she will be looking for a new constituency because she will not stand again in Hastings and Rye, where she had a majority of just 346 over Labour at the previous election.</p> \n  <p>She did not explain why she thought up to 20 people might be standing as independent Conservatives. Of the 21 Tories who lost the whip, almost half have said they <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/full-list-of-mps-who-are-standing-down-at-the-next-election-a4230531.html\">intend to stand down at the next election.</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said people still in cabinet should \u201cspeak out\u201d if they are worried about what Boris Johnson is doing.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said Johnson\u2019s confrontational approach to parliament was \u201ca mistake\u201d.</strong> Theresa May considered proroguing parliament to help pass Brexit, but rejected the idea, May said. Asked about the current prorogation, she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I am surprised, and I think it is a very un-Conservative thing to be doing. I have sat in three cabinets under three different prime ministers, and this level of confrontation with parliament I have never seen before. </p> \n   <p>Under Theresa May we did briefly look at the idea of prorogation. It was dismissed because we knew it would be the wrong approach, the wrong way to treat a parliament full of representatives of their own communities. </p> \n   <p>And this level of confrontation, I think, is unwelcome. I think it is a mistake. I think, as politicians and Conservatives, we should be looking to find the compromise and using persuasion and intelligence to try and find that compromise.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c358249e1b359db38086baa40bc368d62a70915\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c358249e1b359db38086baa40bc368d62a70915/0_17_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Rudd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amber Rudd.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T09:21:16.283Z\">at 10.21am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d79f6648f083106f455a0ea\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T08:22:17.100Z\">9.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ministers have taken 'considerable steps' to avert no-deal Brexit dangers in report, says Gove</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Quite late last night, the government finally published the Operation Yellowhammer document about what might happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now, so here\u2019s a summary of the evening\u2019s events. Three judges accused the prime minister of misleading the electorate. The Scottish appeal judges who ruled Boris Johnson unlawfully prorogued parliament agreed that he did so to prevent proper scrutiny of his Brexit strategy, not for the reasons the government has given. The law requiring the prime minister to ask for a Brexit delay is just as important as that which outlaws bank robbery, the Commons Speaker has stressed. John Bercow said that, whatever the perceived political importance of leaving the EU quickly, the prime minister would be no more justified in ignoring the law than would be a bank robber who promised to hand their loot to charity after the deed. \u201cNot obeying the law must surely be a non-starter. Period,\u201d he told an audience of lawyers. The UK should consider drawing up a codified constitution, Bercow added. The Speaker said parliament had succeeded in reasserting its authority over the executive in recent years, but that a codified constitution might be required for it to complete that work. You can see a round-up of the day\u2019s earlier events here. And, for those wishing to read yet more, my colleagues Rowena Mason and Owen Bowcott have the full story: The three Scottish appeal judges who ruled Boris Johnson had unlawfully prorogued parliament have bluntly accused the prime minister of misleading voters on his true reasons for suspending parliament. They agree unanimously it was to prevent proper scrutiny of his Brexit strategy \u2013 and for no other reason \u2013 in their official rulings issued by the Scottish courts late on Thursday afternoon. Read the judges\u2019 opinion in full here (pdf). Lord Carloway, the lord president, said prorogation was sought \u201cin a clandestine manner\u201d when Downing Street knew 75 MPs and peers were taking the government to court to block it. No 10 also did this knowing prorogation would stymie debate about Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans and then gave the court no clear reason to justify prorogation, as well as the five-week period Johnson got from the Queen, which they described as an \u201cextraordinary length of time.\u201d Carloway said: The circumstances demonstrate that the true reason for the prorogation is to reduce the time available for parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit at a time when such scrutiny would appear to be a matter of considerable importance, given the issues at stake. [Put] shortly, prorogation was being mooted specifically as a means to stymie any further legislation regulating Brexit. Lord Drummond Young is particularly blunt, arguing that the UK government\u2019s failure to provide the Scottish court with any valid reasons for proroguing Westminster for five weeks supported their conclusions it was unjustified. If no reason is given, in the present circumstances, I am of opinion that the decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks out of the seven remaining before the United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the European Union leads inevitably to the conclusion that the reason for prorogation was to prevent parliamentary scrutiny of the government. I find it impossible to see that it could serve any other rational purpose. Lord Brodie, the third judge, said that, despite the weight courts need to give to the royal prerogative and a government\u2019s right to use procedures to suit its purposes, this was an \u201cegregious\u201d case of misuse of prorogation. Procedural manoeuvres are the stuff of politics, whether conducted in parliament or in lesser bodies. However, when the manoeuvre is quite so blatantly designed \u2018to frustrate parliament\u2019 at such a critical juncture in the history of the United Kingdom, I consider that the court may legitimately find it to be unlawful. Bercow draws his address to a close, saying that the evolution and renaissance of parliament has been a positive development in the last decade. Now, he adds, it is \u201ctime to ask whether a written constitution is what we need to allow us to complete the voyage\u201d. He says he was previously sceptical but has come to conclude that it\u2019s worth establishing a royal commission or a Speaker\u2019s conference to look into the idea. Bercow says an act could be passed in the interim to make sure parliament\u2019s authority is ensured. The Speaker turns to the question of a codified constitution, saying the UK\u2019s in a group of only three nations not to have one. He says the UK has been \u201ctravelling in the direction\u201d of such a constitution. Concerned he has sat too long on the fence, Bercow adds: Let me make myself crystal clear: Ladies and gentlemen, the only form of Brexit which we will have, whenever that might be, will be a Brexit that the House of Commons has explicitly endorsed. The Speaker has issued a stinging rebuke to those who support the idea of the prime minister, Boris Johnson, refusing to ask Brussels for a delay to Brexit \u2013 as the law requires. Not obeying the law must surely be a non-starter. Period. Surely, in 2019, in modern Britain, in a parliamentary democracy, we \u2013 parliamentarians, legislators \u2013 cannot in all conscience be conducting a debate as to whether adherence to the law is or isn\u2019t required. What conceivable moral force do the public\u2019s elected representatives have in seeking to tackle antisocial behaviour, in prosecuting with greater vigour and imagination and relentlessness the fight against knife crime, in arguing that the state must protect itself against all sorts of nefarious illegality, if we are to treat for a moment with the proposition that it might be in order, in the name of some higher cause, to disregard a law enacted by parliament? It is astonishing that anyone has even entertained the notion ... It would be the most terrible example to set to the rest of society. One should no more refuse to request an extension of article 50 because of what one might regard as the noble end of departing from the EU as soon as possible than one could possibly excuse robbing a bank on the basis that the cash stolen would be donated to a charitable cause immediately afterwards. What comes next, Bercow asks? Only three plausible possibilities: A new withdrawal agreement and political declaration that will require \u201cheavy lifting\u201d by parliament if it appears it could command a majority. No new agreement, or one the Commons cannot not accept, and a vote by MPs for a no-deal Brexit. He says such a deliberate action \u2013 as opposed to \u201csomething coming about by default or happenstance\u201d would be legitimate. Neither support for an agreement, nor a no-deal Brexit, meaning the prime minister has to ask for an extension. \u201cThis is clearly legitimate,\u201d he says, adding that, while there may be people who disagree with the move, it is \u2013 in procedural terms \u2013 he says that the Benn act is \u201corderly\u201d. \u201cThe Brexit episode and the restoration of parliamentary will should not be seen in isolation,\u201d Bercow, says, in conclusion. Moreover, Bercow stresses the importance of the backbench business committee in making sure issues that are not necessarily a priority for the government or the opposition are brought to the attention of the Commons. One example he cites is the Hillsborough disaster, which was debated in the Commons after being scheduled by the backbench business committee. Another device Bercow says has become important is the emergency debate, which MPs used last week to begin the process of trying to rule out a no-deal Brexit. He explains that the instrument gives MPs the chance to, in effect, take control of the agenda of the Commons away from the executive, should a majority of the house wish to do so. The increasing use of such instruments, he claims, has been key to the Commons getting \u201coff its knees\u201d and providing more effective scrutiny of the government on behalf of the electorate. Meanwhile, three Scottish appeal court judges have refused to order the publication of the unredacted No 10 memos in the case against Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament: Turning to his first point, Bercow says there has been a renewal of the Commons\u2019 desire to and confidence in its ability to scrutinise ministers. Principal in that process, he says, has been the increasing use of an old device: the urgent question. This allows any MP to ask the Speaker to get a minister to respond to the issue, where it\u2019s deemed important and wouldn\u2019t normally form part of the day\u2019s parliamentary business. The urgent question, Bercow says, had \u201cwithered away\u201d in recent times. Only two were laid in the 12 months before he was elected to be Speaker. That, he says, was something he had decided to try to change, if given the role. And, in the roughly 10 years he\u2019s fulfilled it, Bercow says there have been 658 urgent questions. Bercow begins by calling the most recent spell in the Commons short, yet extremely eventful. And he pays tribute to Tom Bingham, the eminent British judge for whom the lecture the Speaker is delivering is named. He says he will cover three topics: That the revival of the Commons is not the one-off product of Brexit, but part of a wider renewal of the UK\u2019s legislature. To offer some reflections on what would and would not be an appropriate response to the recent vote to back an anti-no-deal act. To offer thoughts on how Brexit has changed his view of the UK\u2019s constitution and whether it\u2019s time to consider codifying a constitution. The outgoing Commons Speaker, John Bercow, is due to deliver a speech to the legal thinktank, the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law, entitled: Process of Discovery: What Brexit has taught us (so far) about Parliament, Politics and the UK Constitution. He\u2019s due to start any moment and we\u2019ll be covering it here. Boris Johnson has said it is \u201cabsolutely not true\u201d that he misled the Queen over his reasons for suspending parliament, after a Scottish court ruled his suspension unlawful because he did it to stop MPs scrutinising Brexit. Michel Barnier has told MEPs there remain insufficient grounds for reopening formal negotiations over the Brexit withdrawal agreement, six months after Theresa May and the European commission closed them. The high court in Belfast has dismissed claims that a no-deal Brexit and the imposition of a hard border would damage the Northern Ireland peace process. Gordon Brown, the Labour former prime minister, has said that the government is \u201cstill not telling the truth\u201d about medicine and food shortages that would result in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Before a speech in Edinburgh, Brown said: The truth is that we are not taking back control but losing control - of medical supplies and food and energy prices. The worst-case scenario document downplays the risks to medical supplies, the threat to household budgets and the damage inflicted on the most vulnerable. We now know from Yellowhammer that no-deal Brexit is an unnecessary act of self-harm but ministers are still not telling the truth about the sheer scale of the self-inflicted wounds. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has welcomed a report proposing a new financial transaction tax that would raise \u00a32.1bn a year. The plan is set out in Intelligence Capital\u2019s report Reinforcing Resilience: Making the UK a Citadel of Long-Term Finance (pdf). McDonnell said Labour would carefully consider its recommendations. He said: We need to move beyond a world dominated by fast finance. This report presents one way to achieve that: through a comprehensive financial transactions tax that doesn\u2019t leave loopholes for major areas of financial activity. The report shows that a comprehensive financial transactions tax can raise revenue for our under-resourced public services, improve the resilience of financial markets, and ensure that finance serves the people and the wider economy. Anti-Brexit campaigners have filed a legal challenge in the Scottish courts in an effort to compel Boris Johnson to seek an extension to article 50. The owner of Rosyth dockyard in Fife has been named by Boris Johnson as the preferred bidder for a \u00a31.25bn contract to build five new frigates, a step in a plan to increase the number of warships in the Royal Navy over the next two decades. Fresh fruit and vegetables and wine are among the products likely to become scarcer and more expensive after a no-deal Brexit, according to a flurry of warnings issued by retailers and the alcoholic drinks industry. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. My colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels is less optimistic about the prospect of a Brexit deal than Charles Grant. (See 4.34pm.) Here is a Twitter thread with her analysis of where we are. The Labour MP Emma Lewell-Buck has told ITV\u2019s Acting Prime Minister podcast that she would rather go into coalition with the Brexit party than with the Lib Dems. That is not because of any affection for the Brexit party - she says she despises them - but because she could not accept a coalition with a party committed to revoking article 50. Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, is always worth reading on Brexit. Here is a Twitter thread with his assessment of the latest state of play. Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, said today that there was no reason for the EU to grant the UK another Brexit extension. He said: We see no extension for Brexit, when there is no reason to. At the moment, there is no reason to give an extension. When there are concrete reasons ... we will discuss whether we will give a new mandate or a new extension, but that is not the case at the moment. As long as there aren\u2019t any concrete proposals, there is no reason for us to reopen anything. Bettel\u2019s comments reflect the current state of play. In practice it is widely assumed that at the EU summit starting on 17 October EU leaders probably would be willing to agree to another extension, particularly to enable a general election. Antoinette Sandbach, one of the 21 pro-European Tories who lost the whip after rebelling against the government on Brexit last week, has said that she is now fully committed to the idea of holding a second referendum. In an open letter to constituents, she says this was necessary to \u201cavert disaster\u201d. Here is a question from below the line. The \u201chumble address\u201d requiring the government to hand over private messages from Number 10 aides about prorogation was not law. Effectively it was an order from parliament, and it is for parliament to apply a sanction. Last year, when the government refused to comply with a \u201chumble address\u201d demanding the release of the attorney general\u2019s legal advice to cabinet about the withdrawal agreement, MPs retaliated by passing a motion saying the government was in contempt of parliament. The government then agreed to hand over the document. MPs may well try the same tactic this time. But Boris Johnson is likely to be less bothered about being found in contempt of parliament than Theresa May (his de facto chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, did not seem to care about being found in contempt of parliament on another matter earlier this year). It is possible Johnson would just ignore the vote. At that point, parliament starts running out of options. There is nothing it can do about non-MPs found in contempt of parliament. The Commons can refer individual members to the standards committee, and that committee can recommend punishments such as suspension, or even expulsion, but it is very, very hard to imagine the Commons voting to act like that against a prime minister. These are from the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming in Brussels. Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish government\u2019s copy of the Yellowhammer no-deal Brexit scenario plans was marked \u201cbase scenario\u201d, disputing claims by Michael Gove that the documents were a worst-case scenario. Sturgeon told first minister\u2019s questions at Holyrood it was \u201ccompletely outrageous\u201d that the UK government was contemplating a situation where medicines would be in short supply. She said it was essential that Westminster was urgently reconvened, to allow MPs to question ministers on Brexit and the Yellowhammer forecasts. The first minister told MSPs: The question for the prime minister and the government is why on earth parliament is still suspended - if any government needed scrutiny, it\u2019s this one. Earlier this week my colleague Peter Walker reported on how data privacy campaign groups and Labour have expressed alarm after it emerged Downing Street had ordered departments to centralise the collection and analysis of user information from the government\u2019s main public information website ahead of Brexit. Here is is story. Today the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office has suggested it is seeking assurances about this initiative. Boris Johnson has revived his plan to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland - saying that it would be a \u201cvery good\u201d idea and that it would cost \u00a315bn. Speaking to children during his visit to lighthouse tender NLV Pharos on the Thames, Johnson said he had recently been discussing the possibility of constructing a bridge over the Irish Sea. He said: [I was talking yesterday] about building a bridge from Stranraer in Scotland to Larne in Northern Ireland \u2013 that would be very good. It would only cost about \u00a315bn. Johnson originally floated this idea in an interview with the Sunday Times last year. At the time his proposal was considered fanciful, but this week Channel 4 News revealed that government officials have been asked to produce a paper on the costs and benefits of such a plan. The original Sunday Times story about Johnson\u2019s proposal provoked a memorable letter to the paper from a retired offshore engineer who said the idea was \u201cabout as feasible as building a bridge to the moon\u201d. Here is our latest story on the judgment from the high court in Belfast on Brexit. I\u2019ve corrected the earlier post on this (see 11.38am) because it said the prorogation legal challenge was thrown out. In fact, it was the argument that a no-deal Brexit would undermine the Good Friday agreement that was rejected. A claim about prorogation being unlawful was excluded on the grounds that it is being decided in the cases in England and Wales. And here is the full text of the judgment (pdf). The Commons public accounts committee has published a report (pdf) this morning accusing the government of being \u201coverly secretive\u201d about the money it is spending on consultants who are helping it prepare for Brexit. The bill has come to at least \u00a397m, the committee says. Here is an extract. Departments have made extensive use of consultancy firms in support of their preparations for Brexit, spending at least \u00a397m by April 2019. Departments have been overly secretive about what the consultants are doing, as they have been before in providing information on other aspects of the Brexit preparations. When departments have published information on consultancy work, usually later than they should have, they have failed to meet the government\u2019s own transparency standards. Departments took too long to publish information on the contracts being let, and some contracts were over-zealously redacted before publication. And talking of MPs frustrating a no-deal Brexit, Sir Oliver Letwin, one of the MPs who helped to draw up the bill intended to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, has given an interview to the Evening Standard in which he suggested that MPs might pass another law to hold a referendum on Brexit before a general election. Tony Blair, the former Labour leader, and Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, have both argued this week (see here and here) that it would be better to hold a referendum before a general election because otherwise the general election would end up as a proxy referendum on Brexit, with domestic issues sidelined. Blair has also argued that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s unpopularity could boost the chances of the Tories winning even though voters have doubts about Boris Johnson\u2019s hard-Brexit strategy. Labour wants to hold a general election first, which makes it very hard to see how any backbench attempt to seize control of the Commons order paper and pass legislation saying a referendum should come first would succeed. The Hilary Benn bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October only passed the Commons because all opposition parties (except for the DUP, if you count them as opposition) voted for it. In his interview with the Standard Letwin did not explain why he thought Corbyn might change his stance on this. But Letwin did claim that MPs would come round to his view that it would be best to have a referendum first, assuming Johnson did not get a deal that could pass the Commons. Here is an extract from the interview. [Letwin] would definitely oppose trying to decide Brexit in the hurly-burly of a general election campaign. And he is pretty sure MPs are ready to keep postponing the election until after Brexit is decided. \u201cI can\u2019t see how you can do that [resolve Brexit] very well in a general election where it will get, as Alan Duncan said in a marvellous speech this week, all muddled up in other things,\u201d he said. Was he in agreement with Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, who yesterday called for a referendum to be held before the election? Sir Oliver replied: \u201cWe need to resolve this issue of Brexit before there is a general election so that the election can be about who you want to have govern you, and so the resolution of the Brexit issue is separate. I would prefer that and, like Tom, I would prefer that to be done through the acceptance of a deal in parliament.\u201d And where would that leave the prime minister\u2019s plea for an immediate general election with Brexit on the ballot paper? Sir Oliver replied in a musing tone: \u201cI\u2019ve heard all sorts of predictions of the election timing \u2013 next week, next minute, next day \u2013 but I have never been confident they were right because I think we will get a majority in the House of Commons who agree with the view that I take, which is that it is better to get the Brexit issues resolved first and have an election after. \u201cThat means either you get a deal and get it in place, which is relatively quick, or you have a deal followed by a referendum, which is relatively long.\u201d In his broadcast interview this morning Boris Johnson claimed that the government\u2019s position on prorogation had been endorsed by the high court in London. (See 10.50am.) It is worth stressing that that is a very partial account of what the high court actually said. It rejected the claim that prorogation was unlawful. But it did not accept Johnson\u2019s argument that his decision to prorogue had nothing to do with wanting to limit the opportunities for MPs to frustrate a no-deal Brexit. The court did not take a view on this at all. Instead it rejected the legal challenge on the grounds that decisions to prorogue parliament are inherently political, and therefore outside the scope of the courts. There is a short summary of what it argued here, and the full summary is here (pdf). Here is more from the ruling in the Belfast high court rejecting a challenge to the government\u2019s Brexit strategy. In his written judgment Lord Justice Bernard McCloskey said: I consider the characterisation of the subject matter of these proceedings as inherently and unmistakably political to be beyond plausible dispute. Virtually all of the assembled evidence belongs to the world of politics, both national and supra-national. Within the world of politics the well-recognised phenomena of claim and counterclaim, assertion and counter-assertion, allegation and denial, blow and counter-blow, alteration and modification of government policy, public statements, unpublished deliberations, posturing, strategy and tactics are the very essence of what is both countenanced and permitted in a democratic society. In the past John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has floated the idea of moving towards a four-day working week. He commissioned the distinguished economist Lord Skidelsky to produce a report for Labour on reducing working time and today the 60-page report (pdf) has been published. Entitled How to achieve shorter working hours, it is a long way from a blueprint for a full roll-out to a standard four-day working week. But it does propose various mechanisms that could nudge employers in that direction. Here is an extract from the conclusions: Individuals choose how much to work but within the limits set by the institutions of a particular society. These include the market system, but they also include cultural norms and the ways in which power and wealth are distributed inside and outside the market. At present, the rules governing employment are largely set by financial logic. This is inimical to a civilised reduction in hours. There is therefore a strong argument for setting up countervailing institutions to \u2018nudge\u2019 society in a direction which science and technology makes possible, and which is also desired by most people. A balance will need to be struck between what workers want from employment and what employers can afford to give. The game can be played for lower stakes than at present, but the stakes must not be so low as to bankrupt an economy, which still largely relies on private enterprise to \u2018deliver the goods\u2019. Commenting on the report, McDonnell said: Something is very wrong with how the world of work has changed in recent years. Millions are working long hours, while others don\u2019t get the regular hours they need. I\u2019d like to thank Lord Skidelsky for his meticulously researched report which we will study and draw on when looking at how we can reduce the typical working week without loss of pay. Labour said it was particularly interested in three of Skidelsky\u2019s recommendations: setting up social partnership forums for different sectors of the economy; using state procurement policies to set conditions for pay and working hours in private firms (which would not be eligible for contracts if they did not comply); and ending the opt-out from the EU working time directive. David Sassoli, the new president of the European parliament, has been holding a press conference. He said that any Brexit agreement would have to have a backstop, that the UK had not yet proposed any credible alternative, and that the European parliament would be open to a Brexit delay if the UK was going to hold an election. These are from my colleague Jennifer Rankin, the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge and ITV\u2019s James Mates. It is 2-1 to the government in the courts now on Brexit. As my colleague Owen Bowcott reports, judges in Belfast have rejected a legal challenge arguing that the government\u2019s Brexit policy would undermine the peace process. It has also shelved a challenge on prorogation, on the grounds that this is being dealt with by the courts in England and Wales. The supreme court will come to a final, binding ruling after a hearing starting on Tuesday next week. Here is Owen\u2019s story: UPDATE: I\u2019ve corrected this post because the high court in Belfast rejected the claim that the government\u2019s Brexit policy would undermine the Good Friday agreement. It also considered a challenge against prorogation, but it excluded this on the grounds that it is being dealt with by the cases in England and Wales. Boris Johnson has given a pooled interview for broadcasters. I have already covered his comments denying that he lied to the Queen. (See 10.50am.) Here are the other lines from the interview. Johnson refused to back the views of the business minister Kwasi Kwarteng, who aired concerns last night that judges were seen as biased. Asked if he considered the judiciary to be independent, Johnson said: I think the British judiciary, the United Kingdom judiciary, is one of the great glories of our constitution \u2013 they are independent. And believe me, around the world people look at our judges with awe and admiration, so I\u2019m not going to quarrel or criticise the judges. Clearly there are two different legal views \u2013 the high court in England had a very different opinion and the supreme court will have to adjudicate in the course of the next few days, and I think it\u2019s proper for politicians to let them get on and do that. Asked about Kwarteng saying people questioned the independence of the judiciary, he went on: It is very important, as I say, that we respect the independence of the judiciary. They are learned people \u2026 There\u2019s a separation of powers in this country. In an interview on The Andrew Neil Show last night, Kwarteng said his own personal view was that judges were impartial, but he wanted to acknowledge that \u201cmany people \u2026 are saying that the judges are biased.\u201d He went on: \u201cMany people, many leave voters, many people up and down the country, are beginning to question the partiality of the judges. That\u2019s just a fact.\u201d Johnson said the government had been \u201cmassively accelerating\u201d preparations for a no-deal Brexit. Asked about the Operation Yellowhammer document, he said: It is very important to understand what this document is. This is a worst-case scenario which civil servants obviously have to prepare for. But in the last few months, and particularly in the 50 days since I\u2019ve been prime minister, we\u2019ve been massively accelerating our preparations. We\u2019re trying to get a deal. And I\u2019m very hopeful we will get a deal with our European friends on October 17 or 18 or thereabouts. But if we have to come out on October 31 with no deal, we will be ready ... What you are looking at here is just the sensible preparations, the worst-case scenario, that you would expect any government to do. He listed some of the areas he expected to feature in the Queen\u2019s speech. He said: We need a Queen\u2019s speech. We need to get on and do all sorts of things at a national level \u2026 We are going to need bills on education, on health, on housing, on technology, on our vision for investing in science, [the] space programme, on environment, stopping the export of waste overseas and plastics \u2013 there are a huge number of things that we want to get on with and do. UPDATE: Here is a video of the interview. Boris Johnson has denied lying to the Queen over the suspension of parliament, insisting such claims were \u201cabsolutely not\u201d true. Speaking on a visit to NLV Pharos, a lighthouse tender, which is moored alongside HMS Belfast on the Thames, he was asked if he had lied to the Queen when he asked her to prorogue parliament for five weeks. He replied: Absolutely not. The high court in England plainly agrees with us but the supreme court will have to decide. We need a Queen\u2019s speech, we need to get on and do all sorts of things at a national level. He went on to say he was \u201cvery hopeful\u201d there would be a Brexit deal. Parliament will have time both before and after that crucial summit on 17 and 18 October to talk about the Brexit deal. I\u2019m very hopeful that we will get a deal, as I say, at that crucial summit. We\u2019re working very hard \u2013 I\u2019ve been around the European capitals talking to our friends. I think we can see the rough area of a landing space, of how you can do it \u2013 it will be tough, it will be hard, but I think we can get there. The government has repeatedly claimed it suspended parliament because it wants a Queen\u2019s speech in October \u2013 even though, at five weeks, this is the longest prorogation for almost 90 years, and it is well known ministers wanted to limit the chances available to MPs to pass laws that might obstruct a no-deal Brexit. Formally, it was up to the Queen to prorogue parliament, but she had no choice in the matter, or the length of the suspension, because constitutionally she is obliged to follow the advice of her prime minister. The allegation that Johnson might have lied to the Queen about the real reasons for prorogation was fuelled by yesterday\u2019s judgment from the Scottish court of session that the government did not tell the truth about the real reason for prorogation. In its summary of the judgment, the court said: All three first division judges have decided that the PM\u2019s advice to the HM the Queen is justiciable, that it was motivated by the improper purpose of stymying parliament and that it, and what has followed from it, is unlawful. UPDATE: It was misleading of Johnson to claim that the high court in London agreed with the government because it did not take a view on whether he had been telling the truth or not about the real reasons for prorogation. See 12.52pm for more. Thank you to MrPlebby in the comments below for pointing out that, while Amber Rudd may be cautiously supporting proportional representation now, two years ago, when she was not sitting as an independent MP, she was firmly against. This is what she said in a post that is still on her website. I am afraid that I do not agree with your views on PR, and fully support first past the post. This tried-and-tested system ensures stability and clear governance, preventing disproportionate influence by minority parties with minimal public support, who typically end up holding the balance of power in PR systems. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, made the same argument as Michael Gove (see 9.22am) when he appeared on the Today programme and was asked about the Operation Yellowhammer report. He said it was a \u201cplanning assumption\u201d and the government was addressing the potential problems identified in the document. He told the programme. That is why we are doing things about it. That is why the chancellor opened his chequebook, that\u2019s why we are spending the money on doing lots of things to mitigate those assumptions. Every day, we plan everything from whether we need to find alternative suppliers, whether we need to go out to the private sector to charter things, whether we need to plan using our army or our police forces in certain scenarios. Wallace was on the programme to talk about a government announcement to build five frigates at Rosyth dockyard in Fife. The Downing Street press release is here, and here is my colleague Dan Sabbagh\u2019s story. Police officers from all over the country should be drafted in to help handle traffic in Kent in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the chairman of the county council has said. As the Press Association reports, Paul Carter told the Today programme that he wanted \u201cboots on the ground\u201d and assurances that arrangements were in place for police officers and Highways England staff nationwide to be ready to \u201cman the pumps\u201d. He said: I want assurance from Highways England and Kent police that they have got the reciprocal arrangements with other police forces and Highways England officers around the country to make sure that they come into Kent in sufficiency to be able to man the pumps and make sure that the fluidity and the Operation Brock strategy, to keep the road network in Kent open at all times and direct them to where lorries if they are delays at the port, will be held until such time as they can depart from those ports. Carter, who leads the Conservative-controlled council, said \u201caccelerated progress\u201d has been made since the Yellowhammer report \u2013 released on Wednesday night \u2013 was drafted on 2 August. There are still two or three outstanding matters which I am beating the drum on which need resolving in short order. Asked if he was worried about a no-deal Brexit, he said: As long as we get satisfactory answers and progress on how the operating model for customs clearance is going to work and communicate that to the logistics haulage industry, I am pretty confident that we can avoid disruption in Kent. From Sky\u2019s Michelle Clifford Lord Hope, a former supreme court judge who is now the convenor of cross-bench peers in the Lords, has rejected claims that MPs can now re-enter the House of Commons after yesterday\u2019s Scottish court ruling that prorogation was illegal. Hope, a former lord president of Scotland\u2019s courts, said appeal judges in Edinburgh were right not to order Boris Johnson to reconvene parliament before the supreme court hears the Scottish case alongside the English and Northern Irish challenges next week. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, Hope said: [On] Tuesday morning at 1.30, parliament was prorogued and it was prorogued to a given date on the command of Her Majesty, and you can\u2019t just go back in and start without that order being set aside. Quite how you do that is a matter of parliamentary procedure and I just don\u2019t know quite what the answer is meantime. Hope, who was deputy president of the supreme court until his retirement as a judge in 2013, said he expected a speedy decision by the nine judges hearing the supreme court case. Three days are set aside but I rather doubt it will take three days. And I\u2019m sure they will issue a judgement as soon as they possibly can, maybe for reasons given later because like everybody else, they understand the urgency of this. And it really would be a nonsense if they didn\u2019t issue a decision until parliament resumes on 14 October. So they\u2019ll certainly lean over backwards to get a decision out as soon as they possibly can. It was \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d and \u201cbaseless\u201d for Downing Street sources and government ministers to suggest the Scottish judges were politically biased. Judges are impartial and they\u2019re under oath to decide matters according to the law, and political influence either way has nothing whatever to do with it, and of course it\u2019s one of the risks that judges run when they get involved in cases of this kind is that people make that kind of accusation. Following her resignation from the cabinet at the weekend over Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy, Amber Rudd is giving a speech tonight in which she will suggest proportional representation might produce a parliament better able to reflect what the public wants. She was on the Today programme this morning, and here are some other points she made. Rudd claimed the Tories could face challenges from up to 20 candidates standing at the next election as independent Conservatives. She said there were 22 former Tories in the party who do not take the party whip (the 21 who had the whip removed last week after rebelling over Brexit, and Rudd herself, who resigned the whip at the weekend). She said she had been \u201cstruck by how effectively they [the 21] are organised as a group\u201d and she said she hoped No 10 would agree to restore the whip to all of them. She would like to be able to retake the whip herself, she said, but it would depend on how others were treated. Asked what she would do at the election, she said: I am a Conservative, and if it comes to a general election in the short term, although of course none of us know when that might be, if I\u2019m not back with the Conservative whip then I\u2019m likely to fight as an independent Conservative. And I\u2019m looking at options at the moment \u2026 I will not be fighting for another party. I hope to be fighting as a Conservative and, if not, with up to 20 people, as an independent Conservative, depending on whether the whip has been returned. Rudd has already made it clear she will be looking for a new constituency because she will not stand again in Hastings and Rye, where she had a majority of just 346 over Labour at the previous election. She did not explain why she thought up to 20 people might be standing as independent Conservatives. Of the 21 Tories who lost the whip, almost half have said they intend to stand down at the next election. She said people still in cabinet should \u201cspeak out\u201d if they are worried about what Boris Johnson is doing. She said Johnson\u2019s confrontational approach to parliament was \u201ca mistake\u201d. Theresa May considered proroguing parliament to help pass Brexit, but rejected the idea, May said. Asked about the current prorogation, she said: I am surprised, and I think it is a very un-Conservative thing to be doing. I have sat in three cabinets under three different prime ministers, and this level of confrontation with parliament I have never seen before. Under Theresa May we did briefly look at the idea of prorogation. It was dismissed because we knew it would be the wrong approach, the wrong way to treat a parliament full of representatives of their own communities. And this level of confrontation, I think, is unwelcome. I think it is a mistake. I think, as politicians and Conservatives, we should be looking to find the compromise and using persuasion and intelligence to try and find that compromise. Quite late last night, the government finally published the Operation Yellowhammer document about what might happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit. You can read the document here (pdf). And here is our overnight story. This morning, as he left his home, Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, sought to play down the report\u2019s conclusions. He claimed that over the past six weeks, the government had taken \u201cconsiderable steps\u201d to address the potential problems outlined in the document. He said: The Yellowhammer documents are a worst-case scenario. They are produced so government can take plans and take steps in order to mitigate any of those consequences. And over the course of the last six weeks, this government has taken considerable steps in order to ensure that, if there is a no-deal scenario, we can leave in the safest and smoothest possible way. But of course it is important to stress that we are fighting hard for a deal, the prime minister has been making diplomatic progress this week, and we are on our way to getting a better deal. There will be a lot more on this as the day goes on. Here what\u2019s coming up \u2026 9am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, speaks at the launch of a report by Lord Skidelsky on how to achieve a four-day working week. 9am: Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, speaks at the Universities UK conference. 10am: The high court in Belfast rules on the legal challenge against prorogation brought in Northern Ireland. 4pm: McDonnell speaks at the publication of a report on a plan for a financial transactions tax. At some point today, Boris Johnson is also due to take part in a visit to promote the announcement of a contract to build five new frigates. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament was ruled \u201cimproper\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d on Wednesday by three senior Scottish judges, who concluded it had been done with \u201cthe purpose of stymying parliament\u201d. In their official rulings, issued by the Scottish courts late on Thursday afternoon (pdf), they agreed unanimously there was no other reason for the suspension. Lord Carloway, the Lord President, said prorogation was sought \u201cin a clandestine manner\u201d when Downing Street knew that 75 MPs and peers were taking the government to court to block it. No 10 also knew that prorogation would stymie debate about Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans, No 10 gave the court no clear reason to justify prorogation, and the five weeks Johnson got from the Queen was \u201can extraordinary length of time\u201d. Carloway said: \u201cThe circumstances demonstrate that the true reason for the prorogation is to reduce the time available for parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit at a time when such scrutiny would appear to be a matter of considerable importance, given the issues at stake. \u201c[Put] shortly, prorogation was being mooted specifically as a means to stymie any further legislation regulating Brexit.\u201d Lord Drummond Young argued that the UK government\u2019s failure to provide the Scottish court with any valid reasons for proroguing Westminster for five weeks supported their conclusions it was unjustified. He wrote: \u201cIf no reason is given, in the present circumstances I am of opinion that the decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks out of the seven remaining before the United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the European Union leads inevitably to the conclusion that the reason for prorogation was to prevent parliamentary scrutiny of the government. I find it impossible to see that it could serve any other rational purpose.\u201d Lord Brodie, the third judge, said that despite the weight that courts need to give to the royal prerogative, and a government\u2019s right to use procedures to suit its purposes, this was an \u201cegregious\u201d case of misuse of prorogation. He said: \u201cProcedural manoeuvres are the stuff of politics, whether conducted in parliament or in lesser bodies.

Police said a postmortem will take place on Friday. </p> <p>A number of cordons remained in place near the river, including in Peel Street and River Street.

      "bodyText": "A 22-year-old man has been charged with the murder of 11-month-old Zakari William Bennett-Eko, who died after he was recovered from the River Irwell in Radcliffe on Wednesday, Greater Manchester police have said. The baby was rescued by firefighters from the river on Wednesday afternoon. He was taken to hospital but pronounced dead a short time later. In a statement on Thursday night, police said: \u201cA man has been charged after a baby boy who was found in the River Irwell sadly died. Zak Eko has been charged with murder. He has been remanded in custody and will appear at Manchester magistrates court tomorrow, Friday 13 September 2019.\u201d Earlier Zakari\u2019s mother, Emma Blood, paid tribute to her baby son. She posted a statement on Facebook saying she was unaware anything had happened to him until 7pm on Wednesday and did not know he had died until she reached the hospital. She wrote on her Facebook page: \u201cI lost my baby today. I love my little boy and did everything for him. I didn\u2019t know my child was dead until I got to A&amp;E. We sat with him for hours, we held him, we kissed him and then I left. \u201cI am alive, although I wish I was dead instead. Let me grieve for my child, my whole world and so much more.\u201d Police were called to the river near Blackburn Street in the town centre at around 4.25pm on Wednesday following reports that a baby was in the water. It is understood members of the public had already tried to rescue Zakari when emergency services \u2013 including the police helicopter arrived and managed to pull him from the water. Police said a postmortem will take place on Friday. A number of cordons remained in place near the river, including in Peel Street and River Street. Tearful mourners, many of whom were mothers with young children, left flowers, soft toys and candles at the scene. Among the tributes was a large cuddly bear with a card that read: \u201cTo a beautiful little boy. Sleep tight little man. Our thoughts are with your family. From all of us at Lidl Radcliffe.\u201d One card with flowers read: \u201cGoodnight and God bless beautiful innocent boy. Fly high angel.\u201d The boy\u2019s grandfather was too upset to comment as he visited the scene. He left a card that read: \u201cTo my beautiful grandson. We love you so much, RIP.\u201d",

More contemporary stories, such as Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/07/gravity-review\">Gravity</a>, give women a more active role \u2013 and in its ironic and offbeat way, this new movie is another such.

He has worked with screenwriters Brian C Brown and Elliott Di Giuseppi on this fictional version of one of the strangest tales in Nasa history: a tale of sexual tension in space, and what happens when spacemen and spacewomen have to come to terms with the existential boringness of life back on Earth.</p> <p>It is a witty, intriguing film in many ways, seductively shot by British cinematographer Polly Morgan. I suspect Hawley has taken some inspiration from Sam Mendes\u2019s American Beauty, with its eerie suburban moodscape. But I also feel the film is unsure of how much to disturb its audience, unsure whether to pursue the chaos and embarrassment of a bungled, noir-ish crime and an unsightly psychological disorder, or to contrive something more emollient: to finesse some sympathy and even heroism for the story\u2019s troubled female lead.</p> <p>It is based on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/feb/07/spaceexploration.usnews\">true story of Lisa Nowak</a>, a Nasa astronaut who was arrested in 2007 for a bizarre kidnap attempt in an airport parking lot, of a female air force captain who was in a romantic relationship with a male astronaut with whom Nowak was enamoured. The movie arranges it so that she has a stultifyingly boring marriage with a nice but dreary man; her attack is targeted at the man rather than the woman, and the film makes the other woman a rival Nasa astronaut. The damaged and obsessive antiheroine is played by Natalie Portman, her lover by Jon Hamm, and her name is changed from Lisa to Lucy, perhaps simply so that at a key moment the movie can play a cover version of the Beatles\u2019 Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds to accompany her slow hallucinatory slide towards a nervous breakdown. Because, having experienced the blazing ecstasy of space travel, seeing planet Earth from above, and getting a mind-bending perspective on the sheer littleness of her existence down below, Lucy loses it, very big time. Especially as she is not picked for the next space mission. Sexual infidelity is one way of recapturing the excitement and the intensity. Jealousy is perhaps another.</p> <p>Portman is good at suggesting the internalised anguish of a woman under pressure and beginning to crack: it is a role not so far from her Jackie Kennedy in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/19/jackie-review-natalie-portman-kennedy-assassination\">Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s movie</a> about the president\u2019s wife in shock, in the hours after the assassination. On the surface, Portman\u2019s Lucy is a tough, disciplined officer, impeccably squared away. But her superiors can tell there is something desperate in her. She is married to nice but boring Drew (Dan Stevens) and they are childless which, as in so many movies, is an easy signifier for marital discontent. While waiting to be picked for the next mission, she finds herself in an impulsive sexual relationship with sexy, divorced Mark (Hamm). There is a hilarious cameo for Ellen Burstyn, playing Lucy\u2019s hard-drinking, hard-smoking grandmother.</p> <p>The movie is good at showing that the problem is actually not that life on Earth is boring after the rocket-fuelled excitement of space travel; it is more that our ordinary lives are revealed to astronauts as fiercely strange. To come back to Earth after a spell in orbit and look at all our workaday rituals: work, home, shopping, etc, is to take a red pill: it is to see how strange all this is and to be unreconciled to it. Here we earthlings go about our business, never quite grasping how astonishing and exotic our existence actually is.

But while all the ingredients should conjure noir-ish intrigue, the Brechtian mechanism by which the story is told hampers the build-up of tension or high stakes required of a thriller.

A cast of four actors (Daniel Abelson, Fiston Barek, Michal Horowicz and Hara Yannas) squabble about how to start the story and then narrate by turns. This initial whimsy may seem like a prelude to the drama but is used to deliver it in fullness. The stage is bare but for the tools of its storytelling: a microphone, a desk with a typewriter, a chair.

The flip tone and comic games come to feel tiresome, for example the bell which when struck triggers an actor to run to the mic and explain an obscure word or history. It is a shame because the issues here are important, from how history intersects with the present to inherited trauma, the legacy of place \u2013 what past terrors a building might contain within its walls \u2013 and the idea of foreignness. The latter is dealt with particularly well in a supermarket scene in which the protagonist sees herself as the unwelcome immigrant that others may perceive her to be, which bears echoes of an increasingly isolationist Europe today and is sharply comic. The historical facts behind this play are startling: 75% of the Jewish population in the Netherlands was murdered by the Nazis and once the war was over, those returning home were forced to pay the utility bills of their wartime occupiers. Maya Arad Yasur\u2019s script is complex and layered, bringing a contemporary resonance to this history, but it becomes hard work to follow: there are references not only to Nazi genocide but Hamas, Israeli militarism, Gaza and Isis, while the switch in voices causes some confusion. This feels like an over-conceptualised play packed with serious points which are obscured by the dramatic game it plays too fast and loosely to have the powerful effect its themes deserve. At the Orange Tree, London, until 12 October. Then touring.",

I retweeted it, suggesting that Millwall\u2019s minuscule fine would make no impact on the behaviour of fans at a club already synonymous with racism.</p> \n<p>What followed was a barrage of personal abuse from Millwall fans, some insisting I was unfair to suggest they all behaved as unpleasantly as the club\u2019s stereotype would suggest, and others absolutely reinforcing that stereotype. My tweets are now protected to avoid further abuse, which means people can\u2019t see or reply to my tweets unless I have approved their request to follow me; within hours I had about 100 follow requests from people identifying as Millwall fans, who expected me to give them the approval they needed to send me their abuse. For these people it was not enough to write abusive comments about me, they wanted to make sure I saw the abuse \u2013 and they expected me to volunteer for it.</p> \n<p>At the end of last month I published a book, They Don\u2019t Teach This, the product of a year of effort not just by me but by my ghostwriter and publishers. Within 48 hours of my tweet Amazon had received and duly published dozens of one-star reviews by people who had neither bought nor read the book, reviews that were mostly not themselves racist but whose authors were clearly motivated by tribalism, bitterness and hatred.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d8501cf3-4291-4a07-878b-56c572d5ae10\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j5dB64VEsSw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>I have worked too hard on my book just to sit back and accept that these people, who can\u2019t take the truth about their own club or who themselves embody it, can destroy its chances of success by spewing their hate while hiding behind the cloak of anonymity.

That happened in the late 1990s when rivals were running rings around the organisation and even the top brass at John Lewis seemed to lose faith in their chief point of difference. It is not today\u2019s position.</p> <p>Record profits were achieved as recently as 2017, so the current decline is from a high level. The first loss at the half-year stage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/12/john-lewis-warns-of-no-deal-brexit-impact\">of \u00a325.9m</a>, is serious and embarrassing but, since even a no-deal Brexit can\u2019t delay the arrival of Christmas, there will be a pre-tax profit at the full-year.</p> <p>Indeed, if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/operation-yellowhammer-fears-no-deal-brexit-chaos-forced-to-publish-secret-papers\">Yellowhammer</a> hell is avoided, the full-year outcome may not be wildly short of last year\u2019s group-wide \u00a3160m.

      "bodyText": "The definition of a true crisis at John Lewis, one should remember, is a threat to the model of employee ownership. That happened in the late 1990s when rivals were running rings around the organisation and even the top brass at John Lewis seemed to lose faith in their chief point of difference. It is not today\u2019s position. Record profits were achieved as recently as 2017, so the current decline is from a high level. The first loss at the half-year stage, of \u00a325.9m, is serious and embarrassing but, since even a no-deal Brexit can\u2019t delay the arrival of Christmas, there will be a pre-tax profit at the full-year. Indeed, if Yellowhammer hell is avoided, the full-year outcome may not be wildly short of last year\u2019s group-wide \u00a3160m.

The cost to the airline was estimated to be about \u00a340m a day.</p> <p>Pilots have demanded a profit-share scheme and rejected a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/06/ba-strike-4300-staff-to-take-part-in-airlines-first-ever-pilot-walkout\">three-year pay deal worth 11.9%</a>, claiming they have been let down by the airline after supporting it through several lean years.</p> <p>The travel plans of tens of thousands of passengers are likely to be affected, although the airline had warned customers of likely cancellations when the first wave of strike dates were announced on 23 August. It also removed flights from sale. BA would on a normal day carry an average of 145,000 passengers.</p> <p>In a statement, British Airways said: <strong>\u201c</strong>It is now a month since we shook hands on a pay deal. We urge [Balpa] to call off their strike and return to negotiations.</p> <p>\u201cTo give our customers as much certainty as possible, we are now contacting all those affected to offer them a full refund or a rebook on an alternative date, destination or airline. We are very sorry that Balpa\u2019s actions will affect thousands more travel plans.\u201d</p> <p>Extra staff have been drafted in to work on BA\u2019s phone lines after it drew criticism that it failed to respond to customer queries when the first cancellations were announced. The airline said its customer relations teams have now dealt with almost half a million telephone calls since the strike dates were set by Balpa.</p> <p>Balpa had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/05/british-airways-spurns-olive-branch-from-pilots-union\">said it would hold talks</a> to avert further strikes but that it wanted \u201cmeaningful negotiations\u201d, adding that BA had to improve its offer.</p> <p>The union accused the airline of being \u201cirresponsible and inconsiderate\u201d to customers by cancelling flights now rather than holding talks. BA would be liable for additional payouts to passengers, covering costs such as hotels, if it cancelled with less than 14 days\u2019 notice, under EU261 flight compensation rules.</p> <p>A Balpa spokeswoman said: \u201cBalpa set a gap between the first and second periods of strike action to give BA time to work with us to settle this dispute with their pilots.

      "bodyText": "British Airways has begun cancelling flights ahead of a second strike by pilots later this month. The airline confirmed cancellations with thousands of passengers around 27 September, when pilots in the Balpa union are due to walk out for another 24 hours, in a dispute over pay and conditions. BA cancelled about 1,700 flights during the first strike on Monday and Tuesday, with some disruption continuing into Wednesday. The cost to the airline was estimated to be about \u00a340m a day. Pilots have demanded a profit-share scheme and rejected a three-year pay deal worth 11.9%, claiming they have been let down by the airline after supporting it through several lean years. The travel plans of tens of thousands of passengers are likely to be affected, although the airline had warned customers of likely cancellations when the first wave of strike dates were announced on 23 August. It also removed flights from sale. BA would on a normal day carry an average of 145,000 passengers. In a statement, British Airways said: \u201cIt is now a month since we shook hands on a pay deal. We urge [Balpa] to call off their strike and return to negotiations. \u201cTo give our customers as much certainty as possible, we are now contacting all those affected to offer them a full refund or a rebook on an alternative date, destination or airline. We are very sorry that Balpa\u2019s actions will affect thousands more travel plans.\u201d Extra staff have been drafted in to work on BA\u2019s phone lines after it drew criticism that it failed to respond to customer queries when the first cancellations were announced. The airline said its customer relations teams have now dealt with almost half a million telephone calls since the strike dates were set by Balpa. Balpa had said it would hold talks to avert further strikes but that it wanted \u201cmeaningful negotiations\u201d, adding that BA had to improve its offer. The union accused the airline of being \u201cirresponsible and inconsiderate\u201d to customers by cancelling flights now rather than holding talks. BA would be liable for additional payouts to passengers, covering costs such as hotels, if it cancelled with less than 14 days\u2019 notice, under EU261 flight compensation rules. A Balpa spokeswoman said: \u201cBalpa set a gap between the first and second periods of strike action to give BA time to work with us to settle this dispute with their pilots. We had today been exchanging new ideas to do that via [the arbitration service] Acas and so it irresponsible and inconsiderate to its customers that BA has pulled out and decided to start cancelling flights now, just to save money on compensation. BA did not respond to our latest proposals before cancelling these flights. \u201cPassengers who will be affected by these cancellations should know that we have given BA multiple opportunities to work with us so we could call off this action.\u201d The consumer group Which? said customers with bookings should beware of being \u201cfobbed off\u201d by British Airways. Adam French, a consumer rights expert at Which? said: \u201cBA must now proactively inform those affected by any fresh cancellations of their rights to be rerouted on the next available flight, even if this is with a rival airline. \u201cUnless a refund is vital to you, don\u2019t be fobbed off by this option.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWherever law ends, tyranny begins,\u201d propounded John Locke in 1690. The idea was captured and adjusted to the needs of our modern constitutional democracy by Tom Bingham, a pioneer of conceiving justice as the \u201crule of law\u201d (and the \u201cgreatest judge of his era\u201d, as his obituary in the Guardian noted). I wonder what this great proponent of judicial independence and the rule of law would make of this government\u2019s utter disregard for both concepts, and for law itself, as a system that government must adhere to if we are not to slip into a tyranny of the executive. Bingham wrote, quoting Dicey: \u201cevery man, whatever his rank or condition, is subject to the ordinary law of the realm and amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals\u201d. But this government would beg to differ. The PM would \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than apply the law and seek a further extension to article 50. He prorogued parliament to allow for executive fiat, and misled the Queen in the process (Johnson resists recalling MPs after Scottish ruling, 12 September). We now know this for certain. Scotland\u2019s supreme civil court leaves no doubt: the \u201ctrue reason\u201d for prorogation \u201cwas to stymie parliamentary scrutiny of the executive\u201d; an \u201cegregious case\u201d of failing to comply with \u201cprinciples of democracy and the rule of law\u201d. Any normal-functioning government would take note. The response of a No 10 source was instead to call into question the Scottish judiciary\u2019s impartiality. The end of reason is in sight, and it is preceded by the end of law. Prof Dimitrios Giannoulopoulos Founder and director, Britain in Europe thinktank \u2022 While Boris Johnson repeatedly insists that the prorogation of parliament had nothing to do with Brexit, I, and the 1.7 million others who signed the \u201cDo not prorogue Parliament\u201d petition, have recently received an email with the government response: \u201cProrogation is a prerogative Act of the Crown, exercised on the advice of Ministers. We must respect the referendum result and the UK will be leaving the EU on 31 October whatever the circumstances.\u201d Nothing to do with Brexit though. Neil Jones Swansea \u2022 \u201cBoris Johnson says it is \u2018absolutely\u2019 not true he misled Queen over prorogation\u201d (theguardian.com, 12 September). He would, wouldn\u2019t he? Adrian Willson Bath \u2022 Following the recent judicial ruling on the unprecedented prorogation of parliament, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman claimed it was \u201cto put before MPs a proper domestic legislative programme\u201d. However, since Mr Johnson\u2019s decision was made in camera, we only have his word for this. Would I be better advised to trust the words of my own MP, Ben Wallace, when he stated on camera in a conversation with French defence minister Florence Parly that the real reason for the suspension of parliament was that Boris Johnson doesn\u2019t have the majority to stop parliament blocking his Brexit plans? Austen Lynch Garstang, Lancashire \u2022 John Crace deftly and rightly rebukes the \u201cknown liars\u201d in No 10 (Sketch, 10 September), but I for one am hugely grateful for Dom\u2019s prorogation. Without it we would not have witnessed a galvanised parliament inflicting six defeats on this most undemocratic of governments, nor would we have witnessed the unforgettable, patient dignity of Dominic Grieve, as he called them to account for their hapless perfidy. As long as a democratic heart resides in our country, these last few extraordinary days will have a resonant significance. Tony Rowlands Bristol \u2022 Given that Boris\u2019s avowed position on his justification for the prorogation of parliament is that the time is needed to prepare a programme of legislation before the Queen\u2019s speech, has anyone thought to challenge him as to why this is still necessary? He no longer commands a majority in the House and will therefore be unable to enact any legislation, so having a Queen\u2019s speech at all will be pointless.

      "bodyText": "A West Papuan independence group has accused the Indonesian police of \u201cabducting\u201d a leading West Papuan activist in a dramatic arrest on Monday. The United Liberation Movement for West Papua, whose exiled leader is Benny Wenda, said in a statement that a joint strike force of Indonesian police and military surrounded the home of the high-profile activist Buchtar Tabuni early on Monday morning. The group claims several shots were fired and four armed troops surrounded Tabuni before he was taken into custody, with no prior notice or summons. A national police spokesperson, Dedi Prasetyo, confirmed Tabuni\u2019s arrest for suspected treason, telling the Guardian the Papuan regional police had handled the arrest in the context of \u201censuring security and order in Jayapura and Papua in general\u201d. Tabuni, who is a key member of the West Papuan leadership along with Wenda, is seen as a mastermind of protests that have spread across West Papua and other provinces in recent weeks. Meanwhile, allegations of brutal violence continue to emerge from the strife-torn region in the wake of the protests. Footage allegedly from a rally in Fakfak on 21 August appears to show Indonesian special forces soldiers, in uniform but walking among militia members, firing live rounds across a body of water at independence demonstrators on the other side. And the death toll from a separate clash between West Papuan independence demonstrators and Indonesian military has risen to eight, a priest who was a witness to the shooting has told the Guardian. Father Santon Tekege from the diocese of Timika Papua said the protesters had gathered at the regency office in Deiyai, in Papua province, on 28 August. Video footage obtained by the Guardian shows soldiers opening fire at demonstrators, walking towards protesters, some of whom are standing with their hands up. Initially, the death toll was reported as six, but this had since risen to eight, with 39 people injured, Tekege said. He said security forces fired teargas canisters and \u201cthousands of bullets\u201d towards the protesters. Tekege said UN intervention was needed to bring peace to West Papua and asked \u201cinternational parties to support West Papua independence\u201d. The Deiyai deputy regent has confirmed the death count at eight, the Jakarta Post reported. But police have disputed the toll, saying only one protester was killed, along with one soldier, and that security forces opened fire only after being attacked. On Thursday morning Indonesian police confirmed they had also arrested Steven Itlay, a leader of civil society group the National Committee for West Papua, for his role in the protests. Itlay was arrested at Cenderawasih University in Jayapura on Wednesday afternoon with two others, who the Guardian understands are members of the same group. Indonesian police have named dozens of people, mostly protesters, as suspects after more than three weeks of protests across Papua, West Papua and other Indonesian provinces. Many of them are being interrogated without lawyers, Emanuel Gobay, the director of the Papua Legal Aid Institute, told the Jakarta Post on Wednesday. The protests were sparked by the racist abuse and arrest of Papuan students in Surabaya, on the island of Java, but have morphed into a broader political demand for a referendum on independence. A long-running independence movement has existed since Indonesia forcibly took control of the provinces in the 1960s. The exiled leader Benny Wenda told the Guardian the deteriorating situation in West Papua required United Nations intervention. \u201cIndonesia is sending 6,000 troops on military exercises to West Papua. There is no war going on, this is peaceful demonstrators against a huge military. My people are in danger. We need to act now before it is too late.\u201d In a show of force, and perhaps an indication of a willingness to escalate military action if protests continue, the Indonesian military conducted exercises at Sentani and Wamena airfields in Papua.

The dairy cattle were scheduled to leave Portland in southern Victoria on the live export ship Yangtze Fortune on 23 August, bound for China as breeding stock. Instead they spent weeks in feedlots as federal agriculture officials told the live exporter to halt the consignment following allegations of tampering. \u201cThis decision was due to the department\u2019s concerns that elements of China\u2019s strict export protocols had not been adhered to in relation to this specific consignment,\u201d a Department of Agriculture spokesperson said. \u201cThis issue does not relate to any type of disease outbreak in Australia.\u201d The department said it was conducting a joint investigation with Agriculture Victoria and providing regular updates to authorities in China. It said it would not comment further while the investigation was under way. The Portland Observer newspaper reported that the cattle were filling up local feedlots, but the department said they could be moved. \u201cThere are no current restrictions on the domestic movement of the cattle,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThis is a commercial decision for the exporter.\u201d It was understood that ear tags, used to trace the origin of cattle, were tampered with. The Australian Live Export Council\u2019s chief executive, Mark Harvey-Sutton, said the incident related to an alleged breach of Australia\u2019s domestic traceability systems. He said that halting the shipment was a \u201cdrastic action\u201d that reflected the seriousness of the incident. \u201cCompliance with our integrity systems is paramount and if there has been a breach we hope the department investigates that thoroughly,\u201d Harvey-Sutton told Guardian Australia. \u201cBut we would also like the department to conclude their investigation as soon as possible because it obviously does come at a significant cost to the exporter when consignments are held up.\u201d It comes amid calls for an urgent review of the live export supply chain system after Guardian Australia reported that another live exporter was under investigation for a supply chain breach in Indonesia. Four Australian cattle, exported by Perth-based International Livestock Exports, were filmed being held down by ropes and slaughtered in a mosque car park. ILE said it believed the cattle had been sold by a \u201crogue person\u201d at one of the 140 Indonesian facilities in its supply chain, and had suspended that facility. The RSPCA\u2019s senior policy officer, Dr Jed Goodfellow, said the incident was a stark reminder of the inherent risks of live export, and criticised attempts to shift blame onto Indonesian facilities. \u201cRSPCA Australia is also concerned about a trend in [exporter supply chain assurance system] non-compliance investigations where blame is being shifted to the in-market abattoir or facility, which is then periodically suspended to allow the exporter to simply move to the next abattoir down the road,\u201d Goodfellow said. \u201cGiven the number of breaches recorded against this exporter, this shows that there is simply no effective deterrent under the current ESCAS system.

There is no evidence that frequent changes have any long-term positive impact on performance.\u201d A spokesperson for the EFL said: \u201cThis report will contribute to what is an important debate and we will study its findings to establish what can be learnt. \u201cIt is early days for the use of positive action measures in professional football and we will continue to evaluate and develop our approach so that we can make progress on tackling the under-representation of minority managers and coaches.\u201d Meanwhile the anti-discrimination organisation Kick it Out, which has called for sanctions to effect change in recruitment, has named Sanjay Bhandari as its new chairman. Bhandari was a lawyer and partner at the accountancy firms KPMG and EY, before going on to sit on the Premier League\u2019s equality standard independent panel. The Premier League does not apply any form of the Rooney rule. \u201cI am absolutely delighted to join the Board of Kick It Out as its chair,\u201d Bhandari said. \u201cI have been a football fan all of my life and a vocal advocate for inclusion. I am passionate about helping football to be a game where people of all backgrounds feel welcome and included from the terraces to the pitch, to the boardroom.\u201d",

Fair play to Root, he is on the front foot by the end of the over, stroking through along the carpet - again to point. Burns has one ball to see off and parries a couple behind square.

While Curran &amp; Woakes are both excellent no. 9 batsmen, at 8 Woakes can only be deemed as alright &amp; coming in at 7 Curran is not exactly inspiring \u2013 even less so below the current top 6, Archer is again 1 place too high at 9. Likewise the out of form Buttler at 6 similarly the double-barrelled Bairstow-Bowled coming in at 5 whose current technique of leaving the gate open seems to have us on an endless loop: pitch it up and through it goes.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Yep, that isn\u2019t ideal but I still can\u2019t work out how it has taken until now to find a way for Sam Curran to get a run in this series. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7a1d3e8f08143ee1ae4d68\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T10:30:27.510Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>6th over: England 20-0 (Burns 9, Denly 11) </strong>That\u2019ll do, shot of the morning so far from Burns, driving Hazlewood down the ground for four.

The most interesting switch sees all-rounder Mitchell Marsh come in for his first Test of the series, replacing Travis Head. It\u2019s been a steep decline over the course of the series for Head, beginning the tour a fixture in the middle-order and one of Australia\u2019s vice-captains, and ending it overtaken convincingly by Marnus Labushagne with selectors favouring both Marsh and Matthew Wade in much tighter decisions. Elsewhere, Peter Siddle\u2019s control replaces Mitchell Starc\u2019s aggression in the bowling attack. </p> \n  <p><strong>Australia</strong>: Warner, Harris, Labuschagne, Smith, Marsh, Wade, Paine (c) (wk), Cummins, Siddle, Hazlewood, Lyon</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7a10388f082514879f2a7b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T09:34:32.511Z\">10.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Australia win the toss and field</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Ok, so this has thrown me.

For sure Cummins and Hazlewood have been terrific - but so have Broad and Archer. The Aussie pair\u2019s numbers are a bit better, but of course they are as they haven\u2019t had to bowl at Smith. In truth it\u2019s been two desperately mediocre batting units facing two strong attacks, but with the Aussies having one absolute all time great playing at his very peak to give them the win. We were denied a win by the rain in the match where Smith could only bat once, and won the game when he couldn\u2019t bat at all. But we were heavily beaten in the games where he was fit throughout. It\u2019s all been about Smith. Hard to think of another case in a team sport of one person being so ridiculously, completely ahead of all the others on his own and other teams.

England\u2019s selectors could have done more to heighten anticipation by selecting a couple of greenhorns in advance of overseas tours, but they\u2019ve stuck with the same bunch that have largely failed to capture the imagination, relying on flashes of individual brilliance from a small number of performers to even make a contest out of a series played mostly on Australia\u2019s terms. <br></p> \n  <p>Nonetheless, the weather is set fair for five days, there\u2019s not a spare seat in the house, and we should all be cherishing the opportunity to witness Steve Smith bat in such groundbreaking form.

      "bodyText": "That was an enjoyable day\u2019s play. The recalled Mitch Marsh was the star, with four for 35, while Jos Buttler top-scored with a breezy unbeaten 64. Australia would have expected to bowl England out after putting in, but they are still in front on what looks a pretty good pitch. Thanks for your company, night! 82nd over: England 271-8 (Buttler 64, Leach 10) A short ball from Hazlewood hits Leach on the arm guard and loops to gully. Australia go up for a catch off the glove, but Marais Erasmus correctly says not out. He is such a good umpire. And Leach is a pretty good No10; he survives the remainder of the over and will return tomorrow with his great mate Jos Buttler. 81st over: England 271-8 (Buttler 64, Leach 10) Pat Cummins is going to take the second new ball. Buttler chips just short of mid-on, misses a zesty smear across the line and is beaten by the last delivery. A maiden, which means Australia have the chance to start an over at Jack Leach. It should be the last of the day. 80th over: England 269-8 (Buttler 62, Leach 10) Mitch Marsh returns to the attack after suffering with cramp half an hour ago. Groundhog over: Buttler keeps the strike, this time with a single off the fourth ball. The new ball is due, though Australia\u2019s quicks look so shattered that they might save it until the morning. There are nine minutes\u2019 play remaining. \u201cI saw a lot of Sylvester Clarke at the Oval and can confirm that he really did like to bend his back when the opposition had a West Indian overseas player in their ranks,\u201d says Ian Burch. \u201cIt might have had something to do with him being banned by the West Indies for going on a rebel tour to South Africa or possibly some inter Island rivalry or more than likely both, but I can remember him giving Clive Lloyd a torrid time in a country match. Bearing in mind the other bowlers who were playing county cricket at this time, Sylvester Clarke was the most terrifying of them all. Happy days.\u201d 79th over: England 268-8 (Buttler 61, Leach 10) Cummins for Hazlewood. Buttler steals a single off the last delivery, again. This partnership, 41 in 8.1 overs, has been too easy for England. \u201cI was so glad of your hope-filled response to Ian Mott (over 74) as you reeled off names of possible practitioners of the art of doing batting,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cHowever, I realised that the inmates have taken over my particular prison as all I could think of at the prospect of placing hope in newbies was the plight of poor Haseeb Hameed.\u201d Oh I\u2019m not giving up on him. But it\u2019s too soon to discuss it in public. 78th over: England 265-8 (Buttler 58, Leach 10) The over-rate has again been abysmal. Teams are supposed to lose two Test championship points for every over they fall short, though this hasn\u2019t happened yet. If it does, England will be on 0 at the end of the series. Labuschagne comes on to replace Pat Cummins, and Buttler reverse sweeps firmly for four. For the first time in the entire series, I reckon he\u2019s enjoying his batting. Labuschagne drops an almost impossible return chance, which almost takes his thumb off, and then Buttler takes a single off the penultimate delivery. \u201cEngland\u2019s problems are nearly all due to that insane partnership between Bairstow and Stokes in South Africa,\u201d says Ben Skelton, \u201cwhich created the misleading impression that they had invented a new cricket paradigm when it was really a bizarre one-off.\u201d 77th over: England 260-8 (Buttler 53, Leach 10) Buttler pulls Hazlewood flat and hard into the crowd. That\u2019s his third six, and it brings up a two-paced fifty: 20 from the first 44 balls, 32 from the next 16. It\u2019s his first half-century in 10 Ashes Tests. He keeps the strike with a single off the penultimate delivery. \u201cYou say that Viv had a poor record against Marshall/Garner/Clarke &amp; Daniel...\u201d says Jon Akers. \u201cA poor record compared to who?\u201d A poor record compared to everyone who averaged more than 27.31 against Barbados in the same period. 76th over: England 251-8 (Buttler 44, Leach 10) Leach takes a single off Cummins, which gives Buttler three deliveries to get creative. He settles for a single off the second of those to keep the strike, and then Leach thick edges along the ground for four. \u201cSeptember 12, eh?\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201c\u2018Twas also the day, in 1885, when Arbroath beat Bon Accord 36-0, still a record in professional football. Had either of these teams been playing it would probably have been 36-2.\u201d 75th over: England 245-8 (Buttler 43, Leach 5) Buttler v Hazlewood, round 2... is postponed, because Leach faces all six deliveries. He even takes a single off the last delivery to keep the strike. When he drove Hazlewood he thought there would be two available. \u201cAnxious moments for David Warner,\u201d says Brian Withington, \u201cas both game and clock tick slowly towards an over facing Broad before stumps ...\u201d Australia in nightwatchman-opener-disgrace-shocker. 74th over: England 244-8 (Buttler 43, Leach 4) \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Iain Mott. \u201cThere must be, surely, some batsmen in the counties who are better than this. Time\u2019s up for the one-day specialists currently in the side. Is there anyone out there who follows the county game able to suggest some names?\u201d If Ollie Pope doesn\u2019t get a run at No5 or 6 in the next year, I\u2019ll be displeased. I\u2019m sure Dominic Sibley and/or Zak Crawley, two young openers, will go on the winter tour. Pope\u2019s the most exciting prospect, though. In his short career, he averages over 70 in first-class cricket for Surrey. 73.1 overs: England 243-8 (Buttler 43, Leach 3) Mitch Marsh, having outSiddled Siddle all day, replaces Siddle. And now he\u2019s gone! Marsh, that is. After one delivery he pulls up twice with cramp, to the amusement of everyone on the ground, Marsh included. Pat Cummins will finish the over. 73rd over: England 243-8 (Buttler 43, Leach 3) Buttler takes a shortcut to T20 mode, clouting Hazlewood\u2019s first ball back over his head for six. Hazlewood smiles, kinda. Buttler belts the next ball even further down the ground for six more. Hazlewood doesn\u2019t smile. An unsuccessful ramp from the third ball elicits a few words from Hazlewood, who has more to say when the fourth delivery is hacked behind square for a single. \u201cA bunch of white-ball cricketers trying to play Test cricket,\u201d writes Dominic Si- sorry, David Malcolm. \u201cThe solution of the ECB to the low standard of batting is to introduce even more white-ball cricket next season with the garbage Hundred tournament. Brilliant.\u201d At least you\u2019ll be able to hatewatch it on free-to-air. 72nd over: England 229-8 (Buttler 30, Leach 2) If the ball swings as much tomorrow as it has today, England are well in this game. If not, that\u2019s 27 Test hundreds for the remarkable Steven Smith. \u201cEveryone always said that Sylvester Clarke would bend his back a little more vs Somerset and Viv,\u201d says Patrick Blewer. \u201cThink Botham tried to smash him one night on the booze to avoid having to bat against him. Think about some of the attacks that Viv would have had to play against in the old Shell Shield - Barbados would have been Marshall / Garner / Sylvester and Daniel.\u201d Viv\u2019s record against Barbados was poor, I think. I\u2019d love to research a longread on some of those battles, both in the Shell Shield and the County Championship. That Botham story is true, and very funny. In fact \u2013 shameless plug alert \u2013 it\u2019s told in Robin Smith\u2019s new autobiography, which has an average rating of 4.8 on Amazon. Out of five. 71st over: England 226-8 (Buttler 29, Leach 0) The new batsman is Chris Rogers. Incidentally, Buttler got lucky earlier in that Hazlewood over with consecutive edges for four. The first was safe enough; the second bounced this far in front of Warner at first slip. \u201cHmmm,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cDid someone say \u2018400\u2019 earlier?\u201d That\u2019s why they pay me the small bucks. Too easy. Archer edges a channel delivery from Hazlewood straight to Tim Paine, who takes an easy catch. 70th over: England 217-7 (Buttler 20, Archer 9) Siddle replaces Marsh, who won\u2019t be getting his five-for just yet, and Buttler steals a quick single. It\u2019s too late for this series, and maybe for his Test career, but he\u2019s played well in the last couple of games. Maybe, just as you can apparently drink yourself sober, it is possible to tire yourself fresh. 69th over: England 216-7 (Buttler 19, Archer 9) Archer pulls Hazlewood brusquely for four. His batting has been a disappointment in his short international career, but there have been a few signs, like that, of his ability. He gets another boundary off the penultimate delivery, gloving an attempted pull just wide of the diving Paine. \u201cThe way Root got out to Cummins today and in the last Test is eerily reminiscent of the way Michael Vaughan used to get bowled,\u201d writes Dale Steyn Tom King. \u201cStuck on the crease, no forward movement, often done by balls holding their line or even going under the bat. Then that familiar confused look, sometimes blaming the pitch. If he\u2019d got a stride in to either delivery, he might have nicked off. But a top four batsman in Tests shouldn\u2019t be getting bowled by these.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s an excellent comparison. In Root\u2019s defence, they have bowled exceptionally well to him - not just this summer but in 2017-18 as well - and the captaincy is palpably affecting his batting. I\u2019d love for him to go back in the ranks and start enjoying his cricket again. 68th over: England 208-7 (Buttler 19, Archer 1) Mitch Marsh is one away from his maiden Test five-for. He\u2019ll have to wait for now; Archer survives the over and takes a single off the last ball. 67th over: England 207-7 (Buttler 19, Archer 0) Buttler gets in a tangle with Hazlewood\u2019s short ball, which hits him on the chest and deflects up onto the grille. No need for a concussion check, but there is time for a drinks break. \u201cIs it just me (probably) that thinks Root keeps making deliveries look a lot better than they are?\u201d says Al Taylor. \u201cNot saying it was a bad nut from Cummins, but more than once this series he\u2019s stood in Gattingesque disbelief when dismissed. I just don\u2019t see a peak 2015 Root getting out like he has done in the last few innings and it looks to me like he\u2019s trapped on the crease, something I feel the Aussies have definitely noticed as well.\u201d I think you\u2019re right. At least twice in this series, possibly more, I\u2019ve wrongly assumed he was undone by uneven bounce. That\u2019s because he\u2019s on the crease and groping at the ball, which means he ends up looking hunched. It was still a cracking delivery. 66th over: England 205-7 (Buttler 17, Archer 0) Woakes didn\u2019t take that LBW decision upstairs; had he done so, England would have lost their last review. Marsh has knifed through England\u2019s middle order: 14-4-33-4. That\u2019s four for Mitchell Marsh! Woakes, anticipating the usual short stuff, is trapped in front by another gorgeous yorker from Mitchell Marsh. He\u2019s having a stormer! 65th over: England 203-6 (Buttler 17, Woakes 0) Hazlewood replaces Cummins, which is like being tortured by a cheese grater rather than a cattle prod. Buttler wriggles free to clout a lovely cover drive for four. \u201cIs it just me who thinks that ball tracking has got that Bairstow dismissal very wrong?\u201d says John Withington. \u201cThat was late inswing and would have continued to swing the further the ball travelled, and increasingly so in an arc. Looks to me like tracker took a very conservative view of swing from the point of contact.\u201d It\u2019s quite possible. I\u2019ll never fully trust ball-tracking after it got that Stokes LBW wrong at Headingley. I think Bairstow\u2019s was hitting either way, but it might have been umpire\u2019s call rather then three reds. Still an entitled review, though. (In my opinion; this is a live blog, not a judicial review, etc.) 64th over: England 199-6 (Buttler 13, Woakes 0) \u201cHi England, just properly chill out at tea, yeah?\u201d says Felix Wood. \u201cNo need to focus afterwards. You\u2019ve done the hard work.\u201d In defence of Root and Bairstow, they were defending. I thought their focus was beyond reproach after tea, and they both fell to very good pieces of bowling. Curran had a dash but I don\u2019t blame him in the circumstances. Three for Mitchell Marsh! Sam Curran\u2019s frisky counter-attack of 15 from 13 balls ends when he edges a fast-handed drive to Smith in the slips. On a good pitch, England are in a deal of bother. 63rd over: England 193-5 (Buttler 12, Curran 10) Much better from Curran, who stands up to punch Cummins down the ground for three. He\u2019s going to counter-attack, this being a cricket match. Buttler, who is playing watchfully by comparison, thick edges a very full delivery for four. \u201cWatching that brilliant ball from Cummins to dismiss Joe Root, I fell to reflecting what Steve Smith would have made of it?\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cWith his exaggerated early move to the offside, the eye of a brain surgeon and the timing of a concert pianist I\u2019m guessing it would have been tucked to midwicket without fuss, or at worst a leading edge to extra cover. One run in either case.\u201d As with Viv and the West Indies bowlers in the 1980s, I\u2019d love to see the Aussie attack bowl at Smith. Trouble is, unlike Viv, most of them are on his side in domestic cricket as well. 62nd over: England 186-5 (Buttler 8, Curran 7) Marsh has a huge LBW appeal against Buttler turned down by Marais Erasmus. It was the inswinger again, but this time it did too much. Marsh is having an excellent day: 12-4-25-2. When you see him bowl with such craft, or thump 181 at Perth, it\u2019s hard to understand his modest Test career. Maybe they should just wheel him out against England \u201cI was wondering if the Australian runs per over would be higher or lower during the time when Smith was not at the crease,\u201d says Phil Russell. \u201cThen I realised the sample size would be so small it would be statistically unreliable anyway.\u201d 61st over: England 186-5 (Buttler 8, Curran 7) That was a thrilling and eventful over. Curran hooked his second ball over long leg, a stirring response to the inevitable intimidation. But he started moving too far across, expecting more short stuff, and Cummins trapped him in front with a much fuller delivery. Thankfully for England, it was a no-ball. That, as Nasser and Athers observe on Sky, should be a lesson for Curran not to get too far across his stumps. The fact he\u2019s almost bowled behind his legs next ball suggests he\u2019s yet to absorb it. \u201cI have two positive memories from 12 September 2005,\u201d says my erstwhile colleague Andy Butland. \u201cOne was being at the ground, having made the best \u00a310 investment of my life on a ticket six months earlier (obviously with the expectation of a 4-0 scoreline and/or a match already finished). And the second one was not being in the office and having to spend the day in a dark room rebooting the server running the C4 cricket site, that clearly had been massively under-specced for the popularity!\u201d We were all so clueless about the internet back then. Bliss it was. Oh I say. Cummins pins Curran in front with a beauty, two balls after being hooked for six, but replays show he has overstepped. 60th over: England 179-5 (Buttler 8, Curran 1) When Bairstow was given out he walked down the wicket for a chat with Buttler, who I suspect said it was out. Bairstow reviewed anyway, and England have lost that review because it was hitting leg stump on the full. That\u2019s yet another in his line of indulgent and/or stupid reviews. But that shouldn\u2019t obscure a brilliant piece of bowling from Marsh - not just the delivery itself up but also the extended set-up. Before that, according to CricViz, he had bowled 12 outswingers in a row to Bairstow. It was a sizzling delivery from Marsh, an inswinging yorker that hit Bairstow on the front foot. And it\u2019s out! WICKET (probably)! England 176-5 (Bairstow LBW b Marsh 22) Don\u2019t review it Jonny, don\u2019t review it. He\u2019s bloody reviewed it. This is plumb. 59th over: England 175-4 (Bairstow 22, Buttler 5) Bairstow is beaten by a ferocious delivery from Cummins which then wobbles late to give Tim Paine a bit of nominative determinism. He\u2019s beaten again later in the over, driving loosely outside off stump. This is yet another majestic spell from Cummins, the best flat-track bully in the world. 58th over: England 175-4 (Bairstow 22, Buttler 5) Buttler clumps a full outswinger from Marsh through extra cover for four before producing another excellent, courageous leave to a ball that would have hit a fourth stump. \u201cWhat a day that was!\u201d says Dave Voss of 12/09/2005. \u201cIf you could relive one over surely it\u2019d be that one where Pietersen took Lee on and took him on the hook for 6,6,4 (or similar). I think Tait got a hand to one of them and palmed it over the rope didn\u2019t he? Just imagine if he\u2019d taken that; Gilo would have had the opportunity to score KPs runs and make his century.\u201d From memory it was 644 in the 43rd over, the second of which was dropped for four by Tait, though I\u2019d have to check. Or perhaps not. It missed the bat and glove by miles, and the noise was ball on hip. Buttler is not out. Oof, I think this might out. Australia review for caught behind against Buttler. There was a noise, but nobody knows anything. 57th over: England 171-4 (Bairstow 22, Buttler 1) Mikey Holding makes the point that Root\u2019s front foot didn\u2019t go anywhere. That much is true, but it was still a beautiful delivery from a quite awesome bowler. Buttler leaves his first two deliveries, which takes a degree of courage given his dismissal on the last day at Old Trafford. He inside-edges the last ball for a single, the first run off Cummins in this session. Yet another unconverted fifty for Root, but he\u2019s pretty blameless here. It was a brilliant delivery from Cummins: full, angled in and straightening just enough to beat the bat and bother the off stump. Ashes to Ashes, dust to dust, if Hazlewood don\u2019t get ya, Cummins must. 56th over: England 170-3 (Root 57, Bairstow 22) A leg bye off Marsh is England\u2019s first run of the session. Their batting approach has definitely changed since the 67 all out at Headingley. There have still been some awful shots, it\u2019s true, but they have been less reluctant to do the hard yards. This little spell is a good example of that - Root and Bairstow, two of the more attacking players, have not taking any liberties against some accurate bowling. 55th over: England 169-3 (Root 57, Bairstow 22) Bairstow wants the first run of the session and is wisely sent back by Root. Another maiden, the third in a row. Australia\u2019s ability to control the scoreboard has been so important in this series - England have scored at 2.86 per over, Australia at 3.61. 54th over: England 169-3 (Root 57, Bairstow 22) A double bowling change, with Mitchell Marsh replacing Lyon. He continues to swing the old ball - orthodox, not reverse - and it\u2019s another maiden. There weren\u2019t many maidens once Kevin Pietersen got to work on this ground 14 years ago. If I could relive one day, 12 September 2005 would be pretty high on the list. And I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t go straight home after work. What was I thinking. 53rd over: England 169-3 (Root 57, Bairstow 22) Pat Cummins returns to bowl his 178th over of the series; only Nathan Lyon has bowled more. Australia know that two quick wickets here would make them massive favourites. He starts with a tidy maiden, respectfully played by Bairstow. You have one job 52nd over: England 169-3 (Root 57, Bairstow 22) Bairstow, pushing forward with stiff wrists, inside-edges Lyon not far wide of Labuschagne at short leg. Root then survives an appeal for a catch down the leg side; it was smartly taken by Paine but he had no interest in a review. That\u2019s tea. The afternoon session was fairly even: 83 runs and two wickets from 27 overs. See you in 15 minutes for the extended evening session. 51st over: England 166-3 (Root 57, Bairstow 19) This is Root\u2019s Test record against Australia. His last century was that carefree romp at Trent Bridge in 2015, when the world - ours and certainly his - was a simpler place. He\u2019s having to work pretty hard for his runs today, and there are none on offer in that over from Hazlewood. His sixth maiden of the day gives him figures of 13-6-29-1. 50th over: England 166-3 (Root 57, Bairstow 19) Lyon goes around the wicket to good effect, beating both batsmen with deliveries angled across them. He\u2019s struggling with his spinning finger, but there\u2019s no reserve slow bowler in this squad so he was always going to play. \u201cAdmittedly I wrote this before Burns and Stokes spooned up catches,\u201d says Gary Naylor, \u201cbut here\u2019s Tim Paine\u2019s thinking. England declare at tea on Friday on 551-6. Australia then bat out the draw, 863-7, Steven Smith 502 not out, Peter Siddle 5 not out (180 balls) #Ashes #HolliesAvenged\u201d What are those number signs for? 49th over: England 164-3 (Root 56, Bairstow 18) Hazlewood replaces the disappointing Siddle and slides a good one past Root\u2019s outside edge. A maiden. This is an important spell, given Hazlewood\u2019s record against Root and the flatness of the pitch. If England get through this, they\u2019ll have an incredible opportunity to reach the magic figure of 200. \u201cIf England decide to take the captaincy away from Root, surely it should go to Burns?\u201d says Keith Smith. \u201cBurns may have only spent a year playing Test cricket, but he has actual experience as a first-class captain. He\u2019s skippered Surrey for two full seasons and parts of a third, including winning the County Championship in 2018. He seems to have the right temperament for it too, coming across as calm and thoughtful, and doesn\u2019t appear fazed by pressure situations. Burns\u2019 place in the Test team is among the most secure of the current crop of batsmen. He\u2019d be a much better option than Broad, Stokes or Buttler. They\u2019ll probably stick with Root though.\u201d I\u2019d be happy enough with that, even if it feels slightly early for him. I\u2019m 99.94 per cent sure they\u2019ll stick with Root. England don\u2019t sack Test captains any more, unless they\u2019re Kevin Pietersen. 48th over: England 164-3 (Root 56, Bairstow 18) Lyon replaces Mitch Marsh, who bowled a fine old-ball spell of 7-1-17-1. Root and Bairstow do some effective milking. These look like the friendliest batting conditions of the series for England. \u201cSurely,\u201d says John Starbuck, \u201cthe explanation for Marsh bowling better in England than elsewhere is the Duke ball?\u201d Case closed, Columbo. 47th over: England 157-3 (Root 53, Bairstow 16) There hasn\u2019t been a drawn Ashes series since 1972, which is a pretty weird stat when you think about it, and I\u2019ve done little else these past few days. Root drives Siddle for three to continue England\u2019s promising start, and then Bairstow works two off the pads - his 3,999th and 4,000th in Tests. He\u2019s come a long way since we all had our heart broken at Lord\u2019s in 2012. \u201cIf Marcus Smith (over 42) is correct,\u201d says Simon Ebbett, \u201cEngland will be all out for 4049, soundly beating the 1185 I once got on Brian Lara Cricket. At its easiest setting. Against Zimbabwe.\u201d 46th over: England 152-3 (Root 50, Bairstow 14) Marsh tries to tempt Bairstow with some seductive outswingers. Bairstow leaves a couple and then thumps the final delivery through point for four. Shot! He\u2019s started his innings superbly. 45th over: England 148-3 (Root 50, Bairstow 10) Root scampers back for two to reach a charmed fifty from 105 balls. He will be desperate to make a century, having failed to convert his last eight fifties in Ashes Tests. \u201cDidn\u2019t England get 400 in the first innings at Melbourne in the last Ashes?\u201d says Mark Hutchinson. \u201cOr was that still 2017? Anyway, I\u2019m sure I read that since the start of the last Ashes tour, England have made 400 runs more times in ODIs (twice) than they have in the first innings of Test matches (once), which is impressive in some ways.\u201d In some ways. Yep, that was 2017, and that stat is correct. I still think the trade was worth it, to win the World Cup, but now\u2019s the time for English cricket to return to its first love, Test cricket. 44th over: England 146-3 (Root 48, Bairstow 10) This has been a good spell from Marsh, who has got the old ball to move in the air. He tends to bowl well over here. In his short Test career, he averages 18 with the ball in England as compared to 51 everywhere else. \u201cWould it be right or wrong,\u201d says Geoff Wignall, \u201cto think that England\u2019s short-, medium- and long-term prospects are best served by another Aussie victory here followed by a proper overhaul and reset?\u201d I suspect there will be no overhaul, whatever the result. It\u2019ll be an interesting few weeks. I would omit Bairstow and possibly Buttler from the New Zealand tour, and change the captain, but there\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to happen. 43rd over: England 145-3 (Root 47, Bairstow 10) Siddle replaces Cummins, and Bairstow greets him with emphatic boundaries off the first two balls - a thumping straight drive followed by a brusque cut stroke. Superb batting. \u201cThere is a lot of talk, TMS in particular, criticising Tim Paine\u2019s decision to bowl,\u201d says Damian Kemp. \u201cIt would have been a decision by leadership team and backroom staff. Remembering that backroom staff would include the likes of Langer and Steve Waugh and medical staff with a view on player fitness. No offence to experts with zero skin in this game, I will go with their judgement.\u201d Even they are allowed to get things wrong, which I also think they did here. It\u2019s certainly not a shocker to compare with Brisbane 2002 and Edgbaston 2005, and had they caught Root the decision might have been completely vindicated. But I\u2019m still struggling to see the logic, unless Nathan Lyon is really struggling, in which case he probably shouldn\u2019t be playing. 42nd over: England 137-3 (Root 47, Bairstow 2) \u201cWith the England wickets falling at 27, 103 and 130,\u201d says Marcus Smith, \u201cI predict the next will fall at 233. The Fibonacci Sequence says so.\u201d 41st over: England 137-3 (Root 45, Bairstow 2) Root pushes Cummins pleasantly through the covers for three. His intent has been good today, even if he has had all kinds of fortune. Bairstow, whose intent is sometimes too good for his own good, gets off the mark with a bread-and-butter flick for two. This is a big innings for Bairstow, who needs a score to guarantee his place for the New Zealand tour. Him and a few others. 40th over: England 130-3 (Root 42, Bairstow 0) Here\u2019s Jonny Bairstow, the brains of the operation. Mitch Marsh swings one back into Stokes that rams him in the box and knocks him off his feet. Get ready for a broken effing box, etc. Or, perhaps, for a hideous shot two balls later. Stokes tries to pull, hopelessly mistimes the stroke and top-edges it miles in the air to Lyon at point. Thanks Adam, afternoon everyone. The sun\u2019s out, the pitch is flat, the luck is going Joe Root\u2019s way. If England aren\u2019t careful, they could end up making 400 in the first innings of a Test for the first time since 2017. 39th over: England 130-2 (Root 42, Stokes 20) The final over of today\u2019s third hour courtesy of Pat Cummins, dealt with conservatively by Root before pushing the last ball to cover for two. A long email from Boris Starling to read while the players take a drink. After the breather, it\u2019ll be Rob Smyth with you for the second half of the day. Thanks for your great company. Bye for now. \u201cSeeing the wrath of AB referenced reminds me of a line in Ian Healy\u2019s very entertaining autobiography, \u2018Hands and Heals\u2019. I can\u2019t remember what prompted the incident, but Heals recalls: \u2018no sooner I was on the outer than AB was into me.\u2019 I loved this line because it seemed like something from an Australian-English GCSE translation paper, to which the answer would have been \u2018I had barely left the field of play before Allan Border was expressing his displeasure.\u2019 There were many such examples in the book. I don\u2019t have it to hand, but off the top of my head I can remember: \u2018Warney\u2019s ripped one and I\u2019ve worn it.\u2019 Trans: \u2018Shane Warne has achieved turn so prodigious I failed to react in time and received a blow to the face.\u2019 \u2018I was real dirty about it.\u2019 Trans: \u2018I was exceedingly displeased.\u2019 Was always a big fan of Healy: a proper keeper in every respect (exceptionally skilled and very mouthy), and I can\u2019t help feeling he\u2019s slightly underrated by many people, if only because he gave way to the force majeure that was Adam Gilchrist.\u201d 38th over: England 128-2 (Root 40, Stokes 20) Mitchell Marsh, do have yourself another trundle, young man. He\u2019s getting a bit of hoop to Stokes as well, England\u2019s new No4 playing watchfully through the over before taking a couple off his pads to finish. \u201cRegarding Root\u2019s captaincy and whatnot, the clear way forward for England and to prevent all this moaning and what-iffing is to let the all-knowing public decide,\u201d suggests Ian Copestake. \u201cReferemdum the arse off anything remotely tricky seeming.\u201d Something, something, that time Farage got invited onto TMS, something. 37th over: England 126-2 (Root 40, Stokes 18) Cummins back and that has liberated Stokes it seems: four, four. The first of those was a nice drive with the full face of the back down the ground, the second behind point via a thickish edge. Even so, he\u2019s into double figures. \u201cIf Stuart Broad were captain, both England\u2019s reviews would be used in his first over,\u201d says Dale Sellers. I\u2019d certainly hope so. Cricket\u2019s first full-time stand-up comic, big Disco Stu. May he thrive forever. 36th over: England 115-2 (Root 39, Stokes 8) Another shout for lbw, another inside edge. Siddle has found that part of Root\u2019s blade routinely so far in this session. He goes short in an effort to break Stokes\u2019 concentration but he doesn\u2019t work, the new man pulling a couple before flicking a single fine to finish. That might be it for Siddle for the time being, Lyon warming up in front of us. 35th over: England 111-2 (Root 38, Stokes 5) Stokes takes two when Hazlewood is on the stumps but other than that, they are happy playing a cat and mouse game in the channel outside off for now. \u201cDid you catch the absolute worst case of commentator\u2019s curse on TMS for Burns\u2019 wicket?\u201d asks Simon Davies on twitter. I did not; please continue. \u201cSimon Mann just said Burns was looking good and that it was fine to say so because he doesn\u2019t believe in the curse. Burns out literally next ball.\u201d As I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019m now banned from commentating on Mitch Marsh as the main reason why his Test batting average is what it is. 34th over: England 108-2 (Root 37, Stokes 3) Siddle continues his work from the Vauxhall End, dotting Root up in the channel before bringing one back to find the inside egde but not quite the timber. Stokes plays him out watchfully, his job here to bat for a long time. 33rd over: England 107-2 (Root 36, Stokes 3) Hazlewood is letting Stokes make the running here early on, hanging it out there on a fifth/sixth stump line for the bulk of this over. He leaves it be. \u201cAustralia shouldn\u2019t be too disheartened,\u201d observes Paul Edwards. \u201cTwo more wickets and they are into England\u2019s tail.\u201d And this from Richard McConnell on Root\u2019s leadership. \u201cThe question of captaincy could be the most telling decision of the coming 6 months. A positive change could put England on a different path, but I worry about the propensity to opt for the conservative choice. I guess my main question is why does the star player have to be the captain? Lara wasn\u2019t a great captain, but was a brilliant and consistent Test batsman. Give it to Broad for two year and tell him he will only play Test cricket from now on. Emulate what worked for the ODI team.\u201d Oh, if fast bowlers were eligible, by all means. But we all know if somebody bowls quick then they are not allowed. THE RULES. 32nd over: England 105-2 (Root 36, Stokes 1) Nice again from Siddle, jagging back at Root to begin, prompting an appeal. Doing too much. \u201cHe looks a different bowler since lunch,\u201d acknowledges Warne on the telly. He then beats Stokes with a jaffa from around the wicket. Much fuller and much better. Stokes clips a yorker for one to finish. \u201cAfternoon Adam.\u201d Brian Withington, always a pleasure. \u201cBefore his inevitable century later today, I just wanted to place on the record that in my book Joe Root is still a bloody fine batsman in all formats. His captaincy is nowhere near as poor as is made out by the detractors. And as you point out, there are no obvious alternatives anyway. Talk of Morgan doing the job in Tests is somewhere between risible and laughable.\u201d 31st over: England 103-2 (Root 35, Stokes 0) The vice-captain joins the skipper, leaving the one ball he has to look at here from Hazlewood. A wicket maiden for him at an important time. Oh dear, what\u2019s he gone and done that for? Hazlewood has worked Burns over with the short one, a leading edge landing with Marsh at midwicket. He did so well to avoid anything like that before lunch. 30th over: England 103-1 (Burns 47, Root 35) There\u2019s the England 100, raised with a Burns\u2019 second boundary off Siddle in the over. After getting right back into the scrap after lunch, that\u2019s a poor set from the veteran, giving the left-hander a chance to twice punish him through cover - one of those coming off a no-ball, too. Robert McLiam Wilson has some thoughts on play being stopped for movement behind the bowlers\u2019 arm. I\u2019ll publish them in full. \u201cAll very well Vish distracting Burns but it\u2019s LOLs \u2018cos they\u2019re mates and alWay back, I once got a flea in my ear for getting on Allan Border\u2019s wick at the beginning of an over. Apart from the lasting shame, my chief memories are of his remarkable vocal projection (what a very real loss he was to Shakespearian theatre) and that I had never heard the three-syllable version of \u2018**** ing\u2019 before that. I\u2019d grown up in the midst of a civil war but nothing quite gave me the nightsweats like Al\u2019s terse summation of my general utility. Do I hear right that you are having a baby? A million congratulations. Now get you hair cut.\u201d Border v Paris Bob. Yes please. And yes, good news travels fast - very grown-up. My hair is a fraction less Moz-like now though; got barbered me (too) short between Tests. Vish and I will visit soon. 29th over: England 97-1 (Burns 42, Root 35) In that over, Root has gone past Bradman\u2019s 6996 and on to 7000 career runs with a classy square drive for four off Hazlewood to finish their best over since the break. He\u2019s the third youngest to that mark. Smith is 130 away from 7000 as well, so he\u2019ll probably join him there at about 5pm Friday. 28th over: England 91-1 (Burns 42, Root 31) Another solid over from Siddle to Burns, working his way into a much better spell. \u201cSpeaking of Andy Zaltzman,\u201d says Joe Cross, \u201che had some telling stats about Root\u2019s form as captain, in particular hinging on THAT Headingley test against the Windies in 2017. Something like in 43 matches prior he averaged 78 in the first innings - one of the best in the world - and in 27 matches since averages 26 in the first innings.\u201d Joe Grant has a Root take too: \u201cBecoming abundantly clear the Aussie\u2019s are dropping Root in the hope he posts a decent score and hangs onto the captaincy. Short term damage, long term gains.\u201d Unless they turn to Stokes (seems unlikely, doesn\u2019t it?) then it probably will be Root when they next play Australia. Who else? 27th over: England 89-1 (Burns 42, Root 31) Hazlewood finds the inside edge too with his first ball after lunch, Root then getting on top of his forward defensive. But another loose shot later in the over, lashing and missing at a ball well outside his off-stump. Hmm. \u201cWhen Root\u2019s inevitable hundred is followed by the inevitable email response,\u201d emails Damian Ainsworth, \u201ccan it also be pointed out that it\u2019s his luckiest ever century?\u201d It\u2019ll all be coming, I\u2019m sure. Speaking of luck, Sky says that Siddle has now had five catches put down off his bowling in the series. His lot in life, much like Broad. 26th over: England 89-1 (Burns 42, Root 31) Better from Siddle, so close to nipping under Root\u2019s bat with the second delivery of the session. A big inside edge saves him. A nice length to follow, too, Root leaving close to the off-stump, then defending from that line. Much, much, much better. THEN SMITH DROPS ROOT! He does well to reach it on the dive across from second slip with no third catcher in position. But he did get both hands to it. Three chances for Root. A prediction from Boris Starling as the players return to the field. \u201cSmith to score 328 as Australia power to an absurdly large score. This would let him overtake Bradman\u2019s 974 but leave him on 999 for the series, which would be doubly appropriate as (a) it would be his own yes-I-am-mortal equivalent of the Don\u2019s 99.94 (b) it\u2019s the telephone number England have needed to call for most of the summer when he\u2019s been batting.\u201d And a duck in the second dig? Being The Oval and all, that\u2019ll work perfectly. Righto, Siddle to Root. PLAY! \u201cLoving the coverage as usual.\u201d Thank you, Ben Garbutt. \u201cYour comment about Vish Ethantharajah being good mates with Rory Burns (over 22) got me thinking. Any potential conflict of interest declarations to make yourself, or on behalf of other OBOers? Not that I\u2019m casting aspertions, just looking for transparency! Alright, alright, maybe I\u2019m a little bit jealous too.\u201d That\u2019s a rich vein! Well, Nathan Lyon was my club captain ten years ago; I\u2019m never shy about that. Nor the fact that in a rep game when we were 15, Sidds took 3/0 in the final over when we needed two to win. That hurt. He doesn\u2019t remember it but I do. To be honest, it\u2019s part of the job to maintain friendships around the place. Nothing wrong with that considering how much time we all spend together. \u201cLove your work on the OBO and the pod.\u201d Thank you Quentin Seik. \u201cThought you should know that Channel 9 at flogging their usual offical memorabilia for the Ashes series... this ones entitled \u2018Mission Accomplished\u2019. The ad they\u2019re running clearly shows the result of this test as being an Australian victory printed on the bottom of the picture! As that\u2019s all settled you may as well take the afternoon off.\u201d Brilliant. Screenshot that, please. Whatever would Tony Greig think? \u201cWe\u2019ll have a bowl.\u201d says Gary Naylor. I\u2019ll just leave this here. Funny you mention the Sion Mills game. There is a fundraising drive going on at the moment to help rebuild the club after the club was trashed by vandals earlier this week. With about ten minutes up our sleeve until the re-start, that is more than enough time to sign yourself up to The Spin. A weekly gem. The podcast is pretty neat too. I joined Emma after the Manchester Test along with Vish and Steen, an old teammate of Dave Warner\u2019s. A poor session from Australia. Electing to bowl first on a nice day, wickets need to come early for the fielding team or it can get ugly and fast. To be fair, they should have Root, a couple of times, but he was put down at long leg by Siddle and then by Paine in Cummins\u2019 next over. Justin Langer will be giving them a serve at lunch, make no mistake. Speaking of, I\u2019m going to grab a plate of food myself. Back with some of your excellent emails in about 15 minutes. For now, if you like Andy Zaltzman\u2019s stylings on TMS, Geoff Lemon and I had him on our pod overnight. Very sharp. 25th over: England 86-1 (Burns 42, Root 28) Short from Cummins to Burns but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s so much as considered a horizontal bat shot from the bouncer since the first dig at Leeds. He shuts up shop entirely from the last few balls, knowing that he\u2019s made it to lunch. And made it nicely, as well. The local lad has earned this sandwich. 24th over: England 86-1 (Burns 42, Root 28) Nathan Lyon is coming on for what will probably be a one over spell before lunch. Sure enough, in keeping with the theme of the last 20 minutes, another misfield - from the man least likely, Cummins, allowing Root to get a couple from a push behind point. He pats the rest on the head. Lunch awaits for the skipper. Surely, surely he goes large today. 23rd over: England 84-1 (Burns 42, Root 26) Root dropped again! Was Paine overcompensating for not diving in front of Warner last week? This time, the edge was going straight to first slip but the \u2018keeper went at it with a diving right glove and couldn\u2019t pull it down. Dropped twice off Cummins in two overs. The camera pans to Justin Langer, who is chewing his gum with real aggression. Burns makes it hurt that little bit more, driving nicely through cover for four more. Nearing lunch, what a poor morning this has been for the visitors. 22nd over: England 79-1 (Burns 38, Root 25) Vish stops play! Rory Burns was facing up to start the new over from Siddle but pulled out because Vish Ehantharajah, formerly of this parish (and the OBO family), didn\u2019t get back to his seat in time and was moving behind the arm. It\u2019s happened to all of us in the press box (myself included, to the annoyance of Nathan Lyon); very much an occupational hazard. Better still, Vish is good mates with Burns - that will make for some fun Whatsapps later. Right, back on, the left-hander clips Siddle to fine leg to begin, Root then adding a leg bye from another misdirected ball. He just can\u2019t find his line today. Burns keeps the pressure on, two more to cover before leaving the rest alone. 21st over: England 75-1 (Burns 35, Root 25) DROPPED CATCH! Siddle is having one of those mornings, putting Root down at fine leg. \u201cWhat a let off!\u201d says Atherton on TV and indeed it is. Cummins won the top edge from a hooked bumper, the straightforward chance sailing straight to Siddle. But he snatched at it with his hands pointed to the ground and it didn\u2019t stick. Just when Root has been looking the part, to make matters so much worse. He knows it too. Burns finishes the over with a nicely-clipped three past square leg. 20th over: England 71-1 (Burns 32, Root 24) Siddle gets enough chance and is closer to where he needs to be, beating Root on the inside edge then winning a false stroke from Burns. He beats the left-hander with his last ball, missing a full-blooded cover drive. 19th over: England 68-1 (Burns 30, Root 24) Oooh, Cummins is through Root, cutting him in half with a ball that just clears the middle stump. Fine bowling. To reinforce how talented he is, he backs it up with the outswinger, perfectly positioned and beating the outside of the bat. Fair play to Root, he is on the front foot by the end of the over, stroking through along the carpet - again to point. Burns has one ball to see off and parries a couple behind square. Needless to say, Australian Cricket Twitter is collectively very cross at Tim Paine for bowling first here. Then again, Lord\u2019s started like this too. Want your fill from the shires? Tanya Aldred has your back. 18th over: England 63-1 (Burns 28, Root 21) Siddle won\u2019t be feeling the pinch quite yet - he has been around long enough to know that one bad session does not have to define a Test - but he\u2019s not at his best. He gets past Root\u2019s inside edge to begin but overcorrects well outside off, the captain helping himself to three out past point without much risk at all. Burns is untroubled in defence thereafter. \u201cTim Paine would never have been forgiven if Bradman\u2019s 1930 total had been overtaken,\u201d theorises Tom Carver. \u201cHe had no choice but to field first.\u201d A bit like Tubby Taylor declaring on 334? Let\u2019s hope not. 17th over: England 60-1 (Burns 28, Root 18) It\u2019s Cummins on for Hazlewood; his second spell today from the pavilion end. He has 25 wickets in this series, adding one to that so far this morning, Broad next on that list with 19. But Root is a different proposition when set at the crease than he was last Saturday night, pushing nicely off the back foot early in the over to get off strike. Cummins is into the short stuff at Burns, who wants nothing to do with it and rightly so. \u201cLooking forward to Joe Root scoring a century here to be closely followed by the inevitable emails declaring he can only do it when it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d writes Damian Ainsworth. Nothing more certain. 16th over: England 59-1 (Burns 28, Root 17) Shot. For the second time this morning, Burns is able to learn onto the front foot and on-drive for four. A most attractive stroke. There was a school of thought when Burns reached three figures at Edgbaston that he would never do so again; that it was the luckiest Test innings ever played and he would be dumped very soon. Five weeks on, he\u2019s the man most likely - apart from the leadership duo - to be there this winter. \u201cHas anyone asked the ECB why county championship games in September start at 10:30 but tests start at 11:00?\u201d emails Chris Parker. I am fairly sure it has to do with the host broadcaster. As it is often observed, Tests in 2005 started at 10:30am as it meant the then-TV hosts were able to get to The Simpsons at 6pm. Related: this is the latest in the year a Test has started in England. 15th over: England 53-1 (Burns 23, Root 16) Hazlewood\u2019s sixth over of the morning, again trying to get Root playing throughout from the line of the stumps. It\u2019s a good contest, the No3 collecting two to square leg when there\u2019s enough room for him to do so. Perhaps Siddle to follow from that end? They need to manage Hazlewood. Here is the TMS overseas link. For those who are struggling to find it day to day, it is on the same page from when they go on air - here. 14th over: England 51-1 (Burns 23, Root 14) Mitch Marsh, always a popular inclusion, replaces Siddle after the drinks break. He bowled nicely here four years ago. If I recall correctly, I think he picked up Root both times? Anyway, he\u2019s in the team, for the most part, to help out Cummins and Hazlewood with some usefully timed spells - much like this one. Of course, it is heresy to say any positive about Mitch\u2019s prospects, so that\u2019s where I\u2019ll leave it. He\u2019s in at Burns\u2019 stumps to begin, the opener turning a single to square leg - England\u2019s 50th run of the morning. Not a bad start. Root pushes one to point straight away - good, positive batting. He\u2019s in good shape here. On Smith\u2019s catch, a note from an emailer by the name of Yum. Just Yum. \u201cYou could see right after he took the catch by the expression on his face, that in his mind\u2019s eye he was reliving the horror of dropping it as if that is what really happened. That\u2019s why he keeps getting better.\u201d For me, the main disappointment about Australia putting England in is that the chances of Smith having enough time in the Test to make 304 runs - and overtake Bradman in 1930 - are diminished quite a bit. 13th over: England 49-1 (Burns 22, Root 13) Hazlewood with the final over of the first hour and it is a good one to Root, forced to use his bat throughout. The big quick nearly gets through that defence with the final delivery, offering a few words as they break for drinks. I enjoyed the bit before between Nasser and Ponting when he put to him whether batting first might have been a better idea this morning. \u201cWe both have history with this.\u201d #Ashes #Bantz \u201cEngland\u2019s longest tail?\u201d writes Matthew Doherty. \u201cHow about Tuffnell, Mullally and Malcolm?\u201d Good point. And Ian Truman, also on the England changes. \u201cI agree with you on Curran. Whilst its far from England\u2019s greatest selection crime this series, I can\u2019t fathom what allowed Overton to leapfrog Curran in the pecking order last test. Overton \u201clooks\u201d more a test bowler, but all evidence (test wickets) suggests the opposite. The kid can play Test cricket, something I\u2019d say a lot of others have yet to prove.\u201d 12th over: England 49-1 (Burns 22, Root 13) Siddle isn\u2019t going well here but he isn\u2019t helped by Marcus Harris, who lets a ball through his legs at gully to concede a boundary to finish from a lovely delivery in the channel that finds the edge. Earlier in the over, Root had enough time to again get on the balls of his feet to punch square of the wicket - his most productive shot when on song. Siddle also beat him, when the England skipper had a dash one he should have left. This reminds me of how Siddle went in his first spell at Lord\u2019s. Of course, be bounced back brilliantly later that day. We\u2019ll see. 11th over: England 42-1 (Burns 18, Root 10) Hazlewood is swung around to have a dart from Cummins\u2019 pavilion end. Burns is looking pretty well set though, leaving nicely until he gets a ball on his pads, which is tucks around for three. Root grabs one behind square to finish, keeping the strike for Siddle\u2019s next over. 10th over: England 38-1 (Burns 15, Root 9) Siddle to Root, who watches a couple before having a pop at a ball outside the off-stump, crashing it away to the point rope in front of the Peter May Stand. Too short. \u201cPositive intent,\u201d says Nasser. Siddle bounces back with his best ball so far, beating the England skipper with one that skips nicely off the seam and past the outside edge. Root goes again to finish, this time a fraction behind point, for four more. That is the shot he played so well a few years back when he was right alongside Smith, Kohli and Williamson as the best Test batsman in the world. Back to the pre-game discussion, here is John Starbuck. \u201cKim Thonger\u2019s information takes me back to the 90s, when I was very much involved with helping to fix the Millennium Bug. Thanks to clear planning, hard work and judicious advertising we got it done, only for people to protest there was never anything wrong in the first place and the bonus I got was a cheat. Such an attitude also reflects selectors\u2019 behaviour, wanting the problem to go away without having to engage properly. You can never win in those situations.\u201d We have only TWO international players left who were bashing around for their before the Millenium Bug (from memory): Chris Gayle and Shoaib Malik. Assuming the latter is still playing T20Is. 9th over: England 30-1 (Burns 15, Root 1) Root is off the mark second ball, tucking Cummins to midwicket. Burns then pushes a couple to mid-off to end the successful over. A lot of work ahead for these two. Cummins gets the breakthrough, juggled by Smith at second slip at the second attempt. A tad fuller, Denly can\u2019t help himself. Poor shot. 8th over: England 27-0 (Burns 13, Denly 14) Siddle into the attack from the Vauxhall End, his fourth Test Match at The Oval. Quite the achievement for an Australian. He has Denly ripping his bottom hand off the bat to begin with a ball that bites but the opener makes the most of a ropey ball to finish, slapping three down the ground. 7th over: England 24-0 (Burns 13, Denly 11) Cummins beats Burns for the fourth time so far, with another he had to play at early in the set. But he sticks to the task, taking a ball of his hip away to the rope behind square. I get the feeling he might be out there for a while. \u201cMorning.\u201d Hi , Jonathan Taylor. \u201cIs this Englands longest ever Tail? While Curran &amp; Woakes are both excellent no. 9 batsmen, at 8 Woakes can only be deemed as alright &amp; coming in at 7 Curran is not exactly inspiring \u2013 even less so below the current top 6, Archer is again 1 place too high at 9. Likewise the out of form Buttler at 6 similarly the double-barrelled Bairstow-Bowled coming in at 5 whose current technique of leaving the gate open seems to have us on an endless loop: pitch it up and through it goes.\u201d Yep, that isn\u2019t ideal but I still can\u2019t work out how it has taken until now to find a way for Sam Curran to get a run in this series. 6th over: England 20-0 (Burns 9, Denly 11) That\u2019ll do, shot of the morning so far from Burns, driving Hazlewood down the ground for four. Sure enough, the big quick is straight back on it finding his inside edge - top bowling. Denly\u2019s turn, edging through the cordon for four more. That\u2019s not far away at all from the four catchers. \u201cIs it possible the captaincy affected Steve Smith\u2019s batting, but because the numbers were so good, nobody noticed?\u201d poses Nick Donovan. \u201cI expect his average to be North of 70 - a conservative prediction - by the time the Ashes in 2021 roll around.\u201d Well, Smith averages 75 since his breakthrough ton here in 2013, which is 99 innings ago. If he does go at 75 through to 2021 - 60-odd hits? - that should have him comfortably into the 70s. Extraordinary. 5th over: England 11-0 (Burns 4, Denly 7) Another big lbw shout, this time Cummins v Denly. It\u2019s turned down by Umpire Dharmasena. It looks like an inside edge, so they don\u2019t review. The bowler remains right on top, winning a bottom edge that runs away for four - his first boundary. Ooh, then he nearly loses his wicket from a ball that beats him on the inside of the bat but somehow doesn\u2019t clip the off-stump on the way through. Classy bowling but he survives. \u201cI see that Marsh has a \u2018Mitchell\u2019 printed on the back of his shirt along with his surname,\u201d notes Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cFirst time an individual\u2019s full name has been printed on a Test jersey?\u201d Yep, a nice obscure one to get us going. I used to get a real kick out of the small \u2018Mark\u2019 and \u2018Steve\u2019 on the Waugh brothers\u2019 ODI kits as a kid. 4th over: England 7-0 (Burns 4, Denly 3) Watching the replay back a few times, I can see why Erasmus gave it out, hitting on the back leg deep in the crease, albeit with the thigh pad. Burns keeps his cool after the close call, leaving the last couple. What an nice story he is this week, by the way. The Surrey captain has played all over the world since making his debut the Test after this one in 2019 and now, at last, he gets to turn out on his home ground. One of the few batsmen with their reputation enhanced through this series. NOT OUT! Pitching and hitting in line too but going over the top of the off-stump. Excellent bowling from Hazlewood but not to be. IS BURNS OUT LBW TO HAZLEWOOD? He\u2019s given but going straight upstairs. Stand by. 3rd over: England 7-0 (Burns 4, Denly 3) The sun is bright now; those thick clouds won\u2019t be around for long. That is, assuming clouds do get burned through by the sun? We always say it, but surely that\u2019s not a real thing - or is it? Denly has his first look at Cummins and does it well, playing with soft hands behind point for a couple. 2nd over: England 5-0 (Burns 4, Denly 1) Denly pushes his first ball to square leg and tries to leave the second but it bounces a fraction more, deflecting off his blade. Hazlewood then aims for his hip but the Kent veteran is up to the task, pushing the first run of the match behind square. I\u2019m Team Joe Denly, by the way. I should declare that before we go much further. Burns\u2019 turn against the Bendemeer Bullet, copping a whack on the thigh pad but responding with a lovely square drive, racing away across the practice pitches for four to the Harleyford Road side of the ground. That\u2019ll feel good. Cue every commentator discussing the value you get square of the wicket here at The Oval - wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Droll, Vish. 1st over: England 0-0 (Burns 0, Denly 0) Burns is beaten to begin, Cummins angling nicely away from the home ground boy. Ohh, he does it again with his third offering, an absolute gem that swings in before jagging away. Nobody is hitting that. There is that scrambled seam we keep hearing so much about. Burns gets bat on ball to midwicket then leaves to finish. An excellent maiden to kick us off. Thank you, JP. We\u2019ve had the toss and Jerusalem, now it is time for the teams. Here they are, running down the stairs of the Bedser Stand. The cloud is thick, the grass is visible. This should be fun. Burns is taking the first ball, Denly up the other end. Cummins is bowling the first over, running in from the pavilion end. PLAY! Thank you all, as ever, for your contributions. The OBO is a pleasure on mornings like this - which have been common during this series. Now it\u2019s time for me to hand the keyboard to Adam Collins who is primed and ready to go at the Oval. Send your tweets to @collinsadam and emails to adam.collins.casual@theguardian.com I\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. See you then. Andy Burridge hits the nail on the head. \u201cSome talk over the past few days of people, including Graeme Swann, suggesting Root give up the captaincy to focus on his batting. I just wondered if not him, then who? Jos is surely far too out of form and Broad is probably the next senior player but seems a bit too reckless for the role. I\u2019d rather we make a call now to give the person time to settle into the role before the next series but we seem very light on candidates?\u201d I haven\u2019t seen or heard anyone suggesting anybody other than Broad as a realistic alternative, but then at his stage of his career, he\u2019s hardly a guarantee to front up to every series is he? \u201cI am wondering why Joe Root is allowed, by the England cricket management, to play in every cricket match/format?\u201d asks Arthur Graves. \u201cIf they really are management then isn\u2019t their job to manage? Which includes protecting players from themselves.\u201d David Horn has sent in an excellent email. \u201cI\u2019m always surprised by how openly the captain who loses the toss tells the world what s/he would have done had they won. It seems that there is no advantage to letting it be known one way or another, and something to be lost in saying so. It can reveal a defensive / attacking mindset approaching a game, or give food for thought over whether the captain backs his bowlers over his batters in different conditions (and vice versa). Surely saying \u2018it doesn\u2019t matter what we\u2019d have done\u2019 is perfectly adequate and gives nothing away. I tell you, when I\u2019m England captain, this will all change.\u201d \u201cPersonally I\u2019d have thought it more accurate to say England had an outside chance of winning one rain affected match, and were fortunate to win the other solely because the officiating umpire was blind to perhaps the most obviously plumb LBW of the series,\u201d emails John Phaceas, in response to Simon Yates. \u201cTruth be told, the scoreline should be 3-0 heading into today\u2019s match.\u201d Phil Hall is straight in with the upside of Tim Paine\u2019s call at the toss. \u201cThe good news is that England won\u2019t be following on.\u201d Dylan Pugh with a neat stat. \u201cIf Cummins keeps up his six wickets a match average from the series, without taking a five-fer, it\u2019ll be a record for the most wickets in a series without having taken a Michelle. Shane Warne currently has the record with 29, in the \u201893 Ashes. Cummins on 24.\u201d Simon Yates has set you all off hasn\u2019t he? Steve Smith\u2019s excellence this series is being compared to: Wayne Gretzky (nominated by Jonathan Oliver), Jonah Lomu (thanks Simon Platt), and, magnificently, Ian Bell. \u201cIn the 2013 Ashes, definitely Maradona-esque in his influence on that series and I don\u2019t understand why Theresa did not give him a knighthood.\u201d Thanks Tom Banks. Jeremy Yapp has made a thoughtful contribution on the Boycott saga. \u201cI am sure you don\u2019t want an inbox full of Boycott emails, but I can report that something good came out of the knighthood announcement. It prompted a terrific breakfast table conversation between me and my two young sons (nine and ten), first some stuff about domestic violence that they knew already (phew!) but then about South Africa, racism and the effect the Rebel tours had on the black and anti-Apartheid campaigners, especially how those tours set back the struggle for equal rights in South Africa. We finished the discussion by agreeing that, also, if most of your conversation consists of anecdotes about yourself then it\u2019s good to have a few self-deprecating stories on hand. Otherwise you can come across as a bit of a tosser.\u201d Still surprised at Tim Paine\u2019s decision at the toss. There\u2019s some grass on the pitch and a bit of cloud around, but it\u2019s a very un-Australian call. Perhaps they don\u2019t see the surface deteriorating too much in favour of Nathan Lyon, making the opening couple of sessions bets for bowling? England have made just the two changes despite around half-a-dozen spots being up for grabs at the fag end of a disappointing series. Unsurprisingly, Chris Woakes returns in place of Craig Overton in the attack, while further up the batting order patience with Jason Roy has finally run out. His replacement, however, is not like-for-like with Sam Curran selected, in part to cover the overs lost as a consequence of Ben Stokes\u2019s injured shoulder. The upshot of all that is Joe Denly has another chance to stake his claim as an opener, Ben Stokes will come out at four as a specialist batsman, Jonny Bairstow moves up to five, and Jos Buttler to six, the latter two under considerable scrutiny. England: Burns, Denly, Root \u00a9, Stokes, Bairstow (wk), Buttler, Curran, Woakes, Archer, Leach, Broad Australia have made two changes to their line-up as they look to avoid any complacency and wrap up a series victory. The most interesting switch sees all-rounder Mitchell Marsh come in for his first Test of the series, replacing Travis Head. It\u2019s been a steep decline over the course of the series for Head, beginning the tour a fixture in the middle-order and one of Australia\u2019s vice-captains, and ending it overtaken convincingly by Marnus Labushagne with selectors favouring both Marsh and Matthew Wade in much tighter decisions. Elsewhere, Peter Siddle\u2019s control replaces Mitchell Starc\u2019s aggression in the bowling attack. Australia: Warner, Harris, Labuschagne, Smith, Marsh, Wade, Paine (c) (wk), Cummins, Siddle, Hazlewood, Lyon Ok, so this has thrown me. Tim Paine has won the toss and he\u2019s decided to bowl first. There\u2019s a bit of cloud cover this morning and there\u2019s some grass on the pitch, but I did not see this coming. Andy Bull has contemplated the lot of Joe Root, a victim of his own excellence. You may have missed it in between his being lbw to Josh Hazlewood for 71 and being bowled by Pat Cummins for a duck, but Root actually reached a century at Old Trafford last week. The second day of the fourth Test was the 100th day in the last 365 that Root has spent playing cricket for England, Yorkshire and the Sydney Thunder. Most of the rest were spent on planning meetings, press conferences, gym and net sessions and all that travel, around and across England, Sri Lanka, Australia and the West Indies. Simon Yates would like the record to reflect the gap between these two sides has not been a chasm, but a shape matching the outline of Steve Smith. \u201cThey have had one batsman performing at a truly incredible level, and that\u2019s won them the series (and fair enough). For sure Cummins and Hazlewood have been terrific - but so have Broad and Archer. The Aussie pair\u2019s numbers are a bit better, but of course they are as they haven\u2019t had to bowl at Smith. In truth it\u2019s been two desperately mediocre batting units facing two strong attacks, but with the Aussies having one absolute all time great playing at his very peak to give them the win. We were denied a win by the rain in the match where Smith could only bat once, and won the game when he couldn\u2019t bat at all. But we were heavily beaten in the games where he was fit throughout. It\u2019s all been about Smith. Hard to think of another case in a team sport of one person being so ridiculously, completely ahead of all the others on his own and other teams. Maradona in the 1986 World Cup maybe?\u201d Hard to disagree, and an excellent OBO conversation starter. It would be a fitting end to the series. Operation Yolohammer: Paine win\u2019s the toss, Smith opens, bats for nearly three days, in so doing plunging Australia into a period of mass anxiety at the realisation the conversation over The Don\u2019s untouchable status will finally have to be aired. Kim Thonger has logged on, and he\u2019s taken the opportunity to throw a dead cat on the table to contextualise any England fans mourning the failure to regain the Ashes. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve failed to retain the urn I\u2019ve turned my attention to other worrying matters, and have come across something called the Year 2038 problem, which will mean rather a large proportion of computers and devices cannot encode times after 03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038. I\u2019m actually not making this up, it\u2019s a thing, and I\u2019d just like to give a heads up to scorers and statisticians so they can start planning their response and/or saving for whizzy new devices configured to not go wonky. 64bit architecture is good apparently. It\u2019s only 19 years away after all. Steve Smith will likely still be batting.\u201d We probably have to mention Sir Geoffrey Boycott, don\u2019t we? Marina Hyde has got involved, which is never a bad thing. A recap of the facts: in 1998, Boycott was convicted by a French court of assaulting his then\u2011girlfriend, a verdict off which he continues to smash soundbites with outrageous abandon. Those who regard no morning as complete if they haven\u2019t lost their shit with Radio 4\u2019s Today programme were certainly given what they wanted on Tuesday, as Boycott was interviewed on the news of his knighthood. \u201cI don\u2019t give a toss about her, love,\u201d was his retort to Martha Kearney\u2019s mention that the chief executive of Woman\u2019s Aid had called his knighthood \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d. Matthew Engel shares his many years of experience reporting on the former England opener. He was always a divisive figure. There was his batting, notable for its skill and tenacity but also for its turgidity and self-absorption, tending towards selfishness. The captains have had their say. Joe Root, unsurprisingly, is focussed on the future. Build towards winning in Australia and use the next two years to focus on putting in a winning tour Down Under. That\u2019s a real incentive for everyone: to be part of something special down there. Tim Paine is revelling in the here and now. We\u2019re very hungry. Last week\u2019s result at Old Trafford was brilliant but all the guys know this is bigger, this is our Grand Final. We want this Test just as much as any other in this series. James Robinson is in the live rubber camp. \u201cThe Aussies have been much the better team and deserve to win the series,\u201d he emails, \u201cso to draw it would be particularly beautiful.\u201d Without projecting my views too strongly on others, in a summer that has contained a World Cup victory - and not just any World Cup victory, THAT World Cup victory - snatching a late draw in a home series that doesn\u2019t recapture the Ashes all feels a bit, meh. That notwithstanding, I am still looking forward to the cricket for cricket\u2019s sake. Your reading list for this unit is, as ever, topped by Vic Marks. And he does a finer job than I of making the case for this Test to not be regarded as a dead rubber. The Ashes may be gone but the notion of a dead rubber seldom applies when England meet Australia. A Test match between these two nations has a life of its own. There is now the added incentive of points in the Test Championship (no irony intended here, let\u2019s give it a go) and a drawn series would be a welcome rarity in Ashes cricket. There\u2019s still a good 40 minutes or so before the toss, plenty of time to get in and out of a Spin. If you enjoy this latest episode (featuring David Gower) you should check out the back catalogue, and subscribe for future episodes. The weather: it\u2019s going to be fine and dry and warm all Test long. Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of the opening day of the fifth and final Test of the Ashes from the Oval. This is technically not a dead rubber, but it could be euphemistically described as resting. The destination of the Ashes has already been decided, and Australia celebrated the retention of the urn at Old Trafford like schoolkids on the last day of term, complete with drinking on a playing field and mocking some kid with glasses. Meanwhile England have been putting the right words in the right order to make it appear they are desperate to win at the Oval to draw the series, but there\u2019s been a distinct lack of oomph to the platitudes, like that time Celine Dion covered ACDC. England\u2019s selectors could have done more to heighten anticipation by selecting a couple of greenhorns in advance of overseas tours, but they\u2019ve stuck with the same bunch that have largely failed to capture the imagination, relying on flashes of individual brilliance from a small number of performers to even make a contest out of a series played mostly on Australia\u2019s terms. Nonetheless, the weather is set fair for five days, there\u2019s not a spare seat in the house, and we should all be cherishing the opportunity to witness Steve Smith bat in such groundbreaking form. Now the Ashes have been resolved and the boos silenced, let\u2019s celebrate the greatness in our midst. I\u2019ll be around for the next hour or so before Adam Collins takes you through the morning session of play. If you want to be a part of the action you can drop me a line on Twitter or you can send me an email.",

New figures from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) reveal rape charges, prosecutions and convictions have fallen to their lowest levels in more than a decade, raising serious questions about how the criminal justice system handles rape cases. What do the new CPS figures show? The number of rape cases being dealt with by the CPS has sharply declined in the last year. The service charged, prosecuted and convicted fewer cases despite more alleged rapes being recorded by police in the year to March 2019.

This decline in prosecutions has also taken its toll on the number of convictions. Why are rape cases becoming more complex? The requirement for full disclosure is believed to be more common in rape cases, meaning rape complainants are now reportedly routinely asked to grant full access to their digital devices and personal records or risk having their cases dropped. A phone can hold as many as 35,000 pages of evidence, according to the Big Brother Watch civil liberties group. This volume of evidence, which has to be reviewed by police, means cases take longer. Why has there been a rise in reported rapes? This increase is believed to be a result of more victims coming forward following high-profile coverage of historical abuse cases, such as that involving Jimmy Savile, and those around the #MeToo movement, as well as improvements to police crime recording. Rape is still an under-reported crime. The Crime Survey for England and Wales estimates that only about one in six victims of rape or assault by penetration report the incident to the police.

The Guardian reported last year that prosecutors were instructed to \u201ctake the weak cases out of the system\u201d to make the CPS\u2019s conviction rate look better.

Over several decades, my colleagues, collaborators (including the late Sir Fred Hoyle) and I have published arguments to say that the spread of life (panspermia) from a single cosmic event of origination is the most likely answer. In this case life must surely take root on every habitable planet, and that includes K2-18b, at a distance of 110 light years away.

      "bodyText": "It was the afternoon someone put a rocket-booster up county cricket, six games finishing with a day still to go. At Taunton, Somerset traced the outline of the championship on to their brows after wrapping up a 298-run win against Yorkshire who, set 426 to win, were bowled out for 127. Keshav Maharaj had become Yorkshire\u2019s leading wicket-taker after grabbing five Somerset wickets to make it 10 for the match, but Josh Davey\u2019s career-best five for 21 left Yorkshire scrambling for hope. An unbeaten 123 from Tom Westley steered Essex towards, but not past, the follow-on target at Edgbaston, as they slipped into second place in Division One. Darren Stevens finished off a marvellous match for Kent with five for 53 against Nottinghamshire, who sunk to their sixth defeat in a row and will be relegated if Warwickshire avoid defeat at Edgbaston. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed, everyone\u2019s embarrassed,\u201d the Notts captain, Steven Mullaney, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bit of pride left to play for but that\u2019s pretty much it.\u201d A year and a day after they won the championship, Surrey folded to a 272-run defeat against Hampshire after being bowled out for 151. Felix Organ took a career\u2011best five for 25, while Ollie Pope top-scored with 40. At Old Trafford, Lancashire confirmed their promotion to Division One with victory by an innings. Derbyshire were bowled out for 129, with three wickets each for Matt Parkinson, Glenn Maxwell and Tom Bailey. Durham elbowed Middlesex out of the promotion race by defeating them by 44 runs in a close game at Lord\u2019s. Sam Robson had defied Durham till lunch, when Brydon Carse decided to take the advice of fellow bowler Chris Rushworth. \u201cChris has said all week that the lamb chops are unbelievable at Lord\u2019s, so when they were on the menu for lunch today I dug in.\u201d Middlesex then lost six for 44, Carse finishing with a career best six for 26. Worcestershire collected their third championship win of the season after beating Glamorgan at New Road thanks to a tireless century from Daryl Mitchell before the visitors were bowled out within 39 overs. In Division Two\u2019s unfinished games, Northamptonshire need another 119 to win at Grace Road after equalling the world record with eight lbws against Leicestershire, while Gloucestershire look likely to slip from second place after stumbling against Sussex. Only three county games will require a fourth day ... Division One: Warwickshire 517; Essex 278-6. Essex trail by 239 runs with four wickets remaining (first innings). Division Two: Gloucestershire 200 &amp; 197-6; Sussex 370. Gloucs lead by 27 runs with four wickets remaining (second innings). Division Two: Leicestershire 308 &amp; 189; Northants 357 &amp; 22-0. Northants need 119 runs to win. Results Division One: Hampshire (149 &amp; 436) beat Surrey (162 &amp; 151) by 272 runs. Kent (304 &amp; 259) beat Nottinghamshire (124 &amp; 212) by 227 runs. Somerset (199 &amp; 329) beat Yorkshire (103-9 &amp; 127-9) by 298 runs. Division Two: Middlesex (143 &amp; 151) beat Durham (147 &amp; 191) by 155 runs. Lancashire (418) beat Derbyshire (244 &amp; 129) by an innings and 45 runs. Worcestershire (205 &amp; 299) beat Glamorgan (193 &amp; 156) by 155 runs. Lancashire have wrapped up an innings win over Derbyshire to seal an immediate return to the top tier. Here\u2019s the catch that secured promotion: Surrey 151 all out. Top scorer Ollie Pope with 40. Felix Organ 5-25. That\u2019s four games over and five still going. I\u2019d better write up my round-up - be back later. Live coverage of the Test with our OBO team here - England 226-8. Glamorgan bowled out for 156. Moeen 2-37. And that\u2019s an angry 10-pints and a donner kebab dent in Glamorgan\u2019s promotion chances - 11 points behind third placed Durham. Bravo Felix Organ! His first five-wicket haul in the Championship - 5-25. Surrey 151-9 and hurriedly folding away their whites. I\u2019m still puzzled how Surrey have gone from a runaway first to sixth - even accounting for injuries, Test calls etc, I just assumed their academy production line never stopped. In fact looking at that Division One table again - Yorkshire are the odd ones out. Four of the top five counties are Not Test match counties. The bottom three are all Test match counties. So Essex have a second batting point, and look, a century for Tom Westley, hooray!, but it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019ll take much more from this game with only a day to go. Which gives Somerset a huge advantage going into the last two games. A reminder of the run-in:September 16: Hampshire v Somerset (Ageas); Essex v Surrey (Chelmsford); September 23: Somerset v Essex, Taunton. Leicestershire\u2019s resistance crumbling at Grace Road, despite 60 from Colin Ackermann and 42 from Neil Dexter - eight down, just 124 ahead. Ben Sanderson 3-37. You\u2019ll remember how all those wickets fell after lunch at Lord\u2019s? You\u2019ll remember that Brydon Carse finished with a career-best 6-26? It turns out that Chris Rushworth had had a word.... \u201cFunnily enough, Chris has said all week that the lamb chops are unbelievable at Lord\u2019s, so when they were on the menu for lunch today I proper dug in.\u201d Surrey in the soup as Foakes follows Pope back into the pavilion: 121-5, needing an ethereal 303 to win. Jamie Smith still there, 34 not out. This is Hoppsy at his most tart. He mentions Darren Stevens. I think you\u2019ll like it. I think that Somerset coach Jason Kerr may be a below the line lurker: \u201cI am NOT mentioning the title in the dressing room. Of course, we are aware of people outside discussing it because it would be a first for the club and has long been described as the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019. Poor Adam Lyth was sent out for Yorkshire: \u201c It was a very disappointing game for us. We were well and truly outplayed by a good young side and now all we can do is put everything into our last two games and finish as high as possible in the table. \u201cWe were in a good position at the end of day one. When you bowl a side out for 199 you think you are in the game, but to lose all our remaining wickets in 50 minutes at the start of day two was unacceptable. And Finbar please take a look BTL for much, much information about bonus points. Division One Hampshire 149 &amp; 436: Vince 91, Northeast 73, Dawson 88 Surrey 162: Pope 68; Barker 4-38 and 100-4. Kent 304 &amp; 259 Billings 100, Crawley 82; Fletcher 3-40, Ashwin 5-89 Notts 124: Mullaney 22; Stevens 5-39, Podmore 3-27 and 212 Stevens 5-53. Kent win by 227 runs.

Durham win by 44 runs. Worcestershire 205 &amp; 299 v Glamorgan 193 Lloyd 35; Morris 5-73 and 77-5. Glamorgan need 235 to win. We think that Durham last beat Middlesex at Lord\u2019s five years ago to the very day! DARREN STEVENS, in tooth and claw: 10-92 and 88. NOTTINGHAMSHIRE\u2019S RELEGATION will be confirmed if Warwickshire draw, or win, against Essex at Edgbaston. Essex currently 205-3, trailing Essex by 312. Tom Westley 79 not out. Top score in Yorkshire\u2019s second innings - Steven Patterson, 24 not out. Josh Davey 5-45, Jamie Overton 2-21. Yorkshire 127-9. And that, my friends, is a what you call a pasting -Yorkshire\u2019s fifth heaviest first-class defeat in terms of runs. Yorkshire\u2019s tilt at the title is officially OVER. Somerset\u2019s is very much alive - they go the Ageas Bowl for the penultimate match of the year. A question from Finbar Anslow to which I should, but don\u2019t, know the answer. Over to you BTLers: A question for you; my favourite county has a charming habit of scoring more runs in the second innings than the first but are penalised for this due to the bonus points system, do you know of any particular reason why points are only given for the first innings? And at Trent Bridge Ravi Ashwin goes too - not even he can save the good ship Notts, though he went down with style with 55, 36 of them in boundaries. 183-8 and the sharks are circling. Two England batsmen out after lunch and Surrey post this -hee, hee, hee. I\u2019m back! But the stands are empty, a man is mowing the outfield and the digger, for once, is silent. The sky is brightest blue, just right for batti-n-g....oh dear. Alas Middlesex, it turned out Sam Robson was the only door between hope and despair. They lost 6-44 after lunch as Brydon Carse finished with a career-best 6-26. Durham skip off to Northampton with promotion fantasises. Middlesex have nothing left to fight for other than the fact that never in their history have they finished bottom of the Championship.... Yorkshire three down, Leicester four down, Middlesex five down, Notts six down, Worcester seven down.... please excuse me briefly for half an hour - I\u2019ll update the numbers then. Hampshire all out - Surrey have to chase 424. You\u2019d give Surrey circa 2018 a fighting chance. In fact, it was a year ago tomorrow when an all-conquering Surrey clinched the title at lovely New Road. I assumed they\u2019d dominate for the next four or five years. I was wrong! Perhaps they are more suited to a heatwave summer - Morkel is better suited to it. Memories, of a year past. Give Rushworth a Lord\u2019s lunch? He\u2019ll storm in and grab you a wicket with his fourth ball. And it is the big one - Robson for 65. Middx 107-5. Well played! Division One Hampshire 149 &amp; 427-8: Vince 91, Northeast 73, Dawson 88 Surrey 162: Pope 68; Barker 4-38 Kent 304 &amp; 259 Billings 100, Crawley 82; Fletcher 3-40, Ashwin 5-89 Notts 124: Mullaney 22; Stevens 5-39, Podmore 3-27 and 91-5 Stevens 3-22 Somerset 199 &amp;329: Abell 62, Hildreth 58 Yorkshire 103: Ballance 35; Van der Merwe 3-14 and 47-2 Warwickshire 517: Lamb 173, Hain 82, Patel 51*, Sibley 51; Harmer 6-143 Essex 131-2: Warwickshire 517 (Lamb 173) v Essex 127-2 Division Two Gloucestershire 200 and 24-0: Sussex 370 Derbyshire 244 all out (Godleman 111; Gleeson 5-64) v Lancashire 365-6: Bohannon 174*, Livingstone 71*, Vilas 51 Leicestershire 308: Azad 86, Cosgrove 65, Rhodes 61; Procter 3-54, Hutton 3-62 and 36-2 Northamptonshire 357: Keogh 132 Durham 147: Finn 4-41, Murtagh 3-32, Harris 2-33 &amp; 191: A Robson 64; Harris 3-43 Finn 3-49Middlesex 143: Raine 5-26, Rushworth 3-46 &amp; 106-5: S Robson 65 not out Worcestershire 205 &amp; 272-6 Glamorgan 193 Lloyd 35; Morris 5-73 Lunch at Lord\u2019s where things are too close to call. At 106-4, Middlesex need 90 to win. All depends on Sam Robson (65 not out). Lunch scores to follow. This will gladden many hearts, though not those of the white rose, to whom apologies. Yorkshire 30/1, chasing the sun, the moon, the stars. Ballance is your man. And a wicket falls ten minutes before lunch at Lord\u2019s as the diggers clatter about, shovelling the remains of the bottom tier of the Edrich stand into huge skips. Holden gone after a painfully cautious nine in a stand of 54 with Sam Robson (60 classy not out runs.) Middx 100-4 need another 95 to win. So I glanced at the score from Trent Bridge, and it wasn\u2019t good. Arise Sir Darren Stevens - 3-22 to go with 5-39 and 88 (and a duck) : gallant and bold indeed. Where will he go? Who will have him? Sides lacking the experience of a seasoned pro who has seen it all before... Worcestershire? Middlesex? Have Kent lost their mind? Josh Bohannon out for a cracker of a maiden century - I think 174 is a daddy in anyone\u2019s book. My son told me he and his friends had gone down to Old Trafford yesterday after school and that it had been \u201cbrilliant.\u201d Lancashire 328-5 and recovering from a mid-morning ravaging by Rampaul: two in two balls - Livingstone for 71 and Maxwell for nought. Maharaj finishes the summer with 5-122, and 38 for the season, leaving Yorkshire just the 426 to win. At the Test Joe Denly has gone leaving this remarkable stat, care of Alan Gardner: the highest opening partnership of the English summer remains Will Porterfield and James McCollum for Ireland at Lord\u2019s (32). A sensational email has arrived in the inbox of the Middlesex media manager from Urban paws - offering highly trained fluffy models and actors for their next campaign including Fraser, the terrifying cat. I just thought I\u2019d post this of a Notts batsman playing well. Elsewhere, wickets have been tumbling at Taunton where Maharaj has taken a quick three - but the Somerset lead over Yorkshire is 416. Northants are all out with a lead of 47 against Leicestershire. The World Cup\u2019s forgotten man Liam Dawson has reached 50 for Hampshire (318-6) and nightwatchman Sam Cook is second man out as Essex battle on at Edgbaston - 72-2. Muchos despair in the box. Malan lbw by an exultant Raine for just 3. Middx 45 for 3. Stephen Eskinazi plays an immaculate defensive shot, unfortunately it is as he trudges walks back to the pavilion, lbw to Rushworth for not a bean. Middlesex 41 for 2. And at The Oval, Australia have won the toss for the fourth time in the series, and are having a bowl. Marsh replaces Head, Siddle replaces Starc. Follow it all over by over with our kick-ass Guardian team. Eeek! Gubbins nicks Carse to slip in the third over of the day. Middlesex 31 for 1. Division One Hampshire 149 &amp; 296-6: Vince 91, Northeast 73Surrey 162: Pope 68; Barker 4-38 Kent 304 &amp; 236-8:Billings 100, Crawley 82; Fletcher 3-40, Ashwin 3-71Notts 124: Mullaney 22; Stevens 5-39, Podmore 3-27 Somerset 199 &amp; 269-5: Abell 62, Hildreth 58Yorkshire 103: Ballance 35; Van der Merwe 3-14 Warwickshire 517: Lamb 173, Hain 82, Patel 51*, Sibley 51; Harmer 6-143Essex 31-1: Browne 16*, A Cook 7; Patel 1-1Warwickshire 468-7 (Lamb 173*, Hain 82, Sibley 51) v Essex Division Two Gloucestershire 200: Bracey 61; Jordan 3-49Sussex 313-7: Salt 64; Payne 3-58 Derbyshire 244 all out (Godleman 111; Gleeson 5-64) v Lancashire 269-2: Bohannon 150*, Livingstone 70*, Jennings 38 Leicestershire 308: Azad 86, Cosgrove 65, Rhodes 61; Procter 3-54, Hutton 3-62Northamptonshire 325-7: Keogh 132, Rossington 63; Evans 3-65 Durham 147: Finn 4-41, Murtagh 3-32, Harris 2-33 &amp; 191: A Robson 64; Harris 3-43 Finn 3-49Middlesex 143: Raine 5-26, Rushworth 3-46 &amp; 21-0: S Robson 9* Worcestershire 205 &amp; 153-2 Mitchell 52*, Rutherford 52 Glamorgan 193 Lloyd 35; Morris 5-73 Good morning from Lord\u2019s where a glorious September morning has been smothered by cloud. The Middlesex and Durham press are having a gloom-off about their sides chances, and the prize of keeping the season alive, but expect resolution sometime after lunch. Round the grounds the weather is set fair, except at Bristol where the covers are on. And a little snippet for you to read with your elevenses below.",

      "body": "<p>If popular music is often driven by advances in technology, Daniel Johnston\u2019s work was proof that sincerity, simplicity and primitive recording equipment can deliver enduring results. Johnston, who has died of a suspected heart attack aged 58, became renowned for the haunting honesty and directness of his music. Its lo-fi quality emphasised the raw appeal of his voice, which was sometimes likened to the vintage recordings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/20/hank-williams-country-music-radio\" title=\"\">Hank Williams</a> or the bluesman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/08/robert-johnson-honeyboy-edwards-blues\" title=\"\">Robert Johnson</a>. Johnston himself cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles\" title=\"\">the Beatles</a> as his biggest influence.</p> <p>He accumulated a committed following on the alternative and underground rock circuit, and among his admirers and supporters were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kurt-cobain\" title=\"\">Kurt Cobain</a> of Nirvana (a particular fan of Johnston\u2019s 1983 album Yip/Jump Music), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/18/spiritualizeds-jason-pierce-we-want-to-induce-strong-reactions\" title=\"\">Jason Pierce</a> of Spiritualized, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/30/wilco-jeff-tweedy-addiction-obsession-politics\" title=\"\">Jeff Tweedy</a> of Wilco, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beck\" title=\"\">Beck</a>, members of the Butthole Surfers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sonic-youth\" title=\"\">Sonic Youth</a>. Yet during the early years of his career, in the 1980s, Johnston\u2019s work appeared only on a string of crude homemade audio cassettes released on his own Stress Records label, which he used to give away.</p> <p>After he moved to Austin, Texas, in the early 80s, his tapes helped make him a local celebrity, though this did not bring any big-money record deals. He gained a significant profile-boost in 1985 when he was filmed for a slot on the MTV show The Cutting Edge, which was focusing on Austin\u2019s \u201cnew sincerity\u201d music movement. This brought rapid national acclaim, and, as his tapes made their way from coast to coast, Johnston became an eminently droppable name on the underground circuit.</p> <p>The Dead Milkmen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTx1GpiL76E\" title=\"\">recorded</a> his song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfEa5PwbqNE\" title=\"\">Rocket Ship</a>, and Yo La Tengo and the Pastels were among several artists who recorded his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXnT1pHKojg\" title=\"\">Speeding Motorcycle</a>. In the late 80s the Homestead label reissued some of Johnston\u2019s early recordings on vinyl, and his album It\u2019s Spooky (1989) was a collaboration with Jad Fair of the band Half Japanese.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d5d03832e117543504112d5376ec42d8df6144d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d5d03832e117543504112d5376ec42d8df6144d/0_0_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Johnston performing at the All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties festival in Minehead, Somerset, 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Johnston performing at the All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties festival in Minehead, Somerset, 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Wolstenholme/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Daniel was born in Sacramento, California, the youngest of five children of Bill Johnston, a former second world war fighter pilot, and his wife, Mabel. Daniel described it as a Christian fundamentalist household. The family later moved to New Cumberland, West Virginia, where Daniel graduated from Oak Glen high school. After a brief, abortive stint at Abilene Christian University in Texas, he studied art at a branch of Kent State University near his family\u2019s home. During this period he began creating his homemade tapes in the family basement.</p> <p>In 1983 he went to stay with his brother, Dick, in Houston. It was there that he recorded Yip/Jump Music and Hi, How Are You? on a $59 Sanyo mono tape machine. He moved to San Marcos, Texas, and then, after spending five months working as a corndog seller with a travelling carnival, he settled in Austin. Of the carnival he commented: \u201cEverybody around me was a great story that never stopped, and for the first time I realised how much freedom you have to do what you want.\u201d</p> <p>In 1988 Johnston went to New York to record his album 1990 with the producer Mark Kramer. It was the first time he had been in a professional studio environment. However, this coincided with a sudden worsening in Johnston\u2019s mental health. He suffered from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and it was surely no coincidence that his first album, from 1981, was called Songs of Pain.</p> <p>In 1990 he was almost killed when he suffered a manic episode while flying in a light aircraft piloted by his father. Johnston became convinced he was Casper the Friendly Ghost \u2013 a cartoon character who appeared in Johnston\u2019s songs and drawings \u2013 and threw the aircraft\u2019s ignition key out of the window, forcing his father to crash-land. They suffered only minor injuries, but Johnston was committed to a psychiatric hospital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51aa3e78df0ac265d839889e6813f11bc5cf3de3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51aa3e78df0ac265d839889e6813f11bc5cf3de3/0_250_3607_2165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from the 2005 documentary The Devil and Daniel Johnston.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the 2005 documentary The Devil and Daniel Johnston.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J McConnico/Sony Classic/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was at this point that Johnston was signed to Atlantic Records, though the sole album to result from this contract was Fun (1994). It was not a success, and he was dropped from the label.</p> <p>In 2004 he released the two-disc set The Late Great Daniel Johnston: Discovered Covered. Disc one comprised cover versions of Johnston\u2019s songs by such artists as Tom Waits, Beck, Eels, Mercury Rev, and the Flaming Lips, while disc two contained Johnston\u2019s original versions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/may/05/4\" title=\"\">The Devil and Daniel Johnston</a> (2005), a documentary portrait by Jeff Feuerzeig, won the directing award at the 2005 Sundance festival.</p> <p>Aside from his music, Johnston was highly regarded for his cartoons and artwork. Some of his pieces were included in the <a href=\"https://whitney.org/exhibitions/2006-biennial#exhibition-artists\" title=\"\">2006 Whitney Biennial</a> exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. In 2012 he released the comic book Space Ducks: An Infinite Comic Book of Musical Greatness. Jung Kim\u2019s photo book Daniel Johnston: Here (2013) was assembled from pictures taken over a five-year period, and a matching travelling exhibition visited Austin, London and New York. In autumn 2017 Johnston played a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/09/daniel-johnston-review-town-hall-new-york-lo-fi-hero\" title=\"\">five-date tour</a> that he said marked his retirement from live performance.</p> <p>He is survived by Dick, who was also his manager, and by his sisters, Margy, Sally and Cindy.</p> <p>\u2022 Daniel Dale Johnston, singer, songwriter and artist, born 22 January 1961; died 10 September 2019</p>",

      "bodyText": "If popular music is often driven by advances in technology, Daniel Johnston\u2019s work was proof that sincerity, simplicity and primitive recording equipment can deliver enduring results. Johnston, who has died of a suspected heart attack aged 58, became renowned for the haunting honesty and directness of his music. Its lo-fi quality emphasised the raw appeal of his voice, which was sometimes likened to the vintage recordings of Hank Williams or the bluesman Robert Johnson. Johnston himself cited the Beatles as his biggest influence. He accumulated a committed following on the alternative and underground rock circuit, and among his admirers and supporters were Kurt Cobain of Nirvana (a particular fan of Johnston\u2019s 1983 album Yip/Jump Music), Jason Pierce of Spiritualized, Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, Beck, members of the Butthole Surfers and Sonic Youth. Yet during the early years of his career, in the 1980s, Johnston\u2019s work appeared only on a string of crude homemade audio cassettes released on his own Stress Records label, which he used to give away. After he moved to Austin, Texas, in the early 80s, his tapes helped make him a local celebrity, though this did not bring any big-money record deals. He gained a significant profile-boost in 1985 when he was filmed for a slot on the MTV show The Cutting Edge, which was focusing on Austin\u2019s \u201cnew sincerity\u201d music movement. This brought rapid national acclaim, and, as his tapes made their way from coast to coast, Johnston became an eminently droppable name on the underground circuit. The Dead Milkmen recorded his song Rocket Ship, and Yo La Tengo and the Pastels were among several artists who recorded his Speeding Motorcycle. In the late 80s the Homestead label reissued some of Johnston\u2019s early recordings on vinyl, and his album It\u2019s Spooky (1989) was a collaboration with Jad Fair of the band Half Japanese. Daniel was born in Sacramento, California, the youngest of five children of Bill Johnston, a former second world war fighter pilot, and his wife, Mabel. Daniel described it as a Christian fundamentalist household. The family later moved to New Cumberland, West Virginia, where Daniel graduated from Oak Glen high school. After a brief, abortive stint at Abilene Christian University in Texas, he studied art at a branch of Kent State University near his family\u2019s home. During this period he began creating his homemade tapes in the family basement. In 1983 he went to stay with his brother, Dick, in Houston. It was there that he recorded Yip/Jump Music and Hi, How Are You? on a $59 Sanyo mono tape machine. He moved to San Marcos, Texas, and then, after spending five months working as a corndog seller with a travelling carnival, he settled in Austin. Of the carnival he commented: \u201cEverybody around me was a great story that never stopped, and for the first time I realised how much freedom you have to do what you want.\u201d In 1988 Johnston went to New York to record his album 1990 with the producer Mark Kramer. It was the first time he had been in a professional studio environment. However, this coincided with a sudden worsening in Johnston\u2019s mental health. He suffered from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and it was surely no coincidence that his first album, from 1981, was called Songs of Pain. In 1990 he was almost killed when he suffered a manic episode while flying in a light aircraft piloted by his father. Johnston became convinced he was Casper the Friendly Ghost \u2013 a cartoon character who appeared in Johnston\u2019s songs and drawings \u2013 and threw the aircraft\u2019s ignition key out of the window, forcing his father to crash-land. They suffered only minor injuries, but Johnston was committed to a psychiatric hospital. It was at this point that Johnston was signed to Atlantic Records, though the sole album to result from this contract was Fun (1994). It was not a success, and he was dropped from the label. In 2004 he released the two-disc set The Late Great Daniel Johnston: Discovered Covered. Disc one comprised cover versions of Johnston\u2019s songs by such artists as Tom Waits, Beck, Eels, Mercury Rev, and the Flaming Lips, while disc two contained Johnston\u2019s original versions. The Devil and Daniel Johnston (2005), a documentary portrait by Jeff Feuerzeig, won the directing award at the 2005 Sundance festival. Aside from his music, Johnston was highly regarded for his cartoons and artwork. Some of his pieces were included in the 2006 Whitney Biennial exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. In 2012 he released the comic book Space Ducks: An Infinite Comic Book of Musical Greatness. Jung Kim\u2019s photo book Daniel Johnston: Here (2013) was assembled from pictures taken over a five-year period, and a matching travelling exhibition visited Austin, London and New York. In autumn 2017 Johnston played a five-date tour that he said marked his retirement from live performance. He is survived by Dick, who was also his manager, and by his sisters, Margy, Sally and Cindy. \u2022 Daniel Dale Johnston, singer, songwriter and artist, born 22 January 1961; died 10 September 2019",

People do get hit and concussions do occur. Obviously the referee and trainers are there to look after the boxers to the best of their ability, and I can understand Robert\u2019s comments completely. He is very experienced. I have no issues with Robert at all. He is very qualified. He is one of the best in the world.\u201d Smith also rejected claims by Headway that McCracken had failed in his duty of care and could have seriously damaged Joshua\u2019s health by allowing him to carry on. \u201cI trust Robert impeccably,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any of his boxers were in that serious trouble he would have pulled them out, I am sure.\u201d When asked what advice he would give to a trainer who felt his fighter had a concussion, Smith replied: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to see what you have got when a fighter sits down. Concussion in a boxing contest must occur on a regular basis \u2013 you are getting punched so there will be concussions \u2013 and people do recover. Joshua got knocked down by Wladimir Klitschko and recovered to win. People condemn us, but we take the safety of our boxers very seriously. Our medicals are very stringent. And we have a lot of things in place as regard to any boxer for any issue. Our job is to make it as safe as we possibly can but we can\u2019t be 100% safe.\u201dSmith also defended boxing from criticism that it lacked the formal concussion protocols that are now commonplace in other collision sports. \u201cIn this country, if a doctor has any concerns as regards to the physical condition of a boxer he has the right to go up to the ring and tell the referee stop the fight,\u201d he said.",

Peter Herbert, the chair of the Society of Black Lawyers who sits as a crown court recorder and an immigration judge, is suing the Ministry of Justice for race discrimination after he was disciplined for a speech he gave in 2015. He told a tribunal hearing in Leeds on Thursday that racism in the legal profession was \u201cwell documented and systematic\u201d and that it was \u201cprevalent\u201d in the judiciary. \u201cWhat I assert is that this is a matter of race discrimination and victimisation and that it is of fundamental importance to the administration of justice in England and Wales,\u201d he told the employment judge Sarah-Jane Davies. Herbert, who has been awarded an OBE, is believed to be the first judge to sue the MoJ for race discrimination and victimisation. Two other judges are also preparing to sue the MoJ on the same grounds. This legal action stems from a speech Herbert made at a rally in Stepney, east London, in April 2015. In the speech, he had criticised the Electoral Commission\u2019s decision to bar the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, from holding public office for five years and added that racism was present in parts of the judiciary. \u201cRacism is alive and well and living in Tower Hamlets, in Westminster and, yes, sometimes in the judiciary,\u201d he had said. A complaint was later made about his remarks to the Judicial Conduct Investigation Office (JCIO). Lord Justice Underhill was nominated to look into the matter and to consider whether Herbert\u2019s remarks had breached guidelines. Underhill found Herbert should be issued with a written warning because he was straying into politics and implying that the Rahman judgment was tainted by racism. The attempt to prevent him from sitting as a judge was abandoned after written representations were made and Herbert agreed not to make any more controversial comments. Herbert later received a letter of apology from the JCIO, which stated his remarks were not serious enough to justify requesting a senior judge to ask him to stop sitting as a judge. Herbert, who represented himself at the preliminary hearing, said race discrimination was \u201ca significant problem\u201d in the judiciary and that there was a huge disparity in appointing non-white judges. \u201cThis is an extremely important case, as you know. These are very personal but also deeply distressing issues,\u201d he told Davies. The issue of whether Herbert was racially discriminated against will be decided at a later tribunal if Davies agrees that one should go ahead. In a written argument submitted to the court, Herbert said: \u201cRacism both direct and indirect is still prevalent, especially amongst the senior judiciary as they come largely from a social strata of society where they have littleor no contact with ethnic minorities save as defendants, clients or witnesses given the under representation of BAME judges in the higher and first instance courts.\u201d Black or minority ethnic judges make up fewer than 5% of high court judges and only 7% of all court judges in England and Wales, according to official statistics published in July, compared to the 14% BME proportion of the wider UK population. Herbert told the tribunal in his skeleton argument: \u201cCovert race discrimination and sexism as well as sexual harassment has never disappeared from the bar. The relevance of this is that over 80% of judges, both part and full time, continue to be drawn from the bar. \u201cThe culture of discriminatory behaviour does not disappear when one achieves judicial office and therefore the context of this case is highly relevant to the respondent\u2019s submission that none of these claims has a \u2018reasonable prospect of success\u2019.\u201d The preliminary hearing centred on the issue of whether Herbert can properly sue the MoJ or whether he must sue individually each of the six senior judges who handled his disciplinary case. Ben Cooper QC, for the government, told the hearing that the MoJ was not the proper legal entity and should not be named in the lawsuit. However, Herbert argued that the MoJ had been named as a respondent in numerous legal actions and was \u201cvicariously liable\u201d for judges, whose salaries and pensions it paid and whose training it funded. Herbert said he did not \u201cseek to have a fight\u201d with every high court judge that considered his case. The six senior judges named in the hearing as potential respondents include the high court judges Sir Jeremy Stuart-Smith and Dame Elisabeth Laing, the appeal court judge Peter Gross, and the now-retired lady justice of appeal, Dame Elizabeth Gloster. Herbert described the MoJ\u2019s application to have itself removed from proceedings as \u201cfrivolous and vexatious\u201d and designed to make proceedings \u201ccumbersome and expensive\u201d.",

The issue is almost certain to rise up the legal food chain once again until it returns to the supreme court for a full hearing that would settle the question once and for all. But until the law is settled, the rule change will effectively put on ice decades of procedure whereby America prided itself as a safe haven for those who had fled persecution. Refugees have been able to turn up at the US border and make a \u201ccredible fear\u201d claim that they faced danger back at home. Now, under the new rule families, including children, who have passed through Mexico can be deported immediately back to their native countries without any thought being paid to the risks they might face on their return. The news provoked an outpouring of criticism, even from within the supreme court itself. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in which the justice said the rule upended \u201clongstanding practices regarding refugees who seek shelter from persecution\u201d. Sotomayor added: \u201cThe rule the government promulgated topples decades of settled asylum practices and affects some of the most vulnerable people in the western hemisphere.\u201d Jess Morales Rocketto, chair of a coalition of groups opposing the immigration crackdown, said: \u201cThe Trump administration has put babies in cages, ripped thousands of children away from their parents, banned Muslims from this country because of their religion, started concentration camps, and now they are closing the doors of America to Central American refugees. All parents want freedom and opportunity for their children. But when it comes to the American dream, Trump and his Republican allies are saying: \u2018Latinos need not apply.\u2019\u201d Trump continues to make his hardline approach to immigration a central facet of his presidency, and he is likely to make the subject a mainstay of his bid for re-election next year. This month he snatched $3.6bn from the Pentagon\u2019s budget to fund his controversial border wall. Recently the Trump administration also ran roughshod over a court agreement that had spared migrant families, including children, from being detained for more than 20 days. The change is facing several legal challenges, but unless it is overturned it is likely to see a dramatic increase in families being held indefinitely in secure facilities that have been likened to prisons.",

      "bodyText": "Her return from maternity leave coincides with the beginning of London fashion week, but after the furore that surrounded her trip on Elton John\u2019s private jet, the Duchess of Sussex was not about to make the mistake of facing photographers from the glitz of a catwalk front row. Instead, she entered John Lewis on Oxford Street in London via the back door, smart but low-key in a \u00a3120 pair of black trousers and an \u00a385 white shirt with rolled-up sleeves, to launch the Smart Set, a collection of interview-appropriate clothing for unemployed women trying to enter the workplace. The duchess is a patron of Smart Works, a charity that provides interview coaching and appropriate outfits for women in need. The Smart Set collection, comprising a trouser suit, white shirt, dress and a leather bag, goes beyond awareness raising with an ambitious plan to improve the quantity and quality of clothing stock at the charity. For each piece sold on the shop floor one will be donated to Smart Works. The launch was also something of a celebration of Meghan\u2019s image as the modern \u201crelatable\u201d face of the royal family.

Probably not. The impact of further easing on business and household spending is likely to be very small. In a situation that is almost akin to a liquidity trap, ever more negative rates comes close to pushing on a string. Nonetheless, further easing can still help to contain the downside risks. First, the ECB can prevent market turbulence which could potentially exacerbate the drag on the real economy from the challenging environment of trade wars, Brexit and the Chinese slowdown. Second, by lowering funding costs further, it can make it easier for governments to finance a modest fiscal expansion and nudge countries with some extra fiscal space to actually use it \u2013 think Germany. </p> <p>Relative to previous net asset purchases of \u20ac60bn or even \u20ac80bn per month, the ECB\u2019s new open-ended purchase programme looks modest. On their own, purchases of \u20ac240bn in one year will raise the balance sheet of the Eurosystem by c2ppt of GDP in a year from its current level of close to 40%.</p> <p>Although Draghi is not leaving before November, today\u2019s meeting will be remembered as his major final act. Given the bigger-than-usual divisions within the Governing Council, Draghi probably had to go all in to sway (most of) his colleagues to play largely the melody he had set out at the ECB\u2019s annual gathering in Sintra in early June.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7a6cd68f082514879f2f8b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T16:08:03.714Z\">5.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">BBG: Several ECB policymakers opposed more QE</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Newsflash: Bloomberg is reporting that several members of the ECB governing council opposed parts of today\u2019s stimulus programme.</strong></p> <p>That includes some of Europe\u2019s largest economies - Germany, France and the Netherlands, along with Estonia and Austria.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/sep/12/trump-delays-tariffs-markets-ecb-stimulus-package-qe-mario-draghi-business-live?page=with:block-5d7a3f038f082514879f2c92#block-5d7a3f038f082514879f2c92\">I mentioned earlier</a> that Draghi seemed reluctant to reveal the mood at today\u2019s meeting, joking that the committee were unanimous in believing fiscal policy has a bigger role to play.</p> <p>Clearly they were <strong>not</strong> unanimous about cranking up the money-printing machine again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/VonnieQuinn/status/1172176850434560000\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Draghi said there was no need for a vote.

It is worth keeping in mind that the Eurozone is not only dealing with developments at home, but risks in the form of Brexit and Trump imposing tariffs on European goods. With the ECB cutting its growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020, there is potential for further easing down the line should global and domestic economic conditions deteriorate further.</p> <p>The Euro collapsed like a house of cards following the rate decision with prices crashing towards $1.0930 against the Dollar before later recovering over $1.1000.

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap: Europe\u2019s top central banker has swapped barbs with the President of the United States after announcing a new stimulus package designed to prevent the eurozone sliding into recession. At one of his last meetings as ECB president, Mario Draghi unveiled a package of measures to ease monetary policy in the euro area. The Bank: Cut one of its key interest rates, the one charged on bank deposits at the ECB, to -0.5% to encourage lending Left its headline borrowing rate at zero, but pledged to leave them alone indefinitely, until inflation has robustly risen Agreed to restart its quantitative easing programme in November, with \u20ac20bn of bond purchases each month Made its offer of cheap loans to banks more profitable The ECB also slashed its growth and inflation forecasts, as it warned that economic conditions have deteriorated. Draghi claimed there was broad support for his plan -- however, there are reports tonight that several members of the governing council opposed restarting QE. The ECB president also warned that the risks of a eurozone recession has risen, with many economists believe Germany\u2019s economy is already shrinking. The move met an almost immediate response from the White House, where Donald Trump has been lobbying America\u2019s central bank to cut interest rates. Controversially, Trump claimed the ECB was deliberately weakening the euro to help companies sell goods overseas: This prompted a swift rebuttal from Draghi, who insisted that he was simply following his mandate. We have a mandate. We pursue price stability and we don\u2019t target exchange rates. Period. He also warned America that G20 countries have a commitment not to indulge in currency depreciations. Draghi spent much of his press conference dropping non-too-subtle hints that European governments should rip up their deficit targets and borrow more, to encourage growth. At one point he seemed to hint that monetary policy has gone lost as far as it can: Almost all the things that you see in Europe, the creation of more than 11 million jobs in a short period of time, the recovery, the sustained growth for several quarters, were by and large produced by our monetary policy. There was very little else\u2026 Now it\u2019s high time for the fiscal policy to take charge.\u201d Economists broadly welcomed the package, while warning that it has its limits. As Florian Hense of Berenberg Bank put it: Will the ECB package make a major difference? Probably not. The impact of further easing on business and household spending is likely to be very small. In a situation that is almost akin to a liquidity trap, ever more negative rates comes close to pushing on a string. Nonetheless, further easing can still help to contain the downside risks. First, the ECB can prevent market turbulence which could potentially exacerbate the drag on the real economy from the challenging environment of trade wars, Brexit and the Chinese slowdown. Second, by lowering funding costs further, it can make it easier for governments to finance a modest fiscal expansion and nudge countries with some extra fiscal space to actually use it \u2013 think Germany. Relative to previous net asset purchases of \u20ac60bn or even \u20ac80bn per month, the ECB\u2019s new open-ended purchase programme looks modest. On their own, purchases of \u20ac240bn in one year will raise the balance sheet of the Eurosystem by c2ppt of GDP in a year from its current level of close to 40%. Although Draghi is not leaving before November, today\u2019s meeting will be remembered as his major final act. Given the bigger-than-usual divisions within the Governing Council, Draghi probably had to go all in to sway (most of) his colleagues to play largely the melody he had set out at the ECB\u2019s annual gathering in Sintra in early June. Newsflash: Bloomberg is reporting that several members of the ECB governing council opposed parts of today\u2019s stimulus programme. That includes some of Europe\u2019s largest economies - Germany, France and the Netherlands, along with Estonia and Austria. I mentioned earlier that Draghi seemed reluctant to reveal the mood at today\u2019s meeting, joking that the committee were unanimous in believing fiscal policy has a bigger role to play. Clearly they were not unanimous about cranking up the money-printing machine again. After fluctuating through the afternoon, European stock markets have closed at their highest levels in six weeks. Investors are welcoming the ECB\u2019s new stimulus package, while also aware that monetary policy alone won\u2019t save the world economy (which is why Draghi is pushing for government\u2019s to step up). Christopher Smart, Chief Global Strategist &amp; Head of the Barings Investment Institute, says: \u201cMarkets are cornering central banks into this new round of cuts. The ECB really had very little choice today and the Fed\u2019s next cuts are more or less pre-determined, too. \u201cDoes it help? Of course, it helps. Is it enough? Almost certainly not. The real drag on economic growth comes from a natural slowing at this stage in the cycle and uncertainty over trade. \u201cThe cycle could easily be extended with a meaningful fiscal response. Germany and South Korea have leeway to spend more, and at current low interest rates even the United States could borrow and invest more. \u201cAs for trade, tariff risks mean that companies don\u2019t know where they should build their next plants or how to organize their supply chains. A narrower deal like the one Beijing seems to be talking about today may help avoid the next round of tariff hikes, but it won\u2019t address the fundamental uncertainty that delays capital spending.\u201d One of the most complicated parts of the ECB\u2019s stimulus is the changes to its TLTRO programme -- cheap long-term loans for commercial banks. Fortunately Tom Kinmonth, fixed income strategist at ABN Amro, has analysed the changes, and concluded that they are rather more attractive for commercial banks. He told clients (in a note online here): Banks can now borrow at a far better rate from the ECB TLTRO conditions greatly improved, allowing all eurozone banks to benefit The new tiering system offers \u20ac2bn of savings for eurozone banks\u2026 \u2026and some periphery banks will receive 0% on all their deposits Kinmonth explains: Under TLTRO III, banks can soon take loans from the ECB for three years at a rate as low of -0.5%, if they meet specific loan lending criteria. The ECB will pay banks to take money. The new modalities are considerably better than the originally planned conditions which were 2 years at +0.1%... That means banks are getting some protection, to make up for the pain of negative rates for leaving cash at the ECB: Under the original rules of the TLTRO III programme hardly banks would have stood to significantly benefit when considering the current market conditions. Whereas, under the new programme\u2019s conditions every bank in Europe stands to benefit in regard to funding costs. As such, the change today in the modalities of thus ECB programme is a credit positive for the European banking sector. Banks will breathe a sigh of relief on this matter. The ECB has now uploaded Mario Draghi\u2019s statement, online here. It explains the decision to relaunch its QE programme, hit banks with more negative deposit rates for leaving cash at the ECB, and make a more dovish commitment to leave borrowing costs low. It includes with Draghi\u2019s usual demand for structural reforms, and increased higher government spending where possible: In view of the weakening economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risks, governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timely manner. Melanie Baker, senior economist at Royal London Asset Management, believes the ECB\u2019s package (a rate cut, more QE and sweetened loans for banks) will boost Europe\u2019s economy. She writes: \u201cThe easing measures from the ECB today were welcome news for global growth prospects. By going for a package, rather than piecemeal measures, and a more open-ended form of QE, there is a better chance that there will ultimately be a visible positive impact on the euro area economy, both in terms of growth and inflation outcomes. But, policymakers such as Mario Draghi are fighting the damage caused by Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars: In general, we still see the global outlook as something of a tug-of-war between stimulus and trade tensions. More fiscal stimulus would help, as will a likely Fed rate cut next week. But higher tariffs, persistent trade tensions and high levels of trade-related uncertainty for businesses remain key concerns.\u201d The decision to restart the ECB\u2019s stimulus programme shows Europe\u2019s economy is deteriorating, says Ediz Fahri, senior economist at data firm Dun &amp; Bradstreet. The ECB has just announced its decision to restart its asset purchase programme (APP) this November, in which \u20ac20bn of bonds are set to be purchased each month. Meanwhile, Mario Draghi\u2019s decision to lower the deposit rate for the first time since March 2016, signals towards the ECB\u2019s efforts to kickstart the euro area\u2019s growth engine and bring inflation back closer to the 2.0% target. The euro zone\u2019s latest monetary decisions highlights the rising macroeconomic and political risks across the region and affirms our most recent global economic outlook trend downgrade, shifting from \u2018stable\u2019 to \u2018deteriorating\u2019 in September. Mario Draghi was correct to call for more eurozone government spending, argues Ken Wattret, chief European economist at IHS Markit. But the call may not be needed until Europe\u2019s economy is in real trouble, he fears.... The need for fiscal policy to complement monetary policy accommodation again featured more prominently [at today\u2019s ECB press conference]. Draghi called for \u201ceffective, timely\u201d action from member states which have fiscal space. Christine Lagarde is on the same page clearly. The likelihood of fiscal stimulus is clearly increasing, including from Germany, which is already in recession (bar the confirmation from Q3 GDP). But in time honoured fashion, the government in Germany is going to wait until the situation has deteriorated even further before taking action and even then, the timeline is likely to be elongated. My colleague Richard Partington has filed a news story, explaining what the ECB has done today, and why: The European Central Bank has announced a fresh stimulus package in an attempt to prevent the fragile eurozone economy from grinding to a halt, with an interest rate cut and plans to pump \u20ac20bn (\u00a319bn) a month into the financial markets. In one of the final acts of Mario Draghi\u2019s presidency before Christine Lagardetakes charge of the ECB in November, the central bank said it would reboot its quantitative easing (QE) programme of bond-buying programme in that same month. The ECB will also cut its deposit rate \u2013 the interest paid to commercial banks when they place funds with the central bank \u2013 by 0.1 percentage points to a new all-time low of -0.5%, meaning banks incur charges on any balances they keep there. Negative interest rates are meant to encourage banks to lend to consumers and businesses, rather than park their money with the ECB. The stimulus package comes as the eurozone economy falters alongside a broader global economic slowdown that has been triggered by rising trade protectionism and the US-China trade war. More here: ING\u2019s chief economist, Carsten Brzeski, reckons the European Central Bank is getting worried: As expected, the ECB has become more alarmed about the outlook for the economy and inflation. As Draghi said during the press conference, the base case scenario was still a benign scenario as it didn\u2019t include the risk of a no-deal Brexit and trade wars. Nevertheless, the ECB staff projections presented downward revisions to both growth and inflation (as covered here).\u201d Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, believes European leaders should heed Draghi\u2019s advice. He also thinks the ECB is trying to keep the euro weak - exactly what president Trump is so cross about. Bell says: \u201cThe ECB have played their hand and Draghi has gone out with a bang. The ball now rests firmly in the court of those European governments with the fiscal capacity to join in the easing game. The ECB have certainly got ahead of the pack in an ambitious effort to keep the currency low in the face of potential further stimulus from foreign central banks. Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM, says Mario Draghi has made one last push to stimulate the eurozone - before he leaves the European Central Bank next month. But, he also believes more measure may be required, given the weakness of Europe\u2019s economy. Although Draghi has done \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d before he hands the mantle over to Christine Lagarde, it seems markets are disappointed with the ECB\u2019s actions. Given the concerns revolving around the health of the Eurozone economy, most were expecting Draghi to launch a monetary policy bazooka before his departure. However, the argument for the ECB saving some ammunition in the monetary policy toolbox could be for when economic conditions worsen. It is worth keeping in mind that the Eurozone is not only dealing with developments at home, but risks in the form of Brexit and Trump imposing tariffs on European goods. With the ECB cutting its growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020, there is potential for further easing down the line should global and domestic economic conditions deteriorate further. The Euro collapsed like a house of cards following the rate decision with prices crashing towards $1.0930 against the Dollar before later recovering over $1.1000. Further weakness may be on the cards in the near term as investors digest the ECB\u2019s action and prospects of further easing in the future. Analyst Arne Petimezas of AFS Group is disappointed that the ECB hasn\u2019t announced a larger package today. Ronald Temple, co-head of multi asset at Lazard Asset Management, says Mario Draghi is quite right to call for higher government spending: \u201cToday the ECB used more of its dwindling ammunition to try to stimulate growth. Draghi rightly emphasized the imperative of fiscal stimulus and structural reforms. Unfortunately, Eurozone governments have failed to deliver on this count for a decade now, in spite of ever lower financing costs. The ECB has done its job; now it\u2019s time for the governments to step up.\u201d Never play the Forex, folks. After plunging earlier, the euro has now bounced back and is up around 0.15% against the US dollar today. Economists are chewing through the technical details of the ECB\u2019s stimulus programme now. Fred Ducrozet of Pictet Bank reckons some parts are actually \u2018less generous\u2019 than first thought, such as the \u2018tiering system\u2019 that will protect euro banks from more punishing negative rates. Q: If governments don\u2019t heed your advice to boost spending, will the ECB be forced to resort to helicopter money? Mario Draghi says the governing council hasn\u2019t discussed helicopter money [literally giving cash away to citizens]. It could be part of our strategic review in future, he adds (that will be conducted by his successor, Christine Lagarde). And Draghi wraps up with another nudge to European politicians, saying: Giving money to people is a fiscal policy task, not a monetary policy task. That\u2019s the end of the press conference -- I\u201dll post a summary and reaction now. Q: What about criticism from politicians and bankers about negative interest rates? Negative interest rates are a necessity to help us meet our mandate, Mario Draghi replies firmly. He adds that 11 million jobs created in recent years, and insists that German citizens have benefitted from the ECB\u2019s stimulus measures [even though savers have been hit with lower interest rates]. Banks don\u2019t like negative rates, but they won\u2019t cause the collapse of the financial system, the president adds (well that\u2019s a relief!). Banks should focus on improving their own costs, he adds. Eurozone bonds prices are surging, as investors react to the ECB\u2019s pledge to buy \u20ac20bn of new debt each month. This has driven yields (or interest rate on the bonds) down. Germany\u2019s 30-year bond is now trading at a negative yield again - meaning Berlin can effectively borrow for free! That sounds like the perfect time to boost government spending, despite the German government\u2019s reluctance to run a deficit. Q: Are you worried that Germany is in recession? A eurozone-wide recession is a \u201csmall probability\u201d, Mario Draghi replies, but this probability has risen recently. And on Germany, he points out that several institutes have warned that Europe\u2019s largest economy is already in recession [such as IFO this morning] or going into recession. This is a case for \u201ctimely and effective action\u201d on the fiscal side, Draghi replies. That\u2019s a very significant move -- an unelected central banker is basically telling Angela Merkel to raise government spending. He adds that central bankers need to be very humble when giving such advice! Q: Are people right to be concerned about the negative side effects of QE and record low interest rates? Draghi replies that the ECB is aware of the side effects of our monetary policy and we are closely monitoring all these effects. Q: What would the ECB do if America deliberately weakened the dollar? Draghi says that all G20 members are expected to abide by a consensus not to engage in \u201ccompetitive devaluations\u201d (currency wars). Allianz\u2019s chief economist, Mohamed El-Erian, points out that the ECB has certainly weakened the euro - even though Draghi denies it is deliberate. Q: What do you think about Donald Trump\u2019s tweet? ECB president Draghi steps forward and sweeps the president\u2019s attack aside. We have a mandate. We pursue price stability and we don\u2019t target exchange rates. Period. More reaction: Mario Draghi is doubling down on his call for governments to raise their spending. If fiscal policy was more effective then our stimulus policies would work better, with less negative side effects, he says. Onto questions.... Q: What was the mood like at today\u2019s meeting, as several members of the governing council had opposed restarting QE? (including the German and Dutch central bank chiefs). Draghi embarks on a long explanation. He says the eurozone had slowed more than expected since June (when he gave a speech hinting at fresh stimulus). He also points to the lower inflation forecasts. These, and the \u201cpersistence of downside risks\u201d, were factors behind today\u2019s decision, he says. Draghi also points out that the ECB\u2019s base forecasts don\u2019t include a hard Brexit, even though it has become more likely recently, or a deeper trade war. He\u2019s now picking out phrases from the ECB\u2019s statement - including the commitment not to raise interest rates until inflation is \u2018robustly\u2019 back on target. But he can\u2019t put off the answer for ever.... Draghi says: There was unanimity....that fiscal policy should become the main tool (triggering chortles in the press room). That feels significant -- the ECB is saying that politicians can\u2019t rely on central bankers any more. What we want to know, though, is whether the hawkish members of the governing council were unanimously behind Draghi. And on that, the president say: The consensus was so broad that we didn\u2019t take a vote. #hmmm Draghi ends his statement by calling on governments to raise spending, where possible, to give the eurozone a fiscal boost. Shares are rising across Europe, as equities benefit from the ECB\u2019s latest stimulus plans. The French and German markets are both up 0.5%, pushing the EU-wide Stoxx 600 index to its highest level since late July. The euro is continuing to fall as Draghi speaks, which will NOT please president Trump. It\u2019s now lost three-quarters of a cent, dropping to $1.0927. That\u2019s very close to the two-year low hit last week. The ECB has also cut its inflation forecasts. Draghi blames the lower oil price, and \u201cglobal trade issues\u201d [a jibe to Donald Trump?!] The ECB has cut its growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020. It now expects GDP to rise by 1.1% this year, down from 1.2%. In 2020, growth is seen picking up to 1.2%, not the 1.4% previously expected. President Draghi singles out the US-China trade war as a key cause of Europe\u2019s problems. He says that global trade tensions are hurting the eurozone -- particularly its factories (as we saw this morning, when output slumped by 0.4% in July). Draghi confirms that the ECB has cut its deposit rate (for commercial bank deposits) to minus 0.5%, and will keep interest rates at record lows indefinitely, until inflation has robustly picked up. He also outlines the changes to the TLTRO loans programme, to make them more attractive to banks (as summarised here). He then insists that today\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive package of monetary policy decisions\u201d will provide the firepower needed to ensure that financial conditions remain \u201cvery favourable\u201d. He points to the \u201ccontinued shortfall of inflation\u201d, and adds that incoming information suggest the eurozone economy is suffering \u201ca more protracted weakness\u201d than previously thought. ECB president Mario Draghi is about to explain why he and his colleagues have decided to launch a new stimulus programme. You can watch it live here. I\u2019ve embedded it at the top of this blog too (you might need to refresh to see it). Trump\u2019s latest blast comes a day after he accused the US Federal Reserve of being \u201cboneheads\u201d for keeping interest rates too high..... Here\u2019s a handy reminder of the European Central Bank\u2019s new stimulus programme, from ING. Deposit rate cut by 10 basis point to -0.5%. A tiering system will be introduced. Forward guidance on rates is no longer calendar based but open-ended and state-dependent. QE will be restarted with \u20ac20bn per month, starting 1 November. There is no end date added to QE. The TLTROs will be repriced and include an incentive for banks to increase lending. Along the lines of the first two generations of TLTROs, banks which exceed the benchmark ECB loans will be charged at the deposit rate. Newsflash: US president Donald Trump has reacted, accusing the European Central Bank of fighting a currency war. In a sharply worded tweet, Trump says the ECB is is depreciating the euro - at the expense of US exporters. Once again, he\u2019s criticising the US Federal Reserve for not cutting its interest rates [US headline borrowing costs are currently 2.25%, compared to 0% in the eurozone]. Trump is correct on his last point. French and German 10-year bonds are both trading at negative yields, while US Treasury bills trade at around 1.7% per year. But that also reflects the fact America\u2019s economy is growing rather faster than the eurozone. ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski says this is Mario Draghi\u2019s final \u201cWhatever it takes\u201d moment (a tribute to his successful pledge to protect the euro in 2012). He writes: The final showdown has started with a big bang. The ECB just announced a big policy package to revive the Eurozone economy and to bring inflation back to target.... This is Mario Draghi\u2019s final \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d. Depsite all market excitement now, the question remains whether this will be enough to get growth and inflation back on track as the real elephant in the room is fiscal policy. It is clear that without fiscal stimulus, Draghi\u2019s final stunt will not necessarily lead to a happy end. Marchel Alexandrovich, Senior European Economist, Jefferies, says the ECB has unleashed an \u201caggressive package of easing measures\u201d The depo rate [has been] cut by 10bp, forward guidance extended, a new indefinite \u20ac20bn per month programme of QE, improved TLTRO terms and a tiered system for bank deposits. Financial experts are scrambling to react to today\u2019s package of measures from the European Central Bank. Dr Julia Coronado of MacroPolicy Perspectives is impressed that the ECB has torn up its old forward guidance on interest rates. It is now promising to keep borrowing costs at record lows until inflation has converged \u201crobustly\u201d to its target of just below 2%. Previously, it had set a date of \u201cat least the first half of 2020\u201d - but that calendar guidance has been ditched. Mike Larson of Weiss Ratings says the ECB is trying to protect banks from the harm caused by negative interest rates (even as it hits them with even deeper negative rates!) Lena Komileva of G+ Economics says Draghi is ending his eight-year term at the ECB as he began it -- with a major new package of measures. [Draghi steps down on 31 October -- the day before this new QE programme will begin]. Another important move: The ECB is making its TLTRO programme of long-term loans to commercial banks more attractive. Banks whose lending crosses a certain benchmark will receive a more generous interest rate on their loan. Significantly, it could be as low as the ECB\u2019s own deposit rate -- which has just been lowered to -o.5%. The ECB says: For banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a benchmark, the rate applied in TLTRO III operations will be lower, and can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation. The maturity of the operations will be extended from two to three years. That will make the TLTRO programme more attractive -- and compensate the banks for the impact of negative interest rates. TLTRO was originally introduced during the eurozone crisis. It gives commercial banks access to very cheap finance from the ECB, in a bid to push up commercial lending. The euro has fallen to its lowest level in more than a week. It\u2019s down half a cent against the US dollar at $1.0957, as traders react to this new stimulus package. The ECB\u2019s statement is online, here: Monetary policy decisions Financial news service RANsquawk have helpfully highlighted all the changes: Deeper negative interest rates are bad news for Europe\u2019s banks. They mean even bigger losses for leaving bank deposits overnight with the ECB. But the ECB has got some good news for them. It will introduce a new \u201ctwo-tiered\u201d system, under which some banks\u2019 holdings are exempt from the negative deposit facility rate. The ECB\u2019s Governing Council is pledging to keep rolling over its existing quantitative easing programme too -- another attempt to stimulate the eurozone\u2019s sickly economy. It says: Reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP will continue, in full, for an extended period of time past the date when the Governing Council starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. The ECB is also pledging to leave its interest rates at their current record lows, or even lower, until inflation has picked up. It says: The Governing Council now expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. BREAKING: The European Central Bank has announced a new stimulus package, in an attempt to boost growth in the eurozone. It is cutting its deposit rate -- charged on commercial bank deposits at the ECB -- to a new all-time low of minus 0.5%. It was previously -0.4%. That\u2019s meant to encourage banks to lend to consumers and businesses. The ECB\u2019s governing council has also decided to leave its benchmark interest rate at zero percent -- rather than imposing negative rates on savers. The ECB is also restarting its quantitative easing programme, and will start buying \u20ac20bn of bonds each month from the start of November. More to follow! Here\u2019s the latest buzz....with just a few minutes to go. This morning\u2019s weak factory output figures should worry the ECB, says Sven Schulte-Hillen, acquisition and finance partner at Pinsent Masons. But... lowering interest rates and boosting QE may not be enough to help. He says: \u201cThe decline in production clearly demonstrates that the EU is facing downward economic pressure. I\u2019m confident many across Germany will be encouraged by the ECB attempting to tackle this early and halt a recession. However, many will question how effective the ECB means will be. Lowering interest rates will of course increase pressure on the banks to kick-start lending, lower the value of the Euro and give the EU a currency boost. But as Germany grapples with macro-economic and political hurdles, such as a possible no-deal Brexit and Trump\u2019s trade war, interest rates are not the only mechanism that need to be adjusted.\u201d Just 15 minutes to go! So here\u2019s a reminder of what the ECB could announce..... Just in: Turkey\u2019s central bank has slashed interest rates dramatically -- but not by as much as some traders expected. The Central Bank of Turkey has cut its benchmark interest rate from 19.75% to 16.5%, a cut of 325 basis points. This is the second major rate cut from central bank governor Murat Uysal since he took over in July. That will please president Erdo\u011fan, who has long argued that high interest rate create inflation (not a view shared by many conventional economists...). Surprisingly, the Turkish lira is strengthening -- showing that traders had expected an even deeper rate cut. Perhaps significantly, the CBRT has also said that the \u201cinflation outlook continued to improve\u201d. In addition to the stable course of the Turkish lira, improvement in inflation expectations and mild domestic demand conditions supported the disinflation in core indicators. The ECB has made its decision! Members of the governing council have been spotted leaving their headquarters in Frankfurt. That means we\u2019ve not got long to wait...... Critics of the European Central Bank will question whether a new bond-buying programme will really work. The ECB has already swelled its balance sheet by over \u20ac2.6 trillion, as it snapped up huge amounts of eurozone debt with newly created money. At one stage it was buying \u20ac80bn of assets every month. Mario Draghi insists QE made a difference -- arguing that unemployment would have been rather higher otherwise. But while QE has also driven up asset prices, it doesn\u2019t seem to have achieved a key objective - lifting inflation. As these tweets show, inflation expectations are still rather low, which will concern the ECB\u2019s governing council. Excitement is building in the markets as investors anticipate today\u2019s monetary policy decision from the European Central Bank, in under an hour. Some form of stimulus package feels inevitable - unless the ECB wants to crush market expectations and trigger a whopping sell-off. But what form will it take? ABN Amro believes Mario Draghi will get his big bazooka out, and announce a wide-ranging package of measures. They includes Rate cuts. They expect the ECB to cut all its policy rates by 10bp at the September meeting, followed by another 10bp step at the December meeting. Mitigating measures . A new tiered deposit rate system would protect banks from some of the negative impact of negative interest rates (which crush the profit margin between lending rates and retail deposit rates). The EBC could also make its TLTRO loans programme more profitable for banks. Net asset purchases. ABN AMRO expect the ECB to announce a \u20ac70bn per month QE bond-buying programme running for a year from October 2019 onwards. Other economists expect a rather smaller programme, though. The ECB could also pledge to buy more corporate bonds, and debt issued by European agencies and regional bodies. Forward guidance. The ECB could give a new, more dovish, commitment to keep interest rates at record lows for longer. Nick Kounis, head of financial market research at ABN Amro, says: We expect a package of monetary stimulus from the ECB on Thursday. Given the pullback in ECB stimulus expectations over recent days, we think there is considerable room for a market surprise on the size of net asset purchases, which will push yields lower, curves flatter and sovereign and credit spreads tighter. The disappointing drop in eurozone factory output in July shows that Europe\u2019s economy struggled over the summer. Worryingly, industrial production has been dropping on a year-on-year basis through 2019. As Bloomberg puts it: The euro region\u2019s industrial woes persisted at the start of the third quarter as a German factory slump dragged down output more than economists predicted. Production fell 0.4% in July, deepening a decline from the previous month. The drop was led by Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, which is suffering the most in the region as a global slowdown in trade hurts its exporters. More gloom! Eurozone factory output contracted by 0.4% in July, new figures show. That\u2019s worse than the 0.1% decline expected, and shows that Europe\u2019s manufacturers is still struggling. On an annual basis, eurozone factory output was 2% lower than in July 2018. Eurostat, which compiles the data, says that Estonia, Germany and Romania suffered the biggest declines in factory output -- all down at least 5% year-on-year. It adds that, over the last year: Production of capital goods fell by 3.4%, intermediate goods by 3.0% and energy by 1.4%, while production of non-durable consumer goods rose by 1.5% and durable consumer goods by 1.8% City trading group BP Prime says it\u2019s another recession warning: The German recession would be much more painful if Britain crashed out of the EU without a deal, IFO adds. A deeper US-China trade war would also drive GDP deeper down, it adds: Even if their concrete economic consequences are difficult to calculate - because they lack historical experience - they would certainly deepen and prolong the recessionary tendencies in the German economy. IFO is also worried that German employers are cutting staff -- a classic sign of a recession. Its new economic forecast says: While employment in the manufacturing sector has been falling since the spring, so far the strong growth in private service providers and in the construction industry has come to a standstill in the summer. Unemployment is already rising for the fourth month in a row and the proportion of companies have announced the short-time working, has increased significantly. Ouch! Germany\u2019s economy will fall into recession this quarter, according to new gloomy forecasts from the Munich-based IFO thinktank. IFO has predicted that German GDP will fall by 0.1% in July-September, for the second quarter in a row. That would put Europe\u2019s largest economy into a technical recession. IFO also cut its growth forecast for 2019 to just 0.5%, from a barely-better 0.6%. That should concentrate minds at the ECB, as policymakers debate whether to restart their stimulus programme today. IFO\u2019s Timo Wollmershaeuser fears that the slump in German industry (particularly its car sector) is spreading across the economy, warning that: \u201cThe outlook is weighed down by high uncertainties.\u201d IFO hopes that Germany will return to growth in the fourth quarter of 2019. However, this forecast is based on the UK avoiding a no-deal Brexit, and no further escalation of the US-China trade war. And even then, IFO only expects Germany to grow by 1.2% in 2020, down from 1.7% previously. European stock markets have hit their highest levels in six weeks. Traders are welcoming Donald Trump\u2019s decision to delay China\u2019s tariffs, and also hopeful that the ECB will announce a chunky stimulus package this lunchtime. Update: The Co-op has also revealed that it is stockpiling water and toilet paper ahead of Brexit. Speaking to reporters now, the company also warns there could be some shortages of some fresh food in the event of No-Deal, and that retailers may need to use more air freight services to get fruit and flowers into the UK. Beijing has welcomed Donald Trump\u2019s decision to delay raising tariffs on Chinese imports for a fortnight (see earlier post). The Commerce Ministry says it is a welcome goodwill gesture, and that China hopes that both sides will create \u201cfavourable conditions for talks\u201d. Spokesman Gao Feng added that China will roll out \u201csupportive measures\u201d soon, to mitigate the trade war. The Co-operative Group are also worried about Brexit. It warned this morning that UK farmers could suffer badly if Britain leaves the EU in a disorderly way. In its latest results, the Co-op says: Like all big businesses, we\u2019ve continued with our Brexit planning since the end of March and we know we need to be ready for all eventualities. If a negotiated withdrawal from the EU doesn\u2019t take place at the end of October, we expect some disruption to our supply chain, at least in the short term, and we\u2019ll do our best to protect our members from any inconvenience. We\u2019re particularly concerned about what a no-deal Brexit will mean for the British farmers whose produce we\u2019ve championed over the last few years. We\u2019re also mindful of how Brexit has exposed deep divisions within our communities with strong feelings of disempowerment and neglect expressed by many. These are serious matters that an economic resolution to Brexit will only partially address. UK lamb farmers, for example, could suffer badly if new tariffs were imposed on sales to Europe [one report suggests WTO tariffs could raise the price of British sheep meat for EU buyers by between 38% and 91%] The Operation Yellowhammer documents released last night showed that a No-Deal Brexit could cause rising food and fuel prices and disruption at the border. That could hurt Britain\u2019s agriculture industry, if farmers can\u2019t access key raw materials or get their produce abroad. It\u2019s a bleak morning for John Lewis. The high street chain, and bellwether for retail spending, has slumped into its first ever loss for the last six months. It also warned that Brexit uncertainty is hurting its business, and that a No-Deal departure would make things even worse. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: The group, which owns Waitrose as well as the John Lewis department stores, dived \u00a325.9m into the red in the six months to 27 July after making an underlying pretax profit of \u00a30.8m in the same period a year before. Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the staff-owned retailer, said the loss reflected lower sales in some categories, including homewares, cost inflation and IT costs. He said he expected retail conditions to \u201cremain challenging\u201d and warned: \u201cShould the UK leave the EU without a deal, we expect the effect to be significant and it will not be possible to mitigate that impact.\u201d Chris Daly, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Marketing, says John Lewis is still doing better than many rivals, and enjoys \u201cunrivalled customer loyalty.\u201d However.... \u201cDespite its relative strength, John Lewis is not immune to tough retail conditions. It risks heading towards a price cut trap, partly because its \u2018Never Knowingly Undersold\u2019 brand positioning forces it to pursue rivals\u2019 discounts. Add to this customers that are tougher than ever to lure into stores, and today\u2019s results present a stark warning. There\u2019s a risk that the ECB disappoints the markets today. It\u2019s widely assumed that Mario Draghi will announce new stimulus moves, so anything that falls short could trigger a sell-off. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says investors are expecting rate cuts AND more bond buying: In September, cut in the deposit rate by another 10 basis points to minus 0.5 percent AND announcement of asset purchases In October, the start of asset purchase- the quantitative easing In December, cut in the deposit rate by another 10 basis points to minus 0.6 percent He adds: Mario Draghi will try his best to please the market either with his words or with his action. This is going to be a remarkable shift in the ECB\u2019s policy especially, when the bank was so confident only 9 months ago when it said it was done with cutting rates and buying debt. Hopes of a trade war breakthrough are growing after the US surprisingly delayed its latest tariffs on imports from China. Donald Trump announced that plans to hike the tariff on $250bn of Chinese goods, from 25% to 30%, will be delayed for two weeks. In a tweet (what else?) Mr Trump said a 5% increase to duties scheduled for 1 October will be postponed. He said the delay had been requested by China. It will allow Beijing to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong establishing the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949. Earlier this week Beijing also offered an olive branch, by suspending new tariffs on some US imports. The two sides are due to hold fresh talks in Washington next month, so these moves are an encouraging sign. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Will Super Mario save the day again? That\u2019s the question on investors lips today as the European Central Bank holds one of the most eagerly awaited policy meetings in years. The eurozone economy is weak, factory output is falling, and Germany may be entering recession. So, many economists predict the ECB will unleash a new stimulus programme in an attempt to spur growth. That could include hitting banks with deeper negative interest rates, to force them to lend, or even a new QE bond-buying programme. But ECB president Mario Draghi may have a fight on his hands today, at his penultimate governing council meeting before stepping down. Hawkish colleages, including Klaas Knot of the Netherlands and Germany\u2019s Jens Weidmann, have pushed back against launching more QE. However, some sort of stimulus package seems inevitable today -- if only because the markets are convinced it\u2019s going to happen. Back in June, Draghi pledged to launched more stimulus if the economic landscape deteriorated - and thing certainly haven\u2019t improved.... Stewart Robertson, senior economist at Aviva Investors, says there is \u201clittle doubt\u201d that the ECB will provide fresh stimulus today. The only debate is about the form of the easing that will be provided. How swiftly things change: it was all so different 18 months ago. At the start of 2018, everyone was optimistic about the Eurozone\u2019s prospects. After a year of stellar growth (for the Eurozone at least) in 2017, the path seemed clear for the ECB to prepare the ground for lift off. After a decade in the doldrums, the economy was booming and the ECB could taper its asset purchases and start to push policy interest rates up from historic lows. \u201cThe change in stance has been brought about by renewed economic stagnation in key areas, persistently low inflation and downside risks to growth from trade and tariff worries as well as the cyclical downswing within manufacturing and industry. The governing council is meeting this morning. Its announcement comes at 12.45pm UK time, although we may only get the full details at Draghi\u2019s press conference 45 minute later. Also coming up today It\u2019s a busy morning for retail news with John Lewis, Morrisons and Co-operative Group all reporting results. John Lewis has posted a \u00a325m loss, due to ongoing problems at its department stores, while Morrisons has expanded its deal with Amazon (more on this shortly). European stock markets are expected to continue to rally ahead of the ECB meeting. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is expected to gain another 0.5%, to a new five-week high.

For instance, the vice-president, Mike Pence, made headlines last week for staying at the president\u2019s resort in Ireland when his meetings in Dublin were nearly 200 miles away. Pence said the unusual arrangement was due to family ties to the Trump resort town, but his chief of staff, Marc Short, offered a different explanation. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a request, like a command,\u201d Short told reporters of the decision to stay on Trump property. \u201cI think that is was a suggestion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCalm down everyone, it wasn\u2019t a command,\u201d Bee said mockingly. \u201cIt was a suggestion \u2013 you know, like how waking up to a horse\u2019s head in bed is a suggestion that you \u2026 find the rest of the horse, I guess?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xovwe3qHZDg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xovwe3qHZDg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Trump has also said he hopes to host the next G7 summit at his golf resort in Doral, Florida. \u201cYou might think housing seven heads of state and dozens of people on their staff is just a way for Trump to funnel more money into his pelican jowls,\u201d Bee commented, \u201cbut he\u2019s actually got a very reasonable explanation.\u201d The resort is the best option, Trump said, because it\u2019s five minutes from the airport.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/sep/11/stephen-colbert-john-bolton-trump-late-show-recap\">Stephen Colbert on Bolton: 'Another Trumpling bites the dumpling of dirt'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cObviously the president only wants the G7 conference at his golf resort because he knows it\u2019s the best place to hold it,\u201d Bee said sarcastically. \u201cIt definitely has nothing to do with the fact that as of 2017, income from Trump\u2019s Doral resort has dropped 69%.\u201d</p> <p>And finally, Politico reported how a routine air force run between Kuwait and the US made a surprise pit stop in Scotland, where the crew spent the night at the Trump Turnberry resort.

What advice would you give to today\u2019s young composers? I won\u2019t give advice except to say that it\u2019s important to remember your voice and be true to that alone. And, finally, what musical works would you nominate as the best of the 21st century? I have listened to very little new music these last few years; I cannot have too much in my head. But one name I must mention among so many great composers is George Benjamin. His Written on Skin is a masterpiece.",

At that time very little of his music had been heard for almost a decade \u2013 he had suffered a creative block that he\u2019s since described as being \u201cparalysed by the white paper\u201d, and from which he eventually rescued himself by composing a series of arrangements, both of his own earlier scores and of pieces by others, including Bach and Debussy.<br><br>Born in 1952 in Copenhagen, Abrahamsen had begun his career as a member of a group of young Danish composers who reacted against what they saw as the overcomplexity of the European new music they heard and who sought a much simpler style. He explored minimalism and studied for a while with Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti, and soon established himself as one of the younger European composers to watch, his works championed in the 1980s by conductor/composers such as Hans Werner Henze and Oliver Knussen. After early success came a long silence \u2013 he completed just one short piece in eight years, but he did return to composition with the piano concerto that he finished in 2000, in which he started to invent for himself a totally original and utterly personal sound world.<br><br>This list could just as easily be headed by the work that first exploited this newly invented world, Schnee, an extraordinary hour-long ensemble piece from 2008, as by the ravishing orchestral song cycle Let Me Tell You that followed it five years later. The intricate symmetries and microtonally tinged canons of Schnee define the icy, fragile world that Abrahamsen had been mapping out for himself, and which went on to provide the perfect environment for the settings of extracts from <a href=\"https://newyorkarts.net/2010/04/paul-griffiths-novel-let-me-tell-you/\">Paul Griffiths\u2019s novel </a>of the same name that he made for the songs.<br><br>Like Griffiths\u2019s book, Let Me Tell You is a portrait of Ophelia, but one that tells her story from her perspective rather than from the way she is portrayed in Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet. It\u2019s an operatic scene as much as a song cycle, one of soaring lines and shivering pianissimos, and which makes use of the stuttering repetitions, stile concitato, that Monteverdi introduced into opera four centuries ago to signify anger or anxiety. The vocal writing is astonishingly assured. It is hard to believe this was Abrahamsen\u2019s first large scale vocal work, and it seems perfectly tailored to the soprano Barbara Hannigan, for whom it was conceived, and for her precious ability to soar ethereally and effortlessly above the sometimes forbidding, sometimes ravishingly beautiful soundscapes that the orchestra creates beneath her. There is the feeling, Hannigan has said of the cycle: \u201cThe music\u2019s always been there,\u201d and the sense of there being something timeless and utterly inevitable about Let Me Tell You gives it a very special power. <strong>AC</strong> <br><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/18y8OYW6E1XbgvwVk7EaKt?si=qZAtp0ViQ3aNCbDojdzxhA\">Listen to the work</a></p>",

Based on La Vida breve by Jaufre Rudel, with a libretto by French-Lebanese writer Amin Maalouf, the music has medieval and Middle Eastern echoes but shimmers in Saariaho\u2019s own distinctive and mesmerising voice.FM Read our review | Listen on Spotify 5 Thomas Ad\u00e8s The Tempest (2003) It starts with a geometric storm and ends with a consolatory chaconne. Thomas Ad\u00e8s\u2019s The Tempest was the catalyst for his creation of a musical language that is at once richly familiar and beguilingly strange. It was a piece that immediately fulfilled expectations for what Ad\u00e8s would do with the full resources of the Royal Opera House when it premiered in 2004 \u2013 and transcended them. TS Read our review | Listen on Spotify 4 Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g Fin de Partie (2018) Though it often seemed as if Kurt\u00e1g would never complete the opera on Samuel Beckett\u2019s End Game that he had obsessed about for more than half a century, it eventually appeared in the composer\u2019s 93rd year. An austere, utterly faithful rendering of the original, mostly delivered in recitative, and reinforced with typically terse, wiry orchestral writing. It is a distillation of the uncompromisingly direct music that Kurt\u00e1g has composed all through his career. AC Read our review | Watch the production 3 Harrison Birtwistle The Minotaur (2008) After operas about Punch, Orpheus, Gawain and King Kong, the half-man half-bull protagonist of The Minotaur is perhaps the most sympathetic of Birtwistle\u2019s \u201cheroes\u201d. His death scene, created especially for the bass John Tomlinson, is a majestic operatic set piece, the climax of a work in which the eruptions of orchestral violence are offset by music of lyrical beauty and pungent transparency. AC Read our review. 2 George Benjamin Written on Skin (2012) George Benjamin\u2019s first full-scale opera, with words by Martin Crimp, arrived in 2012 seemingly timeless in every way, its ultimately gruesome story told grippingly to a modern audience through Benjamin\u2019s tense, precise and often glowingly beautiful score. Katie Mitchell\u2019s thoughtful staging was only the start: no opera since has had so many different productions in so many theatres. EJ Read our review | Watch a production 1 Hans Abrahamsen Let Me Tell You (2013) When the 21st century began, the idea that Hans Abrahamsen would compose one of the masterpieces of the next 20 years would have seemed extraordinary. At that time very little of his music had been heard for almost a decade \u2013 he had suffered a creative block that he\u2019s since described as being \u201cparalysed by the white paper\u201d, and from which he eventually rescued himself by composing a series of arrangements, both of his own earlier scores and of pieces by others, including Bach and Debussy. Born in 1952 in Copenhagen, Abrahamsen had begun his career as a member of a group of young Danish composers who reacted against what they saw as the overcomplexity of the European new music they heard and who sought a much simpler style. He explored minimalism and studied for a while with Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti, and soon established himself as one of the younger European composers to watch, his works championed in the 1980s by conductor/composers such as Hans Werner Henze and Oliver Knussen. After early success came a long silence \u2013 he completed just one short piece in eight years, but he did return to composition with the piano concerto that he finished in 2000, in which he started to invent for himself a totally original and utterly personal sound world. This list could just as easily be headed by the work that first exploited this newly invented world, Schnee, an extraordinary hour-long ensemble piece from 2008, as by the ravishing orchestral song cycle Let Me Tell You that followed it five years later. The intricate symmetries and microtonally tinged canons of Schnee define the icy, fragile world that Abrahamsen had been mapping out for himself, and which went on to provide the perfect environment for the settings of extracts from Paul Griffiths\u2019s novel of the same name that he made for the songs. Like Griffiths\u2019s book, Let Me Tell You is a portrait of Ophelia, but one that tells her story from her perspective rather than from the way she is portrayed in Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet. It\u2019s an operatic scene as much as a song cycle, one of soaring lines and shivering pianissimos, and which makes use of the stuttering repetitions, stile concitato, that Monteverdi introduced into opera four centuries ago to signify anger or anxiety. The vocal writing is astonishingly assured. It is hard to believe this was Abrahamsen\u2019s first large scale vocal work, and it seems perfectly tailored to the soprano Barbara Hannigan, for whom it was conceived, and for her precious ability to soar ethereally and effortlessly above the sometimes forbidding, sometimes ravishingly beautiful soundscapes that the orchestra creates beneath her. There is the feeling, Hannigan has said of the cycle: \u201cThe music\u2019s always been there,\u201d and the sense of there being something timeless and utterly inevitable about Let Me Tell You gives it a very special power.

      "bodyText": "Anti-Brexit campaigners have filed a legal challenge in the Scottish courts in an effort to compel Boris Johnson to seek an extension to article 50. The litigation was lodged at the court of session in Edinburgh on Thursday afternoon and is being funded by Dale Vince, the millionaire businessman and political donor who founded the renewable electricity company Ecotricity. The campaigners have applied directly to the inner house of the court of session, the court\u2019s senior tier, as it has a power unique amongst British courts to provide a legal remedy if one is not available elsewhere, a power known as nobile officium. The action is being fronted by Jo Maugham QC and Joanna Cherry QC, the Scottish National party MP who led the successful legal challenge where appeal judges in Edinburgh ruled on Wednesday that Johnson had illegally prorogued parliament. They hope the nobile officium power could mean the court will send the article 50 extension letter on Johnson\u2019s behalf, if he refused to do so. That would be a very controversial decision by the court: Tory ministers and a Downing Street source have been accused of saying that Scottish judges are biased after they found against Johnson, and a court intervening in this fashion is likely to cause a furore. Their submission names Johnson in person, and asks the court to force the prime minister to sign the letter seeking an extension to article 50 mandated by the Commons vote on Monday backing an emergency motion tabled by Hilary Benn, the Labour MP. The so-called Benn Act requires Johnson to get MPs to vote for a new Brexit deal or agree to a no-deal exit by 19 October or if he fails to do so, ask the EU for an extension to article 50 until 31 January 2020. Maugham said that if Johnson refuses to seek an extension, as he has repeatedly suggested he will, they would ask the court to making the extension application required by the Benn Act on the prime minister\u2019s behalf. \u201cThe inner house of the court of session has a special and versatile jurisdiction \u2013 its nobile officium \u2013 which it can use to, in effect, per procurationem or \u2018pp\u2019 any letter that the prime minister refuses to send,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rule of law is not a thing to be grifted \u2013 not even by the prime minister.\u201d Vince said on his Facebook page he had funded the action through Maugham\u2019s Good Law Project campaign group. \u201cFor months I\u2019ve watched in horror at what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re on the verge of law and order breaking down in our country.

      "bodyText": "Mario Abdo Ben\u00edtez has announced plans to amend Paraguay\u2019s constitution to allow the military a greater role in the battle against increasingly brazen and powerful Brazilian crime gangs. But Paraguay\u2019s president\u2019s announcement on Thursday prompted concerns for civil liberties in a country which only emerged from military rule in 1989 \u2013 and skepticism that a militarized crackdown could succeed in reining in the violence after similar strategies have failed in other Latin American countries. Ben\u00edtez\u2019s announcement came a day after the dramatic escape from custody of Jorge Samudio, an alleged leader of the notorious Brazilian cartel Comando Vermelho (Red Command). \u201cWe can\u2019t wait any longer\u201d said Abdo Ben\u00edtez, \u201cwe have resources that we aren\u2019t using, and we need to put them to work to strengthen our security policy.\u201d Samudio was being returned to jail in a police-escorted vehicle after a scheduled court hearing in Asunci\u00f3n was cancelled at the last minute. Witnesses reported that approximately eight gunmen disguised as anti-narcotics officers opened fire on the convoy, killing a police officer and injuring two other officials and a bystander, before Samudio and the assailants made their getaway. The Paraguayan National Drugs Secretariat (Senad) claimed that Samudio \u2013 a Paraguayan national \u2013 had been responsible for flying up to $20m of drugs per month into Brazil from Paraguay before his arrest. Government representatives admitted that protocol for transporting high-danger prisoners had not been followed and Abdo Ben\u00edtez later tweeted that he had accepted the resignation of the justice minister and would substitute the national police commander. The escape was the latest incident in a growing wave of violence unleashed by Comando Vermelho and rival Brazilian cartel Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC, First Capital Command) in Paraguay in recent years \u2013 especially within the country\u2019s extremely overcrowded prisons. The scale of the problem was laid bare in November, when a Comando Vermelho boss, killed a young woman who was visiting him in prison in an attempt to avoid extradition to Brazil. In June this year, 10 prisoners were killed in a bloody riot involving PCC members. Just last week, the security chief of a jail in the region of Itap\u00faa was taken captive by PCC prisoners. As they expand their reach across the border, the Brazilian cartels have largely outgunned Paraguayan groups to take control of the country\u2019s booming drug trade, employing aggressive recruitment strategies \u2013 especially within jails \u2013 to rapidly expand membership. Paraguayan authorities have considered a range of responses, including the construction of specialised jails for cartel members. But opposition senator Jorge Querey said Paraguay needed a much more profound reckoning. Since its return to democracy in 1989, Paraguay has not managed to strengthen its public institutions, giving great advantages to criminal groups both outside and inside of prisons, he said. \u201cAt present, we have a ministry of national affairs and a national police force that are highly penetrated by corruption and have even become components of organised crime,\u201d he said. Vidal Acevedo, of the NGO Service for Peace and Justice, said the employment of the armed forces represented a dire threat to citizens\u2019 human rights, pointing to a recent report demonstrated that the deployment of the military against the leftist guerrilla group the Paraguayan People\u2019s Army has already produced widespread human rights violations. Acevedo also said that the militarisation of anti-crime policy in other Latin American countries such as Mexico and Brazil had only led to more violence, and argued that Paraguay should concentrate on reforming and equipping its police forces. Such shortcomings were clearly illustrated on Wednesday: while the gunmen who freed Samudio were equipped with assault rifles and bulletproof vests, police officers had minimal equipment and had not been informed of the danger represented by the Comando Vermelho leader in their midst.",

Owen Carey died after eating a chicken burger that contained buttermilk at the Byron restaurant at the O2 Arena in Greenwich, southeast London, where he was celebrating his birthday with his family. He was allergic to dairy. The 18-year-old began experiencing symptoms after leaving the restaurant on 22 April 2017 but got as far as the London Eye, near Waterloo in central London, before collapsing. He died at nearby St Thomas\u2019s hospital 45 minutes later. Southwark coroners court heard on Thursday that Carey had ordered a skinny grilled chicken burger with no sauce from the O2 Byron branch. The menu did not mention that the chicken was marinated in buttermilk, the court was told. A postmortem showed he had suffered an anaphylactic reaction. Clodagh Bradley QC, representing Carey\u2019s family, from Crowborough, East Sussex, argued the omission could make a customer believe it was a plain chicken breast. Bradley also suggested that allergy information, which at the time was positioned on the back of the menu, was difficult to read, pointing out that it was in black print against a blue background. But Aimee Leitner-Hopps, Byron\u2019s technical manager, who is responsible for ensuring teams are fully trained in food safety, said that allergy information on the menu met industry standards at the time. \u201cIf you have an allergy you should be asking for information and the team would be able to provide that information in the allergy guide,\u201d she said. \u201cI think most businesses were taking the same approach that the customer would inform the restaurant about (their) allergies,\u201d she said, adding the restaurant had been visited by local authority officials many times over the years and had never been told the wording was not clear enough or was too small. Leitner-Hopps said all staff at the time received online allergen training, which required them to tick different sections, along with on-site training. \u201cIt was apparent to me training available to the teams was sufficient,\u201d she said. Nevertheless, since the incident, and following research showing one in 10 people aged 16 to 24 hide their allergies, staff now ask customers directly if they have any allergies or dietary requirements, she said. When customers reveal an allergy, staff press a button that highlights the word \u201callergen\u201d on the order ticket, along with space for more details, the inquest heard. Staff are then expected speak directly with the kitchen team to ensure the allergy information has been received. Coroner Briony Ballard said she would not read out the report of the restaurant\u2019s head chef as the \u201cerror\u201d appeared to lie at the \u201cpoint of ordering and not at the back of the house\u201d.

      "body": "<p>A government minister has been criticised for suggesting \u201cmany people\u201d think judges are biased in relation to Brexit.</p> <p>The business minister Kwasi Kwarteng made the remarks after judges at the court of session in Edinburgh said the suspension of parliament was \u201cunlawful\u201d.</p> <p>When asked about the Scottish court\u2019s judgment, Kwarteng told the BBC: \u201cMany people are saying \u2013 I\u2019m not saying this \u2013 but, many people \u2026 are saying that the judges are biased. The judges are getting involved in politics.</p> <p>\u201cI think that they are impartial, but I\u2019m saying that many people, many leave voters, many people up and down the country, are beginning to question the partiality of the judges.\u201d</p> <p>The Labour MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidlammy\">David Lammy</a> described Kwarteng\u2019s comments as shameful and said the minister had hidden behind \u201cmany leave voters \u2026\u201d to attack the judges. He said: \u201cIt is completely wrong for government ministers to actively promote and encourage the subversion of the rule of law.</p> <p>\u201cPoliticians must respect the impartiality of judges, even if they do not like the result of their judgments. If they do not, our liberal democratic system will fall apart.\u201d</p> <p>Simon Davis, the president of the Law Society of England and Wales, said the role of judges was to interpret the laws that parliament passes. \u201cThey do so impartially, without fear or favour. We should take pride in our system of justice which provides equality before the law.</p> <p>\u201cYou only have to look around the world to see what happens when the rule of law begins to erode.\u201d</p> <p>Davis called on influential voices, in politics and the media, \u201cto avoid intemperate language and resolve to protect and promote the rule of law, supporting our judiciary, independent from interference\u201d.</p> <p>Richard Atkins QC, the chair of the Bar Council, which represents all barristers in England and Wales, said: \u201cThe United Kingdom is a country built on the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary is a fundamental pillar of our democracy.</p> <p>\u201cI strongly urge those in positions of authority not to undermine the courts or judges. Without the legal protections that the courts afford we are all in peril. The Bar Council expects the government to uphold the rule of law in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Dinah Rose QC, a human rights barrister at Blackstone Chambers, criticised Kwarteng\u2019s remarks as \u201cirresponsible and dangerous\u201d. She said: \u201cAlthough he has disavowed any personal belief that the Scottish judges are biased, his claim that \u2018many people\u2019 think that they are not impartial risks planting the seed of that belief, and has the effect, whether intentional or not, of implying that such a belief is reasonable.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cMutual respect between the courts and the government is fundamental to the proper functioning of our democracy.

      "bodyText": "A government minister has been criticised for suggesting \u201cmany people\u201d think judges are biased in relation to Brexit. The business minister Kwasi Kwarteng made the remarks after judges at the court of session in Edinburgh said the suspension of parliament was \u201cunlawful\u201d. When asked about the Scottish court\u2019s judgment, Kwarteng told the BBC: \u201cMany people are saying \u2013 I\u2019m not saying this \u2013 but, many people \u2026 are saying that the judges are biased. The judges are getting involved in politics. \u201cI think that they are impartial, but I\u2019m saying that many people, many leave voters, many people up and down the country, are beginning to question the partiality of the judges.\u201d The Labour MP David Lammy described Kwarteng\u2019s comments as shameful and said the minister had hidden behind \u201cmany leave voters \u2026\u201d to attack the judges. He said: \u201cIt is completely wrong for government ministers to actively promote and encourage the subversion of the rule of law. \u201cPoliticians must respect the impartiality of judges, even if they do not like the result of their judgments. If they do not, our liberal democratic system will fall apart.\u201d Simon Davis, the president of the Law Society of England and Wales, said the role of judges was to interpret the laws that parliament passes. \u201cThey do so impartially, without fear or favour. We should take pride in our system of justice which provides equality before the law. \u201cYou only have to look around the world to see what happens when the rule of law begins to erode.\u201d Davis called on influential voices, in politics and the media, \u201cto avoid intemperate language and resolve to protect and promote the rule of law, supporting our judiciary, independent from interference\u201d. Richard Atkins QC, the chair of the Bar Council, which represents all barristers in England and Wales, said: \u201cThe United Kingdom is a country built on the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary is a fundamental pillar of our democracy. \u201cI strongly urge those in positions of authority not to undermine the courts or judges. Without the legal protections that the courts afford we are all in peril. The Bar Council expects the government to uphold the rule of law in this country.\u201d Dinah Rose QC, a human rights barrister at Blackstone Chambers, criticised Kwarteng\u2019s remarks as \u201cirresponsible and dangerous\u201d. She said: \u201cAlthough he has disavowed any personal belief that the Scottish judges are biased, his claim that \u2018many people\u2019 think that they are not impartial risks planting the seed of that belief, and has the effect, whether intentional or not, of implying that such a belief is reasonable.\u201d She added: \u201cMutual respect between the courts and the government is fundamental to the proper functioning of our democracy. If the government disagrees with the Scottish judgment, it has a right of appeal to the supreme court, which it is currently exercising. If it thinks that the judges were not impartial, it may make that a ground of its appeal. To shy away from such a course, whilst insinuating a lack of impartiality is improper.\u201d Rose called on the lord chancellor, Robert Buckland QC, to make it clear to all members of the government that such behaviour was \u201cinappropriate, and damaging\u201d. The former Liberal Democrat leader Menzies Campbell said the comments were ill-judged. \u201cI would expect a government minister to understand the importance of the independence of the judiciary and not make any comments that might undermine public perceptions.\u201d Susan D Shaw, a managing partner at the Scottish law firm Living Law, said: \u201cThe rule of law is the bedrock of our society and affects every aspect of our daily lives. Legal judgments \u2013 decisions on the law and proven facts \u2013 frequently have profound political ramifications. That does not make them political.

But to me, the final aim of all this should be activists and companies working together to find common ground.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Fresh fruit, vegetables and wine are among the products likely to become scarcer and more expensive after a no-deal Brexit, according to a flurry of warnings issued by retailers and the drinks industry. The department store chain John Lewis and the Co-op supermarket said customers\u2019 weekly shop could be disrupted, amid concerns that retailers will have to fly in supplies if the chaos predicted in leaked government documents becomes a reality. It came as the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) criticised the government for \u201creneging\u201d on plans for a nine-month suspension of paperwork on imports on wine, the UK\u2019s most popular alcoholic drink, if no deal is reached with Brussels. In an open letter to Brexit ministers Michael Gove and Stephen Barclay, the WSTA said the added administrative burden on imports would force up the price of a bottle of wine by 10p, reduce choice, and cost the thriving UK wine industry \u00a370m. Importers who rely on the flow of niche wines from the EU could be devastated, the trade body warned, while the UK could lose its position as the global wine hub \u201covernight\u201d. John Lewis also gave a grim Brexit forecast as it reported its first-ever half-year loss \u2013 of \u00a326m. Its chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, a former government adviser, said the effect of leaving without a deal would be \u201csignificant and it will not be possible to mitigate that impact\u201d. He said Waitrose, part of the John Lewis group, has been stockpiling some products, including wine, olive oil and canned goods, but could not stave off disruption to the import of fresh food across the Channel. Mayfield believes people could be put off buying non-essential items from John Lewis in the run-up to Christmas if consumers anxious about economic turmoil curb their spending. The Co-op chief executive, Steve Murrells, is particularly worried about fruit because he expects prices to increase. Murrells said the convenience chain was attempting to mitigate the potential impact by stockpiling long-life products such as water, toilet paper and canned goods but was struggling to manage logistics for fruit such as blueberries, apples and pears, which are imported during the British winter. \u201cWe think there will be shortages in some fresh food areas,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere that is the case, we would endeavour to bring it in to give our customers a choice.\u201d To avoid empty shelves the Co-op would resort to using air freight to bring in fruit. The retailer sells British meat only, so those supply lines would not be affected. There were \u201cvery early signs\u201d that Britons were stockpiling, Murrells said, predicting hoarding could intensify the closer the country gets to no deal. He said securing a deal was \u201cthe only way to avoid the inevitable impact on our customers\u201d. The chief executive of Morrisons, David Potts, said the supermarket chain\u2019s contingency plans included switching to alternative ferry crossings such as Le Havre to Portsmouth if the Dover-Calais route became gridlocked as well as measured stockpiling in the run-up to the deadline. The retailer has also secured Authorised Economic Operator certification, which Potts likened to \u201cspeedy boarding\u201d as members of the scheme were less likely to be stopped at customs. In an apparent reference to a quote by the boxer Mike Tyson, he said the supermarket chain had plans but that \u201ceveryone has got a plan until you get punched in the face\u201d. Flagging its concerns for wine retailers, the WSTA said its members could end up \u201cdrowning\u201d in red tape, including 600,000 extra customs forms, after it was told by government officials that they will not abide by an earlier promise to waive paperwork on wine imports. The WSTA said this would cost the industry \u00a370m and threaten the UK\u2019s position as the global hub of wine, as well as adding 10p to the price of a bottle, forcing the cost of the prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s favourite Tuscan Tignanello up to \u00a3180.10. \u201cWe can only conclude from this that government doesn\u2019t understand the value of the UK wine industry nor the value of imports in general to the UK economy,\u201d said the WSTA chief executive, Miles Beale. \u201cThe burden of import certificates for wine will not simply fall on EU businesses \u2013 their pain will be shared by UK importers and ultimately UK consumers.\u201d The WSTA\u2019s concerns revolve around the extra administrative burden that would be required in order to keep wine flowing into the UK from the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Imports would require certificates known as VI 1 forms, as well as expensive lab analysis, meaning higher costs and delays for the 55% of Britain\u2019s wine imports that come from the EU.",

The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.</p>\n    <p>Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone.

The last substantive Brexit negotiation took place in Strasbourg in March when May and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, drafted an ill-fated adjunct to the withdrawal agreement emphasising the temporary nature of the Irish backstop. May\u2019s deal was subsequently defeated in the Commons by the crushing margin of 149. EU officials insisted that nearly two months after Johnson was made prime minister the gap between the two sides was still far too wide for any meaningful renegotiation and that British civil servants were still merely \u201ctalking about concepts\u201d. In the most recent talks between officials, Frost was said to have outlined ideas covering customs and manufactured goods in which Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would be in separate customs and regulatory zones. Sources said Johnson\u2019s envoy had suggested an \u201cenhanced market surveillance mechanism\u201d for industrial goods involving tough penalties for those who seek to smuggle contraband over the border. Frost had said the UK could commit to an open border in the withdrawal agreement but that the detail of how checks could be done away from the border would have to be decided during the stand-still transition period catered for in the withdrawal agreement. The EU says there must be a legally operable plan for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland in any withdrawal agreement and it will not accept a deal based on a promise. Speaking after the MEPs\u2019 briefing with Barnier, the president of the European parliament, David Sassoli, told reporters: \u201cWe would like there to be initiatives to discuss but unfortunately there aren\u2019t any.\u201d The UK government says it will not accept any backstop that leaves Northern Ireland in a separate customs territory and different regulatory areas for goods other than agrifood. There remains some confidence that the UK might move in that direction in order to put a last-gasp deal before parliament and avoid a further Brexit extension. One diplomat said the UK \u201cnow seems [to better] recognise the unique situation on the island of Ireland\u201d, but that current proposals were \u201cwish-wash\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Capita, the outsourcing company behind the London congestion charge and the BBC licence fee, is giving almost 6,000 UK workers a pay rise, offering staff the real living wage as a minimum from next April. The company said all of its 40,000 UK employees, from administrative staff to construction, health and call-centre workers, would be paid, at least, the independently verified real living wage. The real living wage is \u00a310.55 an hour in London and \u00a39 an hour across the rest of the UK. The rates are overseen by the Living Wage Commission and calculated annually by the Resolution Foundation as the basic income needed to cover the real cost of living. Capita\u2019s staff are at present paid, as a minimum, the national living wage \u2013 the legal minimum. This means people aged over 25 get \u00a38.21 an hour, but those under 18 receive just \u00a34.35 while apprentices get \u00a33.90. Capita is working towards full accreditation with the Living Wage Foundation by reviewing plans to extend the policy to regular sub-contracted staff. However, apprentices will not get the new rates.

When I was at university, you could count the number of students on my course who got firsts on one hand. I am sad to report that I wasn\u2019t one of them,\u201d Williamson said.</p> <p>According to a transcript of Williamson\u2019s speech published by the Department for Education, the education secretary also said of first class degrees: \u201cNow it seems that they are 10 a penny.\u201d But Williamson did not use the comment to the delegates.</p> <p>Williamson continued: \u201cIn 1997 \u2013 which is when I graduated \u2013 50% of students gained a first or a 2.1. Last year 80% of students did so.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Universities UK said: \u201cIt is important not to forget that students working harder, improvements in teaching, investment in academic support and widening participation initiatives are also all leading to legitimate grade improvement and such improvements are to be celebrated.\u201d</p> <p>But within the sector there is disquiet among some senior figures that the steep increases are indefensible.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/news-blog-and-events/press-and-media/universities-must-get-to-grips-with-spiralling-grade-inflation/\">report by the Office for Students</a> (OfS), the higher education regulator for England, found that 90% of universities had a statistically significant increase in the proportion of first-class degrees awarded between 2010 and 2018 that could not be explained.</p> <p>Williamson also attacked the use of unconditional offers, where universities in England offer places to applicants regardless of their exam results, a practice that has grown rapidly since the government removed the cap on student numbers in 2015.</p> <p>With unconditional offers rising from 3,000 in 2013 to nearly 76,000 this year, Williamson said the higher education sector needed \u201cto get its house in order\u201d. He suggested limiting the proportion of students given unconditional offers, or setting minimum predicted grade thresholds, as a way of cutting the numbers.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to work together on some of these issues. If we don\u2019t tackle them, your hard-won reputation for excellence will be undermined,\u201d Williamson said.</p> <p>\u201cWorse still, there is a risk that employers will begin to lose faith in grades and foreign students will think twice about investing their time and money in studying here.\u201d</p> <p>Early next week Williamson will write to the OfS setting out his concerns in a wide number of other areas.</p> <p>Speaking to journalists, Williamson also criticised the use of so-called \u201cconditional unconditional offers\u201d, in which universities make the offer of a guaranteed place if the applicants make that university their firm choice.</p> <p>\u201cThey sometimes limit youngsters from the most disadvantaged backgrounds from actually going to the very best academic institution that they possibly could do, and I don\u2019t want see that at all,\u201d Williamson said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/11/government-calls-on-ofs-to-clamp-down-on-university-grade-inflation\">Government calls on OfS to clamp down on university grade inflation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On tuition fees, Williamson told journalists the government intended to make a formal response to the recent review by Philip Augar \u201cby the end of winter\u201d. He refused to be drawn on whether cuts to tuition fees would be included in a Conservative manifesto.</p> <p>Prof Julia Buckingham, vice-chancellor of Brunel University and president of UUK, said the organisation would call for the return of maintenance grants in its pre-election lobbying of political parties.</p> <p>Buckingham said Brexit remained a significant concern for universities. \u201cThere is no shying away from the fact that no deal \u2013 whether this is in 49 days\u2019 time or further down the line \u2013 is not what our sector wants. The risks and challenges will be significant and could impact the sector for decades to come,\u201d she said.</p>",

When I was at university, you could count the number of students on my course who got firsts on one hand. I am sad to report that I wasn\u2019t one of them,\u201d Williamson said. According to a transcript of Williamson\u2019s speech published by the Department for Education, the education secretary also said of first class degrees: \u201cNow it seems that they are 10 a penny.\u201d But Williamson did not use the comment to the delegates. Williamson continued: \u201cIn 1997 \u2013 which is when I graduated \u2013 50% of students gained a first or a 2.1. Last year 80% of students did so.\u201d A spokesperson for Universities UK said: \u201cIt is important not to forget that students working harder, improvements in teaching, investment in academic support and widening participation initiatives are also all leading to legitimate grade improvement and such improvements are to be celebrated.\u201d But within the sector there is disquiet among some senior figures that the steep increases are indefensible. A report by the Office for Students (OfS), the higher education regulator for England, found that 90% of universities had a statistically significant increase in the proportion of first-class degrees awarded between 2010 and 2018 that could not be explained. Williamson also attacked the use of unconditional offers, where universities in England offer places to applicants regardless of their exam results, a practice that has grown rapidly since the government removed the cap on student numbers in 2015. With unconditional offers rising from 3,000 in 2013 to nearly 76,000 this year, Williamson said the higher education sector needed \u201cto get its house in order\u201d. He suggested limiting the proportion of students given unconditional offers, or setting minimum predicted grade thresholds, as a way of cutting the numbers. \u201cWe need to work together on some of these issues. If we don\u2019t tackle them, your hard-won reputation for excellence will be undermined,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cWorse still, there is a risk that employers will begin to lose faith in grades and foreign students will think twice about investing their time and money in studying here.\u201d Early next week Williamson will write to the OfS setting out his concerns in a wide number of other areas. Speaking to journalists, Williamson also criticised the use of so-called \u201cconditional unconditional offers\u201d, in which universities make the offer of a guaranteed place if the applicants make that university their firm choice. \u201cThey sometimes limit youngsters from the most disadvantaged backgrounds from actually going to the very best academic institution that they possibly could do, and I don\u2019t want see that at all,\u201d Williamson said. On tuition fees, Williamson told journalists the government intended to make a formal response to the recent review by Philip Augar \u201cby the end of winter\u201d. He refused to be drawn on whether cuts to tuition fees would be included in a Conservative manifesto. Prof Julia Buckingham, vice-chancellor of Brunel University and president of UUK, said the organisation would call for the return of maintenance grants in its pre-election lobbying of political parties. Buckingham said Brexit remained a significant concern for universities. \u201cThere is no shying away from the fact that no deal \u2013 whether this is in 49 days\u2019 time or further down the line \u2013 is not what our sector wants. The risks and challenges will be significant and could impact the sector for decades to come,\u201d she said.",

Still, I want to be inclusive, so let me break it down for the angry folks. SAM\u2019S A NICE MAN. HE DOESN\u2019T WANT TO COME OFF LIKE A SHIT. He\u2019s already achieved far, far beyond what he set out to when he joined the Pontypandy service, and he would be absolutely cool with someone else having a go at being a mascot for \u2013 hang on, let\u2019s remind ourselves here \u2013 a single county branch of the fire and rescue service. Sam knows that if it brings in more great female fire officers like Penny, then we all win.</p> <p>Because here\u2019s the thing about Sam: he\u2019s not some professional media snowflake who has to wet his <a href=\"https://www.depend.co.uk/\">Depends</a> every morning about something just to feel alive. What sort of example would that be setting to naughty Norman Price, or nice Mandy, the nurse\u2019s daughter, or \u2013 most pressingly \u2013 to his boss, station officer Steele? If Sam pulled the tantrums you lot do, he\u2019d be out on his ear. There\u2019s no \u201cI\u201d in Pontypandy, and the minute someone reckons they\u2019re bigger than the fire station, then it\u2019s over. Sam\u2019s a super-amiable cartoon firefighter, not Neymar.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not enough, is it? These people screaming about Fireman Sam won\u2019t be satisfied until this committed local fire officer, who wants no part of it, has been made to own the libs. On the basis that it\u2019s best to know your enemy, then, here follows the tried-and-tested playbook they now want Sam to follow. Read it carefully and understand one thing: THIS IS THE WORLD CONSERVATIVES WANT YOU TO LIVE IN.</p> <h2><strong>Fireman Sam gets a Netflix special</strong></h2> <p>Like me, you probably feel as if you have so very much more to learn about what 50-year-old comedians feel about gender pronouns and so on, and Netflix specials seem primarily geared towards addressing that deep need in Earth\u2019s populace. Luckily, Sam has a tight 57 minutes of opening material on the subject, and could expect his own special \u2013 working title FIRESTARTER \u2013 to add to the sum of human hilarity on the matter. Word of warning, though: if you\u2019re under 30 and you find this \u201cabsolute legend\u201d hysterically funny, you\u2019re going to be voting far right by the time you\u2019re 52.

Having said that, the Animal Gambit WILL slay in the bar at the Brexit party conference, so if you\u2019re going along later this month and plan to use it, do pack adequate contraception/Mace. As for Sam, ideally we would have an episode where he climbs to the roof of Dilys\u2019s shop, screaming: \u201cShall I identify as a seagull then????\u201d, until Penny wearily uses Jupiter\u2019s ladder to get him down, and a toddler savant \u2013 possibly Mandy\u2019s little brother \u2013 explains to Sam that it just isn\u2019t that big of a deal, babe.</p> <p>For some, of course, it really is.

      "body": "<p>I first discovered Clara Schumann\u2019s work only a year ago. I was listening to music at the kitchen table with some friends, and her Scherzo No 2 came on. The fiery music drew me in immediately, but I didn\u2019t recognise it and asked what it was. I was stunned to discover the answer. I had of course heard of Clara Schumann \u2013 the 19th-century German pianist and composer \u2013 but, like many people, simply saw her as the wife of Robert Schumann. I determined to learn more about her.</p> <p>The more I read about Clara, the more inspiring she was to me. I like to think of her as the Beyonc\u00e9 of her day: a successful artist, capable of balancing motherhood with touring, married to a fellow musician and a truly independent woman! What I found most astonishing was her strength. Researching her life, I couldn\u2019t believe that she had managed to sustain such a long and busy concert career, spanning from childhood right into old age, along with having eight children, and a husband who slowly declined into severe mental illness, and eventually died in an asylum when still in his 40s. She also had a difficult childhood. Her father, Friedrich Wieck, a very overbearing man, was set on creating a concert pianist in Clara \u2013 something particularly tough given that it was a male-dominated world at that time. From a very young age she had to spend hours each day practising, and much of her childhood was spent on the road with her father, giving concerts.</p> <p>She met Robert when he became a pupil of her father\u2019s. The two fell in love; her father forbade them from marrying but they exchanged love letters and met in secret, and did marry in Leipzig in 1840 \u2013 the day before Clara\u2019s 21st birthday. I am 23 now and find it mind-boggling to think that she had achieved so much at that age: she had already composed several works, including her Piano Concerto, and had been touring as a concert pianist for over half her life.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbDhgAO3SdE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LbDhgAO3SdE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It seems that most of Clara\u2019s compositions were actually gifts to her husband. He encouraged her to compose, and she in turn edited his works. In her music, I can definitely hear the influences of Robert, but she also has her own, unique voice. In fact, people are quick to suggest that Clara was also influenced by Brahms (another classical music hero of mine) but since she was composing long before she even met him, I think it is fairer to say that it was the other way round.</p> <p>I decided that for my debut with Decca Classics I wanted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/26/young-pianist-to-record-album-of-clara-schumanns-works\">to record an album exclusively of Clara Schumann\u2019s music</a>. I delved into her compositions via recordings and sheet music and found some incredible work \u2013 much of which I didn\u2019t know \u2013 it\u2019s so rarely played in modern concert halls.

      "bodyText": "I first discovered Clara Schumann\u2019s work only a year ago. I was listening to music at the kitchen table with some friends, and her Scherzo No 2 came on. The fiery music drew me in immediately, but I didn\u2019t recognise it and asked what it was. I was stunned to discover the answer. I had of course heard of Clara Schumann \u2013 the 19th-century German pianist and composer \u2013 but, like many people, simply saw her as the wife of Robert Schumann. I determined to learn more about her. The more I read about Clara, the more inspiring she was to me. I like to think of her as the Beyonc\u00e9 of her day: a successful artist, capable of balancing motherhood with touring, married to a fellow musician and a truly independent woman! What I found most astonishing was her strength. Researching her life, I couldn\u2019t believe that she had managed to sustain such a long and busy concert career, spanning from childhood right into old age, along with having eight children, and a husband who slowly declined into severe mental illness, and eventually died in an asylum when still in his 40s. She also had a difficult childhood. Her father, Friedrich Wieck, a very overbearing man, was set on creating a concert pianist in Clara \u2013 something particularly tough given that it was a male-dominated world at that time. From a very young age she had to spend hours each day practising, and much of her childhood was spent on the road with her father, giving concerts. She met Robert when he became a pupil of her father\u2019s. The two fell in love; her father forbade them from marrying but they exchanged love letters and met in secret, and did marry in Leipzig in 1840 \u2013 the day before Clara\u2019s 21st birthday. I am 23 now and find it mind-boggling to think that she had achieved so much at that age: she had already composed several works, including her Piano Concerto, and had been touring as a concert pianist for over half her life. It seems that most of Clara\u2019s compositions were actually gifts to her husband. He encouraged her to compose, and she in turn edited his works. In her music, I can definitely hear the influences of Robert, but she also has her own, unique voice. In fact, people are quick to suggest that Clara was also influenced by Brahms (another classical music hero of mine) but since she was composing long before she even met him, I think it is fairer to say that it was the other way round. I decided that for my debut with Decca Classics I wanted to record an album exclusively of Clara Schumann\u2019s music. I delved into her compositions via recordings and sheet music and found some incredible work \u2013 much of which I didn\u2019t know \u2013 it\u2019s so rarely played in modern concert halls. In shining a light on her music I hoped I might also inspire others to perform and programme it more. Perhaps her best known work is her Piano Concerto, which is of course on the album, as well as that that remarkable Scherzo No 2 \u2013 the piece which first hooked me into her musical world. There\u2019s also her Piano Sonata in G Minor, a beautiful and fascinating work that was never published in her lifetime.

      "body": "<h2>50. The Greatest Romance Ever Sold (1999)</h2> \n<p>By the end of the 90s, Prince obviously wanted commercial success again. The album Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic came packed with guest appearances; the smooth hip-hop-soul balladry of The Greatest Romance Ever Sold was a good indication of its musical style. It wasn\u2019t a bad song, but the sense Prince was following trends rather than going his own way was hard to avoid.</p> \n<h2>49. Letitgo (1994)</h2> \n<p>By 1994, Prince was more interested in fighting with his record company than the quality of his releases. Come was evidently thrown together to fulfill his contract. But even when he didn\u2019t really care, he couldn\u2019t turn his talent off completely. Letitgo isn\u2019t a classic, but nor is it a disaster. Perhaps he made more of an effort because it\u2019s about his desire to leave the Warners label.</p> \n<h2>48. U Make My Sun Shine (2000)</h2> \n<p>Prince hadn\u2019t lost his ability to spot talent: U Make My Sun Shine featured a great guest appearance from neo-soul singer Angie Stone. Her presence seemed to rouse him \u2013 it\u2019s a gospel/southern soul-inspired ballad, and a minor gem.</p> \n<h2>47. Dinner With Delores (1996)</h2> \n<p>Another thrown-together contractual-obligation album, Chaos and Disorder had a rough charm and immediacy, as evidenced by Dinner With Dolores, a sweet, if slight, song cut from the same pop-rock cloth as Manic Monday.</p> \n<h2>46. Gold (1995)</h2> \n<p>A lost nugget from 1995\u2019s The Gold Experience, Gold reiterates the anti-materialistic message of 1992\u2019s Money Don\u2019t Matter 2 Night. It\u2019s not groundbreaking in the way Prince\u2019s singles once were, but it\u2019s exquisitely written.</p> \n<h2>45. Batdance (1989)</h2> \n<p>The Batman soundtrack was the first real artistic wobble in Prince\u2019s career, arriving replete with filler, including the phoned-in ballad The Arms of Orion. Nor has its largely instrumental first single dated well: it picks up when the vocals come in, but Prince had made umpteen more creative 12in remixes than this.</p> \n<h2>44. The Work Pt 1 (2001)</h2> \n<p>Beloved of Prince diehards, a bit of a schlep for everyone else, the jazz and Jehovah concept album The Rainbow Children underlined that Prince was now more interested in stubborn self-indulgence than commercial success. But it did yield The Work, a relentless, horn-laden James Brown-ish groove that unexpectedly collapses into slowed-down vocals and synth-y ambience.</p> \n<h2>43. Cinnamon Girl (2004)</h2> \n<p>Musicology was Prince\u2019s biggest-selling album in more than a decade. It helped that copies given away with gig tickets counted as sales, but so did the presence of straightforwardly enjoyable songs such as Cinnamon Girl, which you could have imagined him writing circa Around the World in a Day.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0bdcecc59f32ff46b28cfba5d726fcc25f66d00a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bdcecc59f32ff46b28cfba5d726fcc25f66d00a/0_0_3286_4872/674.jpg\" alt=\"Prince on the Purple Rain tour.\" width=\"674\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince on the Purple Rain tour.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ebet Roberts/Redferns</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>42. I Hate U (1995)</h2> \n<p>The Gold Experience was a better album than its relatively lukewarm reception suggested. I Hate You is The Most Beautiful Girl In The World\u2019s evil twin: more pillow-soft soul, this time attacking rather than hymning a woman, complete with a faintly problematic faux-courtroom scene.</p> \n<h2>41. The Truth (1997)</h2> \n<p>An interesting single from Prince\u2019s artistically lean years, primarily because it took him somewhere new. Stark, acoustic and blues-influenced, performed solo and boasting a great vocal performance, The Truth didn\u2019t sound like any Prince single before it.</p> \n<h2>40. Thieves in the Temple (1990)</h2> \n<p>Prince clearly intended Graffiti Bridge to have a similar impact to Purple Rain, but the film was abysmal and the accompanying soundtrack uneven. Its lead single isn\u2019t a bad song by any means \u2013 its sound is slinky and luscious, the chorus is great \u2013 but it\u2019s no When Doves Cry.</p> \n<h2>39. Delirious (1983)</h2> \n<p>In the best possible way, the 1999 album was the sound of a man showing off: name a musical style and he could bend it to his own ends. Hence the US-only Delirious, a kind of dry-run for Let\u2019s Go Crazy, with its roots in 50s rock\u2019n\u2019roll.</p> \n<h2>38. Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad? (1979)</h2> \n<p>One aspect of Prince\u2019s genius lay in his inability to be confined by musical genres. Early on in his career, Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad? offered dancefloor-focused R&amp;B that was influenced by both AOR and the emergent new wave, and concluded with a startling display of guitar pyrotechnics.</p> \n<h2>37. Soft and Wet (1978)</h2> \n<p>Released at the height of disco, Soft and Wet\u2019s skeletal, off-kilter synth funk \u2013 complete with jazzy inflections \u2013 sounded like it came from another planet to the rest of the US chart. A minor hit, it quietly announced the arrival of a unique and uniquely unbiddable talent, so obsessed with sex he mentions his penis in the opening line.</p> \n<h2>36. Let\u2019s Work (1981)</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s all about the 12in mix. Not content with merely extending an album track for the dancefloor, Prince went to town, completely overhauling Let\u2019s Work, interpolating sections of Controversy\u2019s title track and Annie Christian, enhancing the song\u2019s sweaty urgency with new vocals and keyboards, demonstrating a meticulous attention to detail where lesser artists would have expended no effort at all.</p> \n<h2>35. The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (1994)</h2> \n<p>It is incredible that The Most Beautiful Girl in The World is Prince\u2019s only UK No 1, given the singles that preceded it. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a deft homage to the super-soft 70s soul of the Delfonics and the Stylistics, both of whom he subsequently covered.</p> \n<h2>34. 7 (1992)</h2> \n<p>If you want evidence of Prince\u2019s unique, almost mystical, abilities, 7 is an intriguing place to start. At heart, the song is a rousing acoustic campfire singalong with lyrics of a spiritual bent, albeit a fairly baffling one. Deeply unpromising on paper, he somehow makes it work to striking effect, spooning on the harmonies and vintage sitar effects.</p> \n<h2>33. Black Sweat (2006)</h2> \n<p>The problem with Prince\u2019s wilderness years wasn\u2019t a decline in talent, but a fatal lack of focus. The minimal funk of Kiss reimagined for the 00s, Black Sweat was evidence that Prince was marshalling his abilities once more. It wasn\u2019t up to his 80s standards, but it was close enough to pass muster.</p> \n<h2>32. Screwdriver (2013)</h2> \n<p>Later included on Hit n Run Phase Two, Screwdriver is the rawest single of Prince\u2019s career, its overloaded, ragged sound verging on garage rock, or at least Prince\u2019s take on the genre. In fact, your average garage-rock band couldn\u2019t reel off remarkable solos the way he does throughout.</p> \n<h2>31. U Got the Look (1987)</h2> \n<p>Of all the artists on whom Prince bestowed his star-making qualities, the least likely was Scottish MOR singer Sheena Easton, recast on U Got the Look as a snarling sexual predator. The song itself is a little lumpy by Prince\u2019s 80s standards, but not without a weird charm, embodied by its fake sportscaster announcements: \u201cBoy v girl in the World Series of love\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jCuroTbqBI\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_jCuroTbqBI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>30. I Wish U Heaven (1988)</h2> \n<p>Prince was fond of describing Lovesexy as a gospel album, but that\u2019s not a term you would use to describes the music on I Wish U Heaven: a thumping, tom-tom heavy beat, thick, chugging guitars, Prince\u2019s vocal floating beatifically above in a cloud of electronics. The lyrics could be about God, or a lover. Either way, it\u2019s a strange and lovely single.</p> \n<h2>29. America (1985)</h2> \n<p>Another single arguably best heard in its 12in version, which in America\u2019s case lasts for nearly 22 minutes of frantic, paranoid acid funk, Hendrix-y soloing and claustrophobic harmonies. The darkness of Vietnam-damaged late-60s US psych recast for the Reagan years.</p> \n<h2>28. Dirty Mind (1980)</h2> \n<p>Startling, audacious and filthy from soup to nuts, the Dirty Mind album was Prince\u2019s first masterpiece. Its melding of funk and rock and gleeful nose-thumbing at pop\u2019s standard racial boundaries was Sly Stone-esque, but updated for the 80s. The razor-sharp robot funk of its title track was the perfect calling card: no one else sounded like this.</p> \n<h2>27. My Name Is Prince (1992)</h2> \n<p>The grip he had once exerted over the public slipping, you can see why Prince felt the need to reassert his authority in 1992. My Name Is Prince did it in style. Its intro listed his hits, its lyric switched between proclaiming himself divinely chosen and fretting about judgment day, and its music dealt in heavy breakbeats and noise that suggested he had been listening to Public Enemy.</p> \n<h2>26. Take Me With U (1985)</h2> \n<p>The influence of musical consiglieres Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman started drawing Prince towards the sound of 60s psychedelia on the Purple Rain soundtrack. You can hear the first signs on Take Me With U, a gorgeous, carefree song enveloped by a groggy string arrangement \u2013 written by Coleman \u2013 that never quite drifts in the direction you expect.</p> \n<h2>25. Guitar (2007)</h2> \n<p>Planet Earth wasn\u2019t the best of his latterday albums, but its standout track was among his best his latterday singles, an infectious glam stomp with a typically witty kiss-off lyric: \u201cI love you baby and I wish you well, I\u2019ll write you a letter when I learn how to spell\u201d.</p> \n<h2>24. I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man (1987)</h2> \n<p>A return to the pop-rock territory of Little Red Corvette and 1980\u2019s When You Were Mine, I Could Never Take the Place Of Your Man is straightforward compared with a lot of the material on Sign o\u2019 the Times, its lyrical conceit notwithstanding, but it\u2019s a perfect example of Prince\u2019s songwriting craft.</p> \n<h2>23. Gotta Stop (Messin\u2019 About) (1981)</h2> \n<p>Perhaps only Prince in 1981 would think a song about voyeurism and compulsive masturbation was just the thing to break him in the UK. Never released as a single in the US, it unsurprisingly wasn\u2019t a hit, but that\u2019s no reflection on its thrilling, wildly idiosyncratic staccato funk.</p> \n<h2>22. I Would Die For U (1984)</h2> \n<p>More personal myth-making \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not a woman, I\u2019m not a man, I am something that you\u2019ll never understand\u201d \u2013 on a single where the indelible chorus masks a genuinely odd production: an unsettling stop-start rhythm that precludes dancing; rattling, incessant hi-hat perplexingly loud in the mix. Still, he knew what he was doing \u2013 it worked.</p> \n<h2>21. Money Don\u2019t Matter 2 Night (1992)</h2> \n<p>Co-written with Rosie Gaines, its commercial chances in the US scuppered by a Spike Lee-directed video that MTV deemed too political and refused to show, Money Don\u2019t Matter 2 Night is a fantastic song, the smoothness of its sound and delivery masking a punchy, politically engaged lyric that takes in both consumerism and Operation Desert Storm.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"14f6200b26ac72f206c15043f368902ea5fa08e1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14f6200b26ac72f206c15043f368902ea5fa08e1/0_0_3600_2500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prince in 1997.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince in 1997.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Diamond/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>20. Controversy (1981)</h2> \n<p>Effectively early 80s Prince\u2019s manifesto \u2013 \u201cI wish there was no black and white, I wish there were no rules\u201d \u2013 Controversy also addressed the furore caused by Dirty Mind\u2019s songs about troilism and incest with a blithe shrug and featured a bit of the Lord\u2019s Prayer for good measure. The music, meanwhile, is awesome: tight, funky, fluently melodic.</p> \n<h2>19. Girls &amp; Boys (1986)</h2> \n<p>Bafflingly unreleased as a single in the US, much to chagrin of some members of the Revolution, Girls and Boys returned Prince to appealingly tough funk, albeit decorated with weird production flourishes \u2013 honking duck-call synths \u2013 and lyrics that spike the mood of sultry eroticism with wit: \u201cShe had the cutest ass he\u2019d ever seen \u2013 but he did too, they were meant to be\u201d.</p> \n<h2>18. Cream (1991)</h2> \n<p>T Rex never broke the US, but Prince was clearly a fan and never more so than on this glorious, loving homage to Get It On, complete with lyrical echoes (the object of Prince\u2019s affections is \u201cfilthy-cute\u201d as opposed to \u201cdirty-sweet\u201d). Never given to underestimating his own importance, Marc Bolan would doubtless have adored it.</p> \n<h2>17. Baltimore (2015)</h2> \n<p>Prince\u2019s death came amid suggestions he was in the grip of another artistic renaissance. Baltimore was strong evidence: inspired by Black Lives Matter, lyrically angry and confrontational in a way that was unlike his previous political work, it was also blessed with an elegant melody and striking string arrangement.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/24/how-we-made-princes-purple-rain-interview\">How we made Prince's Purple Rain</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>16. Pop Life (1985)</h2> \n<p>The brand of psychedelia found on 1985\u2019s Around The World In A Day never sounded retro or like a pastiche. For all Pop Life\u2019s backwards tapes and melodic nods in the direction of the Beatles, it was resolutely a product of the mid-80s, more evidence of Prince\u2019s ability to not merely absorb influences but recast them in his own image.</p> \n<h2>15 Let\u2019s Go Crazy (1984)</h2> \n<p>The emotional flipside of the eerie, troubled When Doves Cry, Let\u2019s Go Crazy can barely contain itself. One of the greatest intros of the 80s \u2013 \u201cDearly beloved \u2026\u201d \u2013 leads into a relentless rhythmic clatter, explosions of metal guitar, raw-throated exhortations to party and utterly bizarre lyrics: \u201cLet\u2019s look for the purple banana\u201d; \u201cPills and thrills and daffodils can kill\u201d. A joy from start to finish.</p> \n<h2>14. Head (1980)</h2> \n<p>The sound of a libido gone berserk, Head is both irresistible and insane, a falsetto-voiced song about \u2013 wait for it \u2013 a virginal bride-to-be en route to her wedding, who bumps into Prince and is overwhelmed by the desire to fellate him. It should be ridiculous, but its raw funk groove is utterly compelling; Prince\u2019s alchemical powers in full effect.</p> \n<h2>13. Alphabet St (1988)</h2> \n<p>1988\u2019s Lovesexy was received coolly on release, which tells you more about the standard of the Prince albums that preceded it than its quality. In reality, it\u2019s the last unequivocally superb album he made, while its lead single is a delight: an explosion of stop-start funk, popping bass and \u2013 in its full-length version \u2013 rapping from his new female foil Cat Glover.</p> \n<h2>12. Little Red Corvette (1983)</h2> \n<p>Prince at his most unrepentantly commercial. If MTV and US rock radio wouldn\u2019t play black soul artists, then here was a black soul artist who could make pop-rock singles of a calibre they couldn\u2019t ignore. It was his biggest hit to date, censors apparently missing a reference to its heroine\u2019s pocketful of condoms (\u201csome of them used\u201d) in the second verse.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cdf8e4b8b625df0606ed2f2c60cfb3dd02158b5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cdf8e4b8b625df0606ed2f2c60cfb3dd02158b5/0_0_3600_3125/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prince in 1990.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"868\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince in 1990.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Brewster/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>11. Sexy MF (1992)</h2> \n<p>Boasting the kind of lyric his subsequent conversion to the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses would preclude, Sexy MF offers up a JB\u2019s-ish groove that\u2019s simultaneously raw and tightly controlled, a chorus punctuated by the kind of lip-smacking noise also featured on Kiss and its author on superb priapic form: \u201cI got wet dreams comin\u2019 out my ears!\u201d</p> \n<h2>10. If I Was Your Girlfriend (1987)</h2> \n<p>A dark, sparse crawl of a song, alternately sexy, pained and weirdly unsettling, If I Was Your Girlfriend played with ideas of gender (the androgynous sped-up vocal was credited to his female alter-ego Camille, a name under which he initially intended to release a whole album) that are commonplace now, but were uncharted territory for mainstream black music 30 years ago.</p> \n<h2>9. I Wanna Be Your Lover (1979)</h2> \n<p>Prince\u2019s first truly spectacular single \u2013 and first US hit \u2013 I Wanna Be Your Lover was a fabulous, effortless-sounding song. The sound bore the influence of Chic in its scratchy, Nile Rodgers-ish guitar, while its synth-heavy arrangement presciently suggested what the post-disco future would sound like.</p> \n<h2>8. Mountains (1986)</h2> \n<p>A last outing for Prince\u2019s unique contemporary take on psychedelia: an addictive, dizzying wash of sound \u2013 rumbling drums (possibly influenced by Kate Bush\u2019s Running Up That Hill), synths, brass, rolling piano \u2013 topped with a falsetto vocal. The horn breakdown 30 seconds from the end is particularly glorious.</p> \n<h2>7. Sign o\u2019 the Times (1987)</h2> \n<p>Prince fired his backing band the Revolution during the making of Sign o\u2019 the Times: a bad move in retrospect, but initially at least his genius seemed unaffected. The title track is brilliantly stark: Aids, the Challenger space shuttle disaster and the crack epidemic co-mingled in a bleak state-of-the-nation address. If Prince was the Sly Stone of the 80s, this was his There\u2019s a Riot Goin\u2019 On.</p> \n<h2>6. Purple Rain (1984)</h2> \n<p>Originally a 10-minute-long country and western song intended for Stevie Nicks (who found it \u201ctoo much\u201d), Purple Rain was transformed into an epic power ballad during a six-hour rehearsal and recorded onstage at Minneapolis\u2019 First Avenue club to astonishing, heart-stopping effect. Its elegiac tone makes it fitting that it was the last song Prince played live.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0ecb3a33c4403682fd3fb96869d4ee08da9290ec\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ecb3a33c4403682fd3fb96869d4ee08da9290ec/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prince at Hop Farm festival in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince at Hop Farm festival in 2011.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Lupin/Redferns</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>5. 1999 (1982)</h2> \n<p>1999 is so familiar, it\u2019s easy to forget what a weird idea for a hit single it was: a party-starting P-Funk-y anthem about a vision of imminent apocalypse. Perhaps its lyrics chimed with the fear and paranoia engendered by the escalating cold war. More likely, it was a huge crossover smash because it\u2019s an incredible, impossibly assured piece of music.</p> \n<h2>4. Gett Off (1991)</h2> \n<p>Prince\u2019s early 90s albums were nowhere near as consistent as his 80s work, but initially at least, he could still be relied upon to come up with stunning singles. From its opening scream to its ferocious concluding guitar solo, Gett Off is prime-quality Prince: funny, lubricious, preposterously funky, every bit the equal of his best work.</p> \n<h2>3. Raspberry Beret (1985)</h2> \n<p>Compared with everything else happening in pop in the nadir year of 1985, Raspberry Beret was in a different league. It represented the pinnacle of Prince\u2019s psychedelic phase: another of Coleman\u2019s superbly woozy string arrangements, a song so perfect and simple it had a kind of instant familiarity, as if you had known it for years on first listen.</p> \n<h2>2. Kiss (1986)</h2> \n<p>By 1986, Prince was peerless, so far ahead of everyone else in contemporary pop it was almost laughable. Kiss was all the evidence you needed. It repeated When Doves Cry\u2019s hugely impressive trick of conjuring up funk without a bassline, and added perhaps the most indelible chorus of his career and a vocal that turns into an astonishing lust-racked scream at 3min 20sec.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG3VcCAlUgE\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UG3VcCAlUgE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>1. When Doves Cry (1984)</h2> \n<p>Again, the familiarity of Prince\u2019s most famous song tends to obscure what an audacious and daring piece of music it is. Everyone knows that funk is utterly rooted in the drums and the bass. When Doves Cry \u2013 the biggest-selling single of 1984 \u2013 insouciantly turns that on its head. It originally had a bassline, but Prince thought it sounded \u201ctoo conventional\u201d and removed it, leaving only a sparse framework of drums and synth. For a song that inexorably propels people to the dancefloor \u2013 whether at a hip club or a wedding reception \u2013 it\u2019s remarkably downcast. Played in an minor key, its lyrics are alternately desolate, soul-searching and just weird: \u201cAnimals strike curious poses\u201d. Experimental but multi-million-selling, it\u2019s a work of era-transcending genius.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "50. The Greatest Romance Ever Sold (1999) By the end of the 90s, Prince obviously wanted commercial success again. The album Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic came packed with guest appearances; the smooth hip-hop-soul balladry of The Greatest Romance Ever Sold was a good indication of its musical style. It wasn\u2019t a bad song, but the sense Prince was following trends rather than going his own way was hard to avoid. 49. Letitgo (1994) By 1994, Prince was more interested in fighting with his record company than the quality of his releases. Come was evidently thrown together to fulfill his contract. But even when he didn\u2019t really care, he couldn\u2019t turn his talent off completely. Letitgo isn\u2019t a classic, but nor is it a disaster. Perhaps he made more of an effort because it\u2019s about his desire to leave the Warners label. 48. U Make My Sun Shine (2000) Prince hadn\u2019t lost his ability to spot talent: U Make My Sun Shine featured a great guest appearance from neo-soul singer Angie Stone. Her presence seemed to rouse him \u2013 it\u2019s a gospel/southern soul-inspired ballad, and a minor gem. 47. Dinner With Delores (1996) Another thrown-together contractual-obligation album, Chaos and Disorder had a rough charm and immediacy, as evidenced by Dinner With Dolores, a sweet, if slight, song cut from the same pop-rock cloth as Manic Monday. 46. Gold (1995) A lost nugget from 1995\u2019s The Gold Experience, Gold reiterates the anti-materialistic message of 1992\u2019s Money Don\u2019t Matter 2 Night. It\u2019s not groundbreaking in the way Prince\u2019s singles once were, but it\u2019s exquisitely written. 45. Batdance (1989) The Batman soundtrack was the first real artistic wobble in Prince\u2019s career, arriving replete with filler, including the phoned-in ballad The Arms of Orion. Nor has its largely instrumental first single dated well: it picks up when the vocals come in, but Prince had made umpteen more creative 12in remixes than this. 44. The Work Pt 1 (2001) Beloved of Prince diehards, a bit of a schlep for everyone else, the jazz and Jehovah concept album The Rainbow Children underlined that Prince was now more interested in stubborn self-indulgence than commercial success. But it did yield The Work, a relentless, horn-laden James Brown-ish groove that unexpectedly collapses into slowed-down vocals and synth-y ambience. 43. Cinnamon Girl (2004) Musicology was Prince\u2019s biggest-selling album in more than a decade. It helped that copies given away with gig tickets counted as sales, but so did the presence of straightforwardly enjoyable songs such as Cinnamon Girl, which you could have imagined him writing circa Around the World in a Day. 42. I Hate U (1995) The Gold Experience was a better album than its relatively lukewarm reception suggested. I Hate You is The Most Beautiful Girl In The World\u2019s evil twin: more pillow-soft soul, this time attacking rather than hymning a woman, complete with a faintly problematic faux-courtroom scene. 41. The Truth (1997) An interesting single from Prince\u2019s artistically lean years, primarily because it took him somewhere new. Stark, acoustic and blues-influenced, performed solo and boasting a great vocal performance, The Truth didn\u2019t sound like any Prince single before it. 40. Thieves in the Temple (1990) Prince clearly intended Graffiti Bridge to have a similar impact to Purple Rain, but the film was abysmal and the accompanying soundtrack uneven. Its lead single isn\u2019t a bad song by any means \u2013 its sound is slinky and luscious, the chorus is great \u2013 but it\u2019s no When Doves Cry. 39. Delirious (1983) In the best possible way, the 1999 album was the sound of a man showing off: name a musical style and he could bend it to his own ends. Hence the US-only Delirious, a kind of dry-run for Let\u2019s Go Crazy, with its roots in 50s rock\u2019n\u2019roll. 38. Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad? (1979) One aspect of Prince\u2019s genius lay in his inability to be confined by musical genres. Early on in his career, Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad? offered dancefloor-focused R&amp;B that was influenced by both AOR and the emergent new wave, and concluded with a startling display of guitar pyrotechnics. 37. Soft and Wet (1978) Released at the height of disco, Soft and Wet\u2019s skeletal, off-kilter synth funk \u2013 complete with jazzy inflections \u2013 sounded like it came from another planet to the rest of the US chart. A minor hit, it quietly announced the arrival of a unique and uniquely unbiddable talent, so obsessed with sex he mentions his penis in the opening line. 36. Let\u2019s Work (1981) It\u2019s all about the 12in mix. Not content with merely extending an album track for the dancefloor, Prince went to town, completely overhauling Let\u2019s Work, interpolating sections of Controversy\u2019s title track and Annie Christian, enhancing the song\u2019s sweaty urgency with new vocals and keyboards, demonstrating a meticulous attention to detail where lesser artists would have expended no effort at all. 35. The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (1994) It is incredible that The Most Beautiful Girl in The World is Prince\u2019s only UK No 1, given the singles that preceded it. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a deft homage to the super-soft 70s soul of the Delfonics and the Stylistics, both of whom he subsequently covered. 34. 7 (1992) If you want evidence of Prince\u2019s unique, almost mystical, abilities, 7 is an intriguing place to start. At heart, the song is a rousing acoustic campfire singalong with lyrics of a spiritual bent, albeit a fairly baffling one. Deeply unpromising on paper, he somehow makes it work to striking effect, spooning on the harmonies and vintage sitar effects. 33. Black Sweat (2006) The problem with Prince\u2019s wilderness years wasn\u2019t a decline in talent, but a fatal lack of focus. The minimal funk of Kiss reimagined for the 00s, Black Sweat was evidence that Prince was marshalling his abilities once more. It wasn\u2019t up to his 80s standards, but it was close enough to pass muster. 32. Screwdriver (2013) Later included on Hit n Run Phase Two, Screwdriver is the rawest single of Prince\u2019s career, its overloaded, ragged sound verging on garage rock, or at least Prince\u2019s take on the genre. In fact, your average garage-rock band couldn\u2019t reel off remarkable solos the way he does throughout. 31. U Got the Look (1987) Of all the artists on whom Prince bestowed his star-making qualities, the least likely was Scottish MOR singer Sheena Easton, recast on U Got the Look as a snarling sexual predator. The song itself is a little lumpy by Prince\u2019s 80s standards, but not without a weird charm, embodied by its fake sportscaster announcements: \u201cBoy v girl in the World Series of love\u201d. 30. I Wish U Heaven (1988) Prince was fond of describing Lovesexy as a gospel album, but that\u2019s not a term you would use to describes the music on I Wish U Heaven: a thumping, tom-tom heavy beat, thick, chugging guitars, Prince\u2019s vocal floating beatifically above in a cloud of electronics. The lyrics could be about God, or a lover. Either way, it\u2019s a strange and lovely single. 29. America (1985) Another single arguably best heard in its 12in version, which in America\u2019s case lasts for nearly 22 minutes of frantic, paranoid acid funk, Hendrix-y soloing and claustrophobic harmonies. The darkness of Vietnam-damaged late-60s US psych recast for the Reagan years. 28. Dirty Mind (1980) Startling, audacious and filthy from soup to nuts, the Dirty Mind album was Prince\u2019s first masterpiece. Its melding of funk and rock and gleeful nose-thumbing at pop\u2019s standard racial boundaries was Sly Stone-esque, but updated for the 80s. The razor-sharp robot funk of its title track was the perfect calling card: no one else sounded like this. 27. My Name Is Prince (1992) The grip he had once exerted over the public slipping, you can see why Prince felt the need to reassert his authority in 1992. My Name Is Prince did it in style. Its intro listed his hits, its lyric switched between proclaiming himself divinely chosen and fretting about judgment day, and its music dealt in heavy breakbeats and noise that suggested he had been listening to Public Enemy. 26. Take Me With U (1985) The influence of musical consiglieres Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman started drawing Prince towards the sound of 60s psychedelia on the Purple Rain soundtrack. You can hear the first signs on Take Me With U, a gorgeous, carefree song enveloped by a groggy string arrangement \u2013 written by Coleman \u2013 that never quite drifts in the direction you expect. 25. Guitar (2007) Planet Earth wasn\u2019t the best of his latterday albums, but its standout track was among his best his latterday singles, an infectious glam stomp with a typically witty kiss-off lyric: \u201cI love you baby and I wish you well, I\u2019ll write you a letter when I learn how to spell\u201d. 24. I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man (1987) A return to the pop-rock territory of Little Red Corvette and 1980\u2019s When You Were Mine, I Could Never Take the Place Of Your Man is straightforward compared with a lot of the material on Sign o\u2019 the Times, its lyrical conceit notwithstanding, but it\u2019s a perfect example of Prince\u2019s songwriting craft. 23. Gotta Stop (Messin\u2019 About) (1981) Perhaps only Prince in 1981 would think a song about voyeurism and compulsive masturbation was just the thing to break him in the UK. Never released as a single in the US, it unsurprisingly wasn\u2019t a hit, but that\u2019s no reflection on its thrilling, wildly idiosyncratic staccato funk. 22. I Would Die For U (1984) More personal myth-making \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not a woman, I\u2019m not a man, I am something that you\u2019ll never understand\u201d \u2013 on a single where the indelible chorus masks a genuinely odd production: an unsettling stop-start rhythm that precludes dancing; rattling, incessant hi-hat perplexingly loud in the mix. Still, he knew what he was doing \u2013 it worked. 21. Money Don\u2019t Matter 2 Night (1992) Co-written with Rosie Gaines, its commercial chances in the US scuppered by a Spike Lee-directed video that MTV deemed too political and refused to show, Money Don\u2019t Matter 2 Night is a fantastic song, the smoothness of its sound and delivery masking a punchy, politically engaged lyric that takes in both consumerism and Operation Desert Storm. 20. Controversy (1981) Effectively early 80s Prince\u2019s manifesto \u2013 \u201cI wish there was no black and white, I wish there were no rules\u201d \u2013 Controversy also addressed the furore caused by Dirty Mind\u2019s songs about troilism and incest with a blithe shrug and featured a bit of the Lord\u2019s Prayer for good measure. The music, meanwhile, is awesome: tight, funky, fluently melodic. 19. Girls &amp; Boys (1986) Bafflingly unreleased as a single in the US, much to chagrin of some members of the Revolution, Girls and Boys returned Prince to appealingly tough funk, albeit decorated with weird production flourishes \u2013 honking duck-call synths \u2013 and lyrics that spike the mood of sultry eroticism with wit: \u201cShe had the cutest ass he\u2019d ever seen \u2013 but he did too, they were meant to be\u201d. 18. Cream (1991) T Rex never broke the US, but Prince was clearly a fan and never more so than on this glorious, loving homage to Get It On, complete with lyrical echoes (the object of Prince\u2019s affections is \u201cfilthy-cute\u201d as opposed to \u201cdirty-sweet\u201d). Never given to underestimating his own importance, Marc Bolan would doubtless have adored it. 17. Baltimore (2015) Prince\u2019s death came amid suggestions he was in the grip of another artistic renaissance. Baltimore was strong evidence: inspired by Black Lives Matter, lyrically angry and confrontational in a way that was unlike his previous political work, it was also blessed with an elegant melody and striking string arrangement. 16. Pop Life (1985) The brand of psychedelia found on 1985\u2019s Around The World In A Day never sounded retro or like a pastiche. For all Pop Life\u2019s backwards tapes and melodic nods in the direction of the Beatles, it was resolutely a product of the mid-80s, more evidence of Prince\u2019s ability to not merely absorb influences but recast them in his own image. 15 Let\u2019s Go Crazy (1984) The emotional flipside of the eerie, troubled When Doves Cry, Let\u2019s Go Crazy can barely contain itself. One of the greatest intros of the 80s \u2013 \u201cDearly beloved \u2026\u201d \u2013 leads into a relentless rhythmic clatter, explosions of metal guitar, raw-throated exhortations to party and utterly bizarre lyrics: \u201cLet\u2019s look for the purple banana\u201d; \u201cPills and thrills and daffodils can kill\u201d. A joy from start to finish. 14. Head (1980) The sound of a libido gone berserk, Head is both irresistible and insane, a falsetto-voiced song about \u2013 wait for it \u2013 a virginal bride-to-be en route to her wedding, who bumps into Prince and is overwhelmed by the desire to fellate him. It should be ridiculous, but its raw funk groove is utterly compelling; Prince\u2019s alchemical powers in full effect. 13. Alphabet St (1988) 1988\u2019s Lovesexy was received coolly on release, which tells you more about the standard of the Prince albums that preceded it than its quality. In reality, it\u2019s the last unequivocally superb album he made, while its lead single is a delight: an explosion of stop-start funk, popping bass and \u2013 in its full-length version \u2013 rapping from his new female foil Cat Glover. 12. Little Red Corvette (1983) Prince at his most unrepentantly commercial. If MTV and US rock radio wouldn\u2019t play black soul artists, then here was a black soul artist who could make pop-rock singles of a calibre they couldn\u2019t ignore. It was his biggest hit to date, censors apparently missing a reference to its heroine\u2019s pocketful of condoms (\u201csome of them used\u201d) in the second verse. 11. Sexy MF (1992) Boasting the kind of lyric his subsequent conversion to the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses would preclude, Sexy MF offers up a JB\u2019s-ish groove that\u2019s simultaneously raw and tightly controlled, a chorus punctuated by the kind of lip-smacking noise also featured on Kiss and its author on superb priapic form: \u201cI got wet dreams comin\u2019 out my ears!\u201d 10. If I Was Your Girlfriend (1987) A dark, sparse crawl of a song, alternately sexy, pained and weirdly unsettling, If I Was Your Girlfriend played with ideas of gender (the androgynous sped-up vocal was credited to his female alter-ego Camille, a name under which he initially intended to release a whole album) that are commonplace now, but were uncharted territory for mainstream black music 30 years ago. 9. I Wanna Be Your Lover (1979) Prince\u2019s first truly spectacular single \u2013 and first US hit \u2013 I Wanna Be Your Lover was a fabulous, effortless-sounding song. The sound bore the influence of Chic in its scratchy, Nile Rodgers-ish guitar, while its synth-heavy arrangement presciently suggested what the post-disco future would sound like. 8. Mountains (1986) A last outing for Prince\u2019s unique contemporary take on psychedelia: an addictive, dizzying wash of sound \u2013 rumbling drums (possibly influenced by Kate Bush\u2019s Running Up That Hill), synths, brass, rolling piano \u2013 topped with a falsetto vocal. The horn breakdown 30 seconds from the end is particularly glorious. 7. Sign o\u2019 the Times (1987) Prince fired his backing band the Revolution during the making of Sign o\u2019 the Times: a bad move in retrospect, but initially at least his genius seemed unaffected. The title track is brilliantly stark: Aids, the Challenger space shuttle disaster and the crack epidemic co-mingled in a bleak state-of-the-nation address. If Prince was the Sly Stone of the 80s, this was his There\u2019s a Riot Goin\u2019 On. 6. Purple Rain (1984) Originally a 10-minute-long country and western song intended for Stevie Nicks (who found it \u201ctoo much\u201d), Purple Rain was transformed into an epic power ballad during a six-hour rehearsal and recorded onstage at Minneapolis\u2019 First Avenue club to astonishing, heart-stopping effect. Its elegiac tone makes it fitting that it was the last song Prince played live. 5. 1999 (1982) 1999 is so familiar, it\u2019s easy to forget what a weird idea for a hit single it was: a party-starting P-Funk-y anthem about a vision of imminent apocalypse. Perhaps its lyrics chimed with the fear and paranoia engendered by the escalating cold war. More likely, it was a huge crossover smash because it\u2019s an incredible, impossibly assured piece of music. 4. Gett Off (1991) Prince\u2019s early 90s albums were nowhere near as consistent as his 80s work, but initially at least, he could still be relied upon to come up with stunning singles. From its opening scream to its ferocious concluding guitar solo, Gett Off is prime-quality Prince: funny, lubricious, preposterously funky, every bit the equal of his best work. 3. Raspberry Beret (1985) Compared with everything else happening in pop in the nadir year of 1985, Raspberry Beret was in a different league. It represented the pinnacle of Prince\u2019s psychedelic phase: another of Coleman\u2019s superbly woozy string arrangements, a song so perfect and simple it had a kind of instant familiarity, as if you had known it for years on first listen. 2. Kiss (1986) By 1986, Prince was peerless, so far ahead of everyone else in contemporary pop it was almost laughable. Kiss was all the evidence you needed. It repeated When Doves Cry\u2019s hugely impressive trick of conjuring up funk without a bassline, and added perhaps the most indelible chorus of his career and a vocal that turns into an astonishing lust-racked scream at 3min 20sec. 1. When Doves Cry (1984) Again, the familiarity of Prince\u2019s most famous song tends to obscure what an audacious and daring piece of music it is. Everyone knows that funk is utterly rooted in the drums and the bass. When Doves Cry \u2013 the biggest-selling single of 1984 \u2013 insouciantly turns that on its head. It originally had a bassline, but Prince thought it sounded \u201ctoo conventional\u201d and removed it, leaving only a sparse framework of drums and synth. For a song that inexorably propels people to the dancefloor \u2013 whether at a hip club or a wedding reception \u2013 it\u2019s remarkably downcast. Played in an minor key, its lyrics are alternately desolate, soul-searching and just weird: \u201cAnimals strike curious poses\u201d. Experimental but multi-million-selling, it\u2019s a work of era-transcending genius.",

      "bodyText": "The pages of Hollywood history are littered with failed attempts to propel movies towards box office and critical success. To pinpoint the basic construct of a film that is likely to appeal to audiences and critics alike is a virtually impossible task. Just ask the Disney executives who chose to remove the \u201cof Mars\u201d suffix from the big-budget 2012 adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs\u2019 classic planetary romance novel John Carter of Mars, (ostensibly because previous movies mentioning the red planet had bombed), only to see a perfectly decent fantasy flick lose more than $200m at the box office. Or the executives who felt Ridley Scott\u2019s 1982 sci-fi masterpiece, Blade Runner, was so confusing that it needed a tacked-on happy ending and Harrison Ford voiceover to smooth away all those jagged edges. The result was a movie that languished in critical purgatory for a decade until Scott released his seminal director\u2019s cut in 1992.

It\u2019s fair to ask why audiences have failed to get turned on by advance publicity. Trailers showing the return of Linda Hamilton\u2019s Sarah Connor, now protecting a new protege (Natalia Reyes\u2019 Dani Ramos) from termination by sophisticated machines from the future, have been relatively well received. Perhaps audiences have simply turned out too many times to catch previous sequels \u2013 the middling to dreadful Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, Terminator Salvation and Terminator Genisys \u2013 and found themselves leaving disappointed. Perhaps Cameron\u2019s cache as a hands-on producer has been damaged by the lukewarm response to Robert Rodriguez\u2019s Alita: Battle Angel, another movie the Avatar film-maker would originally have been expected to direct himself? An even more unpalatable prospect is that it is possible Dark Fate is suffering from the kind of misogynist backlash that affected the 2016 Ghostbusters remake. Dark Fate is almost as heavily focused on female protagonists, with everyone\u2019s new favourite sci-fi queen Mackenzie Davis also joining the cast as a human with cyborg implants who has been sent from the future to protect Dani. There has been the usual vile response from sexist trolls in the wake of Paramount publishing images of its three female stars front and centre on the posters, even if such predictably myopic antipathy hasn\u2019t made the kind of headlines that Ghostbusters or Star Wars: The Last Jedi did in similar circumstances.

Who rules the country when the mainlines of its communications are controlled by extreme and malevolent owners, whose determination to take the UK out of Europe has become a demonstration of their power for its own sake? The ache of loss all through Radice\u2019s book is matched by a hardheaded appraisal of the failure of his breed of pro-Europeans to reach the people \u2013 but he ends with a conviction that the next generation will seek to rejoin. It must be so because we are inextricably tied to Europe. If he\u2019s right about this indelible connection, the Yellowhammer warning is only a glimpse of immediate inconveniences: it doesn\u2019t begin to spell out the long downward drag on the country\u2019s fortunes. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>An end to the throwaway society is in sight. From boosting recycled plastic in shower gel bottles to creating easily removed labels from packs to aid recycling, manufacturers are looking to reduce the environmental impacts of their products.</p> <p>Where once elaborate, heavyweight packaging was synonymous with quality and desirability, today consumers are demanding that their products are shipped in sustainable, lightweight and recyclable formats. Sustainable packaging is on the rise and manufacturers are stripping down packs and improving recyclability.</p> <p>\u201cThe world of packaging has never moved so fast,\u201d says Colin Zenger, a member of the team responsible for sustainable packaging for Henkel\u2019s laundry and homecare products. \u201cWe see a trend to recycling \u2013 there\u2019s more recycled content going into packaging and we see a huge improvement in smart design.\u201d</p> <p>Consumer goods companies are redesigning existing packaging and making sure new designs are environmentally friendly. One widely used strategy is \u201clightweighting\u201d \u2013 reducing the size and weight of packaging to make the products lighter to transport, thus lowering the carbon footprint of shipping. Henkel has reduced the thickness of the metal container for its Taft hairspray, saving more than 15% of the material and water used in production. The company says the redesign saves up to 3,500 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions and 900,000 cubic metres of water every year.</p> <p>The move to lightweight packaging has also led some companies to replace glass containers with lighter plastic ones. Some in the packaging industry argue that plastic has played a part in sustainability by helping preserve products from decay, while also being light and flexible. But there has been a strong focus on the devastating impacts of single-use plastics, as plastic waste finds its way into oceans. This has spurred consumer goods companies to reduce their use of plastic packaging and make it more recyclable.</p> <p>Henkel has redesigned the spray pump for some of its cleaning products so that it uses less plastic. This has saved more than 450 metric tonnes of plastic materials a year, which translates into a saving of 900 metric tonnes of crude oil.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c15bfce71a893a75767d8b10c19fab069eab19cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c15bfce71a893a75767d8b10c19fab069eab19cf/0_0_8141_4884/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laptop running a software tool called EasyD4R\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henkel\u2019s software tool EasyD4R tells product designers how their proposed packaging can be recycled</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tobias Ebert/Henkel/Henkel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While some of these changes may seem like relatively small steps given the scale of the environmental crisis threatening the planet, Zenger argues that this gradual approach will make a big difference over time. \u201cThose small changes really have a high impact,\u201d he says. He gives the example of plastic sleeves on bottles that carry information about recycling. The company has started putting perforations on the sleeves, so they can easily be taken off and separated, which aids recycling.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Henkel has created, together with partners, a new colourant for black bottles. Conventionally, black-coloured plastic hinders the sorting process in recycling plants as scanners that identify various types of plastics cannot detect the material accurately. Henkel\u2019s new black colourant allows scanners to identify the material correctly. \u201cIt\u2019s a small change \u2013 the consumer doesn\u2019t even realise it when they look at a black bottle \u2013 but this has a huge impact on recyclability,\u201d says Zenger.</p> <p>Building recyclability into product design from the outset is essential to improving sustainability. To aid this, Henkel has created a software tool called EasyD4R that tells product designers how their proposed packaging can be recycled. The designer specifies the type of packaging they want to create, for instance a PET bottle, then inputs the data into the software \u2013 the weight and proportions of the components, the base materials and details for the label and the lid or closure system. The EasyD4R evaluation tool tells the product designer how much of the packaging can be recycled and also the likely quality of the recycled material that will be produced. The tool uses criteria from sources such as Plastics Recyclers Europe and has been endorsed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Environmental, Safety and Energy Technology.</p> <p>\u201cThe good thing about the tool is that it is so easy and quick to use \u2013it is possible to do multiple assessments in a short time and try out different options,\u201d says Zenger. \u201cIt can be used for our existing packaging as well as for new developments. When clicking the options, the result is immediately visible.\u201d</p> <p>Launched at the end of July, EasyD4R is publicly available for everyone who is interested and has been downloaded more than 600 times.</p> <p>\u201cLightweighting\u201d, incorporating recycled plastic, and embedding recycling at the product design stage should go some way to dealing with the mountain of packaging waste produced each year. Every European produces an average of <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Packaging_waste_statistics\" rel=\"nofollow\">170kg</a> in packaging waste each year, varying from 55kg per inhabitant of Croatia to 221kg for every German. Some 41% of this packaging is paper and cardboard, while plastic accounts for 19%, glass for 19%, wood for 16% and metal for 5%</p> <p>Manufacturers are turning their talents at innovation to creating sustainable packaging. Henkel aims to have 100% of its consumer packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025 and the proportion of recycled plastic in European consumer goods packaging should increase to 35%. Over the next decade, the environmental footprint of the consumer society will get considerably smaller.</p> <p><em>Find out how Henkel is moving towards a circular economy with <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2UOvXNY\" rel=\"nofollow\">sustainable packaging</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "An end to the throwaway society is in sight. From boosting recycled plastic in shower gel bottles to creating easily removed labels from packs to aid recycling, manufacturers are looking to reduce the environmental impacts of their products. Where once elaborate, heavyweight packaging was synonymous with quality and desirability, today consumers are demanding that their products are shipped in sustainable, lightweight and recyclable formats. Sustainable packaging is on the rise and manufacturers are stripping down packs and improving recyclability. \u201cThe world of packaging has never moved so fast,\u201d says Colin Zenger, a member of the team responsible for sustainable packaging for Henkel\u2019s laundry and homecare products. \u201cWe see a trend to recycling \u2013 there\u2019s more recycled content going into packaging and we see a huge improvement in smart design.\u201d Consumer goods companies are redesigning existing packaging and making sure new designs are environmentally friendly. One widely used strategy is \u201clightweighting\u201d \u2013 reducing the size and weight of packaging to make the products lighter to transport, thus lowering the carbon footprint of shipping. Henkel has reduced the thickness of the metal container for its Taft hairspray, saving more than 15% of the material and water used in production. The company says the redesign saves up to 3,500 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions and 900,000 cubic metres of water every year. The move to lightweight packaging has also led some companies to replace glass containers with lighter plastic ones. Some in the packaging industry argue that plastic has played a part in sustainability by helping preserve products from decay, while also being light and flexible. But there has been a strong focus on the devastating impacts of single-use plastics, as plastic waste finds its way into oceans. This has spurred consumer goods companies to reduce their use of plastic packaging and make it more recyclable. Henkel has redesigned the spray pump for some of its cleaning products so that it uses less plastic. This has saved more than 450 metric tonnes of plastic materials a year, which translates into a saving of 900 metric tonnes of crude oil. While some of these changes may seem like relatively small steps given the scale of the environmental crisis threatening the planet, Zenger argues that this gradual approach will make a big difference over time. \u201cThose small changes really have a high impact,\u201d he says. He gives the example of plastic sleeves on bottles that carry information about recycling. The company has started putting perforations on the sleeves, so they can easily be taken off and separated, which aids recycling. Meanwhile, Henkel has created, together with partners, a new colourant for black bottles. Conventionally, black-coloured plastic hinders the sorting process in recycling plants as scanners that identify various types of plastics cannot detect the material accurately. Henkel\u2019s new black colourant allows scanners to identify the material correctly. \u201cIt\u2019s a small change \u2013 the consumer doesn\u2019t even realise it when they look at a black bottle \u2013 but this has a huge impact on recyclability,\u201d says Zenger. Building recyclability into product design from the outset is essential to improving sustainability. To aid this, Henkel has created a software tool called EasyD4R that tells product designers how their proposed packaging can be recycled. The designer specifies the type of packaging they want to create, for instance a PET bottle, then inputs the data into the software \u2013 the weight and proportions of the components, the base materials and details for the label and the lid or closure system. The EasyD4R evaluation tool tells the product designer how much of the packaging can be recycled and also the likely quality of the recycled material that will be produced. The tool uses criteria from sources such as Plastics Recyclers Europe and has been endorsed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Environmental, Safety and Energy Technology. \u201cThe good thing about the tool is that it is so easy and quick to use \u2013it is possible to do multiple assessments in a short time and try out different options,\u201d says Zenger. \u201cIt can be used for our existing packaging as well as for new developments. When clicking the options, the result is immediately visible.\u201d Launched at the end of July, EasyD4R is publicly available for everyone who is interested and has been downloaded more than 600 times. \u201cLightweighting\u201d, incorporating recycled plastic, and embedding recycling at the product design stage should go some way to dealing with the mountain of packaging waste produced each year. Every European produces an average of 170kg in packaging waste each year, varying from 55kg per inhabitant of Croatia to 221kg for every German. Some 41% of this packaging is paper and cardboard, while plastic accounts for 19%, glass for 19%, wood for 16% and metal for 5% Manufacturers are turning their talents at innovation to creating sustainable packaging. Henkel aims to have 100% of its consumer packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025 and the proportion of recycled plastic in European consumer goods packaging should increase to 35%. Over the next decade, the environmental footprint of the consumer society will get considerably smaller. Find out how Henkel is moving towards a circular economy with sustainable packaging",

The main thrust of Keynes\u2019s argument makes sense: with each gain in productivity we could have worked less, enjoyed more leisure and let our machines take on more of the hard graft.

      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank has announced a fresh stimulus package in an attempt to prevent the fragile eurozone economy from grinding to a halt, with an interest rate cut and plans to pump \u20ac20bn (\u00a319bn) a month into the financial markets. In one of his final acts in his ECB presidency, before Christine Lagarde takes charge in November, Mario Draghi said governments across the eurozone needed to take greater steps to reboot growth by ramping up public spending or cutting taxes. In a thinly veiled rebuke to Germany, which has among the strongest government finances in the world, Draghi said that eurozone nations with solid finances had to take swift steps to support growth by loosening their purse strings. After years of support from the central bank to sustain growth in the decade since the financial crisis, he said: \u201cNow it\u2019s high time I think for the fiscal policy to take charge. In view of the weakening economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risks, governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timely manner.\u201d Draghi\u2019s comments came as the ECB announced it would step in to support the 19-nation currency bloc by revamping its quantitative easing (QE) programme of bond buying. Starting from November, the central bank will buy \u20ac20bn of bonds a month from commercial banks in an attempt to inject more money into the economy. The move restarts a programme paused by the ECB in December after the purchase of \u20ac2.6tn of bonds since first use of QE in 2015. The ECB also said it would cut its deposit rate \u2013 the interest paid to commercial banks when they place funds with the central bank \u2013 by 0.1 percentage points to a new all-time low of -0.5%, meaning banks would incur charges on any balances they kept there. Negative interest rates are meant to encourage banks to lend to consumers and businesses, rather than park their money with the ECB. The stimulus package comes as the eurozone economy falters alongside a broader global economic slowdown that has been triggered by rising trade protectionism and the US-China trade war. Factory output has slumped in response to diminishing international trade volumes as Washington and Beijing have imposed punitive tariffs on each other\u2019s goods, while business investment has fallen against the uncertain political backdrop. Eurozone growth fell to 0.2% in the second quarter of 2019, from 0.4% in the first three months of the year, while some economies, including those of Italy and Germany, are flirting with recession. Unveiling the stimulus package to avert a deeper slowdown, Draghi said: \u201cThe package is quite powerful, both in the short term but also in the long run.\u201d The central bank said its QE programme would remain in place for as long as necessary to reinforce its impact. The outgoing president of the ECB said he expected interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until inflation accelerated across the eurozone. While the ECB has a target for inflation of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, inflation has remained muted amid weaker economic growth. The ECB\u2019s support for the eurozone economy comes at a tense political moment as Donald Trump attempts to apply pressure on the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates as the American economy falters. In critical comments less than an hour after the ECB decision, Trump used a tweet to attack the Fed for its lack of action. \u201cEuropean Central Bank, acting quickly, Cuts Rates 10 Basis Points. They are trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports.... And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!\u201d Trump has also previously been critical of the ECB for supporting the eurozone economy, arguing that it would be detrimental to US interests. The Fed cut interest rates in July for the first time in more than a decade, signalling at the time a readiness to provide more support to the US economy if necessary. The euro initially fell agains the US dollar after the ECB announcement before rallying by about 0.6% on the American currency to trade at $1.1073.",

      "body": "<p>Before bromance, there was Midnight Cowboy. Brama? Bragedy? This movie \u2013 on rerelease for its 50th anniversary \u2013 is about two men finding friendship in the desolate common cause of their loneliness. It was adapted by screenwriter Waldo Salt from the novel by James Leo Herlihy, and the original author\u2019s friendship with Tennessee Williams shows up faintly as an influence in the film\u2019s depiction of vulnerable small-town boys in the big city. The director was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jul/26/guardianobituaries.filmnews\">John Schlesinger</a> \u2013 an Englishman who brought the kitchen-sink realism and hopeless yearning of earlier movies such as Billy Liar to Midnight Cowboy\u2019s domestic scenes of our two sad heroes squabbling in their grimy New York squat, quarrelling over the cooking and fantasising about riches and relaxing in the Florida sun.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000685/\">Jon Voight</a> plays Joe Buck, a pretty young guy with a poignantly open and trusting face who is kicking the Texas dust off his cowboy boots and heading for New York City on the bus, leaving behind sad memories \u2013 which return as traumatised flashback-fragments \u2013 of being brought up by his grandma, a lost love, small-town spite and apparently rape, of both his girlfriend and Joe himself.</p> <p>With heartbreaking naivety, Joe figures he can be a handsome gigolo stud for rich Park Avenue ladies, and duly sets up in a flophouse Manhattan hotel room, putting an aspirational picture of Paul Newman up on the wall (apparently from his movie, Hud). There\u2019s a view over Times Square, which in those days was the epitome of peep-show squalor. Nowadays, a hotel room with that view would be way out of Joe\u2019s price range, and, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/jul/14/french-connection\">The French Connection</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/09/taxi-driver-review-scorseses-sleaze-is-still-the-bees-knees\">Taxi Driver</a>, Midnight Cowboy is richly evocative of New York\u2019s vanished porno sleaze.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI-KezdGj0E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qI-KezdGj0E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Poor Joe is soon scammed by everyone. A prospective sugar mommy (played by Sylvia Miles) cons him out of 20 bucks, and Joe realises that the only paying customers are other men in the darkness of movie theatres, furtive acts to the ironically appropriate accompaniment of sci-fi trauma on the big screen. Soon, Joe finds that his only friend is the fast-talking lowlife conman Ratso who had been one of the many people who had suckered him, played with an array of arch mannerisms by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/dustinhoffman\">Dustin Hoffman</a>. Ratso finds Joe a place to live and soon they are bickering like a tragic married couple with the bigoted language of the era, Ratso knocking Joe\u2019s ersatz-cowboy image: \u201cThat\u2019s faggot stuff. It\u2019s strictly for fags\u201d; \u201cJohn Wayne? You\u2019re telling me he\u2019s a fag?\u201d</p> <p>I shiver every time I see the \u201cblood donation\u201d scene, with desperate Joe\u2019s paid-for blood drifting and clouding in the plastic bag. Is that bag going to split? And there\u2019s a frisson of pure skin-crawling horror when Joe is tricked by Ratso into going to see a shadowy individual called O\u2019Daniel who will supposedly hook him up with wealthy women. This creepy man (unforgettably played by John McGiver) lives in a scuzzy room \u2013 one of so many in this film \u2013 and Joe\u2019s growing alarm at his excitable behaviour climaxes when O\u2019Daniel unveils a flashing neon Jesus next to the lavatory and invites him to \u201cpray\u201d with him. It is a kind of rape scene or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo</a> scene in itself \u2013 and a reminder of how Midnight Cowboy is unexpectedly gendered. All of Joe\u2019s humiliations and calamities are the things that usually happen to women.</p> <p>In the end, Midnight Cowboy is a film about homelessness. Ratso and Joe are always on the brink of living on the streets; effectively they are living on the streets, given that their derelict building is like a cave. Schlesinger\u2019s camera discovers everywhere something rarely glimpsed in Hollywood movies \u2013 poverty. And their one chance at escaping this poverty, an invitation to a Warholesque party of smug hipsters, has come because, without realising it, they\u2019ve come to look grotesque: the cowboy and the tramp.</p> <p>It is here that Joe gets a chance at getting paid for sex with a wealthy, beautiful woman \u2013 a great cameo for <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0882853/\">Brenda Vaccaro</a>.

      "bodyText": "Before bromance, there was Midnight Cowboy. Brama? Bragedy? This movie \u2013 on rerelease for its 50th anniversary \u2013 is about two men finding friendship in the desolate common cause of their loneliness. It was adapted by screenwriter Waldo Salt from the novel by James Leo Herlihy, and the original author\u2019s friendship with Tennessee Williams shows up faintly as an influence in the film\u2019s depiction of vulnerable small-town boys in the big city. The director was John Schlesinger \u2013 an Englishman who brought the kitchen-sink realism and hopeless yearning of earlier movies such as Billy Liar to Midnight Cowboy\u2019s domestic scenes of our two sad heroes squabbling in their grimy New York squat, quarrelling over the cooking and fantasising about riches and relaxing in the Florida sun. Jon Voight plays Joe Buck, a pretty young guy with a poignantly open and trusting face who is kicking the Texas dust off his cowboy boots and heading for New York City on the bus, leaving behind sad memories \u2013 which return as traumatised flashback-fragments \u2013 of being brought up by his grandma, a lost love, small-town spite and apparently rape, of both his girlfriend and Joe himself. With heartbreaking naivety, Joe figures he can be a handsome gigolo stud for rich Park Avenue ladies, and duly sets up in a flophouse Manhattan hotel room, putting an aspirational picture of Paul Newman up on the wall (apparently from his movie, Hud). There\u2019s a view over Times Square, which in those days was the epitome of peep-show squalor. Nowadays, a hotel room with that view would be way out of Joe\u2019s price range, and, like The French Connection and Taxi Driver, Midnight Cowboy is richly evocative of New York\u2019s vanished porno sleaze. Poor Joe is soon scammed by everyone. A prospective sugar mommy (played by Sylvia Miles) cons him out of 20 bucks, and Joe realises that the only paying customers are other men in the darkness of movie theatres, furtive acts to the ironically appropriate accompaniment of sci-fi trauma on the big screen. Soon, Joe finds that his only friend is the fast-talking lowlife conman Ratso who had been one of the many people who had suckered him, played with an array of arch mannerisms by Dustin Hoffman. Ratso finds Joe a place to live and soon they are bickering like a tragic married couple with the bigoted language of the era, Ratso knocking Joe\u2019s ersatz-cowboy image: \u201cThat\u2019s faggot stuff. It\u2019s strictly for fags\u201d; \u201cJohn Wayne? You\u2019re telling me he\u2019s a fag?\u201d I shiver every time I see the \u201cblood donation\u201d scene, with desperate Joe\u2019s paid-for blood drifting and clouding in the plastic bag. Is that bag going to split? And there\u2019s a frisson of pure skin-crawling horror when Joe is tricked by Ratso into going to see a shadowy individual called O\u2019Daniel who will supposedly hook him up with wealthy women. This creepy man (unforgettably played by John McGiver) lives in a scuzzy room \u2013 one of so many in this film \u2013 and Joe\u2019s growing alarm at his excitable behaviour climaxes when O\u2019Daniel unveils a flashing neon Jesus next to the lavatory and invites him to \u201cpray\u201d with him. It is a kind of rape scene or #MeToo scene in itself \u2013 and a reminder of how Midnight Cowboy is unexpectedly gendered. All of Joe\u2019s humiliations and calamities are the things that usually happen to women. In the end, Midnight Cowboy is a film about homelessness. Ratso and Joe are always on the brink of living on the streets; effectively they are living on the streets, given that their derelict building is like a cave. Schlesinger\u2019s camera discovers everywhere something rarely glimpsed in Hollywood movies \u2013 poverty. And their one chance at escaping this poverty, an invitation to a Warholesque party of smug hipsters, has come because, without realising it, they\u2019ve come to look grotesque: the cowboy and the tramp. It is here that Joe gets a chance at getting paid for sex with a wealthy, beautiful woman \u2013 a great cameo for Brenda Vaccaro. But of course it does not lead to the career that Joe fondly imagined in commercial sex with attractive older women (like Patricia Neal in Hud). His only real chance is robbing a trick who is paralysed with the kind of guilt and despair that Joe is learning to suppress. I am a little agnostic about Hoffman\u2019s mannered performance \u2013 especially as Voight\u2019s is so miraculously easy and light \u2013 and there are some uneasy nods to the zeitgeist: a rather unconvincing generic \u201cdemo\u201d with placards reading \u201cLiberate Freedom\u201d. But everything is delivered with such potency and force and the Harry Nilsson song Everybody\u2019s Talkin\u2019 is one of the most evocative of the age. \u2022 Midnight Cowboy is released in the UK on 13 September. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 September. The original mis-named Patricia Neal as Patricia Dean.",

Hoping that both chemicals would be of use in developing new medicines, he filed for patents and began to make contact with drug companies.</p> <p>His plan, he claimed, was to use the patents to prevent exploitation of the plants by governments and multinationals \u2013 and to help tribes sell their knowledge while establishing legal title to their heritage. Any money received, he said, would be shared with the tribes. But when it emerged that Gorinsky had not sought permission from local people to patent the plants \u2013 and that he also had no agreement in place to pay them for their knowledge \u2013 a massive row ensued.</p> <p>From being a human rights defender and a hero of the global environment movement, he was swiftly branded by politicians, scientists and environmentalists as a \u201cbio-pirate\u201d, out to exploit the knowledge of indigenous people for financial gain.</p> <p>The case had far wider implications, however, than the damage to Gorinsky\u2019s reputation. It helped to stoke mistrust between wealthy and developing countries that has soured many environmental negotiations, and it also fed into the UN\u2019s deliberations over what to do about the patenting of drugs derived from the knowledge of indigenous communities. That led to the 1992 Convention on Biodiversity, which essentially nationalised plant resources and forbade the patenting of organic ingredients by individuals.</p> <p>Gorinsky might have allowed himself to be wryly amused at the thought of becoming a villain whose actions needed to be reined in by that convention, for he had devoted much of his life to championing the rights of indigenous peoples. The son of Cesar Gorinsky, a Polish cattle rancher and gold prospector, and Nellie Melville, a half-Atorad tribeswoman, Gorinsky was born in Parubaru, in the far south of what was then British Guiana (now Guyana), close to the Brazilian border.</p> <p>In later years he recalled how even as a youngster he had been fascinated by the medical potential of the natural drugs and poisons found in the region\u2019s plants. His mother\u2019s tribe had been all but wiped out in the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/1918-pandemic-history.htm\" title=\"\">1918 flu pandemic</a>, and the survivors were adopted by the larger Wapishana group.

He then studied biology at Oxford University, going on to do a PhD at St Bartholomew\u2019s hospital medical college in London, where he researched the plants he had known as a child. He made a number of visits back to South America, where his family background ensured that he was welcomed into the local Wapishana communities to learn first-hand about the use of plants.

Worse, the Wapishana, among whom he had grown up, accused him of stealing their knowledge and, with the help of western environmentalists, contested both patents.</p> <p>Gorinsky was badly hurt. He had financed his research himself, taken no money and broken no laws, but had been accused of a serious breach of trust. His motives had been pure, he said, but he had been naive.

      "body": "<p>Over the years, Adult Swim has carved out a niche as a place of angry anarchy. It\u2019s a place where a sitcom\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrGrOK8oZG8\">opening credits</a> will stretch and warp until it becomes an orgy of murder. Where James Van Der Beek will be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzHn8f9cFEw\">taunted</a> by a nightmarish doppelg\u00e4nger. Where puppets slice other puppets up for ham.</p> <p>But it\u2019s also the home of Joe Pera Talks With You (now streaming on All4), which is the precise opposite of all that. Joe Pera Talks With You is quiet and still. It\u2019s a hushed little tone poem about small-town America. It never loses sight of its own sincerity. It\u2019s still odd, because it\u2019s an Adult Swim show, but it\u2019s about as good natured as anything you will ever watch. It\u2019s terrific.</p> <p>Pera \u2013 a 30-year-old comedian with the voice and mannerisms of someone three times his age \u2013 plays a fictional version of himself; a middle-school choir teacher living on Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. A single man who lives alone, he finds enormous pleasure in tiny things: iron, sheet music, the sound of liquid being poured from a large container into a smaller container. He\u2019s well liked by his local community, but he doesn\u2019t quite fit in. As such, he\u2019s found comfort in his own routines. He reads the announcements at church. He goes on an annual drive each autumn. He collects minerals.</p> <p>Another show would have painted Pera as a figure of fun, using his quirks as a weapon against him, but Joe Pera Talks With You has too much heart for that. The show is always on his side. When teenagers place a For Sale sign outside his home, and it looks for a moment like he\u2019ll honour the wishes of the strangers who make him an offer, you go through all the dips and turns of his dilemma with him. When he marvels at a spinning dessert display, seduced by the sweet delights but knowing that as an adult he has to make healthy choices \u2013 it\u2019s like you\u2019re seeing it for the first time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b9dd0df4f995e346a48347619ca36f0ccd79fe5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b9dd0df4f995e346a48347619ca36f0ccd79fe5/0_140_4125_2475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seduced by the sweet delights ...

Joe Pera talks With You.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Nowak/Adultswim</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each episode of Joe Pera Talks With You is 10 minutes long, which is just enough. We\u2019re introduced into his world, and we watch him impart some folky, home-spun wisdom on a certain topic, then we leave him as we found him.

      "bodyText": "Over the years, Adult Swim has carved out a niche as a place of angry anarchy. It\u2019s a place where a sitcom\u2019s opening credits will stretch and warp until it becomes an orgy of murder. Where James Van Der Beek will be taunted by a nightmarish doppelg\u00e4nger. Where puppets slice other puppets up for ham. But it\u2019s also the home of Joe Pera Talks With You (now streaming on All4), which is the precise opposite of all that. Joe Pera Talks With You is quiet and still. It\u2019s a hushed little tone poem about small-town America. It never loses sight of its own sincerity. It\u2019s still odd, because it\u2019s an Adult Swim show, but it\u2019s about as good natured as anything you will ever watch. It\u2019s terrific. Pera \u2013 a 30-year-old comedian with the voice and mannerisms of someone three times his age \u2013 plays a fictional version of himself; a middle-school choir teacher living on Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. A single man who lives alone, he finds enormous pleasure in tiny things: iron, sheet music, the sound of liquid being poured from a large container into a smaller container. He\u2019s well liked by his local community, but he doesn\u2019t quite fit in. As such, he\u2019s found comfort in his own routines. He reads the announcements at church. He goes on an annual drive each autumn. He collects minerals. Another show would have painted Pera as a figure of fun, using his quirks as a weapon against him, but Joe Pera Talks With You has too much heart for that. The show is always on his side. When teenagers place a For Sale sign outside his home, and it looks for a moment like he\u2019ll honour the wishes of the strangers who make him an offer, you go through all the dips and turns of his dilemma with him. When he marvels at a spinning dessert display, seduced by the sweet delights but knowing that as an adult he has to make healthy choices \u2013 it\u2019s like you\u2019re seeing it for the first time. Each episode of Joe Pera Talks With You is 10 minutes long, which is just enough. We\u2019re introduced into his world, and we watch him impart some folky, home-spun wisdom on a certain topic, then we leave him as we found him. There\u2019s only a veneer of an emotional arc \u2013 a lightly-drawn relationship with a colleague starts to burble up in later episodes \u2013 but even that feels unnecessary. Joe Pera as a character is an island, and the fun of watching it is feeling his own worldview slowly align to yours.

In 1964, as a 19-year-old, he won the British Youths Open Amateur Championship, after which he turned professional, having signed up as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sundridgeparkgolfclub.co.uk/the_button_boys\" title=\"\">Butten boy</a>\u201d to be given training at Sundridge Park golf club in Kent, where the businessman Ernest Butten had sponsored a residential school for young golfers under the tutelage of the former Open champion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/apr/05/guardianobituaries.golf\" title=\"\">Max Faulkner</a>. The school helped Barnes to develop his game and it also threw him into the orbit of Faulkner\u2019s daughter, Hilary, whom he married in 1968.</p> <p>In 1971 Barnes joined the Scottish PGA and subsequently played for Scotland in internationals, despite having represented England up to that point. His first European tour victory was at the 1972 Martini International, and over the next decade he became one of the most consistent of European golfers, winning seven titles in a five-year spell from 1974, including the Dutch, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian opens.</p> <p>It was in the midst of that excellent streak that he twice dispatched Nicklaus at the 1975 Ryder Cup at Laurel Valley. The first of the two wins came in the Sunday morning singles matches, when he beat the then 14-time major champion by the comfortable margin of 4&amp;2. Nicklaus had been scheduled to play someone else in the afternoon singles, but persuaded his captain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/arnold-palmer-obituaries\" title=\"\">Arnold Palmer</a>, to change the pairings so he could seek revenge \u2013 warning Barnes that he would not be allowed to win for a second time. The American began with two birdies, but his opponent saw him off again, albeit by the narrower margin of 2&amp;1.</p> <p>Barnes played 25 matches in six successive Ryder Cups, including three on his last appearance in 1979. Often in partnership with his friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/28/bernard-gallacher-golf-cardiac-arrest-defibrillator\" title=\"\">Bernard Gallacher</a>, he had a respectable record during an era when USA were dominant, winning 10, halving one and losing 14 of his encounters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d20b8ed551f5d3fcc964b7790d8268f9b858a4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d20b8ed551f5d3fcc964b7790d8268f9b858a4b/0_0_2798_2095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brian Barnes and his caddie, Jim Sullivan, at the PGA championship, Royal Birkdale, 1978.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brian Barnes and his caddie, Jim Sullivan, at the PGA championship, Royal Birkdale, 1978.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ANL/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His final European tour win came in the Tournament Players Championship at Dalmahoy in Scotland in 1981, by which time his drinking habits had started to take their toll.

      "bodyText": "The burning of the Amazon has caused alarm around the world, from the Vatican to the G7, and there are fears that unless the fires are stopped swiftly the forests could reach a point of no return in the loss of wildlife and biodiversity. Forest loss has also been happening in other areas of the world but has received a lower level of global attention. Africa is of particular concern. According to a report on the New York Declaration on Forests, signed in 2014 with the aim of halting deforestation globally by 2030, the new hotspots of increasing forest loss are in west Africa and the Congo basin. While the greatest losses of forests by area in the years 2014-18 occurred in tropical Latin America, the greatest rate of increase was in Africa, where deforestation rates leapt from less than 2m hectares a year on average from 2001 to 2013, to more than 4m a year from 2014 to 2018. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo rates of deforestation have doubled in the past five years. Charlotte Streck, co-founder and director of Climate Focus, the thinktank that coordinated the report from 25 forest organisations, said: \u201cDeforestation has increased rapidly in Africa, coming from a relatively low level to begin with, but it is rising very quickly but very quietly.\u201d Government policy is a key factor.

Daniel loved the Beatles.

Daniel thought it was hilarious, the sight of his brother covered in egg.</p> <p>Dan also loved the ideal of true love, if not the actuality. His former manager Jeff Tartakov told me that he was so excited when Melody Maker ran a review of one of his albums in the early 1990s \u2013 not because of the exposure, but because it had the heading Tell Laurie I Love Her. (Jeff incidentally is the unsung hero of this tragic tale: easily the man most responsible for Daniel\u2019s music not lying forgotten in some bargain basement \u2013 in Dan\u2019s own words as a \u201crejected unknown\u201d.) All of Dan\u2019s music up to that point had been designed with one goal: to win the heart of his one true love Laurie, the gravedigger\u2019s wife. It never happened, but then again it was never real.</p> <p>Dan could be dismissive and rude one moment, the next greet you with a massive bear hug as if nothing had happened. He was self-aware to the extent that his music took place despite his mental illness, not because of it: he referenced it for sure in his songs, but only inasmuch as he referenced everything going on around him in his myopic worldview.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a09b062422bebc0246dbe9096370f5602c177203\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a09b062422bebc0246dbe9096370f5602c177203/378_391_2992_3496/856.jpg\" alt=\"Kurt Cobain performing at the MTV Video Music awards in 1992, wearing his Daniel Johnston T-shirt.\" width=\"856\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kurt Cobain performing at the MTV Video Music awards in 1992, wearing his Daniel Johnston T-shirt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Micelotta/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPeople always talk about the myth of Daniel\u2019s genius,\u201d Jeff memorably remarked to me one time. \u201cWhat about the genius of Daniel\u2019s myth?\u201d</p> <p>Jeff had been staying with me in Brighton: on the same visit in 1993 he gave me Dan\u2019s Jeremiah the Innocent T-shirt, the only such item in Britain at the time. He told me to take great care of it. I did, but later I passed the shirt to another of his fans. We\u2019d been arguing at the time about his choice of clothes, and I told him he could only have it if he promised to wear it in public. Kurt Cobain was true to his promise and wore it on the front of Spin magazine and at corporate award ceremonies, leading to a surreal bidding war between Atlantic and Elektra Records as Dan answered calls from a mental hospital.</p> <p>Dan was childish. He cared deeply about his art, his music \u2013 but would travel from town to town, playing with pick-up bands arranged almost randomly. He didn\u2019t seem to care about sound quality or the like \u2013 he was famously heralded as \u201cthe father of lo-fi\u201d with his cassette recorder-recorded albums \u2013 knowing that the magic lies deeper than that, deeper within. He had a strange sense of proportion that kept him in check. \u201cWhen I was going to college my friends made me feel famous,\u201d Dan told me. \u201cI was so famous I was writin\u2019 all the time. We were having parties. I would show up and I was Number One celebrity. I\u2019ve never been as famous as when I first started out.</p> <p>\u201cI hope I could feel that famous again,\u201d he added wistfully, \u201cbecause when you think you\u2019re famous and you think you\u2019re great, you might just have a chance of being great.\u201d Sometimes all you need is a massive heart, wonderful songs and a naked vulnerability.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated on Thursday 12 September to correct an error \u2013 the frog image is called Jeremiah the Innocent, not Jebediah the Frog.</p>",

He had a great, albeit selective, memory. \u201cThis is fun, isn\u2019t it Dick?\u201d he would remark to his ever-patient brother as they searched out another store. \u201cI\u2019m having so much fun today.\u201d On one trip, his travelling troupe (Dan, Dick and his touring guitarist Brett Hartenbach) were fined nearly $1,400 by Jetstar in Japan for the extra weight incurred by Daniel\u2019s comics. Daniel loved the Beatles. He was so excited when he arrived in England to help promote Jeff Feuerzeig\u2019s wonderful 2005 documentary The Devil and Daniel Johnston: \u201cThank you England!\u201d he announced on stage. \u201cThank you so much for giving the world the Beatles.\u201d After the screening, Dan, his brother and I got egged by a passing car. Daniel thought it was hilarious, the sight of his brother covered in egg. Dan also loved the ideal of true love, if not the actuality. His former manager Jeff Tartakov told me that he was so excited when Melody Maker ran a review of one of his albums in the early 1990s \u2013 not because of the exposure, but because it had the heading Tell Laurie I Love Her. (Jeff incidentally is the unsung hero of this tragic tale: easily the man most responsible for Daniel\u2019s music not lying forgotten in some bargain basement \u2013 in Dan\u2019s own words as a \u201crejected unknown\u201d.) All of Dan\u2019s music up to that point had been designed with one goal: to win the heart of his one true love Laurie, the gravedigger\u2019s wife. It never happened, but then again it was never real. Dan could be dismissive and rude one moment, the next greet you with a massive bear hug as if nothing had happened. He was self-aware to the extent that his music took place despite his mental illness, not because of it: he referenced it for sure in his songs, but only inasmuch as he referenced everything going on around him in his myopic worldview. \u201cPeople always talk about the myth of Daniel\u2019s genius,\u201d Jeff memorably remarked to me one time. \u201cWhat about the genius of Daniel\u2019s myth?\u201d Jeff had been staying with me in Brighton: on the same visit in 1993 he gave me Dan\u2019s Jeremiah the Innocent T-shirt, the only such item in Britain at the time. He told me to take great care of it. I did, but later I passed the shirt to another of his fans. We\u2019d been arguing at the time about his choice of clothes, and I told him he could only have it if he promised to wear it in public. Kurt Cobain was true to his promise and wore it on the front of Spin magazine and at corporate award ceremonies, leading to a surreal bidding war between Atlantic and Elektra Records as Dan answered calls from a mental hospital. Dan was childish. He cared deeply about his art, his music \u2013 but would travel from town to town, playing with pick-up bands arranged almost randomly. He didn\u2019t seem to care about sound quality or the like \u2013 he was famously heralded as \u201cthe father of lo-fi\u201d with his cassette recorder-recorded albums \u2013 knowing that the magic lies deeper than that, deeper within. He had a strange sense of proportion that kept him in check. \u201cWhen I was going to college my friends made me feel famous,\u201d Dan told me. \u201cI was so famous I was writin\u2019 all the time. We were having parties. I would show up and I was Number One celebrity. I\u2019ve never been as famous as when I first started out. \u201cI hope I could feel that famous again,\u201d he added wistfully, \u201cbecause when you think you\u2019re famous and you think you\u2019re great, you might just have a chance of being great.\u201d Sometimes all you need is a massive heart, wonderful songs and a naked vulnerability. \u2022 This article was updated on Thursday 12 September to correct an error \u2013 the frog image is called Jeremiah the Innocent, not Jebediah the Frog.",

The Green MP Caroline Lucas, who unsuccessfully sought the information in parliament and then via a freedom of information (FOI) request, said it was \u201creckless and irresponsible\u201d for ministers to use this argument to withhold potentially vital facts from the public. The ruling, in which the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) argued there was \u201ca strong public interest\u201d in keeping the information secret, follows the release of documents outlining the government\u2019s planning assumptions for its no-deal Brexit preparation plan, called Operation Yellowhammer.

Charles Ilfrenord, pastor at the pink-walled New Haitian Mission Baptist church, said it would offer relief to the 45 Haitians, including two children, still camped there more than a week after being left homeless. \u201cWe need help,\u201d said Ilfrenord, whose church is now crowded with cardboard boxes, fans, plastic chairs and suitcases under a woodbeam roof. \u201cPeople come to the church to be safe. And now we have power.\u201d Some involved in the international aid effort acknowledge the daunting nature of managing a vast operation. Brian Wilson, team leader for Humanity First, said: \u201cYou\u2019re got a lot of really well-intentioned people, both nationally and internationally, coming here and it makes it really difficult to coordinate that volume of help.\u201d But others express concern about a lack of direction. Dwayne Strawn, an emergency responder trainer from the British Virgin Islands, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more that can be done, that should have been done, that should still be done. I\u2019m not quite sure what didn\u2019t connect. Based on the fact we had a similar disaster in the British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico two years ago, and in the recent past we\u2019ve had a bunch of hurricanes, I think our response should have been a little bit more coordinated and forthcoming.\u201d The official government death toll has risen to 50, but few aid workers on the ground believe that is anywhere close to reality. Strawn said: \u201cBased on the reports we have heard from people on the ground, it\u2019s going to be way, way more than what the government is reporting. We are ready for closer to thousands.\u201d Asked why the government figure is still so low, Strawn added: \u201cMaybe they\u2019re getting the wrong information. I heard somebody said that they don\u2019t want to send the wrong message in terms of tourism; nobody wants to come to a disaster. But I think the sooner we come to terms with what\u2019s happening here, the sooner we\u2019re going to clean it up and get people back here. It\u2019s paradise and we just have to give paradise a hand.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Eid this year was like no other. We could not even offer the obligatory sacrifice because of the total siege by India of Kashmir. When my son Yasir went to fetch bread in the morning and didn\u2019t return promptly, I started pacing with worry outside the house. What if the security forces manning every corner had roughed him up, or even worse? My fear is the fear of every single person living in shock in Kashmir and wondering \u201cWhat next?\u201d Eventually he returned, explaining that the delay was due to long queues at the only bakery open in the entire area. But unlike Yasir, my son Javaid has never returned. Nothing can make you used to the terror of nocturnal raids by security forces. It was 18 August 1990, and we were living in Srinagar, at the height of an uprising against the Indian occupation. In the early hours of the morning, a neighbour came to tell us that my son Javaid, only 16 years old, had been taken away by the National Security Guard \u2013 one of many paramilitary forces operated by the Indian government in the valley. At first I wasn\u2019t fearful, as I knew this was a case of mistaken identity. My son had never quarrelled with anyone, let alone been part of any armed uprising. As the day passed, my anxiety increased as efforts to trace him failed. I ran from one police station to another, from one known torture centre to another detention camp to be told, \u201cDo not worry, he will be released\u201d. He did not return. From 1997 until today, Javaid\u2019s file, along with those of all Kashmiri victims of armed forces in the India-administered region, has remained secret. Not a single permission has been granted by the central government to prosecute any official facing allegations of grave human rights abuses. They threatened me, they tried to buy me, they suggested I was a bad mother for neglecting my other children and for taking my infant daughter with me to wait endlessly in front of police stations and the courts, they spread rumours about my motives, they harassed me, they raised false charges against me \u2013 they wanted me to give up. But I never stopped asking \u201cWhere is my son?\u201d Between 8,000 and 10,000 Kashmiris have been victims of enforced disappearance. I was never a political person but the fire of my own suffering and the anguish of other parents prompted me to start the Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons (APDP). I started visiting the families of the disappeared in every part of Kashmir to listen, offer support and encourage action. Ours is not a conventional organisation of activists but a community of sufferers who share pain, support each other and live with hope that our disappeared children will be returned. From informal gatherings to hunger strikes in public, from vigils in parks to seminars at educational institutions in both Kashmir and India and visits to universities and the UN, we are seeking the answer to our questions \u2013 Where have you taken our sons? Where are our husbands? I am not a leader, I am a sufferer. I will not give up the hope of seeing my son, who has been disappeared for 29 years. But this is not my struggle alone. If the government assured me that Javaid would return today, I would say no. First bring back the disappeared sons and husbands of other Kashmiris. Bring Javaid last. We do not trust India. The oppression that has been inflicted upon us since the August lockdown of the region is not new \u2013 and yet there is something very different this time since the loss of autonomy for the state of Jammu and Kashmir. We have no way of communicating with each other, we have no way of knowing who is ill, who has been picked up by security forces, who has been injured or killed. There is no livelihood for the many who cannot go out to work. Many of the members of the APDP are poor and elderly women and we provide regular medical help to them: we no longer know what their needs are and whether they have essential medicines or not.

From \u201cWill I poop when I die?\u201d to \u201cCan I use bones from a human cremation as jewellery?\u201d, it gets down to the morbid questions we all have \u2013 asked by children unburdened by shame. \u201cThe kids make it clear that we\u2019re not being direct enough in how we talk about death,\u201d Doughty says. \u201cI think that a lot of adults never really got the kind of death education that they need.\u201d She compares the silence about death to the reticence around sex: \u201cMy parents weren\u2019t necessarily talking about it, but I was watching porn at my friend\u2019s house when I was nine because her older brother had it. There\u2019s always going to be these things slipping in somehow.\u201d</p> <p>To the uninitiated, Doughty\u2019s work, unsurprisingly, sounds a little morbid. She has written two other books about death: her 2014 memoir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/16/smoke-gets-in-your-eyes-caitlin-doughty-review-deaths-summer-coat-living-with-dying\">Smoke Gets in Your Eyes</a>, and 2018\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/21/with-the-end-in-mind-kathryn-mannix-from-here-to-eternity-caitlin-doughty-book-review\">From Here to Eternity</a>, about death rituals around the world.

It was not something she expected to become her life\u2019s work. \u201cI kind of thought it would be a cool story to tell at a dinner party when I\u2019m 45,\u201d she laughs. But she took to it quickly, and found her mission on the way.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I started to learn about the commodification of death and the death industry in the western world, I realised we had something taken from us as a culture,\u201d she says. For From Here to Eternity, she travelled the world to observe different cultures\u2019 death rituals; the book is both sensitive and light, and thoroughly researched, written by an author who genuinely wanted to learn from, not fetishise, other customs. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem in the US and the UK that we just suck our immigrant cultures up into our cookie-cutter, bland death rituals. Forcing them to leave behind rituals and ways of doing things that are really important to them,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Turning grief into healthy grief is not a disservice to the person who died, even if it was someone incredibly close to you</p> <footer> <cite>Caitlin Doughty</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2011, Doughty founded <a href=\"http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/\">The Order of the Good Death</a>, a \u201cdeath acceptance\u201d collective that aims to educate people on better ways to handle dying. From there, she started Ask a Mortician to answer people\u2019s questions about death. As well as the kookier queries, her videos also include \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGbI7zn2UV0\">Helping a Friend Through Grief</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WOyFErcTHU\">Overcoming Death Denial in Your Family</a>\u201d. She advocates for the family caring for the bodies of loved ones, and has found that \u201cpeople instinctively want to be more involved, they just need an expert to say go for it.\u201d In 2015 she opened <a href=\"http://www.undertakingla.com/\">Undertaking LA</a>, an \u201calternative\u201d funeral home in Los Angeles that focused on being more affordable and getting the family involved (a new branch is about to open).</p> <p>She has been building up to Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? for years, with videos such as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypxP3ciUv-Y\">It Gets Better, Morbid Kids!</a>\u201d While the idea might send shivers up some parents\u2019 spines, she says adults shouldn\u2019t shut down children\u2019s questions. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re terrified that something you say is going to set off some deep death fear in them. Say it honestly, tell them \u2018If something is bugging you, or you want to keep talking, I\u2019m always happy to talk to you about this\u2019,\u201d she says. She wishes more adults would give children information early on, so that when they inevitably encounter death, \u201cthey\u2019re already used to talking about it, used to the more fun, interesting, curious parts.\u201d She believes it\u2019s possible, through science and humour, to train the brain \u201cto see death as simultaneously very heavy and a source of great curiosity\u201d.</p> <p>As a child, Doughty learned about death violently when she saw another child fall in a shopping mall (\u201ca complete aberration\u201d). Afterwards, she developed OCD symptoms including tapping and compulsive spitting. \u201cMy brain was being invaded with the knowledge of death and the fact that people could be taken away from me at any moment and I couldn\u2019t control it. All I could control were these little rituals.\u201d</p> <p> Like Doughty, my early relationship with death also manifested through OCD. Once I learned that people could be taken away, I started trying to regain control through repetitive actions. That obsession has only intensified as I\u2019ve got older, but the work of Doughty and other death-acceptance advocates has helped quell my fears. \u201cI have never gotten a message that said \u2018I watched your videos and it made it worse for me. I\u2019m more anxious now, I\u2019m more obsessive compulsive,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t necessarily like it when I use the word \u2018control\u2019, but I personally like it because I think that\u2019s what happened to me. The feeling of empowering myself to know the reality. That truth did set me free, in a way, and made me feel better. It still makes me feel better about the fact that we will all die.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone feels the same. Some people find comfort in denial. Doughty\u2019s humorous and transparent approach can be controversial, with some of her viewers and readers criticising her for not discussing grief enough. But she\u2019s anything but insensitive, and knows better than anyone about the impact of losing someone: \u201cYou\u2019re never going to be the same again. But how can we turn this into something healthy as opposed to something else? Turning grief into healthy grief is not a disservice to the person who died, even if it was someone incredibly close to you. It\u2019s not a disservice to mourn them in a healthy, open way. You\u2019re never going to get over it, no matter what, but you remember the experience with a sort of melancholic, whimsical engagement. You can really do the work, or you can just remember it as a source of deep trauma. You\u2019re going to remember it one way or the other \u2013 so what is that going to look like?\u201d</p> <p>Nobody likes to think about mortality, but if you\u2019re going to, there are far worse places to start than Doughty. Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? is funny, dark, and at times stunningly existential, revealing not only how little we understand about death, but also how much kids can handle. As to whether or not your cat will eat your eyeballs? You\u2019ll just have to read the book to find out.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/will-my-cat-eat-my-eyeballs-9781474613392.html\">Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?

Say it honestly, tell them \u2018If something is bugging you, or you want to keep talking, I\u2019m always happy to talk to you about this\u2019,\u201d she says. She wishes more adults would give children information early on, so that when they inevitably encounter death, \u201cthey\u2019re already used to talking about it, used to the more fun, interesting, curious parts.\u201d She believes it\u2019s possible, through science and humour, to train the brain \u201cto see death as simultaneously very heavy and a source of great curiosity\u201d. As a child, Doughty learned about death violently when she saw another child fall in a shopping mall (\u201ca complete aberration\u201d). Afterwards, she developed OCD symptoms including tapping and compulsive spitting. \u201cMy brain was being invaded with the knowledge of death and the fact that people could be taken away from me at any moment and I couldn\u2019t control it. All I could control were these little rituals.\u201d Like Doughty, my early relationship with death also manifested through OCD. Once I learned that people could be taken away, I started trying to regain control through repetitive actions. That obsession has only intensified as I\u2019ve got older, but the work of Doughty and other death-acceptance advocates has helped quell my fears. \u201cI have never gotten a message that said \u2018I watched your videos and it made it worse for me. I\u2019m more anxious now, I\u2019m more obsessive compulsive,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t necessarily like it when I use the word \u2018control\u2019, but I personally like it because I think that\u2019s what happened to me. The feeling of empowering myself to know the reality. That truth did set me free, in a way, and made me feel better. It still makes me feel better about the fact that we will all die.\u201d Not everyone feels the same. Some people find comfort in denial. Doughty\u2019s humorous and transparent approach can be controversial, with some of her viewers and readers criticising her for not discussing grief enough. But she\u2019s anything but insensitive, and knows better than anyone about the impact of losing someone: \u201cYou\u2019re never going to be the same again. But how can we turn this into something healthy as opposed to something else? Turning grief into healthy grief is not a disservice to the person who died, even if it was someone incredibly close to you. It\u2019s not a disservice to mourn them in a healthy, open way. You\u2019re never going to get over it, no matter what, but you remember the experience with a sort of melancholic, whimsical engagement. You can really do the work, or you can just remember it as a source of deep trauma. You\u2019re going to remember it one way or the other \u2013 so what is that going to look like?\u201d Nobody likes to think about mortality, but if you\u2019re going to, there are far worse places to start than Doughty. Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? is funny, dark, and at times stunningly existential, revealing not only how little we understand about death, but also how much kids can handle. As to whether or not your cat will eat your eyeballs? You\u2019ll just have to read the book to find out. \u2022 Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? Big Questions from Tiny Mortals About Death by Caitlin Doughty is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (\u00a314.99) on 19 September.",

      "bodyText": "A raft of measures to safeguard the mental health of sacked government ministers is being proposed in Wales after the death of the Labour politician Carl Sargeant. The first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, promised that particular care would be taken when politicians left in circumstances likely to attract media interest, as was the case with Sargeant. Changes proposed by Drakeford include making cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) available and giving ministers the chance to confidentially \u201cdeclare\u201d issues such as mental health problems in the same way that they reveal financial interests. Drakeford also plans to make sure information surrounding reshuffles is kept secret before they happen, seemingly an attempt to address concerns raised by Sargeant\u2019s family that news of his sacking was leaked in advance. Sargeant, 49, took his own life at his home in north Wales in November 2017, days after he was sacked from his job as cabinet secretary for communities and children following allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour towards women. The inquest into his death heard he had mental health issues and was vulnerable. At the conclusion of the inquest in July, the coroner, John Gittins, expressed deep concern that no official arrangements were put in place to support Sargeant despite the probability that the then first minister, Carwyn Jones, knew of his vulnerability and that his sacking would cause a media storm. Gittins wrote to the Welsh government warning there could be further deaths unless better support was put in place for high-profile figures when they were sacked. On Thursday Gittins published a letter from Drakeford in which the first minister detailed the changes he proposed to make if the coroner agreed. Drakeford said that having consulted with Sargeant\u2019s family as well as his cabinet and former ministers, he intended to add a new section to the Welsh government\u2019s ministerial code called \u201cministers and their wellbeing\u201d. The section says: \u201cThe first minister will ensure that the wellbeing of the minister \u2026 is fully taken into account as part of planning and preparation for reshuffles. This will include ensuring that the ministers at the time are aware of the support services which are available to them to access. \u201cThe first minister will ensure that information surrounding any reshuffle is kept to as tight a cohort of individuals as the first minister thinks possible.\u201d Drakeford said practical steps he intended to implement included producing an information pack for ministers and providing them with details of a named official in the cabinet division who would act as their liaison point for any queries or issues in relation to their departure. He said he planned to enhance the help available for ministers, including offering access to occupational health and CBT, and set up a mentoring scheme under which new ministers could seek guidance from more experienced colleagues. Drakeford said that subject to the views of Gittins and the chief coroner, Mark Lucraft, it was his intention to make the changes to the ministerial code immediately. Sargeant\u2019s son, Jack, said: \u201cAs a family, we welcome the first minister\u2019s considered response to the coroner. It is clear to us that the current first minister is taking his responsibility to promote and safeguard the welfare of ministers seriously and in such a way that was not in place at the time of dad\u2019s death.\u201d Sargeant\u2019s family strongly believe that the way the sacking was handled by Jones, contributed to his death. \u201cWe hope that Mark Drakeford will now be the guardian of a kinder type of politics,\u201d added Jack Sargeant",

      "body": "<p>There is a moment in the pitch perfect 1987 movie <em>Broadcast News</em>, about the television news industry, which has always spoken to me. Peter Hackes, playing the veteran news executive he once was, confronts the argumentative producer Jane Craig, <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2017/12/broadcast-news-and-the-power-of-holly-hunter-as-jane-craig.html\" title=\"\">played by Holly Hunter</a>. \u201cIt must be nice to always believe you know better,\u201d Hackes says. \u201cTo always think you\u2019re the smartest person in the room.\u201d Hunter blinks back the tears. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispers, \u201cit\u2019s awful.\u201d</p> <p>Oh Holly, I know exactly what you mean. For here is the ugly confession: in the domestic kitchen, I am that person. I try not to be. I try not to interfere when other people are cooking. I want to be a relaxed, genial soul who knows that other people can cook and that I should just let them just get on with roasting the chicken or making the gravy and be thoroughly appreciative. But if I just happen to be walking through the kitchen and just happen to pass the stove and just happen to notice something isn\u2019t quite as it should be \u2013 that, say, the gravy is a thin, translucent outrage \u2013 I can\u2019t stop myself.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A friend was admonished for 'trying to edit' a colleague\u2019s sandwich. My sympathies are entirely with the editor</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I am a model of politeness. Of course I am. I\u2019ll say something like, \u201cPerhaps a knob of butter would help\u201d, or \u201cMaybe you should turn up the burner and reduce it a little.\u201d Or, \u201cFor CHRIST\u2019S SAKE WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING YOU INCOMPETENT NUMPTY?\u201d No, hang on. Those are the words that are actually going through my head while I\u2019m saying the polite things. As dear Holly says, it\u2019s awful.</p> <p>I know I am not alone in this. One friend told me he had once been admonished for \u201ctrying to edit\u201d a colleague\u2019s sandwich. My sympathies are entirely with the editor. His co-worker was doubtless making a truly dreadful sandwich, a calamity slammed between two slices of bread. He was merely attempting to save him from himself. Once, during a TV shoot, I was chastised for my knife skills. When I challenged my accuser, they said: \u201cBut you were doing it wrong.\u201d So I do know exactly what it\u2019s like. And yet I still don\u2019t seem able to stop myself meddling in other peoples\u2019 cooking.</p> <p>I could tell you I only want to help, that I\u2019m doing it out of kindness, but even I recognise I\u2019d deserve a slap for that. Because in truth, the only person I\u2019m trying to help is myself. I\u2019m employed to travel the country in search of restaurants offering good things to eat and sometimes, despite my best endeavours, I fail. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/18/the-bh-garden-room-london-sins-against-good-taste-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">I have to eat terrible things.</a> If I\u2019m now standing in a kitchen and can see that, unless I intervene and quickly, I\u2019m going to be made to eat something which is a disaster of a nightmare of a travesty, of course I\u2019m going to attempt to change the outcome. I\u2019m going to work to make things better. It\u2019s who I am.</p> <p>But there\u2019s something else. Part of cooking\u2019s appeal to me is that it gives us a sense of control over the world around us, when everything else is chaos. We bend ingredients to our will. And it\u2019s very hard to just relinquish that control. Even when you\u2019re wrong. Because sometimes I am. There. I\u2019ve said it. I\u2019m pretty good in the kitchen, but I\u2019m not that good. Put me in a restaurant kitchen surrounded by serious pros and I won\u2019t say a bloody word. But in the home kitchen, most of the time I do know what I\u2019m doing. Still, I recognise I need to come up with a solution to the issue, one that makes everything better for everybody. After much careful thought, I have. It is this: if you\u2019re cooking for me and I\u2019m in the kitchen with you, please don\u2019t screw up. See, it\u2019s really very simple.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is a moment in the pitch perfect 1987 movie Broadcast News, about the television news industry, which has always spoken to me. Peter Hackes, playing the veteran news executive he once was, confronts the argumentative producer Jane Craig, played by Holly Hunter. \u201cIt must be nice to always believe you know better,\u201d Hackes says. \u201cTo always think you\u2019re the smartest person in the room.\u201d Hunter blinks back the tears. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispers, \u201cit\u2019s awful.\u201d Oh Holly, I know exactly what you mean. For here is the ugly confession: in the domestic kitchen, I am that person. I try not to be. I try not to interfere when other people are cooking. I want to be a relaxed, genial soul who knows that other people can cook and that I should just let them just get on with roasting the chicken or making the gravy and be thoroughly appreciative. But if I just happen to be walking through the kitchen and just happen to pass the stove and just happen to notice something isn\u2019t quite as it should be \u2013 that, say, the gravy is a thin, translucent outrage \u2013 I can\u2019t stop myself. I am a model of politeness. Of course I am. I\u2019ll say something like, \u201cPerhaps a knob of butter would help\u201d, or \u201cMaybe you should turn up the burner and reduce it a little.\u201d Or, \u201cFor CHRIST\u2019S SAKE WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING YOU INCOMPETENT NUMPTY?\u201d No, hang on. Those are the words that are actually going through my head while I\u2019m saying the polite things. As dear Holly says, it\u2019s awful. I know I am not alone in this. One friend told me he had once been admonished for \u201ctrying to edit\u201d a colleague\u2019s sandwich. My sympathies are entirely with the editor. His co-worker was doubtless making a truly dreadful sandwich, a calamity slammed between two slices of bread. He was merely attempting to save him from himself. Once, during a TV shoot, I was chastised for my knife skills. When I challenged my accuser, they said: \u201cBut you were doing it wrong.\u201d So I do know exactly what it\u2019s like. And yet I still don\u2019t seem able to stop myself meddling in other peoples\u2019 cooking. I could tell you I only want to help, that I\u2019m doing it out of kindness, but even I recognise I\u2019d deserve a slap for that. Because in truth, the only person I\u2019m trying to help is myself. I\u2019m employed to travel the country in search of restaurants offering good things to eat and sometimes, despite my best endeavours, I fail. I have to eat terrible things. If I\u2019m now standing in a kitchen and can see that, unless I intervene and quickly, I\u2019m going to be made to eat something which is a disaster of a nightmare of a travesty, of course I\u2019m going to attempt to change the outcome. I\u2019m going to work to make things better. It\u2019s who I am. But there\u2019s something else. Part of cooking\u2019s appeal to me is that it gives us a sense of control over the world around us, when everything else is chaos. We bend ingredients to our will. And it\u2019s very hard to just relinquish that control. Even when you\u2019re wrong. Because sometimes I am. There. I\u2019ve said it. I\u2019m pretty good in the kitchen, but I\u2019m not that good. Put me in a restaurant kitchen surrounded by serious pros and I won\u2019t say a bloody word. But in the home kitchen, most of the time I do know what I\u2019m doing. Still, I recognise I need to come up with a solution to the issue, one that makes everything better for everybody. After much careful thought, I have. It is this: if you\u2019re cooking for me and I\u2019m in the kitchen with you, please don\u2019t screw up. See, it\u2019s really very simple.",

They\u2019ve put a lot of faith in me.\u201d</p> <p>Faith is a recurring theme, opportunity and a sense of place too. The talent has never been lacking. Born and raised, like Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes, in Utrera, Ceballos\u2019s parents sold <em>churros</em> from a van while he played football. \u201cA small, humble town,\u201d he calls it.</p> <p>Growing up, he wore a goofy grin and a swoosh shaved into his head, joined Sevilla at eight, was released at 13 and went to Betis at 17. The day of his trial match, they took him off early, having seen enough, to hide him from Real Madrid and Barcelona.</p> <p>At 20 those two clubs returned, Real beating Barcelona to him. The move, though, has not entirely worked out. That Ceballos believes it still can is underlined by his determination to go to London on loan. Under Zinedine Zidane opportunities were few: in his first season he was on the field for 16% of Real\u2019s game time. He talked about ostracism, telling Radio Marca: \u201cThere comes a time when you see it\u2019s impossible: there were times when [Toni] Kroos and [Luka] Modric were injured and he\u2019d change the system to put others in.\u201d</p> <p>He admitted that, had Zidane stayed, he would have left. Instead, Zidane walked out. Then, six months later, Zidane walked back in. Ceballos started one of 11 matches after the manager\u2019s return, employing a personal coach to ensure his level did not drop.</p> <p>This summer Zidane made little attempt to persuade him to stay. One of the midfielder\u2019s former coaches calls his treatment an aberration. It must be hard not to agree. \u201cYou have to be realistic,\u201d Ceballos says. \u201cThe two good games I\u2019ve had so far for Arsenal I never had in two years at Madrid. I didn\u2019t play a lot but it\u2019s also true that, when I played, I didn\u2019t play as I can. That\u2019s related to confidence but you have to be self-critical.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d568dd616a7e7b2aa9cc352f8cd66130ec5bb3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d568dd616a7e7b2aa9cc352f8cd66130ec5bb3f/0_0_2180_1454/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dani Ceballos battles with Liverpool\u2019s Jordan Henderson. \u2018I haven\u2019t seen a team that plays better, that presses like them,\u2019 Ceballos says.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dani Ceballos battles with Liverpool\u2019s Jordan Henderson. \u2018I haven\u2019t seen a team that plays better, that presses like them,\u2019 Ceballos says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On that first day at the Emirates, supporters already knew what they wanted: Dani to stay.

      "bodyText": "It starts with a song. Dani Ceballos listens back, laughs, then looks down a little bashfully. \u201cSurprising,\u201d he calls it. Arsenal fans knew he was good, or hoped so \u2013 he had come from Real Madrid, after all \u2013 but you don\u2019t leave there unless someone wants you to and few expected anything quite this good, this soon. Even he didn\u2019t. Two assists, more touches, passes and dribbles than anyone and that moment when he turned full circle, fell and still escaped with the ball obediently by his foot led to a supporters\u2019 serenade. And a Spaniard wondering if that was really his name he could hear. Oh, Dani Ceballos. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was my first day and it was as if I\u2019d been playing in England 10 years.\u201d He is back in Spain, sitting in the sunshine in Las Rozas, the national team\u2019s HQ, taking it all in. Twenty days have passed since victory over Burnley, during which time he got two reminders that it will not always be like that \u2013 at Anfield he could barely breathe and he began the north London derby on the bench \u2013 but he cannot help smiling. Me encanta, he keeps saying, in the lisping Spanish of the south: I love it. \u201cI love the city, I love the Premier League and love Arsenal,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just really, really happy to be part of this great club. I\u2019ve hardly noticed any difference in size between Real Madrid and Arsenal. And the fans are very passionate, they love the players. It\u2019s much easier to adapt because they make you feel like you\u2019ve been at the club for ever. I love the way everyone\u2019s treated me. They\u2019ve put a lot of faith in me.\u201d Faith is a recurring theme, opportunity and a sense of place too. The talent has never been lacking. Born and raised, like Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes, in Utrera, Ceballos\u2019s parents sold churros from a van while he played football. \u201cA small, humble town,\u201d he calls it. Growing up, he wore a goofy grin and a swoosh shaved into his head, joined Sevilla at eight, was released at 13 and went to Betis at 17. The day of his trial match, they took him off early, having seen enough, to hide him from Real Madrid and Barcelona. At 20 those two clubs returned, Real beating Barcelona to him. The move, though, has not entirely worked out. That Ceballos believes it still can is underlined by his determination to go to London on loan. Under Zinedine Zidane opportunities were few: in his first season he was on the field for 16% of Real\u2019s game time. He talked about ostracism, telling Radio Marca: \u201cThere comes a time when you see it\u2019s impossible: there were times when [Toni] Kroos and [Luka] Modric were injured and he\u2019d change the system to put others in.\u201d He admitted that, had Zidane stayed, he would have left.

      "body": "<p>In discussions about the art of the pass, it is never wrong to afford Johan Cruyff the final word. \u201cTechnique is passing the ball with one touch, with the right speed, at the right foot of your teammate,\u201d he famously said, instantly creating a blueprint for a generation of players and coaches everywhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/28/the-most-perfect-camera-angles-of-great-football-moments\">The most perfect camera angles of great football moments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So how do you describe precisely the same act, carried out while standing at 180 degrees to the recipient of your pass while the ball is spinning away from you? Paul Scholes\u2019 one-touch, no-look, perfectly weighted pass towards Tim Cahill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/11/vincent-kompany-homelessness-charity-manchester-city-testimonial\" title=\"\">in Vincent Kompany\u2019s testimonial</a> set social media agog overnight and, this weekend, will presumably send parents sprawling as they look to replicate it in front of their children in the local park. It was, as more than one commenter pointed out, a flourish so delightful that Robin van Persie virtually fought Cahill to be its rightful recipient.</p> <p>Joleon Lescott, completely foxed by Scholes\u2019s slice on the half-volley, scampered after the situation with the look of a man who had never had to deal with anything like this during a 17-year career. But then nobody watching had seen much to compare it with either. Football is decided by goals of all shapes and sizes but this was the most delicious of reminders that there is nothing in the sport quite like a pass.</p> <p>To some extent we know that already. Manchester City have already made 2,483 passes in the Premier League this season. At the other end of the scale even Burnley, for all their belts and braces, have made 1,190. Any team that do not play a possession game risk at least some degree of stigmatisation nowadays; it is dogma to the extent that most passes, played from side to side as a team build from the back, barely register in the consciousness.

      "bodyText": "In discussions about the art of the pass, it is never wrong to afford Johan Cruyff the final word. \u201cTechnique is passing the ball with one touch, with the right speed, at the right foot of your teammate,\u201d he famously said, instantly creating a blueprint for a generation of players and coaches everywhere. So how do you describe precisely the same act, carried out while standing at 180 degrees to the recipient of your pass while the ball is spinning away from you? Paul Scholes\u2019 one-touch, no-look, perfectly weighted pass towards Tim Cahill in Vincent Kompany\u2019s testimonial set social media agog overnight and, this weekend, will presumably send parents sprawling as they look to replicate it in front of their children in the local park. It was, as more than one commenter pointed out, a flourish so delightful that Robin van Persie virtually fought Cahill to be its rightful recipient. Joleon Lescott, completely foxed by Scholes\u2019s slice on the half-volley, scampered after the situation with the look of a man who had never had to deal with anything like this during a 17-year career. But then nobody watching had seen much to compare it with either. Football is decided by goals of all shapes and sizes but this was the most delicious of reminders that there is nothing in the sport quite like a pass. To some extent we know that already. Manchester City have already made 2,483 passes in the Premier League this season. At the other end of the scale even Burnley, for all their belts and braces, have made 1,190. Any team that do not play a possession game risk at least some degree of stigmatisation nowadays; it is dogma to the extent that most passes, played from side to side as a team build from the back, barely register in the consciousness.

Ruling reverses years of US immigration policy The supreme court has ruled to allow Trump\u2019s administration to enforce a policy denying asylum to anyone who has passed through another country on their way to the US without seeking protection there first. The restriction is likely to affect almost all migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border. The order overturns a lower court ruling that blocked the policy after it was unveiled in July. Opponents of the rule, which reverses years of immigration policy, say it violates the US Refugee Act and the UN refugee convention. Mexico crackdown. Mexico\u2019s president says his tough new immigration plan has slowed the flow of migrants. However, huge numbers continue to travel north, aided by coyotes, corrupt officials, crooks and concerned citizens, as Nina Lakhani reports. Bolton quits after spat over proposed Trump-Rouhani meeting Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, jumped or was pushed from his perch after arguing forcefully against the prospect of the president meeting Iran\u2019s leader, Hassan Rouhani, according to a report by Bloomberg News on Bolton\u2019s White House exit earlier this week. Trump was said to be keen to score some easy diplomatic wins, including engineering a meeting with Rouhani at this month\u2019s UN general assembly, by offering to ease sanctions on Tehran. Tough guy. Trump said on Wednesday the hawkish Bolton had also been \u201cway out of line\u201d on the administration\u2019s approach to Venezuela. \u201cJohn is known as a tough guy. He\u2019s so tough, he got us into Iraq,\u201d the president added. Who will benefit from California\u2019s gig economy bill? The conversation around California\u2019s groundbreaking gig economy bill, passed by lawmakers in the Golden State on Wednesday, has focused on its potential to improve working conditions for Uber and Lyft drivers. The AB5 bill, which sets new standards for determining whether workers ought to be classified as independent contractors, could also benefit a diverse range of other professionals, from cable installers to exotic dancers, as Kari Paul reports. Uber allies. Uber said on Wednesday it would resist reclassifying its drivers as employees under AB5. Its rideshare rival Lyft said in a statement it was \u201cprepared to take this issue to the voters of California to preserve the freedom and access drivers and riders want and need\u201d. Potential no-deal chaos detailed in secret Brexit papers The potentially devastating impacts of a no-deal Brexit, including rising food and fuel prices, medicine shortages and civil unrest, have been detailed in secret papers the UK government was forced to publish on Wednesday. Michael Gove, the minister responsible for the no-deal preparations known as Operation Yellowhammer, said the government had taken \u201cconsiderable steps\u201d to address the potential problems, and insisted the document described a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d. The Irish issue. A no-deal Brexit would be \u201ca total disaster\u201d for Ireland\u2019s agribusiness, farmers said at a recent meeting in Dublin. The resulting tariffs would also drive up the price of bread in Ireland, where bulk flour is provided by two industrial mills on the UK side of the border. Cheat sheet Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of OxyContin, and members of the Sackler family who own the firm, have reached a tentative deal with states and local governments to pay a settlement of $12bn over Purdue\u2019s role in the opioids crisis. The FDA will develop guidelines to ban all e-cigarette flavours apart from tobacco, to combat the recent surge in teen vaping and amid reports of widespread respiratory illnesses related to the habit, Trump announced on Wednesday. At least 1,021 people have died in an outbreak of dengue fever in the Philippines. More than a third of the victims of the mosquito-borne disease have been children under the age of 10. The Gates Foundation is facing criticism from human rights activists after announcing plans to honour India\u2019s controversial Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, for his efforts to improve toilet provision and sanitation in the country. Must-reads Life and death on the lawless high seas When a South Korean fishing trawler overturned in the southern Pacific in 2010, killing six men, it was sunk as much by greed as by water, writes Ian Urbina. And for the Sajo Oyang Corporation, which operated the vessel, the poor treatment of workers and the dismal conditions of its ship were nothing unusual. MIT\u2019s Epstein whistleblower: \u2018My job was to protect secrets\u2019 Signe Swenson, a former alumni coordinator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s celebrated Media Lab, helped to facilitate a working relationship between the late, disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and the institution\u2019s former head, Joi Ito.

      "body": "<p>\u2018It\u2019s easy for people to say, \u2018We should all care for our loved ones\u2019,\u201d says Kristof Bilsen \u201cBut what happens when you can\u2019t?\u201d For his new documentary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/10/mother-review-alzheimers-dementia-care-thailand-kristof-bilsen-documentary\">Mother</a>, the 39-year-old Belgian travelled to northern Thailand to film at Baan Kamlangchay, a centre for westerners with Alzheimer\u2019s whose families have left them in the hands of Thai caregivers.</p> <p>The political was very personal for Bilsen. During the three years he made the film, his own mother Rosemarijn was in decline with dementia. \u201cMy dad tried to give her home care but he\u2019s 78, so it proved overwhelming,\u201d Bilsen says. \u201cSo he visited her a lot in an old persons\u2019 home. The subject of the film is very close to me \u2013 the frustration of not being able to care for our most beloved.\u201d</p> <p>In his novel Everyman, Philip Roth wrote: \u201cOld age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.\u201d Especially, it might be added, for those who have dementia, and those who care for us. And yet we keep returning to the massacre and how we variously deal with it.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/05/still-alice-julianne-moore-oscar-alzheimers\">Still Alice</a> (2014), Julianne Moore plays a professor who finds the linguistic skills that have defined her identity falling away with her early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s, living with a family reeling from her diagnosis. James Keach\u2019s documentary of the same year, Glenn Campbell: I\u2019ll Be Me, depicted the late country star on his last tour, struggling to remember lyrics and losing his dexterity but still bent on showing the truth of his Alzheimer\u2019s.</p> <p>No wonder some attempt find something more heartening. Hence the BBC\u2019s recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/02/our-dementia-choir-with-vicky-mcclure-review-your-tears-will-flow-unstoppably\">Our Dementia Choir With Vicky McClure</a>, in which the Line of Duty star assembled a group of 20 people in the hope that lyrics learned long ago can be embedded too deep for for dementia to erase and that performing together can uplift rather than annihilate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68369072375aa267eccbeeb8eeebd03ad5eee570\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68369072375aa267eccbeeb8eeebd03ad5eee570/0_72_2784_1670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julianne Moore in Still Alice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julianne Moore in Still Alice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Artificial Eye</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bilsen cites Erick Stoll and Chase Whiteside\u2019s recent documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/07/america-review-mexican-grandmother-documentary-erick-stoll-chase-whiteside\">Am\u00e9rica</a>, which showed three Mexican brothers looking after their eponymous 93-year-old grandmother after she injured herself falling out of bed and subsequently struggled with forgetfulness. The trio of street entertainers turned carers sing her songs, shower her with kisses and at one point tenderly assist her with an enema. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely, rather romantic film,\u201d says Bilsen. \u201cBut very different from mine.\u201d</p> <p>More to Bilsen\u2019s temper is Michael Haneke\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or-winning film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/15/amour-review\">Amour</a> (2012), in which Georges and Anne, retired music teachers played by Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva live happily in Paris. When Anne has two strokes and begins to experience dementia, she makes Georges promise never to put her in a hospital or home. And so, as her condition deteriorates and despite his own frailties, he cares for her until the very end. That harrowing resolution, Haneke suggests, is better than any treacly Hollywood ending that denies the disease\u2019s ravages.</p> <p>Bilsen\u2019s documentary comes at a time when how we care \u2013 or don\u2019t care \u2013 for people with dementia is becoming an increasing concern. In May, the Alzheimer\u2019s Society estimated that the number of people with dementia facing isolation and loneliness is expected to double to 240,000 in the next 20 years by 2039. Too many people with dementia end up feeling \u201cabandoned and isolated, with nowhere to turn\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/15/number-of-people-with-dementia-living-alone-predicted-to-double\">said Jeremy Hughes, the charity\u2019s chief executive</a>. A YouGov poll found that 40% of respondents would not feel confident communicating with people with dementia. Last month, Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia was found to be the leading cause of death in England and Wales, the proportion increasing for the fourth consecutive year.</p> <p>In such a context, I suggest to Bilsen, Mother might be taken as showing the latest instance of a callous west offloading its problems: we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/28/treated-like-trash-south-east-asia-vows-to-return-mountains-of-rubbish-from-west\">export our rubbish</a> to Thailand. We send them our sex tourists. And now, incapable of caring for our loved ones, we export vulnerable people who are losing their minds.</p> <p>Bilsen nods, but disagrees that his film simply contrasts western callousness with eastern compassion. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that. My task was to shift that perspective from the western gaze. It\u2019s tricky, because clearly it\u2019s the west that has the funding to tell the story. Also my political preconceptions are behind the film and I am a white man from Europe, but I want to challenge the judgments that flow from that.

We think our job is to ensure health and survival. But really it is larger than that. It is to enable wellbeing.\u201d Gawande\u2019s radical thought is that while death is the enemy, it is unbeatable, and so what one needs is not a Custer, but a Robert E Lee: \u201cSomeone who understands that the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to the bitter end.\u201d</p> <p>Early in the film, we see Pomm tenderly massaging the hands of her most beloved patient, Elisabeth R\u00f6hner, a Swiss woman near the end of her life. This isn\u2019t healthcare as battle but as kindness and warmth. \u201cWhen she was with Elisabeth, it was as if she was looking after her mother. I fell in love with Pomm,\u201d says Bilsen. \u201cShe\u2019s totally opposite to the western concept of a petite Thai woman. She\u2019s very independent, strong, self-reliant woman.

They\u2019ve got money to pay for all this. If one day I get like this what will I do? Who will take care of me?

      "bodyText": "\u2018It\u2019s easy for people to say, \u2018We should all care for our loved ones\u2019,\u201d says Kristof Bilsen \u201cBut what happens when you can\u2019t?\u201d For his new documentary, Mother, the 39-year-old Belgian travelled to northern Thailand to film at Baan Kamlangchay, a centre for westerners with Alzheimer\u2019s whose families have left them in the hands of Thai caregivers. The political was very personal for Bilsen. During the three years he made the film, his own mother Rosemarijn was in decline with dementia. \u201cMy dad tried to give her home care but he\u2019s 78, so it proved overwhelming,\u201d Bilsen says. \u201cSo he visited her a lot in an old persons\u2019 home. The subject of the film is very close to me \u2013 the frustration of not being able to care for our most beloved.\u201d In his novel Everyman, Philip Roth wrote: \u201cOld age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.\u201d Especially, it might be added, for those who have dementia, and those who care for us. And yet we keep returning to the massacre and how we variously deal with it. In Still Alice (2014), Julianne Moore plays a professor who finds the linguistic skills that have defined her identity falling away with her early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s, living with a family reeling from her diagnosis. James Keach\u2019s documentary of the same year, Glenn Campbell: I\u2019ll Be Me, depicted the late country star on his last tour, struggling to remember lyrics and losing his dexterity but still bent on showing the truth of his Alzheimer\u2019s. No wonder some attempt find something more heartening. Hence the BBC\u2019s recent Our Dementia Choir With Vicky McClure, in which the Line of Duty star assembled a group of 20 people in the hope that lyrics learned long ago can be embedded too deep for for dementia to erase and that performing together can uplift rather than annihilate. Bilsen cites Erick Stoll and Chase Whiteside\u2019s recent documentary Am\u00e9rica, which showed three Mexican brothers looking after their eponymous 93-year-old grandmother after she injured herself falling out of bed and subsequently struggled with forgetfulness. The trio of street entertainers turned carers sing her songs, shower her with kisses and at one point tenderly assist her with an enema. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely, rather romantic film,\u201d says Bilsen. \u201cBut very different from mine.\u201d More to Bilsen\u2019s temper is Michael Haneke\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or-winning film Amour (2012), in which Georges and Anne, retired music teachers played by Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva live happily in Paris. When Anne has two strokes and begins to experience dementia, she makes Georges promise never to put her in a hospital or home. And so, as her condition deteriorates and despite his own frailties, he cares for her until the very end. That harrowing resolution, Haneke suggests, is better than any treacly Hollywood ending that denies the disease\u2019s ravages. Bilsen\u2019s documentary comes at a time when how we care \u2013 or don\u2019t care \u2013 for people with dementia is becoming an increasing concern. In May, the Alzheimer\u2019s Society estimated that the number of people with dementia facing isolation and loneliness is expected to double to 240,000 in the next 20 years by 2039. Too many people with dementia end up feeling \u201cabandoned and isolated, with nowhere to turn\u201d, said Jeremy Hughes, the charity\u2019s chief executive. A YouGov poll found that 40% of respondents would not feel confident communicating with people with dementia. Last month, Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia was found to be the leading cause of death in England and Wales, the proportion increasing for the fourth consecutive year. In such a context, I suggest to Bilsen, Mother might be taken as showing the latest instance of a callous west offloading its problems: we export our rubbish to Thailand. We send them our sex tourists. And now, incapable of caring for our loved ones, we export vulnerable people who are losing their minds. Bilsen nods, but disagrees that his film simply contrasts western callousness with eastern compassion. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that. My task was to shift that perspective from the western gaze. It\u2019s tricky, because clearly it\u2019s the west that has the funding to tell the story. Also my political preconceptions are behind the film and I am a white man from Europe, but I want to challenge the judgments that flow from that. My film does not indict or judge.\u201d One way he attempted to subvert the western gaze was to give a camera to Chutimon Sonsirichai, AKA Pomm, one of the Thai caregivers at Baan Kamlangchay, so she could tell her story. \u201cInitially, my film was going to be about different kinds of care.\u201d He had been much influenced by reading Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End by American surgeon Atul Gawande. \u201cWe\u2019ve been wrong about what our job is in medicine.

Karoline Normann, the head of the Danish law society\u2019s criminal law committee, said evidence once considered purely technical was now open to doubt. \u201cUntil now, mobile data has had a high significance and value in courtrooms because this kind of evidence has been considered almost objective,\u201d she told Agence-France Presse. \u201cThis situation has changed our mindset about cellphone data. We are probably going to question it as we normally question a witness or other types of evidence, where we consider circumstances like who produced the evidence, and why and how.\u201d Isolated incidences of clearly inaccurate mobile data have occurred in the past in the US and South Africa, but this is the first time it has been questioned by a national justice system. Three years ago a Kansas family sued a digital mapping company after being visited \u201ccountless times\u201d by police. Rather than wait for their case to be examined under the review, Danish prisoners have started demanding their release on the grounds that their convictions were based on mobile phone evidence. Not all are successful. Two members of an an Aarhus criminal gang \u2013 one of whom insisted he had spent the night at his parents\u2019 home but was placed at a crime scene by mobile phone records \u2013 had their appeals turned down this week because other evidence was considered conclusive.",

The vast majority of BAT\u2019s \u00a324.5bn revenue in 2018 came from traditional cigarettes \u2013 its brands include Rothmans, Dunhill and Lucky Strike \u2013 but the company said it could save money to invest in alternative products such as vaping and heated tobacco by stripping out layers of management around the world.

That would mean more than doubling the \u00a31.8bn it made last year from vaping, tobacco-heated products and oral tobacco, which includes pouches such as Snus, popular in Scandinavia.

That\u2019s the presiding meta spirit of this magnificent, inventive, playful, exasperating film, Argentina\u2019s longest ever, shot over 10 years.

Instagram, the photo- and video-posting platform, could play a larger role than many people anticipate.</p> <p>Facebook and Twitter received the lion\u2019s share of attention in connection with Russia\u2019s election interference in 2016. But Instagram was more important as a vehicle for disinformation than is commonly understood, and it could become a crucial Russian instrument again next year.</p> <p>Instagram\u2019s image-oriented service makes it an ideal venue for memes, which are photos combined with short, punchy text. Memes, in turn, are an increasingly popular vehicle for phony quotes and other disinformation. Deepfake videos are another potential danger on Instagram. Made with readily available artificial intelligence tools, deepfakes seem real to the naked eye and could be used to present candidates as saying or doing things they have never said or done.</p> <p>There\u2019s more to worry about than just Instagram. As I explain in a new <a href=\"https://bhr.stern.nyu.edu/tech-disinfo-and-2020-election\">report</a> published by the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, the Russians may not be the only foreign operatives targeting the US. <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/05/removing-more-cib-from-iran/\">Iranians</a> pretending to be Americans have already jumped into the US disinformation fray.

In the last seven years, 75,000 sales assistant or checkout operator jobs have been lost. The Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce found that while men lost 33,000 of those jobs, these were offset by the rise in roles in warehouses and as delivery drivers. As online retail and automated checkouts continue to takeover, entry-level shop floor jobs for young women and part-time work for older women juggling care commitments are disappearing. We\u2019d like to hear from women and teenage girls in retail who have either lost their job or had their hours and pay reduced as a result of store cutbacks.

      "bodyText": "For two tournaments in the 1990s the World Cup opened with the sound of thunder. The meeting of the hosts and the holders was becoming a tradition when Wales were awarded the 1999 event and the organisers decided it would not be an ideal start if South Africa got near the 98 points they put on the men in red the year before. So World Cups have tended to start with, if not a whimper, then something less than a bellow, although Argentina in 2007, when they were involved in the opener for the third successive tournament, ignored the script and beat France (they might have embarrassed Australia four years before had they been allowed to scrummage). The ninth World Cup starts on Friday 20 September with a match that should be as one-sided as the two openers in New Zealand in 1987 and 2011. When Japan face Russia the outcome should be as predictable as the result of a presidential election in the land of Putin. Pyrotechnics will be reserved for the opening ceremony. The following day, however, New Zealand face South Africa, a meeting of the two most successful sides in international rugby who have won five of the eight World Cups. It is a repeat of the 1995 final, played in the month of the death of Chester Williams, the only non-white player in the Springboks\u2019 squad that autumn and one of three wings that afternoon who has since died of a heart attack \u2013 Jonah Lomu and James Small being the others \u2013 and the 2015 semi-final, matches that were decided by one score. It was not that long ago that South Africa resembled Wales in 1998. They lost to Italy in 2016 but more than half of the 23 who were involved that day will be in Japan. They had conceded 98 points in two Rugby Championship matches and the following year lost 57-0 to the All Blacks in Albany: 14 of that 23 will be at the World Cup. They lost 38-3 to Ireland, looking shambolic and rudderless. It was when the Munster coach Rassie Erasmus returned home at the end of the year, initially in an overlord capacity only to find himself soon running the national side, that the precipitous decline of the previous two years was first arrested and then put into reverse. Their past three matches against New Zealand have been a 36-34 victory in Wellington, their first away to the All Blacks in nine years, a last-minute 32-30 defeat in the return in Pretoria and a 16-16 draw in Wellington in July when their line speed denied the World Cup holders width and, as in Dublin the previous November, unable to think their way out of trouble. South Africa were the first team to arrive in Japan having arranged to play the hosts in Kumagaya last Friday. Erasmus has brought in some new backs and ended the cap threshold a player must have reached to be eligible for selection if he is based abroad, but he has largely used players he inherited, restoring self-belief and pride in a jersey that was looking moth-eaten. The Yokahama showdown with New Zealand threatens to be one of the matches of the tournament, a throwback to the days when little separated the countries, and a potential preview of the final. Whoever wins will almost certainly top the group with Italy, Canada and Namibia to come, although that could leave both sides going into the quarter-finals underexposed. South Africa and Ireland have, since the last World Cup, found a way of defeating New Zealand and, if the All Blacks lose the opener, they would, if form prevails, meet Ireland in the last eight. The World Cup winners in 2011 and 2015, who have not lost a match in the tournament since France in Cardiff 12 years ago, are seen as vulnerable, their 10-year hold on the top of the world rankings ending this summer. The bookmakers have New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland and England as the four most likely winners, but at most only two of the first three will make the semi-finals because of the way the groups have aligned. It has not often paid to write off the All Blacks, who will have spent this year, and never mind their mediocrity in the Rugby Championship, planning for South Africa in Yokahama. They have been adept down the years at ironing out wrinkles and turning weakness into strength. It makes the prospect of the match so appealing and it stands out on a weekend when France play Argentina, where the loser will need to beat England to keep their knock-out dream alive, and Ireland face Scotland.

At the time of the bidding war to sign him, he was resident in a mental hospital, where he had been involuntarily committed after a psychotic episode during which he had caused the plane his father was piloting to crash by removing the keys from the ignition mid-flight. The question of whether this was a man in any state to be subjected to the machinations of the major label music business hung heavy over his deal with Atlantic; the uneasy sense that at least some aspects of the cult following Johnston had developed were prurient and voyeuristic was hard to shake off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"90e9abdbc24c4bb78e3ea5ae7023337f6a2f327d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90e9abdbc24c4bb78e3ea5ae7023337f6a2f327d/0_0_1600_1134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman places flowers beneath the \u201cHi, how are you\u201d mural created by Daniel Johnston in Austin, Texas, 11 September 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"709\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman places flowers beneath the Hi, How Are You mural created by Daniel Johnston in Austin, Texas, 11 September 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Wagner/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But then, the potency of Johnston\u2019s music was hard to shake off. The sound of the tapes he released in the 80s \u2013 recorded on a mono cassette player in the basement of his parents\u2019 home \u2013 was shockingly primitive: this was an era before the term \u201clo-fi\u201d came to denote a desirable indie aesthetic. But the songs he wrote and played on an out-of-tune piano and a cheap organ cut through the background noise, tape hiss and ramshackle performances. A huge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles\">Beatles</a> fan, Johnston had a way with a simple, indelible tune. Moreover, his songs often had a haunting impact. People sometimes used the adjective \u201cchildlike\u201d to describe them, which seems faintly pejorative, but there was certainly a weird, potent directness about them. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1HXn29trE4\">Like a Monkey in a Zoo</a>, from 1981\u2019s Songs of Pain, laid bare his isolation and mental health problems in stark terms \u2013 \u201cit could happen to you, you could be in my place,\u201d he warned the listener, \u201cI wasn\u2019t always like this, I never saw it coming\u201d \u2013 and set them to a gorgeous melody.</p> <p>The Beatles, from Kurt Cobain\u2019s favourite Johnston album, <a href=\"http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4137703-daniel-johnston-re-issues--yip-jump-music-hi-how-are-you-and-welcome-to-my-world-reviewed\">Yip/Jump Music</a>, uses every cliche imaginable to describe the band \u2013 \u201cthe legendary rock group \u2026 four lads who shook the world\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s sung with such sincerity and intensity, Johnston slapping the keys of his chord organ so hard he effectively provides his own percussion, that the cliches take on a real emotional power. On the most basic level, these are just good songs, but there was something else attractive about them: they appeared to be completely guileless, utterly lacking in artifice. Moreover, they seemed to pour out of him. He released 10 cassettes in eight years, creating his own universe of recurrent characters \u2013 Casper the Friendly Ghost, Joe the Boxer, Laurie Allen, the latter a real person, a local librarian who was the subject of Johnston\u2019s unrequited affections. These tapes contained almost all his most celebrated songs: Speeding Motorcycle, Funeral Home, True Love Will Find You in the End.</p> <p>The cult that grew around them led famed underground producer Mark Kramer to invite Johnston to record in a professional studio for the first time. The sessions at Kramer\u2019s Shimmy Disc studios in New York were fraught and marked by another decline in Johnston\u2019s mental health: the unfinished album had to be completed with home recordings and live tapes. And yet <a href=\"https://mancunion.com/2014/09/08/from-the-vault-daniel-johnston-1990/\">1990</a> may well be the greatest album Johnston made, an alternately beautiful and disturbing collection of songs that frequently sounded like hymns. His recording of an actual hymn, Careless Soul, makes for discomforting, harrowing listening, Johnston fighting off tears as he sings about the day of judgment; at the other extreme, it contains the definitive version of True Love Will Find You in the End, the perfect example of the beautiful, profoundly moving simplicity of Johnston\u2019s songwriting. It was subsequently covered umpteen times, most famously by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beck\">Beck</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/wilco\">Wilco</a>, and eventually found widespread exposure, in the UK at least, as the soundtrack to an animal rescue charity\u2019s advertising campaign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/7h4VPRS9s2IXwcLkeSekEb\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7h4VPRS9s2IXwcLkeSekEb\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He made a further studio album, Artistic Vice \u2013 home to Honey I Sure Miss You, another heartbreaking love song \u2013 before signing to Atlantic.

      "bodyText": "With the prorogation of parliament, and the government set on a no-deal Brexit, it\u2019s easy to feel powerless. And yet this is not the time to feel helpless. A general election may have stalled but one is inevitably on its way. Those of us who wish to remove Boris Johnson and his hard-right ilk from power will need to organise with laser focus, not only setting out an inspiring vision for a fairer society but targeting its message to reach the public. There is no better place to start than promoting voter registration. Progressive parties traditionally benefit from high turnout and the signs are already promising. More than 100,000 people applied to register to vote last week, with young people making up the bulk of the surge. It\u2019s widely understood that Labour was helped by an increased youth vote in the 2017 general election but it is important not to get complacent.

Still, if enough young voters are registered and marshalled, they could make a significant impact in marginal seats with large student populations.

Vertigo sufferers, not so much. 4) And the genius side of Nick Kyrgios, away from all the strops. Spotters\u2019 badges: whobroughtoranges, evilboy 14, BlackCaeser.

      "body": "<p>It is that time of year when, if you are stupid like me, you are thinking about packed lunches for children, having failed to put your foot down about the perfectly fine school dinner. If you are smart, you are also thinking about packed lunches for yourself, because it is somehow more mature than going to Eat \u2013 the nutritional equivalent of having a crippling mortgage instead of crippling rent. So stand by for some sweeping statements about generational differences, as they relate to packed lunches.</p> <p>Children like things to come in many segments, discreet packages containing different food groups, and you either have to beat this out of them or accept that lunch is never going to look very chic or nutritious. Mini Babybells and oaty bars, plastic bags full of grapes and single-ingredient sandwiches with the crusts cut off: this is the stuff of childhood dreams, with some Dunkers or ham and cheese Lunchables if you get super lucky with your parents. These foods are fine in and of themselves (I run a pretty loose ship); what they will not do is introduce a child to anything new. Adventures in a lifetime\u2019s eating begin with combining foodstuffs, not keeping them all separate and wrapping them in clingfilm.</p> <p>I know all that. Sadly, though, I was scarred in childhood by having a mother who thought nothing of making a sandwich out of ratatouille and dark rye bread, which by lunchtime would look and smell like a medieval poultice for warts.

      "bodyText": "It is that time of year when, if you are stupid like me, you are thinking about packed lunches for children, having failed to put your foot down about the perfectly fine school dinner. If you are smart, you are also thinking about packed lunches for yourself, because it is somehow more mature than going to Eat \u2013 the nutritional equivalent of having a crippling mortgage instead of crippling rent. So stand by for some sweeping statements about generational differences, as they relate to packed lunches. Children like things to come in many segments, discreet packages containing different food groups, and you either have to beat this out of them or accept that lunch is never going to look very chic or nutritious. Mini Babybells and oaty bars, plastic bags full of grapes and single-ingredient sandwiches with the crusts cut off: this is the stuff of childhood dreams, with some Dunkers or ham and cheese Lunchables if you get super lucky with your parents. These foods are fine in and of themselves (I run a pretty loose ship); what they will not do is introduce a child to anything new. Adventures in a lifetime\u2019s eating begin with combining foodstuffs, not keeping them all separate and wrapping them in clingfilm. I know all that. Sadly, though, I was scarred in childhood by having a mother who thought nothing of making a sandwich out of ratatouille and dark rye bread, which by lunchtime would look and smell like a medieval poultice for warts. Once she sent me to school with a frankfurter and two eggs, which looked a lot like graffiti, the same day as my best friend came in with a boiled egg her equally countercultural mother had forgotten to boil: nobody spoke to us again without jeering for about 18 months.

The Women\u2019s Equality party has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/25/abuse-survivors-mps-general-election\" title=\"\">selected five survivors</a> of sexual assault and domestic violence to stand against five male MPs who have been accused of violence or harassment. It is a bold step for the party, and for the candidates it can\u2019t be an easy one to take. But for two of them, at least, the decision was straightforward.</p> <p>Serena Laidley, who will be standing in Luton North, said yes immediately when she was asked to stand for election. \u201cI\u2019m still nervous,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought: \u2018Why me?\u2019 But then a voice said: \u2018Why not me?\u2019\u201d Other women are going through sexual abuse, assault and domestic violence and are afraid or silenced, she says. \u201cLet me be that mouthpiece and let me champion women and girls who are so afraid to speak up and be that representation.\u201d</p> <p>We meet at a cafe in Westminster, along with Jenn Selby, another WEP candidate, who is standing for Cities of London and Westminster. They are formidable, articulate women and if I were one of the men they were standing against, I would be feeling distinctly uncomfortable.</p> <p>Laidley\u2019s opponent is Kelvin Hopkins, who was suspended by the Labour party after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/12/labour-steps-up-inquiry-into-complaints-against-mp-kelvin-hopkins\" title=\"\">allegations of sexual harassment</a> and is still under investigation.

Field apologised to the woman, but Hopkins has denied the allegations.</p> <p>The WEP will field three other candidates, one against the Conservative MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/06/charlie-elphicke-denies-sexually-assaulting-two-women\" title=\"\">Charlie Elphicke</a>, who will appear in court next month charged with three counts of sexual assault, and the former Labour MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/23/labour-suspends-ex-minister-ivan-lewis-over-sexual-harassment-claim\" title=\"\">Ivan Lewis </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/27/ex-labour-mp-jared-omara-to-resign-from-parliament\" title=\"\">Jared O\u2019Mara</a>, both of whom have been accused of sexual harassment. Lewis and Elphicke deny the allegations.</p> <p>Laidley and Selby talk of shocking abuse, although as Selby points out: \u201cThe more I talk about it, the more people disclose to me that they have been through something horrific, and the more widespread the problem seems.\u201d </p> <p>She says that in 2013, she was raped and, for nearly two years, went through a court system that she describes as \u201cvery brutal\u201d. Her case was thrown out days before she was due to give evidence because the CPS said there was not a reasonable prospect of conviction. At the time, Selby was an editor at the Independent newspaper but was struggling with her mental health, denied therapy while the case was ongoing, and had to leave work.</p> <p>\u201cI was just so angry and lost, and all these emotions you go through when something like that finishes without a conclusion,\u201d she says. \u201cYou just end up carrying it with you. I needed to do something with it, so I started campaigning.\u201d</p> <p>She helped set up a women\u2019s rights campaign with several NGOs in India, became an ambassador for Solace Women\u2019s Aid and worked with IC Change, the campaign to get the government to ratify the Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and girls, <a href=\"http://www.lawabsolute.com/recruitment-news/article/bill-to-end-violence-against-women-and-girls-becomes-uk-law\" title=\"\">successfully</a> getting a private member\u2019s bill through parliament. \u201cAll of us have stories to tell, all of them quite brutal and unjust, and we\u2019re standing against men who have not been held to account,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Laidley was 16 and had just finished school when she befriended a group of girls who, unbeknown to her, belonged to a gang. They lured her to a house where she was gang-raped by seven men. \u201cIt turned my light of hope for a successful future into darkness \u2013 I\u2019m shaking now \u2013 and I wanted to commit suicide,\u201d she says. She tried to. \u201cIt put fear into my family because they didn\u2019t know what I was going to do next. I tried counselling, but all I was entitled to was six weeks and that wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p> <p>She continued her education, going to college, but subsequently found herself in an abusive relationship \u2013 she thought that was normal. \u201cI felt shame, thinking: \u2018It\u2019s happened again.\u2019 I thought this person loved me.\u201d</p> <p>Laidley went to the police numerous times, but they took no action. Her ex-partner was controlling with her money, sometimes taking her phone, but would allow her to go to college. She stayed with him for another six months, planning her escape \u2013 to university, where she had got a place with accommodation for students who were parents.</p> <p>\u201cI waited until he went to work and I packed up my bags, my son, the buggy, passport and \u00a330 in cash,\u201d she says. He found her eventually, and for the next few years she lived through harassment, stalking and her former partner breaking injunctions, until he finally moved away.</p> <p>\u201cI started to realise the mental impact I had endured and I was diagnosed with PTSD,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to give up work, I again tried to commit suicide. I realised that I needed more help.\u201d She still has counselling. \u201cWhat also helps is helping other women and children.\u201d</p> <p>Now, Laidley is a part-time secondary school teacher, and runs her own education programme, teaching empowerment and respect in schools, as well as working with organisations supporting women through domestic violence and preventing youth suicide.</p> <p>Is it daunting to be a candidate and have to relive these stories, standing on a platform against male violence and abuse? \u201cYes, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d says Selby. \u201cIt takes away a little bit of you every time you have to talk about it. But you have to weigh up the pain you feel talking about it constantly, and a sense of justice and being able to put that negative energy towards something positive.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that people who have the power to take decisions that affect our personal safety, and the protection of women and girls, are allowed to sit in parliament having [unresolved] allegations or being charged with serious offences is just an abomination. We want to hold them to account and if they\u2019re not going to do that in parliament, then we want to hold them to account at the ballot box.\u201d</p> <p>Laidley says that standing for the WEP, and talking about her story, feels like a \u201crelease\u201d. \u201cI know I\u2019m helping other women out there. In order to create change, we have to keep speaking about it. Standing against them, I would like to believe that I\u2019m doing it for all women who can\u2019t speak.\u201d</p> <p>If they win, they will be joining a workplace where a 2018 report found that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/westminster-sexual-harassment-one-five-report-leaked-mps-lords-staff-a8199401.html\" title=\"\">one in five people</a> had experienced or witnessed sexual harassment in the past year.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting,\u201d says Laidley. \u201cYou\u2019re in the place where laws are being made and you\u2019re still getting sexually harassed and being silenced.\u201d </p> <p>They know they probably won\u2019t win their seats. \u201cI mean, I might,\u201d says Selby with a laugh. It is a protest, she says. If the WEP can draw attention to the way the main parties handle \u2013 or rather, don\u2019t \u2013 allegations of harassment and abuse, they will consider that a victory. The WEP wants amendments to the Recall Act 2015 to give constituents the power to remove their MPs if an independent third party finds them guilty of sexual harassment or violence. They are also calling for secured funding for services that support women and girls who have experienced violence and abuse \u2013 following years of cuts \u2013 as well as universal free childcare from the age of nine months.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re in negotiations with the Liberal Democrats and the Labour party and any other pro-remain parties, to get them to change their policies around how they\u2019re dealing with these investigations,\u201d says Selby. The women will stand down if those parties adopt the amendment, and will help campaign for them.</p> <p>Have the men they are standing against been in touch? According to a WEP spokeswoman, Lewis\u2019s team phoned to say that he wasn\u2019t under investigation, but none of the other men has contacted the party or its candidates.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to having a nice chat at some point,\u201d says Selby. Laidley says Hopkins\u2019s behaviour will be something she talks about in her campaign, but she would rather not focus on him.</p> <p>Selby says: \u201cI\u2019m hoping that people don\u2019t just see me as a survivor and they\u2019re able to see that I can do the job, and that I\u2019m one of very many women who have been through a similar thing. But the big thing we\u2019re doing is exposing these men and that injustice.\u201d</p> <p>Has it been an empowering process? Both say the WEP has been incredibly supportive. \u201cHaving its support is really a strength in my back, allowing me to project my voice, having that push,\u201d says Laidley. \u201cI don\u2019t know about self-empowerment but it\u2019s a good release of self-expression, pain and hurt. It\u2019s knowing that I\u2019m doing it for the greater good.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic violence helpline is on 0808 2000 247.

I tried counselling, but all I was entitled to was six weeks and that wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d She continued her education, going to college, but subsequently found herself in an abusive relationship \u2013 she thought that was normal. \u201cI felt shame, thinking: \u2018It\u2019s happened again.\u2019 I thought this person loved me.\u201d Laidley went to the police numerous times, but they took no action. Her ex-partner was controlling with her money, sometimes taking her phone, but would allow her to go to college. She stayed with him for another six months, planning her escape \u2013 to university, where she had got a place with accommodation for students who were parents. \u201cI waited until he went to work and I packed up my bags, my son, the buggy, passport and \u00a330 in cash,\u201d she says. He found her eventually, and for the next few years she lived through harassment, stalking and her former partner breaking injunctions, until he finally moved away. \u201cI started to realise the mental impact I had endured and I was diagnosed with PTSD,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to give up work, I again tried to commit suicide. I realised that I needed more help.\u201d She still has counselling. \u201cWhat also helps is helping other women and children.\u201d Now, Laidley is a part-time secondary school teacher, and runs her own education programme, teaching empowerment and respect in schools, as well as working with organisations supporting women through domestic violence and preventing youth suicide. Is it daunting to be a candidate and have to relive these stories, standing on a platform against male violence and abuse? \u201cYes, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d says Selby. \u201cIt takes away a little bit of you every time you have to talk about it. But you have to weigh up the pain you feel talking about it constantly, and a sense of justice and being able to put that negative energy towards something positive. \u201cThe fact that people who have the power to take decisions that affect our personal safety, and the protection of women and girls, are allowed to sit in parliament having [unresolved] allegations or being charged with serious offences is just an abomination. We want to hold them to account and if they\u2019re not going to do that in parliament, then we want to hold them to account at the ballot box.\u201d Laidley says that standing for the WEP, and talking about her story, feels like a \u201crelease\u201d. \u201cI know I\u2019m helping other women out there. In order to create change, we have to keep speaking about it. Standing against them, I would like to believe that I\u2019m doing it for all women who can\u2019t speak.\u201d If they win, they will be joining a workplace where a 2018 report found that one in five people had experienced or witnessed sexual harassment in the past year. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting,\u201d says Laidley. \u201cYou\u2019re in the place where laws are being made and you\u2019re still getting sexually harassed and being silenced.\u201d They know they probably won\u2019t win their seats. \u201cI mean, I might,\u201d says Selby with a laugh. It is a protest, she says. If the WEP can draw attention to the way the main parties handle \u2013 or rather, don\u2019t \u2013 allegations of harassment and abuse, they will consider that a victory. The WEP wants amendments to the Recall Act 2015 to give constituents the power to remove their MPs if an independent third party finds them guilty of sexual harassment or violence. They are also calling for secured funding for services that support women and girls who have experienced violence and abuse \u2013 following years of cuts \u2013 as well as universal free childcare from the age of nine months. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re in negotiations with the Liberal Democrats and the Labour party and any other pro-remain parties, to get them to change their policies around how they\u2019re dealing with these investigations,\u201d says Selby. The women will stand down if those parties adopt the amendment, and will help campaign for them. Have the men they are standing against been in touch? According to a WEP spokeswoman, Lewis\u2019s team phoned to say that he wasn\u2019t under investigation, but none of the other men has contacted the party or its candidates. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to having a nice chat at some point,\u201d says Selby. Laidley says Hopkins\u2019s behaviour will be something she talks about in her campaign, but she would rather not focus on him. Selby says: \u201cI\u2019m hoping that people don\u2019t just see me as a survivor and they\u2019re able to see that I can do the job, and that I\u2019m one of very many women who have been through a similar thing. But the big thing we\u2019re doing is exposing these men and that injustice.\u201d Has it been an empowering process? Both say the WEP has been incredibly supportive. \u201cHaving its support is really a strength in my back, allowing me to project my voice, having that push,\u201d says Laidley. \u201cI don\u2019t know about self-empowerment but it\u2019s a good release of self-expression, pain and hurt. It\u2019s knowing that I\u2019m doing it for the greater good.\u201d \u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic violence helpline is on 0808 2000 247.

After a season of mediocrity at Manchester United last season, behind <strong>Paul Pogba</strong> and Scott McTominay in the pecking order, the Spaniard signed a mega-money contract at PSG, owing to the fact he was moving on a free transfer and that, previously, he had been quite good at football. Imagine his concern, then, this summer when he found out PSG were about to drop a somewhat specific \u00a3429,000-a-week deal on bringing old rival Pogba to Paris.

Just like in Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction, it never happened. But one suspects that the various parties here will get their way at some point.</p> <p>And right on time, here\u2019s Barcelona suit Javier Bordas! \u201cWhile Neymar wants to come, we will do what we can to bring him back. The case of Neymar is a special one. He\u2019s an exceptional player and he wants to come to Barcelona; he hasn\u2019t adapted to Paris; he was wrong to go there, and even he has said that.\u201d It\u2019s on! Probably!

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s all working out for Ander Herrera. After a season of mediocrity at Manchester United last season, behind Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay in the pecking order, the Spaniard signed a mega-money contract at PSG, owing to the fact he was moving on a free transfer and that, previously, he had been quite good at football. Imagine his concern, then, this summer when he found out PSG were about to drop a somewhat specific \u00a3429,000-a-week deal on bringing old rival Pogba to Paris. Say that three times quickly with a straight face. Of course, thankfully for Ander and his hopes of actually making it on to a pitch, this particular tale, from Calciomercato, never came to fruition. It is claimed Manchester United were willing to sell the World Cup winner in the final days of the transfer window, but PSG were only able to pull the trigger if they were able to shunt Neymar off to Barcelona. Just like in Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction, it never happened. But one suspects that the various parties here will get their way at some point. And right on time, here\u2019s Barcelona suit Javier Bordas! \u201cWhile Neymar wants to come, we will do what we can to bring him back. The case of Neymar is a special one. He\u2019s an exceptional player and he wants to come to Barcelona; he hasn\u2019t adapted to Paris; he was wrong to go there, and even he has said that.\u201d It\u2019s on! Probably! Ish! More good news for United fans! Ed Woodward is going to continue to be the mastermind behind all Old Trafford transfers for the foreseeable! Edwin van der Sar had been linked with a new director of football role, but the Dutchman took a strong right hand to the rumours, crucially pushing them away from danger. \u201cI am enjoying my time at Ajax.

A five-page document spelling out the government\u2019s \u201cplanning assumptions\u201d under Operation Yellowhammer \u2013 the government\u2019s no-deal plan \u2013 was disclosed in response to a \u201chumble address\u201d motion. The content of the document was strikingly similar to the plan leaked to the Sunday Times in August, which the government dismissed at the time as out of date. That document was described as a \u201cbase case\u201d; but the new document claims to be a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d. Led by former attorney general Dominic Grieve, and passed by the House of Commons on Monday night as Boris Johnson prepared to suspend parliament, the motion demanded the publication of the documents, large sections of which had been leaked in August. At the time, Downing Street claimed the document had been superseded, and government sources suggested it had been leaked by disaffected former ministers. Former chancellor Philip Hammond later demanded an apology from Johnson, when it emerged the date on the document was August, after the PM took power. The document, which says it outlines \u201creasonable worst case planning assumptions\u201d for no deal Brexit, highlights the risk of border delays, given an estimate that up to 85% of lorries crossing the Channel might not be ready for a new French customs regime. \u201cThe lack of trader readiness combined with limited space in French ports to hold \u2018unready\u2019 HGVs could reduce the flow rate to 40%-60% of current levels within one day as unready HGVs will fill the ports and block flow,\u201d it warns. This situation could last for up to three months, and disruption might last \u201csignificantly longer\u201d, it adds, with lorries facing waits of between 1.5 days and 2.5 days to cross the border.

This has never meant that Yellowhammer is a base or central scenario and to suggest otherwise is a gross misrepresentation,\u201d said a government source. The government refused to comply with the second part of MPs\u2019 request, which demanded the release of messages relating to the suspension of parliament sent by Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings and various other aides on WhatsApp, Facebook, other social media and both their personal and professional phones. In a letter to Grieve, Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said the request was \u201cinappropriate in principle and in practice, would on its own terms purport to require the government to contravene the law, and is singularly unfair to the named individuals\u201d. Grieve told MPs on Monday he had information from public officials that the correspondence contained a \u201cscandal\u201d. The House of Commons voted, by 311 to 302, for the government to publish the information, giving the prime minister a deadline of 11pm on Wednesday to comply. Following publication of the document, Grieve said: \u201cAs a One Nation Conservative I am deeply fearful of the long-term damage a reckless approach \u2013 which knowingly risks prosperity, increases poverty and even threatens medical supplies \u2013 will do to both the people and our party.

The chancellor, Sajid Javid, set aside an extra \u00a32bn at last week\u2019s spending review for the task, taking the total now allocated to no-deal planning to \u00a38bn. Johnson has lost every vote in parliament since he became prime minister in July, including on his two attempts to trigger a snap general election for next month. The prime minister sparked a fierce backlash inside the Tory party last week by removing the whip from 21 rebels who supported backbench-led legislation to force him to request a Brexit delay if he fails to pass a new deal through parliament by mid-October. Those expelled include former justice secretary David Gauke, Hammond, and Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson, Nicholas Soames. Chief whip Mark Spencer has now written to some of them, confirming that they are entitled to appeal the decision \u2013 and hinting that future loyalty to the government could boost their cause. One of the 21 MPs said: \u201cIt was one of the most self-unaware letters I\u2019ve received in some time. From people who are serially disloyal and decimated their own minority government. I don\u2019t want it back ... \u201cAll it did in my local community was confirm that the Conservative party is now led by a narrow sect who wouldn\u2019t be out of place in the Muppet version of the Handmaiden\u2019s tale.

Joe\u2019s condition manifests itself in a sort of Forrest Gump-like ingenuousness. He makes friends with strangers, believes everything everyone tells him, and operates in the world without self-consciousness or calculation.

With it come groupies, welcomed with characteristic wide-eyed enthusiasm, and drugs \u2013 likewise; and then, just when we think this is a book about Joe, the novel takes another direction.</p> <p><em>Doxology</em> is, in some ways, an old-fashioned thing \u2013 and all the better for it.

Point of view scoots merrily from character to character, major or minor, as suits the narration. And Zink blithely ignores that silliest cliche of literary advice: show, don\u2019t tell. She\u2019s a teller, the book is full of information, and her pert authorial commentary is part of the fun. When we\u2019re introduced to a character, for instance, we might get a biographical precis: \u201cPamela Bailey was born the year after Joe, in 1969. She grew up an only child in northwestern Washington DC, between the national zoo and the National Cathedral. Her mother, Ginger, was a homemaker, active in the church \u2013 that is, the cathedral \u2013 and the friends of the local branch library.\u201d</p> <p>But why, you might wonder, does it start where it starts \u2013 rather, than, say, a generation further back \u2013 or end where it ends? That takes you back to the title, and to the quiet but insistent tendency to set scenes in cathedrals as much as in punk clubs. Even if there\u2019s nothing so schematic as a religious framework visible in the book, it\u2019s a story that is above all interested in the condition of innocence, and the way it survives, or doesn\u2019t, under the pressure of history and of day-to-day life.</p> <p>Joe may leave the story relatively unexpectedly, but the example of his (contested) martyrdom runs throughout. The principal protagonist of the second half is Pam\u2019s daughter Flora. She was babysat in infancy by Joe, and has inherited a version of his innocence: \u201cShe began with wounded thoughts about dishonesty. Her faith in truthfulness was deeply ingrained, in part because of her school\u2019s honor code, but mostly because of Joe. Her honesty started with him, and his honesty had never ended for her.\u201d</p> <p>Flora wants to change the world but, like most of us, doesn\u2019t really have a clue how to go about doing so: \u201cHer life was a continual struggle to distinguish career goals from the other kind. A career goal should be personal and practicable. Its variables should fall within realistic limits. Its success should depend as much as possible on factors under the individual\u2019s control. Her career goal was to hold global warming to under two degrees Celsius.

It wouldn\u2019t be shocking if stars who couldn\u2019t find time for the World Cup will suddenly rediscover their national pride next summer. That\u2019s the open secret about the Fiba World Cup: it simply doesn\u2019t matter as much to the US as it does to other countries. There\u2019s a glory of playing in front of gigantic global audiences at the Olympics that just doesn\u2019t compare to playing 8.30am EST games that have been relegated to ESPN+. If there\u2019s one lesson to be learned from the US\u2019s flameout, it\u2019s that the other countries had more invested this time around. Meanwhile, the rest of the world produced some really good teams for the tournament. France\u2019s victory over the US was technically an upset, but you wouldn\u2019t know that from watching a game where they dominated for the majority of the second half. Led by the NBA\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert, they showed that the US\u2019s earlier struggles against Turkey weren\u2019t just the result of an off night. It wasn\u2019t just that the US brought an uninspiring roster to China, it was that other countries are getting that much better at basketball. Many had tabbed Serbia as the best team in the field, the top favorites to unseat the US in the World Cup, but instead they lost to Argentina in the quarter-finals before they beat the US. Following their surprising victories, France and Argentina join Spain and Australia in the semi-finals. If you had filled out brackets for the Fiba World Cup, undoubtedly they are now busted and that\u2019s probably a good thing. For basketball to fully grow on the international stage there must be some amount of global parity and there are signs that this might be on the horizon. There is no greater indicator for the health of the sport than the fact that the favorites are out of the running and the gold medal is officially up for grabs.",

      "bodyText": "Mario Rosales is organising travel arrangements for his latest clients, a Honduran woman and her two primary school-aged children hoping to reach the United States. Rosales, 47, a coyote, or people smuggler, sends their photos via WhatsApp to his contact in the Mexican National Immigration Institute (INM) in order to obtain fake identity cards \u2013 all part of the family\u2019s travel package, which costs $1,800 per person to traverse about half (1,750km) of the region\u2019s most dangerous migration route. Rosales (not his real name), is one of 10 or so coyotes operating in La T\u00e9cnica, a tiny border town in north-west Guatemala, where hundreds of migrants from Central America and the Caribbean cross into Mexico every week, despite a crackdown orchestrated by the US. Seeking to avert crippling trade tariffs threatened by Donald Trump, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has deployed a newly created national guard across the country to stop the migrant flow. Checkpoints have sprung up along major roads, and immigration officials have raided migrant shelters. This week, Mexico\u2019s president declared the plan a success after apprehending around 108,500 migrants during the first half of 2019 \u2013 a 70% increase compared with the same period last year. Migration always drops off in the hot summer months, but US figures also showed a dramatic fall. Meanwhile in Guatemala, US federal authorities including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and intelligence agents are being deployed to dismantle smuggling networks, as part of the controversial \u201csafe third country\u201d agreement with the US. But despite the clampdown, huge numbers of people continue to travel north \u2013 aided by Mexico\u2019s booming migration industry, a multi-faceted array of networks including coyotes, corrupt officials, crooks and concerned citizens. Local aid workers estimate that 70% of migrants crossing the porous 871km Mexico-Guatemala border travel with coyotes \u2013 or \u201cguides\u201d, as they prefer to be known \u2013 but the quality of service varies wildly. Rosales prides himself on providing a safe passage and says he sympathises with the migrants\u2019 plight: he previously lived as an undocumented migrant in Los Angeles, and along with his girlfriend was once kidnapped in Veracruz, trying to reach the US. He works with a tightly knit group of associates, who move small groups of people by car and plane, providing \u2013 he claims \u2013 three decent meals a day. (Other coyotes guide larger groups and subcontract out dozens of short journeys to truck, bus and taxi drivers.) With his latest clients, Rosales will accompany the Honduran family across the River Usumacinta in a small motorised boat, to Frontera Corozal in Chiapas, Mexico. He\u2019ll then drive them 300km to Villahermosa airport in the neighbouring state of Tabasco. Mexican migration and security forces \u2013 including state and local police, the navy, army and national guard \u2013 patrol the highways which Rosales will drive, but the group will not be stopped. Rosales sends his contacts the travel schedule, and photos of the car and his clients, to guarantee a blind eye. \u201cEveryone gets paid, so I never have problems,\u201d said Rosales, who claims to spend 70% of what he earns on bribes. \u201cThe national guard are the same agents in different uniforms, still willing to make a deal.\u201d (An INM spokesperson said corruption was not tolerated and every allegation investigated.) From Villahermosa, the family will use their new ID cards to fly to Reynosa, a Mexican border city notorious for warring cartels and clandestine graves. Here, more associates will be waiting to guide them as they apply for asylum or cross the border illegally. Rosales allowed that the current crackdown had reduced demand, forcing him to cut prices, but history shows that such declines rarely last. Last year\u2019s migrant caravans were also bad for business, until travellers stuck in Tijuana started contracting his team to take them through less congested border crossings. Rosales lives a comfortable life in La T\u00e9cnica, which is thriving thanks to the money migrants spend on hotels, showers, food and transport. But not everyone is in it for the money. Filomena Barrera, 67, a retired nurse and committed Catholic, has been providing safe haven for migrants since 2002. She offers free bed and board for the most desperate families, letting them sleep in her grown-up daughter\u2019s old room. Barrera, who has a constant tremor because she cannot afford to treat her Parkinson\u2019s disease, has hosted countless migrants over the years. \u201cI look easygoing, but I am brave, and would do anything to save these poor people.\u201d Across the river, the indigenous Chol community in Frontera Corozal is sustained by two groups of people: the tourists flocking to the nearby Mayan archaeological site Yaxchilan \u2013 and the migrants. At about 11am, No\u00e9 Pino, 29, leans on his taxi waiting for migrants who often cross during peak tourist traffic to avoid detection. He picks up a Honduran man with a suitcase and drops him off at the junction with Highway 307, which heads north-west. At the crossroad, groups of migrants come and go in taxis, combis and on foot. Pino \u2013 not his real name \u2013 points out a man as he gets out of a tourist minivan to buy a cold soda. \u201cHe\u2019s a pollero [coyote]. He dropped off one group last night, now he\u2019s going back for the next,\u201d said Pino. Pino knows that because he also worked last night, after receiving a call at 12.30am to pick up four migrants at the river and drop them in Palenque. It was a \u201ctypical night\u201d, according to Pino, with five taxis and eight minivans, each holding 15 passengers, subcontracted by smugglers. Pino says he doesn\u2019t fret about encountering migration or security agents because they\u2019re paid off in advance. But the road north is plagued by armed bandits, and he narrowly survived a gun attack in 2015 which left him traumatized and off work for six months. En route, Pino advises migrants to erase messages discussing the journey from their phones, but apart from that, he avoids conversation with clients. \u201cI don\u2019t get involved \u2013 I just do my job.\u201d At the crossroads, a group of seven children and six adults from Honduras arrive in taxis from the river. They seem nervous and disorientated, unsure what to do next or who to ask for advice. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going, just that we\u2019re going,\u201d said a skinny 16-year-old, who asked not to be named. The group mills about outside the general store in silence, until a toddler starts crying and tugs on his mother\u2019s sleeve, demanding his favourite toy car. As she digs inside a plastic bag full of their belongings, a navy patrol jeep parks across the road to question a man. It\u2019s the national guard, searching for migrants.",

He said:<strong> </strong>\u201cThe Government has made an unequivocal guarantee to EU citizens living in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cThe EU Settlement Scheme is performing well and provides a simple way for EU citizens to guarantee their rights \u2013 over 1.1 million people have been granted an immigration status that is secured in UK law.</p> <p>\u201cWe want the EU and member states to match the UK\u2019s unequivocal guarantee to provide greater certainty to UK nationals living in the EU.\u201d</p> <p>The European parliament\u2019s resolution also notes the \u201cstrong reaction\u201d, including by the courts, to the \u201cdecision to prorogue the UK parliament until 14 October, which makes the possibility of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU without an agreement more likely\u201d.</p> <p>Given the House of Commons vote in support of the Benn bill ensuring Johnson will have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/brexit-lords-agree-to-push-through-bill-preventing-no-deal-by-end-of-friday\">request an extension</a> of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU beyond 31 October if a deal is not agreed, the parliament says it is open for such a Brexit delay if there is to be a general election or second referendum, or even to prevent a no deal exit.</p> <p>Luisa Porritt MEP, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats in the European parliament, said: \u201cThe European parliament is right to be deeply concerned about the settled status scheme and its botched implementation.</p> <p>\u201cEU27 citizens continue to be subject to intolerable uncertainty and face a dismissive attitude from the Home Office.

The EU insists any deal must include a last-resort arrangement to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and protect the all-Ireland economy under any circumstances. In light of the UK government\u2019s stated policy of seeking regulatory divergence from the EU in order to gain a competitive advantage, the parliament further \u201ccalls into question how close the future EU/UK economic relationship can be\u201d. Demanding provisions in any future deal that ensure the UK signs up to \u201chigh levels of environmental, employment and consumer protections\u201d, the resolution warns \u201cany free-trade agreement that fails to respect such levels of protection would not be ratified by the European parliament\u201d. Johnson\u2019s EU envoy, David Frost, has in recent days spoken with European commission officials about the UK\u2019s intention to diverge from EU standards. But the strongest criticism of Johnson\u2019s approach is reserved for the prime minister\u2019s treatment of EU citizens living in the UK which the parliament accuses of worsening an already \u201chostile environment\u201d. A sharp rise in the proportion of EU citizens not considered eligible for so-called settled status has caused alarm among campaign groups and MEPs in recent weeks. The proportion of people instead being granted \u201cpre-settled\u201d status \u2013 and therefore finding themselves without a guaranteed permanent right to remain \u2013 has risen from 32% during the testing phase to 34% in the month after the national launch in March, and on to 42% in July. The parliament\u2019s resolution \u201cexpresses its concern at the implementation of the UK\u2019s settlement scheme and the high levels of applications \u2026 who are only accorded pre-settled status\u201d. The parliament calls on the UK to adopt a \u201cdeclaratory\u201d scheme in which the burden of proving an EU citizen does not have the right to permanently stay is placed on the Home Office. Priti Patel, the home secretary, also comes under fire for her initial announcement of the end of free movement from 31 October, followed by a swift U-turn when the UK parliament was prorogued and the required legislation could not be passed. The European parliament\u2019s resolution expresses \u201cgrave concern that recent and conflicting announcements by the Home Office in relation to free movement after 31 October 2019 have generated very unhelpful uncertainty for EU citizens resident in the UK, with the risk that those announcements may exacerbate the hostile environment towards them as well as impact negatively on their ability to enforce their rights\u201d. A government spokesman insisted that the system was \u201cperforming well\u201d. He said: \u201cThe Government has made an unequivocal guarantee to EU citizens living in the UK. \u201cThe EU Settlement Scheme is performing well and provides a simple way for EU citizens to guarantee their rights \u2013 over 1.1 million people have been granted an immigration status that is secured in UK law. \u201cWe want the EU and member states to match the UK\u2019s unequivocal guarantee to provide greater certainty to UK nationals living in the EU.\u201d The European parliament\u2019s resolution also notes the \u201cstrong reaction\u201d, including by the courts, to the \u201cdecision to prorogue the UK parliament until 14 October, which makes the possibility of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU without an agreement more likely\u201d. Given the House of Commons vote in support of the Benn bill ensuring Johnson will have to request an extension of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU beyond 31 October if a deal is not agreed, the parliament says it is open for such a Brexit delay if there is to be a general election or second referendum, or even to prevent a no deal exit. Luisa Porritt MEP, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats in the European parliament, said: \u201cThe European parliament is right to be deeply concerned about the settled status scheme and its botched implementation. \u201cEU27 citizens continue to be subject to intolerable uncertainty and face a dismissive attitude from the Home Office. Our European neighbours are rightly outraged at the way the government has disregarded their rights, as well as the application of the rule of law.\u201d",

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The minister suggested there were \u201cextremes from both sides\u201d of the debate, which should be about \u201cdo we want to breathe healthy air\u201d.

He is a weedy gibbering shell of man named Simon (Brendan Fletcher, chewing carpet, linoleum, astrotur) who was himself the victim of terrible childhood trauma.

This crime thriller, with its lurid serial-killer conceit and a cast peppered with talents who must have just needed the money, is a nostalgic throwback to those straight-to-video guilty pleasures of yore. Henry Cavill glowers manfully throughout as a hardened detective named, with on-the-nose nominative determinism, Marshall, pursuing a sicko in Minnesota who kidnaps and imprisons young women in his dank torture dungeon, damaging their hearing in order to play out his compulsions. The twist is that Marshall and his colleagues, including police commissioner Harper (a slumming Stanley Tucci) and forensic psychologist Rachel (Alexandra Daddario), appear to capture the killer within the first half-hour. He is a weedy gibbering shell of man named Simon (Brendan Fletcher, chewing carpet, linoleum, astrotur) who was himself the victim of terrible childhood trauma. Rachel reckons that Simon has a disassociative personality disorder and if she could get one of his alternate personalities to talk to her they could crack innumerable cold cases. Meanwhile, Ben Kingsley plays a retired judge turned vigilante \u2013 with an absurdly sophisticated aptitude for hi-tech gadgets and seemingly unlimited financial resources \u2013 who is working with beauty bait Eliana Jones to lure sexual predators into their trap so they can castrate them. The storylines inevitably intersect. Of course, there\u2019s a big daft twist that the writers of Scooby-Doo might have looked askance at. This is such twaddle it becomes kind of fun, except that there\u2019s an uncomfortable feeling \u2013 as with many vigilante movies \u2013 that the film is revelling in the sexual violence and covering itself with the fig leaf of justice-seeking. \u2022 Night Hunter is released in the UK on 13 September.",

What the member for Isaacs is doing a casting a smear on Chinese-Australians.

He, of course, was asked about <strong>Gladys Liu</strong>. From the transcript:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, I think there\u2019s three separate issues there. I mean, Andrew Bolt\u2019s a great interviewer and it\u2019s his job to make politicians look a bit unsteady from time to time, and he\u2019s done that to me, does that to the best of us \u2013 he\u2019s a great interviewer. </p> <p>The fact that Gladys Liu declines to adopt precisely Andrew Bolt\u2019s descriptive legislation of the Chinese government, that isn\u2019t her doing something negative for Australia. I put to you this proposition: that\u2019s actually her doing something in Australia\u2019s interest. It\u2019s not in Australia\u2019s interest to adopt precisely the language that was used on that show to describe the Chinese government when other accurate and alternative language is available. </p> <p>With respect to the South China sea, she said she absolutely puts Australia\u2019s interests first, which might be in some people\u2019s view an unsophisticated way of saying that she supports Australian policy. But nevertheless, that\u2019s what it is. </p> <p>With respect to these three organisations, she was asked about three organisations. One of them she said that she had previously been the honorary president of. One of them she was asked whether she was presently the honorary president, and she said she wasn\u2019t, which was correct. The third organisation she said firstly that she couldn\u2019t recall whether she was a member, and then afterwards said that she hadn\u2019t been a member. She was clearly confused. She\u2019s corrected that in a statement. </p> <p>But the fact of being previously a member of the Guangdong Overseas Exchange Association \u2013 as I said in parliament this morning, that doesn\u2019t make you a communist, that doesn\u2019t make you a traitor, that doesn\u2019t make you not a fit and proper person to be a member of parliament. A very similar organisation sponsored the travel of the member for McMahon \u2013 the Labor member for McMahon \u2013 to China who\u2019s met with Communist party officials.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T04:08:12.784Z\">at 5.08am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d79c1858f082514879f2871\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T03:54:52.411Z\">4.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The vegan terrorist bill has passed the Senate. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d79c0cf8f08143ee1ae4afa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T03:53:07.948Z\">4.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Given <strong>Peter Dutton\u2019s</strong> earlier claims about the Biloela family, this is a good point <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/04/biloela-tamil-family-deportation-case-the-truth-behind-the-claims\">(although there are journalists who have fact checked Dutton\u2019s claims)</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sallyrugg/status/1171994117271781376\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The asylum claims of Pryia - whose former fianc\u00e9 was burnt alive in front of her - and Nades - who was conscripted to the Tamil Tigers as a child soldier - were processed by 2 public servants.<br><br>The courts have assessed if correct bureaucratic was followed-not their asylum claims.</p>&mdash;

It would provide a much-needed forum for a comprehensive and sober discussion of this hugely important relationship, and involve the full range of expertise and interests from within and outside the Australian government. While government agency briefings are important, they are only part of the wide range of information and views a Senate inquiry may consider.</p> <p>\u201cIf Labor is not now prepared to support the proposed inquiry, there will little doubt that behind their current political bluster relating to the controversy surrounding the federal member for Chisholm, <strong>Gladys Liu, </strong>they are running scared on the issue of China.</p> <p>\u201cObviously it would also be good if the government came on board as well, but their inclinations still appear to be to suppress any debate and discussion on China policy.</p> <p>\u201cFurther political self-censorship about this key international relationship would not bode well for Australian democracy and sovereignty.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T03:57:25.660Z\">at 4.57am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d79be468f082514879f2865\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T03:41:13.147Z\">4.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is almost question time.</p> <p>Or, in this case, the <strong>Gladys Liu</strong> hour. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d79bcc68f082514879f2852\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T03:35:03.360Z\">4.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Stop sending me your Pokemon Go defences.

I\u2019m not suggesting anything by your question that this is any sort of alliance or alignment in your reasoning for asking them. </p> <p>The Labor party has been saying that these are questions the government has to answer today. </p> <p>Anyone who sits around the national security committee of cabinet table, and anyone who takes the management of our national security issues and how we deal with security agencies seriously, and to ensure that that is never compromised, to ensure that it is always carefully attended to, always knows that you are never in a position to be able to offer commentary on inquiries of that nature. </p> <p>That would be to undermine absolutely the nature of the relationship between agencies and the government.

So why do they raise it? They seek to smear an Australian of Chinese heritage simply for the fact that she did a clumsy interview. Now if that were the case the entire Labor frontbench would have to resign. She gave a clumsy interview. Fair enough. She is in her first term. She has been here for a few weeks and I think she should be extended some comfort and support. </p> <p>I know full well what Gladys Liu had to overcome to get here. I remember sitting in the chamber and listening to her maiden speech. </p> <p>It was a story of great Australian success and you know, Australians of Chinese heritage, regardless I think of their political persuasion, celebrated the fact that we had the first Chinese-born Australian woman in our parliament and I think Labor should think carefully at the way they\u2019re dressing up a political attack on Gladys Liu and I think they should reconsider the line that they\u2019ve taken.

Now she is a part of her community and as anyone in this building knows, particularly in communities of Chinese-Australian, there are many, many different organisations and those organisations confer membership on lots of different people, oftentimes without their knowledge, but these organisations are part of the community. </p> <p>Indeed, her Labor candidate at that very same election was a member of at least two of the organisations that Gladys has been a member of. </p> <p>Let me tell you what Gladys Liu hasn\u2019t done. She hasn\u2019t had someone pay for her legal expenses which we understand was up to about $40,000 in the case that Labor wants to create an equivalency over. </p> <p>She didn\u2019t take travel expenses personally. She didn\u2019t stand at a lectern like this in Sydney with a crest on the front of it with a person who paid for those expenses and advocate for a change in her party\u2019s policy on the sensitive issue of the South China sea. She didn\u2019t do any of these things. </p> <p>Gladys Liu is part of a community. She is a great Australian. What I am very concerned about \u2013 very concerned about \u2013 given what I have just outlined to you about her background. There is 1.2 million Australians of Chinese heritage in this country. This has a very grubby undertone in terms of the smear that is being placed on Gladys Liu and I think people should reflect very carefully in the way they have sought to attack Gladys over this matter and the broader smear that I think is implied in that to over more than one million Australians.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T01:46:22.856Z\">at 2.46am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d7998fc8f082514879f2793\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T01:03:00.840Z\">2.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And just on that, Labor\u2019s <strong>Tanya Plibersek</strong> pointed to the party holding firm on its climate change policy, if nothing else, in a doorstop interview a little earlier:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The leader has made it very clear \u2013 Anthony has made it very clear \u2013 that all of our policies are up for re-examination ... </p> <p>\u201cBut I would say Labor party members are proud of our ambitious climate change agenda and it\u2019s really the government that should be answering questions about what is happening with climate change policy in Australia. We have got a government \u2013 I mean I have literally lost count of how many energy policies they\u2019ve had. I don\u2019t know if we are up to 15 or 16 and what we know about those policies is power prices are still going up, pollution is still going up, we are spending billions of dollars of taxpayers\u2019 money and achieving none of the objectives that the government has set itself. Energy prices are up, and pollution is up. </p> <p>\u201cWe need in this country certainty for people to invest in new electricity generation capacity. We know that renewables are getting cheaper all the time. We need to act strongly in Australia to reduce our pollution, and that has the added benefit of reducing power prices for households. There is a reason that people are putting solar panels and batteries on their homes: renewables are becoming cheaper all the time.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>So saying all of that, you would be opposed to changing the reductions target that Labor took to the last election?</p> <p> <strong>TP:</strong> We are years out from the next election. Our leader has made it very clear that we are looking at all of our policies and we are not in any rush to make these sorts of announcements. </p> <p>\u201cWhat I would say is that Australians understand that we need to act decisively on climate change or we are leaving our grandchildren a diminished planet. I\u2019d also say it is up to the government, that the government actually needs to have an energy policy and a climate change policy. We have people in this government today who are still saying that they\u2019re not really sure whether manmade climate change is actually a thing. I mean, truly, in 2019 we\u2019ve got government ministers who aren\u2019t really sure whether the overwhelming evidence, scientific evidence, the overwhelming scientific opinion around the world \u2013 they aren\u2019t really sure whether that\u2019s right or not.

And the other point to make is that Jennifer Yang isn\u2019t here. Gladys Liu is. Gladys Liu was sworn in as the member for Chisholm and represents that constituency in this parliament, right now, and forms part of the government\u2019s majority. It is absolutely essential given the seriousness of the allegations that have been made in the papers this morning that the prime minister provides an answer to the Australian people on these questions immediately and I would imagine that from Gladys Liu\u2019s point of view she would want those answers given straight away.

      "bodyText": "And on that note, I am going to wrap it all up for this week, because the internet issues have driven me to the brink of a Michael McCormack (and the House is adjourning). A massive thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp for all their work, and to those behind the scenes, for keeping me, and the blog, all going. Next week we will no doubt be talking again about Gladys Liu. Scott Morrison is also off to the United States to see Donald Trump. And the Nationals are holding their federal council meeting in Canberra this weekend, which should mean some gossip is floating around by Monday as well. We\u2019ll bring you everything that happens, in the chamber and out (as long as the internet is working. If not, I guess I\u2019ll be sending smoke signals). Thank you to everyone for spending time with us this week. If you have a moment, check on someone to see if they need to chat. Not just because it is R U OK? Day, but because we all need to look out for each other. I\u2019ll be back on Monday, bright and early and caffeinated to the hilt. In the meantime, as always \u2013 take care of you. Russell Broadbent is telling the chamber that \u201cprinciples are important\u201d as is the rule of law. It seems to be an announcement \u2013 he may not always stand with the government on issues. Interesting. Russell Broadbent is making an interesting speech in the adjournment debate in the chamber right now. He says his job is not to follow the whims of the party leader of the day and that he needs to follow his judgment. \u201cI always in essence in the end, when it comes down to it, I offer the people I represent, this parliament and this nation, my judgment on any particular issue,\u201d he says. Broadbent has spoken out against mandatory detention as well as wanting Newstart increased. Here\u2019s the moment David Littleproud rediscovered science, but not necessarily the whole truth about how he got himself into the mess in the first place (which was through a written response to a question on whether he believed climate change was manmade, to which he answered, in writing, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d but sure, go off about being imaginarily interrupted). The speaker, Tony Smith, confirmed just after question time that the Gladys Liu statement would not count as misleading parliament, in the event it is found to be incorrect, because it came from outside the parliament. So it doesn\u2019t count towards the Hansard record, no matter who tabled it. Which makes sense. People table documents all the time, and it doesn\u2019t become Hansard. There is no suggestion the statement is incorrect, or could be. Tony Burke was just trying to clear up whether it was subject to the same privileges rules. Penny Wong during the attempt to suspend standing orders, on the government\u2019s response to Gladys Liu: I will say this: there is only one person who is making these specific and serious concerns about the member for Chisholm an issue about race, and that is Scott Morrison. There is only one person who is linking these specific, serious concerns about the member for Chisholm to the entire Chinese-Australian population, and that is Mr Morrison. This is the prime minister who is using this issue as a shield from accountability to the parliament and the Australian people. The prime minister is hiding behind the entire Chinese-Australian community to avoid saying why he has ignored warnings from our national security agencies. Can I say that is one of the lowest acts I have seen in all my time in this place \u2013 that you would use Chinese-Australians in order to avoid answering questions about why you are ignoring advice from national security agencies. Because of what the prime minister has done, it is more important than ever for Chinese-Australians and our inclusive democracy for these specific concerns to be addressed, because all of us in this place must be able to provide a public assurance that we have no conflict of interest in serving the Australian people. That is a basic democratic requirement. And I would say to the minister: if you avoid this motion, if you avoid coming in to give a statement that provides the assurance that senator Payne has repeatedly declined to give \u2013 that Ms Liu is a fit and proper person to sit in this parliament \u2013 it really says that you do not understand the role you have in this democracy.\u201d Question time, as seen by Mike Bowers. Not sure if Stirling Griff was in the chamber for that one, but Rex Patrick voted against suspending standing orders. Jacqui Lambie and One Nation voted with Labor and the Greens. The motion to suspend standing orders was tied \u2013 and then lost \u2013 because when there is a tie in the Senate, the status quo remains (in this case, not to suspend standing orders). OK, before I burn my computer because of the internet issues I have been having all week, Rex Patrick supports the substance of the motion, but not the motion to suspend standing orders. Over in the Senate, Centre Alliance has announced it will support Labor\u2019s motion to suspend standing orders. Question time ends with a \u201cGo Sharks.\u201d That happened. *Contacts Elon, leaves planet* Scott Morrison has just taken a dixer about the mining tax. What even is this. Sorry, not a dixer. It was a question from Joel Fitzgibbon: \u201cWhen will the PM introduce legislation into the parliament to establish the biosecurity import levy that he promised in the 2018-19 budget? Why has he already banked the $300m in revenue to prop up his budget bottom line?\u201d (Phil Coorey at the Fin has taken this issue on with gusto.) Morrison answered with a response on the mining tax. Again, what even is this. In the Senate, Labor is moving to suspend standing orders. Penny Wong has put forward this motion: I move that \u2013 (1) The Senate notes widespread reports in the media about the member for Chisholm this week which raise questions concerning her fitness to be a member of the Australian parliament. (2) At 12.20pm on 16 September 2019, before government business is called on: (a) requires the minister representing the prime minister (senator Cormann) to provide, for no more than 20 minutes: i. an explanation of the government\u2019s response to the allegations raised against the member for Chisholm, and ii. an assurance to the Senate that the member for Chisholm is a fit and proper person to remain a member of the Australian parliament; and (b) a senator may, at the conclusion of the minister\u2019s explanation, move without notice, that the Senate take note of the explanation. Sarah Martin, who is in the chamber, tells me Gladys Liu is crying. Mark Dreyfus to Scott Morrison: Did the PM receive any advice about the current member for Chisholm from government agencies before or since the May 18 election?\u201d There is some back and forth over whether or not the prime minister can answer a question involving security advice, but Tony Smith rules it in order. Morrison: Your ruling on the matter makes clear that just as the member did yesterday in coming to this dispatch box, that on this occasion that member has come to the dispatch box again, particularly given what the attorney general has set out, with the very clear knowledge that he would know, as I would know, having sat around the national committee of cabinet table for five of the last six years, that on no occasion would any responsible minister and in particular a PM go into any operational matters regarding Asio or any of these intelligence agencies. So what is the intent of the question? The intent is to infer, infer against a member of this House, a disloyalty to this country, and that member has in some way been the subject of some investigation. And that member knows, who raised this question, that member knows that by simply coming up here and speaking to smear a member, knowing that the PM is not in a position to make comment on these matters, that he hopes the mud sticks. Now, Mr Speaker, what this member is doing here in seeking a smear a member and I refer to the member for Chisholm, the member for Chisholm who has probably done more than anyone else in this place, but like many to overcome barriers in her life to overcome discrimination, to overcome domestic violence, to overcome disability, and there are members on the other side of the House who I applaud for doing exactly the same thing. Now the member for Isaacs should take a good hard look at himself and he should have a good hard look at the 1.2 million Australians who will see exactly what he is doing to Australians of Chinese descent. Just because someone was born in China doesn\u2019t make them disloyal. What the member for Isaacs is doing a casting a smear on Chinese-Australians. But this is not unknown in the Labor party, because we remember Michael Daley, the former Labor leader before the last state election, on most of those remain silent: \u201cAsian migrants taking our jobs.\u201d That\u2019s what the Labor party wreaks of. She\u2019s a great Australian who deserves to be in this house [which is more than I can say for the member for Issacs].\u201d Mark Dreyfus to Scott Morrison: \u201cYesterday the PM specifically referred to the media statement released by the member for Chisholm. Is the report by journalist Sam Maiden correct that the PM\u2019s office prepared that statement? What steps did the PM or his office take to verify the information contained in the statement?\u201d Morrison: \u201cI have the statement. I\u2019m happy to table the statement for the benefit of the House as I indicated I would do earlier today when I addressed the press. \u201cThis is a statement made by the member for Chisholm.\u201d Angus Taylor, who can\u2019t answer questions on the details and impacts on Australia\u2019s ACTUAL emissions reduction policy, is attacking Labor for not having answers on the details and impacts of a policy which is not being enacted. Mark Butler has a follow up question for David Littleproud: My question is to the minister for drought and various other things. And I refer to the minister\u2019s earlier answer. And also to an article in the Guardian in which the minister responded to written questions about whether or not there was a link between human activity and climate change and he responded that he was not convinced about that. Does he still hold that view? Littleproud: I thank the honourable member for his question. With respect to my response: I accept the science. I\u2019m just a poor humble bloke with a year 12 education but I\u2019m prepared to accept, prepared to accept what our scientists are telling us. As simple as that.\u201d A \u201cpoor, humble bloke\u201d who just happens to be helping to shape our climate change response. That new planet is looking better every minute. And here is the exchange he says he was interrupted in. David Speers: You say the climate is changing and that is certainly true. The question is: is this manmade climate change? David Littleproud: I have no idea, but does it really matter? DS: Sorry, you have no idea whether ... DL: I am not a scientist. I haven\u2019t made an opinion one way or the other, but I don\u2019t think it really matters. DS: Sorry, I just want to be really clear on this. You are not sure whether manmade climate change is real? DL: I am going to be honest with you. I don\u2019t have an opinion, but I don\u2019t think it really matters. I think these extremes from both sides have taken away the maturity of debate we should have about keeping, simply, a clean environment and making sure we give our people the tools they [need to address it]. Just on that answer from David Littleproud there, Paul Karp\u2019s article which was followed up by David Speers, leading to that \u201cinterrupted exchange\u201d was based on an emailed question to Littleproud\u2019s office. Here was the emailed question sent to Littleproud: Q: Parts of Queensland that are not expected to burn are now burning. The overall fire danger index has increased for most of southern Australia over the past 40 years and the bushfire and natural hazards cooperative research centre says the trend is expected to continue. It says the frequency of really bad fire days like those on Ash Wednesday or Black Saturday will increase. It says we need to prepare for that. Given that expert advice, why step around the human contribution to climate change as the minister did yesterday on the ABC (by arguing whether climate change is manmade or not \u201cis irrelevant\u201d)? And here is the emailed answer: \u201cI don\u2019t know if climate change is manmade. \u201cI\u2019m about practical outcomes. Whether that\u2019s about having a cleaner environment or giving farmers and emergency services the right tools to adapt. \u201cI am responsible for making sure we have the tools we need to adapt to a changing climate.\u201d Justine Elliot to David Littleproud: The minister was asked, \u201cJust to be clear on this, you\u2019re not sure manmade climate change is real?\u201d The minister responded, \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d The Washington Post leads with the headline Australia\u2019s natural disaster minister doubts manmade climate change is real. Does the minister still doubt the science? Littleproud: Let me make this clear. I accept the science ... (the Labor side of the House arcs up). ... I thank the member for her question. Let me make it clear. I accept the science on manmade impact on climate change. Always have. The interview that was taking place was interrupted by a division. And I wasn\u2019t able to finish my response. Let me make it clear: I have a track record with respect to climate change. The future fund, the drought future fund, the $5bn future fund that will be paid, part of that $100m dividend has a response around climate adaptation for our farmers, equipping our farmers with the tools to be able to adapt to a changing clime. That is what my record is. My record in relation to the budget last year was to get a stewardship fund, a $34m project that will see our farmers rewarded for the stewardship of our land, protecting their environment. This is a debate about protecting our environment, having cleaner air. I believe in it. I\u2019ve led it.\u201d It\u2019s another question to Michael McCormack, from his new best mate, Joel Fitzgibbon, because politics in 2019 means hugging in front of the cameras when a 2GB radio host tells you to, apparently: \u201cI refer him to the answer he gave yesterday with respect to the terrible drought impacting upon our farmers and our rural communities. In six years the government has appointed a drought coordinator, a drought taskforce, and the member for New England as the drought envoy. Deputy PM, why hasn\u2019t the government ever made any of these reports available to the parliament? McCormack: Mr Speaker, reports are one thing. Getting on the ground and doing the real work, the real work that regional Australia wants and expects and deserves is another thing. We have been very responsible, as a government, to help our regional communities through this drought.\u201d He continues with more buzzwords. Anthony Albanese asks him to stick to the question\u2019s relevancy. McCormack: Indeed, Mr Speaker, they have reported to government and government has acted accordingly to their advice and that has been important, and I also commend the member for New England for his role as the drought envoy. Indeed, we cannot make it rain. If we could we would have. These are desperate times for farmers throughout Queensland, farmers throughout New South Wales. Indeed in the member for Parkes\u2019 electorate they have destocked. There are farming communities on their knees. He is working hard, as we all are. I appreciate parts of your electorate are not affected by this drought as much as ours but we are working very, very hard. Whether it\u2019s Victoria, South Australia. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve provided a million dollars to 110 councils throughout the drought-affected community to keep employment generating in their towns. To keep money in their towns. We can, as I said, and we must and will do more to help those drought communities. And I know the farm household assistance has provided valuable assistance to those farming families and getting rural financial councillors around the table to talk to farming families.\u201d Fitzgibbon asks him to table those reports he referred to, but he doesn\u2019t have to. Josh Frydenberg takes a lickspittle where he again refers to Wayne Swan as \u201cChairman Swan\u201d and siggggghh. Now Labor starts up on the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, who has also defended Gladys Liu by saying she has been \u201cclear and open about her associations\u201d and \u201cproactively disassociated herself\u201d from organisations that claimed her as a member without her knowledge or consent. Asked by Kimberley Kitching if she had received security briefings about Liu, Payne refused to comment on engagement with intelligence and security agencies or private conversations with colleagues. Asked if Liu is a fit and proper person to sit in parliament, Payne replied: \u201cI have said that twice. I am not sure quite what it is senator Kitching seeks to imply. If she is intending to advance some alternative proposition, then they should actually say it. If not, she should stop attempting to smear a member of the House of Representatives.\u201d Payne then suggested that Labor was \u201cuncomfortable\u201d about having similar associations, and the mess of the developer donations allegations heard in the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption. McCormack: \u201cBut he\u2019s a good man. Good St Michael\u2019s Regional high school, Wagga Wagga, boy. The PM is a good man too. They\u2019re both very, very good. They both want the best for our country. And the Reserve Bank governor, Dr Philip Lowe, he\u2019s called for continued spending on infrastructure projects including rail, on bridges, on roads. He understands that, yes, building infrastructure is helping the economy. \u201cThat\u2019s why under the Morrison government we\u2019ve got a $100bn plan. Those opposite could only have hoped when it was the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years they could have had anywhere near the millions to spend on infrastructure that\u2019s getting Australians home sooner and safer. \u201cWe are working with the states and territories. I don\u2019t really care what their political persuasion is. If it helps to build infrastructure, to save people\u2019s lives, to make sure that we get the roads, the bridges, the rail that we need, then we\u2019re happy to do it. And we are doing it. \u201cIndeed, the PM was just in Melbourne just last week talking to premier Andrews, a Labor premier ... Catherine King interrupts to say the question was about which one [statement] was right. McCormack: Pardon me for correcting your grammar, but it wouldn\u2019t be which, it would be who. People are actually who. I was taught a lot in English [he names his English teacher]. I\u2019m sure she taught Philip Lowe as well. Both the Reserve Bank governor and indeed the PM are both right for putting forward our infrastructure plan for this nation.\u201d There is more, but I am distracted by a memory from my own English classes, where we studied Much Ado About Nothing: Four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed with one: so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left, to be known a reasonable creature.\u201d Catherine King brings Michael McCormack back to the despatch box and the chamber is once again filled with beige noise. Last week the PM said, \u201cWe\u2019re really starting to hit our head on the ceiling in terms of how much infrastructure work you can get under way at any one time.\u201d But the Reserve Bank governor says, and I quote, \u201cWe can do more.\u201d Deputy PM, who is right? McCormack: Well, Mr Speaker, the Reserve Bank governor\u2019s a good fella. I went to school with him. He was the dux of the school. Something I never achieved.\u201d No shit, Sherlock. Honestly, white noise has more of an impact. George Christensen is the latest to inflict Michael McCormack upon us and, in what has become McCormack tradition, includes the reference to the \u201cMorrison-McCormack government\u201d, which is the only time it is ever used. The deputy prime minister is attempting to talk about the carbon tax, but there is still a tub of cream cheese sitting on my desk from my lunch and it\u2019s a bit hard to tell them apart. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Does the PM agree with the Reserve Bank governor that, and I quote: \u201cThe challenge we face in monetary policy is carrying too much of a burden?\u201d When economic growth is the slowest it\u2019s been since the global financial crisis, why has the government left all of the heavy lifting to the Reserve Bank? Morrison: Mr Speaker, I\u2019m happy to respond to the member\u2019s question and simply quote the Reserve Bank governor again in his testimony before the House economics committee on 9 August this year, where he says: \u201cI 100% agree with you that the Australian economy is growing.\u201d Sorry, a press conference with the treasurer on 11 July. \u201cI agree 100% with you that the Australian economy is growing and the fundamentals are strong.\u201d The outlook is being supported by our lower interest rates, by our tax cuts, by higher levels of investment in infrastructure, by a pick-up in the resources sector and the stabilisation of the housing market in Sydney and Melbourne. But I don\u2019t think we should forget more Australians have jobs today than ever before in Australian history and that\u2019s a remarkable achievement and I also agree with you that a priority is to make sure that Australia remains a great place for business to expand, innovate, invest and employ people and I\u2019m sure we can do that, Mr Speaker. The first lickspittle is about how amazing Liberals are at supporting multicultural Australia. The Labor leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, has asked whether the prime minister received any security advice about Gladys Liu. The government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, responded that preselections are matters for the party organisations: \u201cI am not aware of any such advice being received, but out of an abundance of caution, to be 100% sure, I\u2019ll take that question on notice.\u201d He said it was \u201cirresponsible\u201d to ask if Scott Morrison had sought advice today. \u201cThe prime minister has full confidence in the member of Chisholm. This is nothing but an attempt at a Labor smear.\u201d Cormann suggested that Labor\u2019s candidate in Chisholm, Jenny Yang, was a member of similar organisations, which sets Wong off. She says it is \u201ccowardly to smear someone who isn\u2019t in the parliament\u201d and Cormann should answer the \u201cserious national security questions raised on the front page of the paper\u201d. Cormann rejected the view there are \u201cserious national security issues at stake\u201d arguing it was simply a \u201cclumsy interview\u201d by a new MP of Chinese descent. Liu is \u201cabsolutely suitable\u201d and was duly elected by the people of Chisholm. \u201cThe prime minister has full confidence in the member for Chisholm, as people expressed their confidence in member for Chisholm at the election. All this is the seven stages of grief of the Labor party. You can\u2019t accept that you lost the election, and you lost the election in Chisholm too.\u201d Someone misses the call and Brendan O\u2019Connor gets the next question. It\u2019s to Josh Frydenberg: When the Reserve Bank of Australia is calling for improved wages growth, why has this government presided over the worst wages growth on record? Frydenberg: The honourable member would like to know that when Labor was last in office for three out of six years minimum wages fell. The real minimum wage fell. Now, Mr Speaker, under us, under the Coalition, every year real minimum wages have gone up, Mr Speaker. I repeat that for the honourable member. Under Labor, in three out of the six years that they were in office, real minimum fell. Under us, every year, real minimum wages went up. Now to educate the honourable member from the other side of the House, inflation today is 1.6%, Mr Speaker. Inflation today is 1.6%. But the wages price index which is a euphemism* for wages growth was 2.3%. Mr Speaker, the reality is that real wages have been going up, Mr Speaker. The reality is that under our government, lower taxes are creating more jobs and higher wages, Mr Speaker. And if Labor ever got their time in government, $387bn of high taxes would have reduced wages and cost jobs. It doesn\u2019t matter what the question is, for Labor the answer is always higher taxes. * I don\u2019t think this means what Frydenberg thinks it means. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question s addressed to the PM. Does the PM agree with the Reserve Bank governor that the economy is being, and I quote him: \u201cWeighed down by a protracted period of low income growth.\u201d Morrison: Mr Speaker, the challenge of getting incomes to rise in this country is not a new one. It\u2019s one the government has been working with with the Reserve Bank for many years. As treasurer I have had numerous engagements with the Reserve Bank governor about this very issue. And I can tell you that\u2019s why our government initiated the tax relief that we took through this parliament, not just in the most recent budget, but in the budgets before that because we wanted to ensure that Australians keep more of what they earn. In the most recent quarterly figures, the most recent quarterly figures, 0.7% was real wage growth through the year. That\u2019s higher than what we inherited from the Labor party in their last year, when they were in government, and ensuring that we continue to grow wages is a function of implementing our economic plan.\u201d There is more, but you have heard it all before. Peter Dutton will miss question time for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d. Mehreen Faruqi has responded to the vegan terrorist bill being passed by the Senate: This bill is an absolute fraud. It\u2019s nothing more than ag-gag legislation aimed at protecting big agribusiness from scrutiny at the cost of animal welfare and the community\u2019s right to know and protest. The Greens are proud to oppose laws aimed at stamping out protest and jailing activists and whistleblowers. We should be passing national animal welfare laws with real accountability and enforcement to protect animals, not taking another step down the road to a police state. Rather than improving animal welfare laws and practices, this government is obsessed with attacking those that expose horrific mistreatment of animals. They are on the wrong side of history. It\u2019s shameful that Labor is lock, stock and barrel with the government in supporting this draconian bill.\u201d And for everyone telling me how Pokemon Go is still cool, here you go: the moment it became part of our Hansard record. Senate question time has begun though, and Penny Wong is straight into the issue of Gladys Liu. Paul Karp will have something on that for you very soon Ahead of question time, Scott Morrison is making a statement by indulgence on R U OK? Day. Anthony Albanese will also make a statement on this. Christian Porter spoke to his local Perth radio station, 6PR, this morning. He, of course, was asked about Gladys Liu. From the transcript: Well, I think there\u2019s three separate issues there. I mean, Andrew Bolt\u2019s a great interviewer and it\u2019s his job to make politicians look a bit unsteady from time to time, and he\u2019s done that to me, does that to the best of us \u2013 he\u2019s a great interviewer. The fact that Gladys Liu declines to adopt precisely Andrew Bolt\u2019s descriptive legislation of the Chinese government, that isn\u2019t her doing something negative for Australia. I put to you this proposition: that\u2019s actually her doing something in Australia\u2019s interest. It\u2019s not in Australia\u2019s interest to adopt precisely the language that was used on that show to describe the Chinese government when other accurate and alternative language is available. With respect to the South China sea, she said she absolutely puts Australia\u2019s interests first, which might be in some people\u2019s view an unsophisticated way of saying that she supports Australian policy. But nevertheless, that\u2019s what it is. With respect to these three organisations, she was asked about three organisations. One of them she said that she had previously been the honorary president of. One of them she was asked whether she was presently the honorary president, and she said she wasn\u2019t, which was correct. The third organisation she said firstly that she couldn\u2019t recall whether she was a member, and then afterwards said that she hadn\u2019t been a member. She was clearly confused. She\u2019s corrected that in a statement. But the fact of being previously a member of the Guangdong Overseas Exchange Association \u2013 as I said in parliament this morning, that doesn\u2019t make you a communist, that doesn\u2019t make you a traitor, that doesn\u2019t make you not a fit and proper person to be a member of parliament. A very similar organisation sponsored the travel of the member for McMahon \u2013 the Labor member for McMahon \u2013 to China who\u2019s met with Communist party officials.\u201d The vegan terrorist bill has passed the Senate. Given Peter Dutton\u2019s earlier claims about the Biloela family, this is a good point (although there are journalists who have fact checked Dutton\u2019s claims). Centre Alliance aren\u2019t letting it drop either. Rebekha Sharkie was very strong on Labor\u2019s motion earlier today: Rex Patrick wants a whole inquiry into Australia\u2019s relationship with China: In light of political developments this week, I am more determined than ever to press for a comprehensive parliamentary review of Australia\u2019s relations with China. \u201cThis is a vital relationship and the parliament urgently needs to undertake a most rigorous inquiry to see how we can maximise benefit from a mutually beneficial trading relationship, but equally gain an understanding of where caution is warranted in Australia\u2019s national interest. \u201cOn Monday the Coalition government and Labor opposition joined together in an extraordinary and worrying instance of political self-censorship to block Centre Alliance\u2019s proposal that the Senate foreign affairs, defence and trade references committee conduct a holistic review of Australia\u2019s relations with China. \u201cLabor justified its position on the grounds that the shadow foreign affairs [spokeswoman], senator Penny Wong, had requested briefings for parliamentarians by relevant government agencies on Australia\u2019s relationship with China, and such an behind closed doors approach was apparently preferred. \u201cYesterday the foreign [affairs] minister, senator Marise Payne, gave the government\u2019s response, telling the Senate there will be no government agency briefings on China as requested by Labor, though she also noted that \u2018the foreign affairs, defence and trade committees\u2019 may receive \u2018extensive briefings\u2019 from agencies. \u201cIn these circumstances, the Labor opposition would be well advised to embrace Centre Alliance\u2019s proposed Senate inquiry and I have lodged a new motion for debate when parliament sits next week. \u201cThe proposed inquiry would be chaired by the foreign affairs, defence and trade references committee chairperson, Labor senator Kimberley Kitching. It would provide a much-needed forum for a comprehensive and sober discussion of this hugely important relationship, and involve the full range of expertise and interests from within and outside the Australian government. While government agency briefings are important, they are only part of the wide range of information and views a Senate inquiry may consider. \u201cIf Labor is not now prepared to support the proposed inquiry, there will little doubt that behind their current political bluster relating to the controversy surrounding the federal member for Chisholm, Gladys Liu, they are running scared on the issue of China. \u201cObviously it would also be good if the government came on board as well, but their inclinations still appear to be to suppress any debate and discussion on China policy. \u201cFurther political self-censorship about this key international relationship would not bode well for Australian democracy and sovereignty.\u201d It is almost question time. Or, in this case, the Gladys Liu hour. Stop sending me your Pokemon Go defences. It\u2019s over. This is why no one should ever indulge in name calling, even when it seems like a great marketing sell. \u201cShanghai Sam\u201d was a stupid way to refer to the Sam Dastyari issue then. And now. It\u2019s rare that Andrew Bolt gets a guernsey in these pages, but given his interview with Gladys Liu gave the whole issue legs, I\u2019ll include part of his response to Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference: There is 1.2 million Australians of Chinese heritage in this country. This has a very grubby undertone in terms of the smear that is being placed on Gladys Liu and I think people should reflect very carefully in the way they have sought to attack Gladys over this matter and the broader smear that I think is implied in that to over more than one million Australians. Extraordinary. Are the dictators in Beijing now writing Morrison\u2019s lines? Morrison is offensive not just to everyone asking legitimate questions about Liu\u2019s associations and untruths, from Asio to Labor, and including many journalists. It is also grossly offensive to every Chinese-Australian and every democracy dissident in China and Hong Kong. Morrison is in effect suggesting that criticism of someone close to China\u2019s Communist party is a criticism of every Chinese man and woman. As I said, Beijing couldn\u2019t have put that lie better than did Morrison today.\u201d People would still need to be playing it, for this to be a thing. Bridget McKenzie is now talking on this bill, reminding me why I very rarely watch the Senate. Labor is not backing down on the Gladys Liu issue. Penny Wong and Mark Dreyfus have just sent out this press release: Today there are extraordinary reports that senior Liberals were warned by security agencies that concerns about Gladys Liu\u2019s links to the Chinese Communist party made it \u2018unwise\u2019 to preselect her. One Government MP is quoted: \u2018There should have been concerns when she was being chosen to stand as a candidate and I believe those concerns were ignored.\u2019 These reports raise serious questions as to whether the prime minister and the Liberal party put winning marginal seats ahead of Australia\u2019s national security. This goes far beyond whether an interview was clumsy. It goes directly to the national interest. In light of these reports, the prime minister must urgently demonstrate to the Australian people what steps he took to ensure that Gladys Liu is in fact a fit and proper person to sit in the Australian parliament. It is in the interests of Chinese-Australian communities and our inclusive democracy for these specific concerns to be addressed. The only person linking these specific and serious concerns about Ms Liu to the entire Chinese-Australian population is Scott Morrison and he should stop. All parliamentarians must be able to provide assurance that they have no conflict of interest in serving the Australian people.\u201d In the Senate the government has lobbed in a last minute amendment to the so-called vegan terrorist bill. The amendment adds wood processing- and wood fibre-processing facilities to the definition of primary production businesses protected by the laws criminalising social media posts that incite trespass, a demand of the forestry industry that increases its remit beyond food production. On Tuesday the Labor caucus agreed to seek to amend the bill to address numerous concerns raised by Kim Carr in an inquiry examining it but \u2013 if these failed \u2013 ultimately to support it. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese ,told MPs that \u201cvegan terrorists\u201d were not part of Labor\u2019s constituency but trade unions were. This new amendment could pose a difficulty for Labor because it didn\u2019t go through caucus and expands the bill\u2019s remit to deterring organisation of environmental protests generally, not just those that could cause biosecurity concerns. Tim Beshara, federal policy director of The Wilderness Society, has responded to the new amendment: \u201cThis minute to midnight amendment makes clear that the government\u2019s intentions with this bill is to constrain and intimidate groups it disagrees with. \u201cIt\u2019s clear now, this bill was never about farmers, biosecurity and animal welfare, it was simply an identity politics crusade that has now been broadened from targeting activist vegans to targeting conservationists. Soon every group the government disagrees with will be on this list. \u201cWhen Labor signed off on passing this bill did that include the amendment targeting conservationists too? Are they onside with the government\u2019s legal intimidation of the people who care about the environment?\u201d Joel Fitzgibbon and Michael McCormack have \u201ccuddled\u201d in front of the cameras after yesterday\u2019s tantrums. In unrelated news, water has been discovered on a planet with earth-like temperatures, if you are looking for a change. And for those who missed it, here is the main message from Scott Morrison and his MPs The PMO has put out the transcript to the press conference Scott Morrison held. You may have seen a note that Morrison did not address this first part of the ABC\u2019s Andrew Probyn\u2019s question: Firstly, have you inquired with Gladys Liu as to the nature of her work with the Chinese Consulate down in Melbourne? And secondly, what advice, if any, have you received from security agencies about Gladys Liu\u2019s background or the people with whom she associated? There was as follow up: AP: What of my first question about the work with the Chinese Consulate? Morrison: There is no matter before me that would give me concern. Draft laws giving federal police more power to conduct identity checks at Australian airports are a step closer to being rubber-stamped, AAP reports. \u201cThe proposal passed through the lower house on Thursday with shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, pleased the legislation had been amended in line with recommendations from parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee,\u201d it said. \u201cThe recommendations include requiring police to publicly report how many times the powers are used and how many people miss flights as a consequence.\u201d Kristina Keneally, in an interview with ABC RN last week, raised the point that the Biloela family debate was straying into \u201canchor baby\u201d territory: This is an importation, quite frankly, of an American debate about so-called anchor babies, and the law is very different in the United States where citizenship is accorded to anybody born on American soil. That is not the law in Australia so it\u2019s an importation of that debate. No. The issue here, I would say, is that the Biloela community, Australians, have embraced this family, want them to be part of their community, have integrated them into the fabric of their community. It\u2019s not simply the act of having a child.\u201d Also in the Senate, Kristina Keneally has just had this motion passed: I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move that: 1) The Senate notes that: a. Paladin \u2013 the small company registered to a beach shack on Kangaroo Island which was awarded a $523m contract without a proper tender process \u2013 has been fined over one thousand times in eighteen months for failing to provide contracted services. b. The Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, Minister Cash, told the Senate on Tuesday 10 September 2019 that these fines \u201coften related to relatively minor administrative failures\u201d. c. Documents produced under order of the Senate revealed that the total abatement could have totalled $11 million, if not for monthly penalty limits. 2) There be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, by no later than 12:20pm on 16 September 2019: a. An unredacted copy of each Performance Management Report, which details the aforementioned fines, relating to Paladin\u2019s contract to provide services on Manus Island. b. A copy of the full report prepared by the Independent Health Advice Panel for the Second Quarter of 2019 in accordance with Section 199E of the Migration Act 1958. Which means the un-redacted Paladin documents and the full independent health panel report on medevac has to be tabled in parliament by Monday lunchtime. Over in the Senate Peter Dutton has phoned in for his regular love in with Ray Hadley on 2GB. They are still really cool friends, yadda, yadda, yadda. But then the home affairs minister gets into the Tamil family from Biloela. And, well, Dutton is going a new direction on this now. And it\u2019s not the direction Michelle Obama recommends we all take. He says the family\u2019s case has cost taxpayers \u201cliterally millions of dollars\u201d. \u201cThe matter has been to the high court. These people came by boat. It\u2019s been made clear to them at every turn that they were not going to stay in Australia and they still had children. We see that overseas in other countries, anchor babies so-called: the emotion of trying to leverage a migration outcome based on the children and they claim they have new grounds to test with the federal court in Victoria. \u201c... I regret to say I don\u2019t think this will be dealt with quickly. I think it will go on now for potentially a couple of months because lawyers will try and delay and that is part of a tactic. They think if they delay they can keep the pressure on the government and we\u2019ll change our mind in relation to this case.\u201d Hadley says his listeners in Biloela don\u2019t agree with the \u201cleft-wing advocates in the southern part of the continent\u201d. The assistant minister for superannuation and financial services, Jane Hume, has launched the Australian financial complaints authority roadshow in Canberra, along with its chair, Helen Coonan. Since December the authority \u2013 the \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d financial complaints body established by the Turnbull government when it was avoiding calling a banking royal commission \u2013 has received 60,000 complaints and resolved 73% of them, resulting in $144.7m of compensation being paid. At a doorstop, Hume said that rather than being surprised by the number of complaints she is surprised there aren\u2019t more, and the roadshow will lift the authority\u2019s profile so disgruntled customers know where to go. Hume also confirmed that not only is it still government policy to have an amnesty for employers who fail to pay superannuation but we should expect fresh legislation to do so \u201cimminently\u201d. Hume: \u201cIt is still our plan to go ahead with that superannuation guarantee amnesty that will allow companies that have inadvertently not paid the correct amount of superannuation to come forward to the tax office ... to make sure we can reunite as many people as possible with superannuation they haven\u2019t been paid.\u201d \u201cGrubby smear\u201d and \u201cclumsy interview\u201d is the official government line when it comes to Gladys Liu. Jane Hume is repeating it on Sky. Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, just told an off-the-record Australian Industry Group gathering at parliament that Australia is doing \u201cextremely well\u201d on its emissions reduction task. Taylor cited as evidence that Australia is expected to exceed its 2020 target by 367m tonnes but strangely neglected to mention that Australia\u2019s emissions are at a record high and still rising. In the context of the fact Scott Morrison won\u2019t attend the UN climate summit because Australia has no new emissions reduction goals to unveil, Taylor said that Australia \u2013 unlike other countries \u2013 does not \u201clecture\u201d at these international events. It just gets on and \u201cachieves\u201d. The rest of the speech rehearsed facts about strong investment in renewables in 2018, although as Katharine Murphy has reported this is set to drop off a cliff in 2020 because of a lack of certainty after the renewable energy target expires. This bullish view of the renewables scene was rebutted thoroughly by Labor\u2019s Mark Butler and the Greens Richard Di Natale at a Clean Energy Council event on Wednesday night, both of whom noted the success was despite rather than because of Coalition government policy. But at the AIG event Taylor was followed by the immigration minister, David Coleman, so it seems the business types wanted to hear a lot more from the re-elected Coalition than a bit of back and forth on what we\u2019re doing for the planet. On the British-Australian bloggers who have been detained in Iran, named as Jolie King and Mark Firkin, Scott Morrison said: I refer to the comments made by the foreign [affairs] minister. These are always very sensitive cases. They are never issues that are addressed well by offering public commentary on them and I note that in at least one of these cases that is a view that has been expressed by family members. \u201cWe will continue to pursue these matters in the interests of the Australians at the centre of these cases and we will do that carefully and in close consultation through our officials who have been part of this process now for some time. I will respect the wishes of the family and I will respect the best interests of those citizens.\u201d Question: [I\u2019ve been] involved in the reporting on [these issues] for the last four years. A lot of that involves China and we have been accused of racism from start to the finish of that. Clearly that is a concern the government has. How do you propose we report about this if it [does] involve some people who are members of the Chinese-Australian community? Morrison: What I think the problem here is Gladys Liu has given a clumsy interview. That is all that\u2019s happened here. There is no credible suggestion of any inappropriate behaviour in relation to Gladys Liu. What we\u2019re left with is just a grubby smear by the Labor party who is in one of their most desperate hours unable to explain their position on anything and so they have gone after a Chinese-Australian woman, the first so elected in this parliament. They should be celebrating their election, not attacking it. Question: You mentioned earlier some local Chinese community groups of which Ms Liu seems to have been a member. What concerns do you have about the China Overseas Exchange Association? It is not a local Chinese community group but an organ of the communist party of China. Morrison: We are looking at all these issues carefully in terms of the impact on Australia\u2019s interests and will take whatever action we have to ensure Australia\u2019s interests. Question: On the broader issue of the smoke and mirrors around the advice or otherwise from security agencies, do you think it is worth considering given the concern of foreign interference in Australia ensuring that all MPs undergo security clearances so the Australian people can be confident that everyone who is sitting in parliament has passed those security checks? Morrison: Honestly I don\u2019t think that is a practical suggestion given the broad range of candidates you have at any election. There are foreign interference laws in this place. We know because we introduced them and the standards are very clear and the agencies undertake their work as is appropriate and deal with the government on those matters as they think is appropriate. Question: Firstly, have you inquired with Gladys Liu as to the nature of her work with the Chinese consulate down in Melbourne? Secondly, what advice, if any, have you received from security agencies about Gladys Liu\u2019s background or the people with whom she associated? Morrison: Let me deal with the second question first because this is a very important question ... I\u2019m not suggesting anything by your question that this is any sort of alliance or alignment in your reasoning for asking them. The Labor party has been saying that these are questions the government has to answer today. Anyone who sits around the national security committee of cabinet table, and anyone who takes the management of our national security issues and how we deal with security agencies seriously, and to ensure that that is never compromised, to ensure that it is always carefully attended to, always knows that you are never in a position to be able to offer commentary on inquiries of that nature. That would be to undermine absolutely the nature of the relationship between agencies and the government. Anyone who would suggest that responding to a question like that in that way provides any inference in any way, shape or form, would know that that could not be done. What\u2019s worse, and I\u2019m not suggesting you are doing this at all, but I think there is a concern, given what we saw in the parliament yesterday, when Labor deliberately sought to ask questions, it would appear, as the speaker inferred, with a view to them not being able to be actually raised under the standing orders \u2013 simply to smear. Labor knows that that is the responsible answer to that question. So why do they raise it? They seek to smear an Australian of Chinese heritage simply for the fact that she did a clumsy interview. Now if that were the case the entire Labor frontbench would have to resign. She gave a clumsy interview. Fair enough. She is in her first term. She has been here for a few weeks and I think she should be extended some comfort and support. I know full well what Gladys Liu had to overcome to get here. I remember sitting in the chamber and listening to her maiden speech. It was a story of great Australian success and you know, Australians of Chinese heritage, regardless I think of their political persuasion, celebrated the fact that we had the first Chinese-born Australian woman in our parliament and I think Labor should think carefully at the way they\u2019re dressing up a political attack on Gladys Liu and I think they should reconsider the line that they\u2019ve taken. There is no matter before me that would give me concern. Question: Firstly, she has made that statement publicly but she hasn\u2019t made to the parliament. Why is she not required to do that or why are you not requiring her to do that? Secondly, do you advise your members not to have any association with these Chinese groups now? Are you saying this is racist? Morrison: I will let others draw their conclusions but what I do know is that \u2013 firstly, let me deal with your first point. I would be happy to table Gladys\u2019s statement she has made publicly in the parliament. I have no problem with that. [Let\u2019s] get into is this accusation by Labor in seeking to exploit this issue. Gladys is a Chinese-born Australian. Does that make her in cahoots with the Chinese Government? Of course not. It is a ridiculous suggestion and I think it is an insult to every single Chinese-Australian in this country. You know, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time \u2013 wouldn\u2019t be the first time \u2013 the Labor party has made comments like this in my home state of New South Wales. We all remember the last NSW state election. What did they say? \u201cAsians will take your jobs.\u201d The Labor party have to take a good, hard look at themselves as to why they are pursuing this matter. They might want to dress it up as national security but I think 1.2 million Australians of Chinese heritage get the point. I don\u2019t think they would be too fussed by it. Scott Morrison on Gladys Liu: Gladys Liu has made a very clear statement. Let\u2019s be clear. Gladys gave a clumsy interview. She is a new member of parliament. If that were the grounds for which people weren\u2019t sitting in the parliament, it would be a pretty empty place. None of you would have had a good story in your lives. There are clumsy interviews that are given from time to time. On this occasion one was given by a new member of parliament. Let me tell you about Gladys Liu. Gladys Liu, yes, was a Chinese-born Australian. Born in Hong Kong. Gladys has overcome incredible challenges to be a member of this place. She\u2019s overcome disability. She\u2019s overcome domestic violence. She\u2019s overcome the challenges that people from many different backgrounds in our ethnic communities face in this country to actually come through the ranks of our own party and to represent our party here and represent the people of Chisholm in this parliament. She is someone who has run a small business. She is someone who came here to get an education and has created a life here for her and her family. Now she is a part of her community and as anyone in this building knows, particularly in communities of Chinese-Australian, there are many, many different organisations and those organisations confer membership on lots of different people, oftentimes without their knowledge, but these organisations are part of the community. Indeed, her Labor candidate at that very same election was a member of at least two of the organisations that Gladys has been a member of. Let me tell you what Gladys Liu hasn\u2019t done. She hasn\u2019t had someone pay for her legal expenses which we understand was up to about $40,000 in the case that Labor wants to create an equivalency over. She didn\u2019t take travel expenses personally. She didn\u2019t stand at a lectern like this in Sydney with a crest on the front of it with a person who paid for those expenses and advocate for a change in her party\u2019s policy on the sensitive issue of the South China sea. She didn\u2019t do any of these things. Gladys Liu is part of a community. She is a great Australian. What I am very concerned about \u2013 very concerned about \u2013 given what I have just outlined to you about her background. There is 1.2 million Australians of Chinese heritage in this country. This has a very grubby undertone in terms of the smear that is being placed on Gladys Liu and I think people should reflect very carefully in the way they have sought to attack Gladys over this matter and the broader smear that I think is implied in that to over more than one million Australians. And just on that, Labor\u2019s Tanya Plibersek pointed to the party holding firm on its climate change policy, if nothing else, in a doorstop interview a little earlier: The leader has made it very clear \u2013 Anthony has made it very clear \u2013 that all of our policies are up for re-examination ... \u201cBut I would say Labor party members are proud of our ambitious climate change agenda and it\u2019s really the government that should be answering questions about what is happening with climate change policy in Australia. We have got a government \u2013 I mean I have literally lost count of how many energy policies they\u2019ve had. I don\u2019t know if we are up to 15 or 16 and what we know about those policies is power prices are still going up, pollution is still going up, we are spending billions of dollars of taxpayers\u2019 money and achieving none of the objectives that the government has set itself. Energy prices are up, and pollution is up. \u201cWe need in this country certainty for people to invest in new electricity generation capacity. We know that renewables are getting cheaper all the time. We need to act strongly in Australia to reduce our pollution, and that has the added benefit of reducing power prices for households. There is a reason that people are putting solar panels and batteries on their homes: renewables are becoming cheaper all the time.\u201d Q: So saying all of that, you would be opposed to changing the reductions target that Labor took to the last election? TP: We are years out from the next election. Our leader has made it very clear that we are looking at all of our policies and we are not in any rush to make these sorts of announcements. \u201cWhat I would say is that Australians understand that we need to act decisively on climate change or we are leaving our grandchildren a diminished planet. I\u2019d also say it is up to the government, that the government actually needs to have an energy policy and a climate change policy. We have people in this government today who are still saying that they\u2019re not really sure whether manmade climate change is actually a thing. I mean, truly, in 2019 we\u2019ve got government ministers who aren\u2019t really sure whether the overwhelming evidence, scientific evidence, the overwhelming scientific opinion around the world \u2013 they aren\u2019t really sure whether that\u2019s right or not. Come on.\u201d Just for a change of pace, the Greens are calling for David Littleproud to step down from his ministries after he said he didn\u2019t know whether manmade climate change was real or not. David Littleproud has admitted that he does not believe the accepted science that human action is driving climate change, so how can he possibly be responsible for oversight of the water resources, drought, natural disaster and emergency management portfolios?\u201d Richard Di Natale asked. \u201cThat\u2019s why the Greens are calling on minister Littleproud to do the right thing and immediately resign from the frontbench so that he can be replaced with someone who understands the science of climate change. If he refuses to do so, then Scott Morrison must stand him down. \u201cIf Scott Morrison won\u2019t remove minister Littleproud from the frontbench now that it\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t believe the overwhelming scientific evidence that manmade climate change is real, then the public would have no choice but to assume that the prime minister agrees with his position.\u201d I mean, obviously they are just discussing the Caroline Calloway article in the Cut. What is anyone else talking about? Sarah Henderson will be officially welcomed back by the prime minister in that press conference. She has just walked into the PMO for her briefing now. Seems like the ideal time to look at memes. I\u2019ve just heard from people within the chamber over what Tim Watts said that had him kicked out from the chamber under 94a during the debate to suspend standing orders: You\u2019ll regret this, Porter. It\u2019s going to come back and bite you on the arse.\u201d That\u2019ll do it. Scott Morrison has just called a press conference for 11am. It is in the Blue Room (the second most serious press conference location). It\u2019s the first one he has held all week. Gee, I wonder what it could be about? For those interested, all of the crossbench voted with Labor on that motion.* *I never really count Bob Katter as the crossbench. He very rarely gets involved. Totally normal sitting arrangement. Scott Morrison sat next to Gladys Liu during that vote. Optics, optics, optics. Motion to suspend standing orders ends. Ayes 68 Noes 72 Time on the debate concludes \u2013 the divisions begin. Even without Tim Watts, Labor was going to lose this one. Rebekha Sharkie is now speaking on the motion. She says the motion goes to \u201cconfidence\u201d of MPs in the parliament and urges the government not to use its numbers to \u201crun a protection racket\u201d. Sharkie says the motion is \u201csimply calling on the member to make a statement\u201d to the parliament, to clear up her comments to Andrew Bolt. \u201cThe trust, the confidence, the integrity of this place rides on this matter \u2013 don\u2019t think it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Sharkie says. Christian Porter says the motion is an \u201coutrageous slur\u201d on the first Chinese-born MP in the parliament. \u201cAt the end of the day, you would have someone excluded from the parliament because of their heritage, and associations with that heritage,\u201d Porter says. Tony Smith has already issued the 94a warning and reminded MPs that they might want to be around for the vote. But they keep going, so Smith then uses it. Tim Watts is kicked out. Christian Porter points out that Chris Bowen travelled to China as a guest of the Guangdong Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Communist party in 2015. He asks if Bowen is under question for his associations. Christian Porter is up and arguing against the motion. He opens with: It\u2019s pretty awful stuff, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s pretty awful stuff. Earlier this week we had a condolence for the last living member of the Menzies government, who helped unravel the white Australia policy, and all these years later ... All these years later, this is where we are. What a lovely way to spend the morning. And there are two \u2013 there are two fundamental propositions ... There are two propositions that have been put by members opposite. The first proposition is this: Is that if you are associated in any way with one of the three organisations, or, indeed, others like them, that somehow you are not a fit and proper member of parliament. That\u2019s the proposition. And the three organisations ... That\u2019s precisely the proposition that you are putting. And here are the three organisation that is are in question. The Guangdong Overseas Exchange Association. The Australian General Commercial Association. And United Chinese Commerce Association. The fundamental proposition that they are putting is that a Chinese Australian, with a wonderful heritage, who overcame domestic violence, who came to this country, who came to this country and has natural associations with Chinese organisations, by virtue of those associations, is not a fit and proper person to be here. The question is, are you fit and proper people to be here, when you run arguments like that? That\u2019s the central question. For those wondering, there were 1,090 votes in the Chisholm count. I think, after Macquarie, it is the second slimmest margin in the country. Mark Dreyfus says the government needs to hold Gladys Liu to the same standard it held Sam Dastyari: It suited the current prime minister of Australia at that time to say that there was a lack of patriotism on the part of that senator because of the statements that he had made about the conduct of the People\u2019s Republic of China in the South China Sea. Now we have a Liberal member of parliament, a recently elected Liberal member of parliament who has said something virtually identical to the statements made by that former senator. Statements in respect of which that senator ultimately resigned from his position in the Senate. And we\u2019ve had nothing from the prime minister and nothing from the member for Chisholm in relation to this. Instead, she has simply distributed \u2013 not come and explained herself to this House \u2013 but instead she has simply distributed a written statement that was self-evidently prepared for her by the foreign affairs minister and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, self-evidently is not in her words, self-evidently is not the language that she herself chose to use when she was being interviewed by Andrew Bolt. And the ridiculous hypocrisy of all of the people in the government benches, starting with the prime minister and including the member for Chisholm, is on full display for the Australian people to see. That\u2019s why standing orders should be suspended, in order to have the member for Chisholm come into this House, as she should, as convention would require that she should. Here is the motion Mark Dreyfus has put forward, After that talk to Dave Sharma, Gladys Liu has left the chamber. Dave Sharma has walked over to Gladys Liu\u2019s seat and is having a chat to her as Mark Dreyfus gives his speech. We are right into it this morning. Mark Dreyfus is straight into it, saying the member for Chisholm needs to explain her interview with Andrew Bolt and clear up, in the parliament, what the situation is. The bells are ringing. I hear them in my sleep. Richard Marles was sent out by Labor this morning to give the opposition\u2019s position on Gladys Liu. Here is some of that doorstop: Q: Should Gladys Liu resign? RM: Well, right now I think there are questions which are at large, and I think actually it is for the prime minister to act. The prime minister needs to be fronting the Australian people and making it really clear what his position in respect to these allegations are. Q: The Labor candidate for Chisholm, Jennifer Yang, she was also associated with some of these organisations that Gladys Liu has been linked to. How can Labor then criticise her? RM: Well, firstly, the allegations that are being made in this morning\u2019s paper are being made in respect of Gladys Liu. And the other point to make is that Jennifer Yang isn\u2019t here. Gladys Liu is. Gladys Liu was sworn in as the member for Chisholm and represents that constituency in this parliament, right now, and forms part of the government\u2019s majority. It is absolutely essential given the seriousness of the allegations that have been made in the papers this morning that the prime minister provides an answer to the Australian people on these questions immediately and I would imagine that from Gladys Liu\u2019s point of view she would want those answers given straight away. But the prime minister needs to be speaking on this. Greg Hunt has been asked about Gladys Liu as he was leaving an event this morning: I am very uncomfortable with the way that some people have focused on her Chinese heritage, the fact that she has an accent, I think Senator Payne set that out and I agree with Senator Payne\u2019s concerns about the characterisation. I have a deep discomfort at the way that some have focused on her Chinese heritage. I\u2019ve just had a look through some of the comments. I\u2019m just going to say it again. Think about what you are posting. I don\u2019t want to see those \u201cjokes\u201d. Be better. As Alice Workman first reported in the Australian, Gladys Liu is meant to head the Sydney Institute\u2019s \u201cHow the Coalition won Chisholm\u201d event on 25 September. We have a feeling this event will be quietly shuffled off the Sydney Institute\u2019s calendar after their headline speaker is suddenly unable to attend. Sarah Henderson will be officially sworn into the Senate at 9.30am today. Seems there might be something in the water when it comes to our water ministers lately. On the heels of David Littleproud admitting that he did not know if climate change was human-made or not, we have this from the NSW water minister, Melinda Pavey. Sarah Henderson is back in the building. Henderson lost the seat of Corangamite at the last election after a boundary change, but scraped by in the Victorian Senate selection to replace Mitch Fifield. Frank Bainimarama will arrive for his first official Australian visit since becoming Fijian prime minister today, with a meeting scheduled with Scott Morrison for Monday. It\u2019s also the pair\u2019s first meeting since Bainimarama said this about the Australian leader in an interview with Guardian Australia, after the Pacific Islands Forum last month: After yesterday\u2019s meeting I gathered [Morrison] was here only to make sure that the Australian policies were upheld by the Pacific island nations,\u201d said Bainimarama. I thought Morrison was a good friend of mine; apparently not. The prime minister at one stage, because he was apparently [backed] into a corner by the leaders, came up with how much money Australia has been giving to the Pacific. He said: \u2018I want that stated. I want that on the record.\u2019 Very insulting. Morrison has since said the pair are cool friends again, and message each other all the time. Bainimarama has said he thinks the meeting will be more positive. Given one of the major concerns of our Pacific neighbours is climate change, and Australia isn\u2019t shifting on that end \u2013 and, as Katharine Murphy revealed, Scott Morrison will not attend the UN climate summit, despite being in the US, that might be a little bit of a stretch. Government MPs have been pretty quiet this morning. But the Senate crossbencher Rex Patrick has not been. He was on ABC RN this morning and had this to say about Gladys Liu. I actually think that with all of the evidence that\u2019s emerging, she\u2019s reached the Sam Dastyari threshold, where she must consider her tenure. Patrick said he believed Liu had not been \u201ccandid\u201d with the Australian people or the parliament and he wanted more answers. There\u2019s a standard that\u2019s been set for the parliament ... I don\u2019t think she\u2019s been open and transparent about it. Scott Morrison is off to the US next week. He\u2019ll be at the White House but not the UN climate summit. Katharine Murphy has this report: Scott Morrison will not attend the UN climate action summit despite him being in America to visit the Trump administration at the time \u2013 deploying the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, and the Australian ambassador for the environment, Patrick Suckling, instead. Guardian Australia understands speaking slots at the event in New York on 23 September were reserved for countries announcing new emissions reduction targets or financial commitments to the UN Green Climate Fund \u2013 and Morrison has been signalling Australia won\u2019t be going further, at least at this point, than commitments previously announced. A draft program for the summit, and a list of member states intending to present at the event, seen by Guardian Australia, did not include any reference to Australian participation. It\u2019s the last sitting day for this week, and the government has its first official \u201cembattled\u201d MP. The member for Chisholm, Gladys Liu has had the adjective proceed her name in morning news coverage, as the fallout from an unsanctioned interview she gave to Sky News\u2019s Andrew Bolt continues. A statement Liu released on Wednesday to clarify her comments raised more questions. Question time was largely dedicated to the first-term MP, but most questions on the subject were ruled out of order. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said then it was \u201coffensive\u201d to suggest that Liu\u2019s previous associations suggested she was not fit and proper to sit in parliament. \u201cThe member is duly elected as the representative of the people of Chisholm,\u201d she said. Labor and the crossbench are expected to ask more questions today as parliament prepares for the weekend break. Meanwhile, questions over what policies Labor will hold on to and what the party is looking to scrap continue for the opposition, as the much-lauded 50% carbon reduction plan by 2030 comes under the microscope. The review is ongoing, so Labor won\u2019t say, but it has so far not revealed which way it will vote on the crossbench motion to have the parliament declare a climate emergency. Why is that important? Because Labor has spent much of the six years talking about climate, and if it suddenly walks back its position, it tells you more about the direction of the party moving forward. We\u2019ll have all that and whatever else the day throws at us, so I hope you come along. Mike Bowers is wandering around the hallways and Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin are here for you as well. It\u2019s a four-coffee day. I\u2019m just saying. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "bodyText": "Pressure is growing on Jacinda Ardern to explain when she was made aware of serious sexual assault allegations in her party after the staffer at the centre of the furore resigned. The individual remains unnamed but is known to have worked in a senior role in Parliament House and had regular interaction with senior Labour ministers. According to allegations published on the Spinoff website on Monday, the staffer is alleged to have seriously assaulted a 19-year-old Young Labour member at his home early last year. The alleged victim claimed the Labour party ignored her numerous official complaints about the matter. On Thursday, the man sent a statement to RNZ denying \u201cthe serious allegations made against me\u201d but saying he was resigning due to stress and to avoid distracting from the government\u2019s work. \u201cI am cooperating fully with the Dew inquiry that is now under way and will continue to do so, having been assured that this process will be fair to all parties,\u201d the statement said. Scepticism is mounting as to when the prime minister found out about the allegations, and Ardern has been accused of letting down survivors who viewed her as a champion for women\u2019s rights and equality. Ardern has repeatedly said she first became aware of the allegations from reports on Monday, but documents obtained by domestic media show senior Labour figures were sent testimony of the sexual assault allegations last year. A number of political journalists said the allegations were a critical moment for Ardern\u2019s leadership. Newshub\u2019s Duncan Garner said the idea that the prime minister did not know about the allegations was a \u201cmassive stretch\u201d, while Stuff\u2019s Andrea Vance said the prime minister\u2019s insistence that she did not know was \u201chard to swallow\u201d. The prime minister faced a barrage of questions over the issue from the press on Thursday as she announced policies on mental health and the school curriculum. A QC has been appointed to investigate Labour\u2019s handling of the complaint and is due to report back to Ardern within a month. On Wednesday, the party\u2019s president, Nigel Haworth, resigned after emails showed he had been sent testimony detailing the alleged sexual assault last year, despite claiming to have not been told about it. There were at least six other complaints against the man relating to misconduct, of which he was cleared by an internal Labour investigation earlier this year. The allegations are the worst crisis to face Ardern since she took office in 2017, not least for her strong focus on women\u2019s and young people\u2019s rights. Speaking last year at the UN general assembly, she said the #MeToo movement must become \u201cwe too\u201d. Ardern told the assembly: \u201cIt seems surprising that in this modern age we have to recommit ourselves to gender equality, but we do. And I for one will never celebrate the gains we have made for women domestically, while internationally other women and girls experience a lack of the most basic of opportunity and dignity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The industry body representing Google, Facebook and Twitter has rejected proposals for an industry code of conduct on fake news, warning that the recommendation would turn Australia\u2019s media regulator into the truth police. The Digital Industry Group Inc \u2013 a non-profit association representing the social media and digital giants in Australia \u2013 made the warning in a submission to the competition regulator\u2019s digital platforms review, arguing against eight of its 23 recommendations. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission recommended new codes of practice to ensure fairness and transparency in the digital ad market and to govern handling of complaints about inaccurate information, to be enforced by an independent regulator such as the Australian Communications and Media Authority. But Digi has argued against a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d code of conduct on fake news, arguing that what might be considered appropriate in one forum \u2013 such as the removal of a public post containing disinformation \u2013 \u201cmay be considered as intrusive and inappropriate on a private messaging platform\u201d. \u201cAn appropriate intervention on one platform (such as partnerships with third-party fact-checkers) may be cost-prohibitive and unscalable for another,\u201d it said. Although the ACCC sought to avoid the government \u201cdirectly determining the trustworthiness\u201d of news, the recommendation \u201ceffectively [put] that burden on platforms\u201d, Digi\u2019s submission said. \u201cThe ACCC indicates that the code would enable members of the public who are unsatisfied with digital platforms\u2019 handling of their complaints about disinformation or malinformation [to] refer these to the regulator. \u201cThis effectively makes the ACMA a truth verification body, as its judgements as to whether a digital platform adequately handled the complaints speak to the regulator\u2019s own assessment of truth in relation to the matter in question.\u201d New rules covering \u201cinformation incorrectly alleging that a public individual is involved with illegal activity\u201d would be \u201cparticularly problematic when people take to digital platforms, such as Twitter, for whistleblowing to raise awareness of injustices that have not yet been presented in court, as was seen with the #metoo movement\u201d. During Australia\u2019s 2019 election, Facebook refused to shut down a social media campaign spreading misinformation that Labor intended to introduce a death tax, explaining that it only intervened if material breached community standards. The ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, has argued the social media giant has the capacity to stop the spread of fake news but chooses not to. The communications minister, Paul Fletcher, has said he has some sympathy with Facebook because it does not hold itself out as a traditional media publisher with editorial standards, but has suggested it could be required to help its users better assess the veracity of content. Digi responded to a call for new rules governing how digital platforms deal with news organisations by recognising the \u201cintent\u201d to protect journalism. But it warned against \u201cmarket-wide interventions that will have unintended consequences for the digital industry\u201d. New specialised codes of conduct may \u201cput digital native companies at a commercial disadvantage in a rapidly shifting digital advertising market\u201d, it said. Digi also argued against new rules to take into account technology and data transfer and whether an acquisition would \u201cresult in the removal from the market of a potential competitor\u201d when considering if a merger should be prohibited because it substantially lessened competition. It said the recommendation was \u201cdisappointing\u201d and accused the ACCC of not responding to analysis of its impact on the technology industry and seeking to impose \u201cinnovation-stifling red tape\u201d. \u201cAcquisitions of Australian companies in particular could see major sectoral growth, and resulting consumer benefit,\u201d it said. \u201cFurthermore, such proposed regulations serve as a deterrent to global companies from investing or expanding operations in the Australian market.\u201d Digi submitted that privacy recommendations requiring user consent before an IP address or device identifier was collected would result in \u201ca consumer being blocked with a consent screen before a page can even load\u201d. It warned that if privacy compliance \u201cbecomes overly complex\u201d it could result \u201cin declining conversion rates and revenue, global companies and startups may withdraw or not develop products and services for the Australian market\u201d. Submissions for the digital platforms inquiry closed on Thursday. So far, the government has suggested it is open to forcing Netflix, YouTube and other streaming companies to produce more Australian content.",

The myth of Robin Hood, with its injunction to take from the rich and give to the poor, was the remainer\u2019s myth. It represented a belief in slow, almost invisible political change \u2013 effected through things like the NHS and progressive taxation \u2013 which, while worthy, was in the end slightly boring. In contrast, the leaver\u2019s favoured myth, George and the Dragon, was dramatic and triumphant. It celebrated beating your oppressors and not worrying too much about what came afterwards. As such, it was inevitably more attractive at the ballot box. \u201cThe Brexiteers succeeded,\u201d wrote Meek, not because they had better arguments but \u201cbecause they shared the dream vision of enough of the voters\u201d.</p> <p>Historical fiction usually approaches the dream visions of the past in one of two ways. The first, best exemplified by the sympathetically intelligent novels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hilary-mantel\" title=\"\">Hilary Mantel</a>, plunders them for evidence that things have probably always been much as they are today. The second uses history, as TS Eliot said of James Joyce\u2019s \u201cmythic method\u201d in <em>Ulysses</em>, as a way of \u201ccontrolling, of ordering, of giving shape and significance\u201d to the contemporary moment. One approach represents history as stasis, the other as allegory. <em>To Calais, in Ordinary Time</em>, Meek\u2019s rich and strange new novel, combines elements of both, and one of the many deep and destabilising pleasures it offers comes from trying to work out precisely what kind of a book \u2013 and what kind of a world \u2013 you are in at any particular moment.</p> <p>The setting is straightforwardly historical. It is south-west England in 1348, two years after the battle of Cr\u00e9cy, a decisive conflict in the hundred years war when a handful of English archers routed the French and went on to capture Calais. Edward III is on the throne; religious and cultural capital is entrenched on the continent; plague stalks the land. The contemporary parallels \u2013 with Brexit, with the existential threat of climate crisis \u2013 are there for the making, but Meek never labours them.</p> <p>There are three principal actors: a serf named Will Quate, bound to work the land owned by a local nobleman; Lady Bernadine, that nobleman\u2019s daughter; and Thomas Pitkerro, a proctor or clerical administrator from Avignon on secondment to Malmesbury Abbey. Will is betrothed to the village beauty, but his desires lie elsewhere and he dreams of becoming a free man. Bernadine, fed on a diet of courtly love culled from <em>Le Roman de la Rose</em>, also wants to escape the smallness of village life. She is engaged to a nobleman her father\u2019s age, but thinks she is really in love with a young knight named Laurence Haket. Pitkerro, haunted by guilt over his intellectual and moral failings, simply wants to go home.</p> <p>Haket has raised a band of archers to send to France, led by a religiously fanatical giant of a man named Hayne, and Will, Bernadine and Thomas join them on the road south to Dorset, where a ship waits to take them to France. Coming the other way, as a rumour on the wind, is the plague.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You never know with this novel if you\u2019re reading a comedy of manners, a dystopian novel or a medieval porno</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jul/09/featuresreviews.guardianreview28\" title=\"\"><em>The People\u2019s Act of Love</em></a>, Meek\u2019s historical moral fable set in 1920s Russia, which was longlisted for the Man Booker prize in 2005, the novel is staged as a series of almost magically strange encounters and scenes: marvels, you might call them.

An archer with a facial scar \u201chas a fissure dividing the dexter and sinister parts of his face, a cicatrix so profound it appears he has been formed of dual semi-humans, conglutined into unity\u201d. Quate is described as \u201csolid of form, pectorally muscled, but with the face of an angel, a tranquil gestus and an intelligent aspect\u201d.

      "bodyText": "An alleged straw donor has been accused of inventing a \u201cnonsense\u201d after claiming to have used Chinese \u201clucky money\u201d to fund a $5,000 cash payment to New South Wales Labor. The Independent Commission Against Corruption is examining whether a series of straw donors, or false donors, were used to mask the true source of a $100,000 donation to NSW Labor. The commission has heard testimony that the money came from Huang Xiangmo, a Chinese billionaire and banned donor, who is alleged to have paid for seats next to Bill Shorten and Luke Foley at a 2015 fundraising dinner. Icac is investigating whether records of 20 donations of $5,000 were falsified to cover up Huang\u2019s gift. A previous witness, Labor\u2019s former fundraising director Patty Barrett, has stated she never saw cash donations as large as $5,000 at any dinner event during her entire career. Valentine Yee, the son of a prominent Chinatown restaurateur, is one of those who purportedly gave $5,000 to NSW Labor on the night of the dinner. Yee is not a supporter of the Labor party, and said he counted himself more as a conservative. Yee faced a barrage of questioning at Icac on Thursday as he sought to explain how he made the $5,000 donation. He was forced to repeatedly revise or alter his evidence throughout the day, was accused of inventing falsehoods to protect his family, and denied allegations he had not \u201cdonated a cent\u201d to Labor and had never attended the 2015 dinner. Yee insisted that he had both attended the dinner and made the $5,000 donation. Yee said he had $5,000 in cash from a series of \u201clucky money\u201d gifts he had received from family for Chinese New Year the month prior to the dinner. Lucky money is a reference to cash gifts exchanged at occasions of significance for the Chinese community. Yee said he would have received 50 separate cash gifts of an average of $100 as lucky money. Counsel assisting, Scott Robertson, responded: \u201cAre you seriously saying that 50 people gave you an average of $100 in lucky money in 2015? Is that your serious evidence?\u201d Yee responded: \u201cYes.\u201d The chief commissioner, Peter Hall, labelled his answer a \u201cnonsense\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s nonsense isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s a nonsense answer?\u201d Hall said. Yee, the chief financial officer at Sydney\u2019s Emperor\u2019s Garden restaurant, denied it was a nonsense answer. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Yee\u2019s mother also donated Labor $10,000 in cash at the fundraising dinner, according to Labor records. Both Yee and his mother gave \u201cstrikingly\u201d similar statements to the NSW electoral commission in 2016, when it first began investigating donation irregularities associated with the dinner, Icac heard. Robertson said the two statements were \u201cidentical\u201d, something he described as an \u201castonishing coincidence\u201d. Even full stops and commas were in the same place, he said, and Yee\u2019s mother\u2019s statement similarly claimed to have funded the donation using lucky money. \u201cMr Yee, come on. Seriously. Seriously,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cWith respect to you, much of what you\u2019re saying is utterly hard to believe, utterly hard to believe. It just does not stand to reason based on these documents.\u201d Yee insisted the similarities between the statements were a coincidence and said he had not had any influence on what his mother wrote. Hall responded that he was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s puzzling me is that an intelligent man could have given the answer you just gave,\u201d Hall said. Yee was warned that lying to Icac can attract a prison sentence, and was given a brief adjournment to consider whether he wished to change his answer. Following the adjournment, Icac heard that Yee would be recalled at a later date. Yee giggled at times during his evidence. At one point, Robertson asked him what it was about the evidence that was so funny. \u201cSorry, is there something funny? Are you laughing because you\u2019ve been caught out in another lie? Is that why you\u2019re laughing and giggling?\u201d The inquiry continues on Thursday.",

      "body": "<p>The king of Samsung smartphones has finally arrived, but is the Galaxy Note 10+ and its S-Pen stylus really still the super phone for super fans of the South Korean brand?</p> <p>For a long time the Galaxy Note line was used to push the boundaries of what could be done with a smartphone, siring the big-screen \u201cphablet\u201d category in the process. I\u2019m sad to report that\u2019s no longer the case. The \u00a3999 Note 10+ might technically be the biggest screen on a Samsung flagship phone, but it\u2019s really only by a smidgen.</p> <p>Underneath the glass and metal body the Note 10+ is essentially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/11/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-review-smartphone-ultrasonic-triple-camera\">a Galaxy S10+ from March</a>. That\u2019s not a bad thing, as the S10+ is a very good phone, but it means that the Note 10+ is no longer the specs monster it was. If you always bought the Note because it was \u201cthe best Samsung\u201d your decision is no longer that clear cut.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e69d338c2c6ea61736113671e6374e9b36b5234\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e69d338c2c6ea61736113671e6374e9b36b5234/634_572_3615_2169/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy note 10+ review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Note 10+ has one of the smallest hole punch notches in the screen for the selfie camera available.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What you get is a slight change of design. The striking 6.8in QHD+ AMOLED screen is enormous, but it\u2019s actually only 0.1in bigger than the one in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/21/samsung-galaxy-s10-5g-review-bigger-faster-and-lasts-longer\">S10 5G</a>. Still it\u2019s gorgeous to look at, videos look particularly great, and the hole cut in the top for the selfie camera is smaller than any other. But it\u2019s not as smooth nor impressive as the notchless (Samsung made) 90Hz AMOLED screen on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/31/oneplus-7-pro-review-an-absolute-beast-in-every-way\">OnePlus 7 Pro</a>.</p> <p>The Note 10+ has stereo speakers, which are surprisingly good \u2013 all the more so because the top one projects its sound out of a nearly imperceivable gap at the top of the screen,.</p> <p>The build quality is exceptional. The phone is thin, feels lighter than it is at 196g and the glass front and back curve at the edges to a thin metal band with squared-off ends at the top and bottom. There\u2019s absolutely no give anywhere, making the Note 10+ feel the closest yet to that all-glass slab of a phone we\u2019ve been promised in sci-fi for a decade.</p> <p>But those squared-off ends, harder corners and giant screen make the Note 10+ harder to use one-handed than any other phone. This is decidedly a two-hand phone. Use it one-handed without an aid at your peril. If ever there was a phone that should have shipped with one of those lanyards of old, this is it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66990f9aa48585be00ead8988cf01523aaecdbb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66990f9aa48585be00ead8988cf01523aaecdbb6/657_527_3748_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy note 10+ review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mirrored aura glow coloured back refracts light in pleasing, multicoloured ways that constantly changes as your viewing angle shifts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I also got a lot of accidental touches from my palm on the bottom right of the screen.

It also has 4GB more RAM at 12GB total (which is a bit of overkill).</p> <p>One big difference is the use of the newer UFS3.0 storage technology, which makes the 256GB of built-in storage significantly faster than that used in the Galaxy S10+ (and most other phones, except the OnePlus 7 Pro and a handful of others).</p> <p>As such the Note 10+ is a very powerful phone on paper, but it doesn\u2019t feel any faster in use than an S10+, and certainly not as snappy or fluid as the OnePlus 7 Pro.</p> <p>Battery life on the Galaxy Note 10+ is good, lasting more than 32 hours between charges on average with reasonably heavy usage. With the screen on in excess of five hours and set to FHD+ with the always-on display (AOD) setting off, the phone lasts from 7am on day one until after 3pm on day two. That is while browsing and using apps for four hours with a hundred or so push messages, watching 40 minutes of Netflix, shooting about 10 photos a day and listening to around five hours of music via Bluetooth headphones.</p> <p>Lighter usage sees the battery last another few hours, as did activating one of the many battery-saving modes. The Note 10+ has wireless charging and powershare (for charging headphones and other devices from the back), but has faster cabled charging than previous Samsung phones. From completely flat the battery reaches 80% charge in 40 minutes with the included 25W charger. The Note 10+ can charge up to 45W, but requires a special charger that supports Power Delivery 3.0 with PPS and isn\u2019t included in the box.</p> <h2>Samsung One UI</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"061a2fe281c167cf9565a7124e1185847f8cc586\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/061a2fe281c167cf9565a7124e1185847f8cc586/366_251_4223_2535/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy note 10+ review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samsung\u2019s One UI works well, but is currently based on the older Android 9 and lacks good gesture navigation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Galaxy S10 line was the first to launch with Samsung\u2019s revamped version of Android called One UI, which is based on 2018\u2019s Android 9, not the recently launched Android 10.</p> <p>Most of the customisations Samsung makes to Android are welcome, with a focus on using the bottom of the screen for things you have to touch and the top for information, which aids in using phones with large screens.</p> <p>However, it\u2019s held back by the use of the old Android navigation keys or swipe pads in their place, instead of the more modern gesture control used by other manufacturers such as Huawei and OnePlus or the ones now baked into Android 10. It\u2019s very difficult to reach the bottom left corner with your right thumb or bottom right with your left for the navigation keys on this size of screen.</p> <h2>S-Pen</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d16e9ba0cf697e54d18a6b58cf2166c7291f9067\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d16e9ba0cf697e54d18a6b58cf2166c7291f9067/0_306_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy note 10+ review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The S-Pen can now be used like a magic wand to control the Note 10+ remotely by waving it around.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Different for the Note 10+ is the addition of S-Pen features for drawing on the screen and accessing various apps from pop-out menus. New for this year on the S-Pen is greatly improved handwriting recognition in the Samsung Notes app, which was thoroughly impressive accurately translating even scrawl into pristine text, and what Samsung calls Air actions.</p> <p>Last year Samsung added remote control functionality to the S-Pen; this year that includes using the stylus like a magic wand for gestures in mid-air. You can change tracks, change cameras and take photos, and generally navigate or activate features using swipes and twirls of the S-Pen. It\u2019s fairly impressive, but after a brief play around I found it simply easier to press a button on the screen, apart from taking photos with the phone mounted in a tripod, which I have done precisely once to see whether it would work.</p> <p>The S-Pen remains one of the best styluses available, and slots neatly into the body of the Note 10+ when not in use. If you never use it, the S-Pen doesn\u2019t get in the way at all, but it is essentially the reason to buy the Note 10+.</p> <h2>Ultrasonic fingerprint scanner</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7bf4c7962deb5e57fd7b988b63977905346e2cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7bf4c7962deb5e57fd7b988b63977905346e2cb/0_153_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy note 10+ review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samsung\u2019s ultrasonic fingerprint scanner ican be frustratingly unreliable.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Note 10+ has the same ultrasonic fingerprint scanner embedded under the screen as the S10+. When it works it\u2019s great.

      "bodyText": "The king of Samsung smartphones has finally arrived, but is the Galaxy Note 10+ and its S-Pen stylus really still the super phone for super fans of the South Korean brand? For a long time the Galaxy Note line was used to push the boundaries of what could be done with a smartphone, siring the big-screen \u201cphablet\u201d category in the process. I\u2019m sad to report that\u2019s no longer the case. The \u00a3999 Note 10+ might technically be the biggest screen on a Samsung flagship phone, but it\u2019s really only by a smidgen. Underneath the glass and metal body the Note 10+ is essentially a Galaxy S10+ from March. That\u2019s not a bad thing, as the S10+ is a very good phone, but it means that the Note 10+ is no longer the specs monster it was. If you always bought the Note because it was \u201cthe best Samsung\u201d your decision is no longer that clear cut. What you get is a slight change of design. The striking 6.8in QHD+ AMOLED screen is enormous, but it\u2019s actually only 0.1in bigger than the one in the S10 5G. Still it\u2019s gorgeous to look at, videos look particularly great, and the hole cut in the top for the selfie camera is smaller than any other. But it\u2019s not as smooth nor impressive as the notchless (Samsung made) 90Hz AMOLED screen on the OnePlus 7 Pro. The Note 10+ has stereo speakers, which are surprisingly good \u2013 all the more so because the top one projects its sound out of a nearly imperceivable gap at the top of the screen,. The build quality is exceptional. The phone is thin, feels lighter than it is at 196g and the glass front and back curve at the edges to a thin metal band with squared-off ends at the top and bottom. There\u2019s absolutely no give anywhere, making the Note 10+ feel the closest yet to that all-glass slab of a phone we\u2019ve been promised in sci-fi for a decade. But those squared-off ends, harder corners and giant screen make the Note 10+ harder to use one-handed than any other phone. This is decidedly a two-hand phone. Use it one-handed without an aid at your peril. If ever there was a phone that should have shipped with one of those lanyards of old, this is it. I also got a lot of accidental touches from my palm on the bottom right of the screen. Accidentally zooming into web pages, exciting apps when trying to reach something and even pausing the music when trying to scroll in Spotify was a regular occurrence. Taking photos without hitting the back or home button was particularly difficult, resulting in quite a few missed photos. Specifications Screen: 6.8in QHD+ AMOLED (498ppi) Processor: Samsung Exynos 9825 or Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 RAM: 12GB of RAM Storage: 256GB + microSD card Operating system: One UI based on Android 9 Pie Camera: rear triple camera, 10MP selfie-camera Connectivity: dual sim, LTE, wifi, NFC, Bluetooth 5, wireless charging and GPS Dimensions: 162.3 x 77.2 x 7.9mm Weight: 196g Faster charging The Note 10+ comes with the same processor as the S10+ in the US (Qualcomm Snapdragon 855) and a slightly updated one (Exynos 9825) with the same performance but marginally improved energy efficiency in Europe. It also has 4GB more RAM at 12GB total (which is a bit of overkill). One big difference is the use of the newer UFS3.0 storage technology, which makes the 256GB of built-in storage significantly faster than that used in the Galaxy S10+ (and most other phones, except the OnePlus 7 Pro and a handful of others). As such the Note 10+ is a very powerful phone on paper, but it doesn\u2019t feel any faster in use than an S10+, and certainly not as snappy or fluid as the OnePlus 7 Pro. Battery life on the Galaxy Note 10+ is good, lasting more than 32 hours between charges on average with reasonably heavy usage. With the screen on in excess of five hours and set to FHD+ with the always-on display (AOD) setting off, the phone lasts from 7am on day one until after 3pm on day two. That is while browsing and using apps for four hours with a hundred or so push messages, watching 40 minutes of Netflix, shooting about 10 photos a day and listening to around five hours of music via Bluetooth headphones. Lighter usage sees the battery last another few hours, as did activating one of the many battery-saving modes. The Note 10+ has wireless charging and powershare (for charging headphones and other devices from the back), but has faster cabled charging than previous Samsung phones. From completely flat the battery reaches 80% charge in 40 minutes with the included 25W charger. The Note 10+ can charge up to 45W, but requires a special charger that supports Power Delivery 3.0 with PPS and isn\u2019t included in the box. Samsung One UI The Galaxy S10 line was the first to launch with Samsung\u2019s revamped version of Android called One UI, which is based on 2018\u2019s Android 9, not the recently launched Android 10. Most of the customisations Samsung makes to Android are welcome, with a focus on using the bottom of the screen for things you have to touch and the top for information, which aids in using phones with large screens. However, it\u2019s held back by the use of the old Android navigation keys or swipe pads in their place, instead of the more modern gesture control used by other manufacturers such as Huawei and OnePlus or the ones now baked into Android 10. It\u2019s very difficult to reach the bottom left corner with your right thumb or bottom right with your left for the navigation keys on this size of screen. S-Pen Different for the Note 10+ is the addition of S-Pen features for drawing on the screen and accessing various apps from pop-out menus. New for this year on the S-Pen is greatly improved handwriting recognition in the Samsung Notes app, which was thoroughly impressive accurately translating even scrawl into pristine text, and what Samsung calls Air actions. Last year Samsung added remote control functionality to the S-Pen; this year that includes using the stylus like a magic wand for gestures in mid-air. You can change tracks, change cameras and take photos, and generally navigate or activate features using swipes and twirls of the S-Pen. It\u2019s fairly impressive, but after a brief play around I found it simply easier to press a button on the screen, apart from taking photos with the phone mounted in a tripod, which I have done precisely once to see whether it would work. The S-Pen remains one of the best styluses available, and slots neatly into the body of the Note 10+ when not in use. If you never use it, the S-Pen doesn\u2019t get in the way at all, but it is essentially the reason to buy the Note 10+. Ultrasonic fingerprint scanner The Note 10+ has the same ultrasonic fingerprint scanner embedded under the screen as the S10+. When it works it\u2019s great. It doesn\u2019t feel fast, but appears to unlock faster than Samsung\u2019s software is set up to react, giving rise to a sluggish response, particularly in comparison to the OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro\u2019s excellent optical in-screen fingerprint sensor. However, it is the Note 10+\u2019s inconsistency which is extremely annoying. About one in five times it simply refuses to work, which always happens to be when you\u2019re in a hurry. Others have proven that in-screen fingerprint sensors can be as fast and accurate as traditional ones on the front or back, but Samsung\u2019s isn\u2019t as good. Camera The Note 10+ has a triple rear camera system that\u2019s aided by a new depth sensor, which enhances portrait mode shots and other depth effects, including for video. The main 12-megapixel camera is joined by a 12-megapixel telephoto (2x optical zoom) camera and a 16-megapixel ultrawide angle camera, which is one of the best in the business. Together they allow lossless zoom from 0.5 to 2x, and on to a 10x hybrid zoom. The Note 10+ therefore has one of the better cameras available taking shots with an excellent amount of detail and generally good exposure and colour. It falls down in low light and zoom capabilities next to the Huawei P30 Pro. Samsung\u2019s night mode doesn\u2019t match Google\u2019s for the Pixel either. Video capture quality is top notch at up to 4K at 60fps, and can now do live focus effects similar to Samsung\u2019s still images, but in real time. Samsung\u2019s new AR Doodle lets you draw on your or someone else\u2019s face in real-time too with the S-Pen, which your kids will love. The selfie camera was a bit of a let down, taking fairly good photos outdoors in good lighting, but struggling indoors and at events, where a crappy photo can\u2019t be taken again. Observations The stereo speakers are really good The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is incompatible with most screen protectors, but a compatible one comes included in the box Haptic feedback (vibrations) are the best yet on a Samsung phone A little pop-up when you take the S-Pen out of the slot shows you the gestures you can use in the current app or that they won\u2019t work here, which is handy There\u2019s no headphone socket You can hook it up to a PC or just a screen/mouse/keyboard to use the Note 10+ as a computer The power button has been moved to the left side next to the volume buttons, which took a little getting used to, and by default it can activate Bixby rather than fully power-off the phone Price The Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ costs \u00a3999 with 4G and 256GB of storage, \u00a31,099 with 5G and 256GB of storage or \u00a31,199 with 5G and 512GB of storage in either black or aura glow. For comparison, the recommended retail prices of the competition are now \u00a3799 for the Galaxy S10+ with 128GB of storage, \u00a31,099 for the 256GB Galaxy S10 5G, the 128GB Huawei P30 Pro is \u00a3799, the 64GB Google Pixel 3 XL costs \u00a3869, the 64GB iPhone XS Max costs \u00a31,099, and the 256GB OnePlus 7 Pro costs \u00a3699. Verdict The Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is some piece of hardware. An enormous screen and a feeling of solid glass seems simply futuristic. But that giant screen is also its downfall - it\u2019s just too big to use with one hand. It\u2019s also plagued with accidental touches, which are downright irritating.

According to an <a href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/http:/www.hefce.ac.uk/\">analysis</a> by the Higher Education Funding Council for England in 2016, BAME students are more likely than white students to decide to take a master\u2019s course but less likely to do a PhD. The research found that 2.4% of white students had started a PhD within five years of graduation, compared to 1.3% of their BAME peers.</p> <p>Last month the UK Council for Graduate Education launched an in depth review looking to establish why more BAME graduates aren\u2019t progressing onto PhDs. The review, which will report next year, will conduct a detailed analysis of student data to understand trends for researching, qualification rates and funding for different ethnicities, as well as to highlight existing schemes which are encouraging participation rates for BAME students. </p> <p>The fact that more young black students aren\u2019t choosing to do doctorates doesn\u2019t surprise Lynette Goddard, a black academic at Royal Holloway, University of London. She says that in 21 years as an academic she has only supervised three black PhD students. \u201cThat tells you something,\u201d she says. When she announced her promotion on her Facebook page, someone commented: \u201cI was never taught by a black lecturer at university so it didn\u2019t occur to me I could do that.\u201d</p> <p>Goddard is used to being in a minority. She was promoted at the beginning of the summer, making her the 27<sup>th</sup> black woman professor out of a total of around 21,000 across the UK \u2013 a statistic that she describes as \u201cshocking\u201d. She is the only black academic in her department of drama, theatre and dance, and insists it is actually one of the more diverse drama departments in the UK: until three years ago she says there wasn\u2019t a single other black British-born woman working as a full-time academic in a UK drama department.</p> <p>Prof Kalwant Bhopal, deputy director of the centre for research in race and education at Birmingham University, argues that BAME students feel strongly that universities are places for white students, \u201creserved for the privileged few\u201d. She adds: \u201cStudents see it in a curriculum that isn\u2019t for them, in the support that isn\u2019t there for them, and in the academic workforce which doesn\u2019t represent them.\u201d</p> <p>Bhopal recently interviewed third-year undergraduates for a study about next steps. Her team found that BAME students were less likely to apply to do a PhD, even if they were on track to achieve a first or a 2.1. \u201cOur respondents from all BAME groups said: \u2018I would like to become an academic but why should I try when there are no positive role models for me?\u2019\u201d she says.</p> <p>Kehinde Andrews, professor of black studies at Birmingham City University, says this means many black students struggle to find a supervisor who is knowledgeable about the subject they are interested in. \u201cOften minority students have a different approach and a different way of seeing things,\u201d he says. \u201cSo finding a supervisor who is compatible is hard.\u201d</p> <p>Finding funding can prove a challenge too. He was fortunate in winning funding for his doctorate from the Economic and Social Research Council, but says that such opportunities are now much harder to find. \u201cA lot of PhD funding now is more prescriptive. They say: \u2018If you research this we will fund you.\u2019 But just like the curriculum those topics are Eurocentric, so the chances of minority students finding a topic they actually want to do is pretty small.\u201d</p> <p>This chimes with Bhopal\u2019s findings. \u201cMany respondents were interested in researching areas of inequality and especially race, and they felt they were less likely to get support for those sorts of projects.\u201d</p> <p>Her research suggested that cultural barriers aren\u2019t the only things in the way. They found that black, Pakistani and Bangladeshi students were also less likely to have access to sufficient funding to do a PhD. \u201cThere are very few bursaries available to do a PhD and those that exist are very competitive, so that really matters.\u201d</p> <p>She argues that universities who want to address racism and make the workforce more representative should look seriously at providing financial support for first class BAME students who can\u2019t afford to do a PhD. </p> <p>Cliona Kelly, who has just started a PhD in neuroscience at Aston University, is the first person in her family to go to university, and suspects her parents don\u2019t even really know what a doctorate is. She says in her group of black friends, money is the main obstacle to considering a PhD.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you want to do a PhD they start asking whether you have done any placements or research,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that means taking the summer off and working for free, which most black students can\u2019t afford to do. You\u2019ll be contributing to the rent at home so doing a placement for no money just isn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly worked for Aston full-time while she did her master\u2019s in psychology, which she says found \u201creally draining\u201d; if she hadn\u2019t managed to secure a grant for her PhD she wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it. She says she wants to stay in research, and is hoping to improve \u201cthat terrible statistic about black women professors.

      "bodyText": "When Usman Kayani chose to do a PhD in theoretical physics at King\u2019s College London, he felt sure an academic career lay ahead of him. Now two months after completing his doctorate, having suffered from anxiety and depression, he is considering other options. At first Kayani was the only student who was either black, Asian or from an ethnic minority (BAME) in his research group. Although the group later became a bit more diverse he remembers how that feeling of being different, coupled with a lack of BAME academics and professors he could look up to as role models, contributed to his feelings of anxiety. \u201cIt didn\u2019t help my imposter syndrome. I do feel the lack of representation can put people off a career in academia. It\u2019s a vicious cycle,\u201d he says. \u201cMy dream was always to stay in academia. Now I don\u2019t know what I want to do and I feel a bit lost.\u201d As a BAME student, Kayani was defying the odds by doing doctoral research at all. According to an analysis by the Higher Education Funding Council for England in 2016, BAME students are more likely than white students to decide to take a master\u2019s course but less likely to do a PhD. The research found that 2.4% of white students had started a PhD within five years of graduation, compared to 1.3% of their BAME peers.

      "bodyText": "After the half-hour drive from Batman in south-east Turkey, the ancient city of Hasankeyf, which sits on the banks of the Tigris River, appears as an oasis. Hasankeyf is thought to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements on Earth, dating as far back as 12,000 years and containing thousands of caves, churches and tombs. But this jewel of human history will soon be lost; most of the settlement is about to be flooded as part of the highly controversial Ilisu dam project. Construction work on the dam and its hydroelectric power plant started in 2006 and Hasankeyf is now just weeks away from destruction, despite a fight by residents and environmental campaigners to save it. The Turkish government has given residents until 8 October to evacuate. An attempt to challenge the project at the European court of human rights on the grounds that it would damage the country\u2019s cultural heritage was unsuccessful. First conceived as far back as the 1950s, the dam project has long been mired in controversy. On its completion it will be the fourth biggest dam in Turkey and is predicted to generate 4,200 gigawatts hours of electricity annually, but at a huge cost. The scheme will mean the flooding of 199 settlements in the region, thousands of human-made caves and hundreds of historical and religious sites. Campaigners warn that close to 80,000 people will be displaced. They also warn of terrible damage to the natural environment, saying biodiversity will suffer, and that numerous vulnerable and endangered species are threatened by the construction of the dam. Ridvan Ayhan, who was born in one of the caves in Hasankeyf, is an active member in the Initiative to Keep Hasankeyf Alive, founded in 2006 as a grassroots campaign to halt the dam project. Walking along the mountainside facing the town, Ayhan reached a cave clearly marked with an engraved cross, indicating an ancient church. \u201cIt\u2019s not just our story, Hasankeyf, it\u2019s also your story, because it\u2019s the human story,\u201d he said. It is unknown what year the church dates back to. Only 10% of the area has been explored by archaeologists. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked for the area to be an open-air museum but the government wouldn\u2019t accept it,\u201d Ayhan said. \u201cIf you dig here you will find cultures layered on top of one another.\u201d Under the church is a tomb where piles of human bones have surfaced. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t even respect the dead,\u201d Ayhan said. \u201cThey are barbaric.\u201d Hasankeyf has been part of many different cultures in its long history, including ancient Mesopotamia, Byzantium, Arab empires and the Ottoman empire, but Hakan Ozoglu, a history professor at the University of Central Florida, said the settlement predates all these civilisations. \u201cWe have references to the town in several ancient texts in different languages such as Assyrian, Armenian, Kurdish, Arabic,\u201d he said. The professor says Hasankeyf is a laboratory that could provide many answers about the past. \u201cSuch rare physical evidence of the human past must be protected at all cost,\u201d Ozoglu said. Only eight historical monuments \u2013 including a tower from what was said to be the oldest university in the world, half of an old Roman gate to the city and a women\u2019s hamam dating to around 1400 \u2013 have been saved from Hasankeyf. The pieces were moved 3km away and now stand on a vast plain. \u201cIt\u2019s meaningless for us to see these historical pieces there,\u201d Ayhan said. With the deadline handed down by the government, people from the surrounding areas have come to say farewell to the historical site, knowing it will be their last chance to see it. Few tourists visit the area, however, due to its inaccessibility. Ozoglu said the benefit from the dam cannot come close to that of the potential of tourism that would be better marketed if it had Unesco\u2019s name attached to it. \u201cI cannot see very many other places on Earth that deserve [more] to be on the list of Unesco\u2019s protected sites,\u201d Ozoglu said. Ayhan shook his head when Unesco was mentioned \u2013 the Initiative to Keep Hasankeyf Alive had already applied unsuccessfully for the settlement to be listed. \u201cUnesco said the culture ministry has to apply for it,\u201d Ayhan said. \u201cWe wrote to the ministry but no answer \u2026 It\u2019s their duty but they didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d The Turkish ministry of culture and tourism would not comment. A spokesperson at the ministry of energy and natural resources was also contacted. \u201cWhy do you want to talk about Hasankeyf when we have so many other projects?\u201d was their only comment. The Turkish authorities\u2019 crackdown on protests has also hindered Hasankeyf residents\u2019fight to stop the dam. \u201cIf we protest, they take us to prisons,\u201d Ayhan said. \u201cThere\u2019s no democracy here. If there was democracy, maybe we could do something.\u201d He says he was arrested in 2012. The government has built a \u201cnew Hasankeyf\u201d for 700 households, 3km away from historical Hasankeyf, to relocate residents before 8 October. But Eyup Agalday, 27, said he and his wife were not offered their own home in the new settlement, as the government has a cutoff for those married after 2014. \u201cI will have to live with my parents again\u2013 the whole family of 10 members will be in the one house,\u201d he said. Agalday, like his ancestors, is a shepherd, and currently lives in in one of Hasankeyf\u2019s many caves. He will not be allowed to take his animals to the new village and has started selling his goats. \u201cI am forced to do something and be in a city where I don\u2019t want to live,\u201d he said. Agalday said about a fifth of Hasankeyf\u2019s residents have already moved to the new settlement, with around five or six families moving each day. A green pick-up truck could be spotted from below with belongings and furniture piled high, making its way out of Hasankeyf. Sitting under the shade of bountiful grapevines on the opposite side of the river, Hediye Tapkan, 38, said she had no idea where her family, including five young children, will go. \u201cWe like our place, we make our bread here, we have lots of grapes and figs which sometimes we sell, our lands are productive,\u201d she said. Tapkan and her family have also not been offered a replacement home, even though they were allegedly forced to sell some of their land \u2013 at 900 Turkish lira for 1 dunum, or \u00a3125 for 1,000 sq metres \u2013 for the construction of the new village. As the residents wait for the floodgates to open and for Hasankeyf to be slowly submerged by the rising river, they say they will continue to raise their voices and spread the message of the settlement\u2019s history, even after entry to it is banned in October. \u201c[If we don\u2019t,] when we die, our children will come and spit on our graves and say, why didn\u2019t you save Hasankeyf?\u201d Ayhan said.

Dengue, a viral infection, is widespread throughout the tropics. The virus thrives in areas of rapid urbanisation, poor sanitation and the absence of a vaccine. The Department of Health has warned parents to monitor their children for fever accompanied by severe headache, pain behind the eyes or muscle and joint pain lasting two days or more. Dengue can lead to haemorrhaging and organ failure in severe cases. Dengue is not confined to specific regions, although the highest number of cases have been recorded in Western Visayas (42,694 cases) and southern Luzon (35,136 cases). Metropolitan Manila reported 15,819 cases. Esperanza Cabral, the former health secretary, told the Guardian that government efforts will never be enough until the ban on Dengvaxia vaccine is lifted. Cabral said: \u201cThe government has focused its campaign on reducing the number of mosquitoes and on cleanliness. Doing just that will not work. We know there\u2019s a vaccine that is not perfect but is effective enough. Unfortunately, it is not available.\u201d Cabral added that the government should work harder to restore public confidence in vaccines. \u201cWe need to prevent the next epidemic,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cHe never had a chance.\u201d That\u2019s what Sandra Reed said at the start of a rally in front of the Texas governor\u2019s mansion calling for a retrial for her son, Rodney Reed. Reed, 51, has been on death row in Texas since 1998 and is scheduled to be executed on 20 November for murder. But an array of supporters even beyond his own family, ranging from some relatives of the woman he was convicted of killing to a world-famous nun, argue that Reed is innocent and is a casualty of a criminal justice system beset by errors and racial bias. In 1998, Reed, who is African American, was convicted \u2013 by an all-white jury \u2013 of the 1996 murder of 19-year-old Stacey Stites. His family has spent years trying to get his case overturned and he is represented by the Innocence Project, the not-for-profit group that focuses on DNA testing to exonerate wrongly convicted people and campaigns to reform the system. Reed\u2019s lawyers filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Texas last month, after repeatedly being thwarted in their demands for DNA testing of the murder weapon, a leather belt used to strangle Stites. His lead attorney, Bryce Benjet of the Innocence Project, said continued refusal to perform the test violates Reed\u2019s constitutional rights. And Reed\u2019s case has caught the attention of the Texas state representative Vikki Goodwin. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can say he is guilty without a shadow of a doubt,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we should carry out the death penalty when there\u2019s doubt about the truth of the case.\u201d During the original trial, DNA from the Stites case matched Reed, but he said he was having a secret affair with her to avoid scandal in a small Texas town, especially because Reed is black and Stites white. Reed\u2019s legal team believes new evidence would prove that Jimmy Fennell, Stites\u2019s fiance at the time of her death, was the murderer. Fennell was a police officer for the city of Giddings, to the east of Austin, at the time, and was later sentenced to 10 years in prison for a different crime stemming from allegations that he kidnapped and raped a woman while on duty in a previous post working in Georgetown, north of Austin. The lawsuit is the latest in a series of actions to get Reed a retrial. Three weeks before he was scheduled to die by lethal injection, on 5 March 2015 in the Texas state penitentiary, his lawyers filed an appeal, citing multiple problems with his conviction and urging a stay of execution and a retrial. That same month, the US supreme court declined to review Reed\u2019s case. In the August 2019 lawsuit, the Innocence Project lawyers claim there are \u201cmultiple additional items of evidence\u201d collected during the murder investigation in a \u201ccondition suitable for DNA testing\u201d. The suit also argues that that Fennell couldn\u2019t keep his testimony straight and failed his polygraph tests and that he acted \u201csuspiciously\u201d following Stites\u2019s death, including closing his bank account and disposing of his truck. Fennell\u2019s \u201cinconsistent statements\u201d about his whereabouts on the night of 22 April 1996 are significant because the condition in which Stites\u2019s body was found on 23 April indicates she was \u201cmurdered several hours before\u201d her body was found, the suit claims. \u201cProminent forensic pathologists have reached the un-rebutted conclusion that Fennell\u2019s testimony that Ms Stites was abducted and murdered while on her way to work around 3.30am is medically and scientifically impossible,\u201d the lawsuit claims. Several complaints were filed against Fennell alleging \u201cracial bias and use of excessive force at the Giddings police department where he worked\u201d, and he was overheard several times saying that if Stites cheated on him, \u201che would kill her\u201d and \u201che specifically stated he would strangle her with a belt\u201d, the suit said. Fennell was initially a suspect but investigators focused on Reed after his DNA was discovered inside Stites\u2019s body, and a jury concluded that Reed raped and strangled Stites after intercepting her on the way to work, a timeline his lawyers argue has been discredited. Supporters think there are other issues at play. \u201cRace was a big factor in this case. A \u2018Jim Crow trial\u2019, an all-white jury, none of his peers,\u201d Sandra Reed told the Guardian. Benjet said there was data showing racial disparity in \u201cmost if not every\u201d aspect of the US criminal justice system. Sister Helen Prejean, an anti-death penalty activist and author of the book Dead Man Walking, visited with Reed\u2019s family in 2015 as his previous execution date neared. Her book about the death penalty and the subsequent film changed many people\u2019s perspectives in the US on capital punishment. She tweeted about Reed\u2019s case in 2015. She has followed the case ever since and plans to work with Reed\u2019s family and attorneys to help stop his 20 November execution. Her spokesman, Griffin Hardy, said Reed\u2019s case was particularly compelling to Sister Helen because of Reed\u2019s consistent claim of innocence and the case\u2019s racial undertones. \u201cRacial discrimination infects the death penalty system as a whole and we see it in this case,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing to see these kind of biases and prejudices that can ultimately cost someone their life.\u201d He says it paints a picture of a legal system that values white victims over victims of color and punishes criminal convicts of color more harshly. The Death Penalty Information Center reports that in the modern era, 75% of executions carried out for murder have involved white victims, even though blacks and whites \u201care about\u201d equally as likely to be murder victims. The bias issue made it to the supreme court in 1987, but the court ruled that studies didn\u2019t offer sufficient proof of racial discrimination in a particular defendant\u2019s case. It has found racial discrimination in the selection of the jury in individual capital cases, however. Goodwin, the state representative, told the Guardian she was lobbying for a retrial for Reed or to remove him from death row. \u201cI believe history has shown that in too many cases what seems to be true and just has turned out not to be so when new information or new scientific advances occur,\u201d she said. Some members of the Stites family have publicly supported a retrial for Reed. One of Stacey Stites\u2019s cousins also doubts Reed\u2019s conviction. \u201cToo many things point to the ineptitude of law enforcement when they first started working the case,\u201d said Heather Campbell Stobbs. Stobbs said her outspokenness about the case had caused tensions with Stites\u2019s immediate family, who believe Reed is guilty. Sandra Reed said at the rally of Reed supporters last month that she visited her son on death row after his execution date was set. \u201cRodney and I made a pact the day they came back with that sentencing. I visited him and we made a pact: \u2018If you fall, I fall,\u2019\u201d Sandra Reed said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been sticking with that.\u201d Rodrick, Rodney\u2019s younger brother, echoed that the campaign goes on. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to stop as long as I have breath in my body,\u201d he said.

Stridency is not his thing. He is not looking to recreate the world anew, and that is reassuring in a world buffeted by Trumpian tweetstorms.</p> <p>Unlike Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, Biden is not looking to strip Americans of their health insurance policies for the sake of bringing a progressive Arcadia to the here and now. In Biden\u2019s playbook, preserving Obamacare and maintaining coverage for pre-existing conditions takes priority over change for its own sake, and middle America is fine with that.</p> <p>Likewise, while Biden supports comprehensive immigration reform, a path to citizenship for those who came to the US illegally and are part of our social fabric, he also believes that entering the country illegally should remain a crime.

      "bodyText": "Joe Biden sits squarely atop an unwieldy Democratic presidential field, and is the only challenger who appears comfortably competitive when paired against Donald Trump in electoral battlegrounds such as Michigan, New Hampshire and Wisconsin. While other contenders lead the president in national polls, Biden is the one candidate who generates the kind of coalition necessary to avoid the debacle of 2016, that is a Democratic popular vote victory coupled with another electoral college defeat. Biden is reassuring, not strident, and in that sense he is the anti-Trump. Barack Obama\u2019s vice-president runs well with traditional Democratic constituencies along with those swing voters necessary to cobble together a win on election day 2020. Biden has done so despite repeated gaffes, uneven debate performances and the questionable conduct of Hunter Biden, his surviving son, and James Biden, his brother. The former Delaware senator\u2019s continued durability is about more than simple name recognition. Simply, Biden \u201cdoes\u201d reassuring naturally, and flashes emotional intelligence. It\u2019s more about people than a cause, and in that sense, Biden is a candidate for our tumultuous times. On the issues, Biden is a mainstream economic liberal, not a wild-eyed would-be revolutionary. Stridency is not his thing. He is not looking to recreate the world anew, and that is reassuring in a world buffeted by Trumpian tweetstorms. Unlike Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, Biden is not looking to strip Americans of their health insurance policies for the sake of bringing a progressive Arcadia to the here and now. In Biden\u2019s playbook, preserving Obamacare and maintaining coverage for pre-existing conditions takes priority over change for its own sake, and middle America is fine with that. Likewise, while Biden supports comprehensive immigration reform, a path to citizenship for those who came to the US illegally and are part of our social fabric, he also believes that entering the country illegally should remain a crime. Borders are more than a concept. Like it or not, immigration and borders remain a political hotspot. By the numbers, a plurality of Democrats and nearly two-thirds of Americans disagree with Warren\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 stance. Simply put, Biden is a creature of the cultural center, someone who resonates with suburban moms, African Americans and retirees who have earned their right to social security and Medicare after a lifetime of work. To Trump\u2019s chagrin, Biden has established a rapport with firefighters. Unlike Bill de Blasio, New York City\u2019s absentee mayor and delusional presidential aspirant, Biden is capable of empathizing with the men and women in blue. In Tell Me, Dad, Biden writes of paying his respects to two New York City policemen who were shot dead just for being cops. One was Latino, the other Asian American. Biden\u2019s grief rings genuine: \u201cThe assassin\u2019s bullet targeted not just two officers, not just a uniform. It targeted this city.\u201d Then to twist the knife into the mayor, and to mark his own political turf, Biden recalls that De Blasio \u201cseemed happy that it was me representing the administration because he knew I had a close relationship with the police and the civil rights community\u201d. Biden\u2019s tale is one of an old-time north-east Democratic politician who understands that culture and coalitions both count. At the same time, he was ahead of the curve when it came to same-sex marriage, nudging Obama on the issue in an unscripted moment of Sunday news show candor. Anyone who thinks that whoever emerges as the Democratic nominee will be elected president is mistaken. Who the nominee is will be crucial. The ability to speak to all Americans, and not just the party\u2019s base is an imperative. As demonstrated by the results of Tuesday\u2019s special election in North Carolina\u2019s ninth congressional district \u2013 which the Republican won by only 2% in a district Trump had captured by double-digits \u2013 the political climate has not budged all that much since the 2018 midterms, with city dwellers and suburbanites squaring off against rural voters and the chasm between the two groups growing deeper and wider.

Then three months into her job she was directed to \u201cwipe every trace of Epstein from the university\u2019s record\u201d.</p> <p>That order was Swenson\u2019s first clue that the Media Lab\u2019s relationship with Epstein, who killed himself in a jailhouse suicide after being arrested on sex-trafficking charges in July, was highly sensitive to the institution. As it would turn out, the link was so sensitive that toxic fallout at the Media Lab has proven to far-ranging and ongoing.</p> <p>Last week, the scandal claimed Ito, who secured at least $7.5m in donations from Epstein or a circle of donors connected to him, including Bill Gates and Apollo Global Management \u2019s Leon Black. He had previously claimed the lab only received $525,000 in Epstein donations and that had been just an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/mit-media-lab-director-joichi-ito-im-deeply-sorry-for-ties-to-jeffrey-epstein\">error in judgement</a>\u201d.</p> <p>This week, Brown University also announced the suspension of Peter Cohen, a fundraising director who reportedly helped cover up Epstein\u2019s connections when he was working as the Media Lab\u2019s director of development, despite MIT listing Epstein as \u201cdisqualified\u201d in its donor database.</p> <p>Cohen <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/09/10/former-mit-media-lab-fund-raiser-says-was-following-university-rules/OnnyCWT9t0I5AQW6OeeXwN/story.html\">claims the fundraising practices</a> at MIT were \u201cauthorized by and implemented with the full knowledge of MIT central administration\u201d \u2013 a claim that the woman who blew the whistle on MIT finds hard to believe.</p> <p>The directive, Swenson recalls, came after Epstein gave a relatively small gift \u2013 \u201c50 or a hundred thousand dollars\u201d \u2013 to help restore a Rothko painting. Three months later he unexpectedly acknowledged the gift in a press release.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/07/jeffrey-epstein-mit-funding-tech-intellectuals\">The Epstein scandal at MIT shows the moral bankruptcy of techno-elites</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He was, Swenson believes, \u201cshowing Joi that he had to keep him happy\u201d. \u201cHe was saying to Joi: \u2018I can destroy you by telling people you know me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were all frantic,\u201d Swenson recalls. \u201cThe MIT press office reached out to investigate.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI felt like my job was to protect secrets,\u201d says Signe Swenson, who last week emerged as key witness in the relationship between disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s (MIT) Media Lab and its former head, Joi Ito. Ito resigned last week after a picture emerged of institutional efforts to accept and cover up substantial philanthropic donations from Epstein that threaten to devastate the reputation of the famed technology-research centre. It was a story of powerful men and huge amounts of money. But its exposure, and the resultant scandal and house-cleaning at one of the world\u2019s most renowned academic institutions, was at least in part down to the bravery of one female whistleblower. In an interview with the Guardian, Swenson, a former development associate and alumni coordinator at the lab, said that when she took the job canvassing potential MIT donors, Swenson was told one of her duties would be \u201cto help the existing relationship between Joi Ito and Jeffrey Epstein along\u201d. Then three months into her job she was directed to \u201cwipe every trace of Epstein from the university\u2019s record\u201d. That order was Swenson\u2019s first clue that the Media Lab\u2019s relationship with Epstein, who killed himself in a jailhouse suicide after being arrested on sex-trafficking charges in July, was highly sensitive to the institution. As it would turn out, the link was so sensitive that toxic fallout at the Media Lab has proven to far-ranging and ongoing. Last week, the scandal claimed Ito, who secured at least $7.5m in donations from Epstein or a circle of donors connected to him, including Bill Gates and Apollo Global Management \u2019s Leon Black. He had previously claimed the lab only received $525,000 in Epstein donations and that had been just an \u201cerror in judgement\u201d. This week, Brown University also announced the suspension of Peter Cohen, a fundraising director who reportedly helped cover up Epstein\u2019s connections when he was working as the Media Lab\u2019s director of development, despite MIT listing Epstein as \u201cdisqualified\u201d in its donor database. Cohen claims the fundraising practices at MIT were \u201cauthorized by and implemented with the full knowledge of MIT central administration\u201d \u2013 a claim that the woman who blew the whistle on MIT finds hard to believe. The directive, Swenson recalls, came after Epstein gave a relatively small gift \u2013 \u201c50 or a hundred thousand dollars\u201d \u2013 to help restore a Rothko painting. Three months later he unexpectedly acknowledged the gift in a press release. He was, Swenson believes, \u201cshowing Joi that he had to keep him happy\u201d. \u201cHe was saying to Joi: \u2018I can destroy you by telling people you know me.\u2019\u201d \u201cWe were all frantic,\u201d Swenson recalls. \u201cThe MIT press office reached out to investigate. They were wanting to refute or play down what he\u2019d said. If it came out, Joi was ready to call Epstein to ask him to take it down.\u201d In that event, the press release was not widely picked up so there was no need to spring into action. But in the larger picture, Swenson said she finds Ito\u2019s denial that he ever saw anything suspicious over the course of his long friendship with Epstein, including trips to Epstein\u2019s homes in New York, the Caribbean and New Mexico \u201cimplausible\u201d. According to Swenson, who witnessed Epstein\u2019s visit to the lab accompanied by two eastern European \u201cassistants\u201d, Ito and his colleagues were \u201cat best complicit in denying a problem\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about the worst,\u201d she says. \u201cJoi spent time in Epstein\u2019s homes and regularly socialized with him. It felt like bringing these two women everywhere, especially to scientific meetings, was a distraction. And the idea that they thought nothing was underfoot is impossible to believe.\u201d Swenson now recognizes that Epstein was \u201cusing the lab as a social thing and he knew that academics would be weak for money\u201d. Beyond that,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s hard to think further\u201d. Swenson says that a \u201csmall group of women in the office realized this was wrong, that this should not be happening, and that Epstein should not be running around MIT \u201d. The women had a name for Epstein: Voldemort. After working at the lab for three years, Swenson stepped away when, she says, \u201cshe realized her opinions and those of other women at the lab who had expressed discomfort at Epstein\u2019s visits and efforts to obscure his donation would not be heard. \u201cI realized that the job was never going to be what I wanted it to be,\u201d she concluded. Swenson first came forward to the New Yorker earlier this month. She produced emails that showed MIT had grossly underplayed the relationship with Epstein and the sums that he had given, or directed to be given, to the institution. The university said that it received $800,000 from Epstein\u2019s foundations over 25 years. MIT\u2019s president, Rafael Reif, wrote: \u201cWith hindsight, we recognize with shame and distress that we allowed MIT to contribute to the elevation of his reputation, which in turn served to distract from his horrifying acts. No apology can undo that.\u201d Ito disclosed that he had separately received $1.2m from Epstein for investment funds under his control, in addition to $525,000 he had donated to the lab. But the New Yorker story blew that limited admission and apology out of the water. Reif called the relationship \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and announced a \u201cthorough and independent investigation\u201d by an outside law firm. Ito\u2019s resignation followed soon after. Swenson\u2019s decision to come forward, she says, came after Epstein was arrested in early July. She recognized that the discomfort she felt, specifically around the women Epstein brought with him to the lab, were well-founded.

On steep hills overlooking the harbour is the area where the outside world set up trading and diplomatic missions following the end of policy of isolation in the mid-19th century. You find colonial-style European architecture mixed with Japanese features such as sliding doors, painted scrolls and pine tree bonsai. There is even the sound of church bells from a Russian orthodox church. These buildings feel unique, not just within Japan but the world. You can go inside many of them to learn more: we visited the former British consulate for just over \u00a32, to see historical exhibits, preserved rooms and a well-kept rose garden. <br><strong>Will</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9a19fac5-8dff-4125-9ba7-ba08f2c09fa7\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

One of the oldest is Meikyoku Kissa Lion, the Lion Cafe, opened in 1926. It is in the sleaziest part of Shibuya, surrounded by love hotels and sex shops, but inside it\u2019s a model of decorum. In a hall decked out like a railway dining car, punters sit at tables facing three-metre-high wooden speakers, reverently listening to classical vinyl LPs.

Some trusts are having to spend as much as one-sixth of their entire budget on repaying debts falling due <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/12/nhs-hospital-trusts-to-pay-out-further-55bn-under-pfi-scheme\">as a result of the \u201ctoxic\u201d PFI scheme</a>, says the IPPR thinktank.</p> \n<p>The \u00a313bn of investment that PFI brought into hospitals will end up costing the NHS in England a staggering \u00a380bn by the time all contracts come to an end, the IPPR says. Sherwood Forest trust in Nottinghamshire has a \u00a3326m PFI deal that costs it \u00a350.3m a year in repayments and eats up the largest proportion of its budget of any trust: 16.51%. The \u00a31.2bn outlay to build the Royal London hospital will have cost the Barts Health trust \u00a36.2bn by the time it ends, according to Treasury figures. \u201cAll trust debts should be wiped clean by the Treasury, and contracts renegotiated and brought back into public ownership on grounds of poor value,\u201d said Dr John Puntis, co-chair of the campaign group Keep Our NHS Public.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Lawless Johnson warned \u2013 </strong>Civil service union the FDA has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/civil-service-union-tells-pm-dont-make-our-members-break-law\">put Boris Johnson on notice not to make its members break the law</a>, after his refusal to comply with legislation to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The union has told the PM that the civil servants\u2019 code binds them to \u201ccomply with the law and uphold the administration of justice\u201d. Leaked warnings about a no-deal Brexit that the government previously dismissed as outdated have been affirmed after MPs forced the government to release its plan, known as Operation Yellowhammer. No deal could result in rising food and fuel prices, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/operation-yellowhammer-fears-no-deal-brexit-chaos-forced-to-publish-secret-papers\">disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder on Britain\u2019s streets</a>, according to the documents.

Ivor Ferguson, Ulster Farmers Union president, says: \u201cAll in all, no deal will be a total disaster and a percentage of farmers would be out of business.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Litter louts all \u2013 </strong>Jeremy Paxman will today indict Britain as \u201ca nation of litter louts\u201d and blast government efforts to clean up the country\u2019s act. \u201cThere is, in truth, only one way to solve this problem,\u201d the patron of Clean Up Britain will tell a waste and recycling conference. \u201cPeople have to change the way they behave. Our ambition is to reach a point where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/12/britain-is-nation-of-litter-louts-says-jeremy-paxman\">dropping litter is as socially unacceptable as drunk driving</a>.\u201d Paxman has called for measures including number plate recognition to catch litterers at drive-throughs. He hit out at the government and the Keep Britain Tidy charity as both \u201cuseless\u201d \u2013 the latter responded that it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d to be attacked by a kindred campaigner. Meanwhile MPs have been told that increasingly used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/12/plastic-alternatives-may-worsen-marine-pollution-mps-warn\">biodegradable alternatives to plastic packaging can be just as harmful</a> if not broken down in industrial composting facilities as intended. MPs say the focus should be on reducing plastic packaging rather than using other materials. And farming may be under threat because the earthworms that ensure soil health <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/12/worms-fail-to-thrive-in-soil-containing-microplastics-study\">are stunted by ever more prevalent microplastic pollution</a>, scientists have found.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Health records thrown open \u2013 </strong>Britain is to allow pharmaceutical firms, doctors and academics access to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/12/britain-to-use-millions-of-nhs-patients-histories-to-seek-cures\">millions of NHS patients\u2019 medical histories</a> to help the search for cures for ailments from cancer to mental illness. Seven \u201cdata hubs\u201d will be set up. It is likely to raise anxiety about possible breaches of patients\u2019 privacy and the commercialisation of patient records. The programme will be run by Health Data Research (HDR) UK, a non-profit body independent of government. It says the data will be anonymised. Separately, chances of surviving cancer are improving in the UK but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/11/uk-still-behind-in-cancer-survival-despite-recent-surge\">have not caught up with other comparable countries</a>, a 20-year research exercise has shown.

The in-game rewards offer a random selection of items to players who buy or earn them. The digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee says games that include the purchase of loot boxes for real money should be marked as containing gambling and age-rated content, and the government should consider regulating them as games of chance under the Gambling Act 2005. The recommendation is part of the committee\u2019s report on immersive and addictive technologies, to be delivered today.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Keep working \u2013 </strong>A study commissioned by the Labour party has come down against a French-style legal cap on the length of the working week. The cross-bench peer Robert Skidelsky found a reduction in hours was desirable but a blanket limit was unrealistic. Instead he proposed a sector-by-sector approach. The report notes full-time workers in the UK do longer hours than in any EU country except Greece and Austria. \u201cAt present the rules governing employment are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/sep/12/french-style-cap-on-working-week-in-britain-unrealistic-finds-study\">largely set by financial logic. This is inimical to a civilised reduction in hours</a>,\u201d Skidelsky wrote. \u201cThere is therefore a strong argument for setting up countervailing institutions to \u2018nudge\u2019 society in a direction which science and technology makes possible, and which is also desired by most people.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said he would use the report in formulating Labour policy.</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: How Dorian devastated the Bahamas</h2> \n<p>Oliver Laughland tells Rachel Humphrys about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/sep/12/its-all-gone-how-hurricane-dorian-devastated-the-bahamas-podcast\">destruction he witnessed in the Bahamas</a> in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian.

      "bodyText": "Top story: NHS trusts left with huge debt burden Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray doing the paperless round this morning. NHS hospital trusts are being crippled by the legacy of the private finance initiative (PFI) championed under Tony Blair and will have to make another \u00a355bn in payments by the time the last contract ends in 2050, a report reveals. Some trusts are having to spend as much as one-sixth of their entire budget on repaying debts falling due as a result of the \u201ctoxic\u201d PFI scheme, says the IPPR thinktank. The \u00a313bn of investment that PFI brought into hospitals will end up costing the NHS in England a staggering \u00a380bn by the time all contracts come to an end, the IPPR says. Sherwood Forest trust in Nottinghamshire has a \u00a3326m PFI deal that costs it \u00a350.3m a year in repayments and eats up the largest proportion of its budget of any trust: 16.51%. The \u00a31.2bn outlay to build the Royal London hospital will have cost the Barts Health trust \u00a36.2bn by the time it ends, according to Treasury figures. \u201cAll trust debts should be wiped clean by the Treasury, and contracts renegotiated and brought back into public ownership on grounds of poor value,\u201d said Dr John Puntis, co-chair of the campaign group Keep Our NHS Public. * * * Lawless Johnson warned \u2013 Civil service union the FDA has put Boris Johnson on notice not to make its members break the law, after his refusal to comply with legislation to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The union has told the PM that the civil servants\u2019 code binds them to \u201ccomply with the law and uphold the administration of justice\u201d. Leaked warnings about a no-deal Brexit that the government previously dismissed as outdated have been affirmed after MPs forced the government to release its plan, known as Operation Yellowhammer. No deal could result in rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder on Britain\u2019s streets, according to the documents. In Ireland the price of bread is likely to go up: the only two industrial-scale flour mills on the island are in Northern Ireland, so cross-border tariffs would be introduced. The uncertainty is leaving the all-island agri-food sector in disarray, Lisa O\u2019Carroll writes. Ivor Ferguson, Ulster Farmers Union president, says: \u201cAll in all, no deal will be a total disaster and a percentage of farmers would be out of business.\u201d * * * Litter louts all \u2013 Jeremy Paxman will today indict Britain as \u201ca nation of litter louts\u201d and blast government efforts to clean up the country\u2019s act. \u201cThere is, in truth, only one way to solve this problem,\u201d the patron of Clean Up Britain will tell a waste and recycling conference. \u201cPeople have to change the way they behave. Our ambition is to reach a point where dropping litter is as socially unacceptable as drunk driving.\u201d Paxman has called for measures including number plate recognition to catch litterers at drive-throughs. He hit out at the government and the Keep Britain Tidy charity as both \u201cuseless\u201d \u2013 the latter responded that it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d to be attacked by a kindred campaigner. Meanwhile MPs have been told that increasingly used biodegradable alternatives to plastic packaging can be just as harmful if not broken down in industrial composting facilities as intended. MPs say the focus should be on reducing plastic packaging rather than using other materials. And farming may be under threat because the earthworms that ensure soil health are stunted by ever more prevalent microplastic pollution, scientists have found. * * * Health records thrown open \u2013 Britain is to allow pharmaceutical firms, doctors and academics access to millions of NHS patients\u2019 medical histories to help the search for cures for ailments from cancer to mental illness. Seven \u201cdata hubs\u201d will be set up. It is likely to raise anxiety about possible breaches of patients\u2019 privacy and the commercialisation of patient records. The programme will be run by Health Data Research (HDR) UK, a non-profit body independent of government. It says the data will be anonymised. Separately, chances of surviving cancer are improving in the UK but have not caught up with other comparable countries, a 20-year research exercise has shown. Other countries are doing better thanks to new technologies and efforts to catch and treat cancer early. * * * \u2018Loot boxes\u2019 under scrutiny \u2013 Video game \u201cloot boxes\u201d should be regulated as gambling and children barred from purchasing them, a House of Commons committee has advised. The in-game rewards offer a random selection of items to players who buy or earn them. The digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee says games that include the purchase of loot boxes for real money should be marked as containing gambling and age-rated content, and the government should consider regulating them as games of chance under the Gambling Act 2005. The recommendation is part of the committee\u2019s report on immersive and addictive technologies, to be delivered today. * * * Keep working \u2013 A study commissioned by the Labour party has come down against a French-style legal cap on the length of the working week. The cross-bench peer Robert Skidelsky found a reduction in hours was desirable but a blanket limit was unrealistic. Instead he proposed a sector-by-sector approach. The report notes full-time workers in the UK do longer hours than in any EU country except Greece and Austria. \u201cAt present the rules governing employment are largely set by financial logic. This is inimical to a civilised reduction in hours,\u201d Skidelsky wrote. \u201cThere is therefore a strong argument for setting up countervailing institutions to \u2018nudge\u2019 society in a direction which science and technology makes possible, and which is also desired by most people.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said he would use the report in formulating Labour policy. Today in Focus podcast: How Dorian devastated the Bahamas Oliver Laughland tells Rachel Humphrys about the destruction he witnessed in the Bahamas in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian. Also today: Chris Hanretty on the Scottish court\u2019s ruling that the British government\u2019s suspension of parliament was unlawful (more on that here). Lunchtime read: Life and death on the high seas In August 2010, the captain of the South Korean fishing trawler Sajo Oyang 70 ordered the net back over the side one more time. At about 3am on 18 August, the ship\u2019s first mate roused Captain Shin from his sleep. The net was too full, the first mate told him. It was pulling the boat under. But Shin demanded that the deckhands keep hoisting. When he would finally belay that order and allow the net to be cut free, the knives came out too late \u2013 the ship rolled over. Six crew members, including Shin, lost their lives in the waters of the Pacific. From bullying and sexual assault to squalid living conditions and forced labour, working at sea can be a grim business \u2013 and the deep-sea fishing fleet of the Sajo Group is particularly notorious, Ian Urbina reports. Sport Joe Root has said the planning for England\u2019s next Ashes tour to Australia begins right away, after dropping Jason Roy for today\u2019s fifth Test, which the tourists\u2019 captain Tim Paine has described as a Grand Final, despite having already retained the urn. Dylan Hartley has said friends reacted to the news he had missed out on England\u2019s Rugby World Cup squad almost as though he had died. The Sri Lankan cricket board says it has been warned about a possible terrorist threat during its planned tour of Pakistan. As Europe and the US prepare to face off at Gleneagles the claims that the Solheim Cup is \u2018the pinnacle of women\u2019s golf\u2019 fall flat with only two of the world\u2019s top 10 playing. And Gareth Southgate has admitted he fears the worst when it comes to England\u2019s next two qualifying matches and the potential for disorder involving the team\u2019s supporters. Business The Hong Kong stock exchange has made a surprise \u00a332bn bid for the London Stock Exchange in the latest example of growing Chinese interest in British companies. It is the seventh bid for the LSE since 2000. All have failed and Nils Pratley, our financial commentator, reckons this one won\u2019t be any different because it doesn\u2019t offer enough of a cash incentive and there\u2019s too much exposure to political uncertainty in the territory. Asian markets were up overnight on hopes of more monetary easing from the European Central Bank today. The FTSE100 is seen rising 0.5% while the pound is at $1.233 and \u20ac1.119. The papers The Guardian reports: \u201cFears of no-deal chaos as ministers forced to publish secret documents\u201d, the Times has: \u201cPM blocks key memos on shutting Commons\u201d and the Express reports: \u201cBoris: I won\u2019t do deal with Farage\u201d. The i (\u201cQueen dragged into \u2018unlawful\u2019 shutdown of Commons\u201d) and the Mirror (\u201cBoris lied to the Queen\u201d) take aim at Johnson\u2019s advice to prorogue parliament being deemed illegal. The Telegraph says: \u201cTory rebels offered an olive branch\u201d, with news there may be a way for them to return to the fold. The Sun has news of Freddie Flintoff: \u201cFreddie in 124mph Top Gear smash\u201d, the Mail reports of Britain ranking bottom of an international survival table: \u201cUK\u2019s cancer care shame\u201d and the FT has: \u201cLondon Stock Exchange poised to rebuff \u00a332bn Hong Kong bid\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The policeman tasked with investigating Tanya Day\u2019s death in custody said he did not question fellow officers about inconsistencies in their statement because asking follow-up questions was not \u201cbest practice\u201d. Det Sgt Scott Riley was the coronial investigator who produced the initial brief of evidence about the 55-year-old Yorta Yorta woman\u2019s death for the coroner, Caitlin English. Day died on 22 December, 2017, from a traumatic brain injury sustained when she fell in the Castlemaine police cells on 5 December. She was detained to \u201csober up\u201d after being arrested for public drunkenness. Riley told an inquest into Day\u2019s death in Melbourne on Thursday that he chose not to ask police officers Edwina Neale and Danny Wolters about discrepancies between their statements and CCTV footage because he \u201cconsidered it not to be best practice.\u201d \u201cBest practice is to get a statement from the witness as soon as you can after the event,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThat statement is their memory... in this case the statements are oversighted by [the professional standards command].\u201d Asked by the counsel for Day\u2019s family, Peter Morrissey, if that would prevent him from asking a question if he was provided with inconsistent evidence, Riley said there was nothing to prevent him asking a question, \u201cbut it\u2019s not the best practice\u201d. The officer from professional standards who had oversight of the investigation into Day\u2019s death was Det Sgt Mark Patrick. He told the inquest that Riley\u2019s view of best practice was incorrect. \u201cI believe that you should recanvass if required,\u201d Patrick said. Patrick said there were \u201cno proposed policy or process changes recommended from the oversight process.\u201d He said that he concluded that Wolters had breached police guidelines by failing to conduct a welfare check every 30 minutes, and had been given \u201cworkplace guidance\u201d. Neale was found not to be in breach. Riley told the inquest that he had not attempted to locate any of the other passengers that were in the same V/Line carriage as Day. He also had not attempted to obtain any CCTV footage of Day\u2019s arrival at Bendigo hospital because he said he had not believed it to be relevant, and had not attempted to seize or even review CCTV footage of Day being wheeled out of the police station by paramedics. \u201cIt\u2019s probably an oversight,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving said that, I don\u2019t know that it would add a huge amount of value.\u201d He said he had not told doctors treating Day at St Vincent\u2019s hospital the details of her fall, when he had identified it on CCTV, and had not considered doing so. Under policies implemented following the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody almost 30 years ago, deaths in custody are to be investigated as a homicide in the first instance before being determined a coronial matter. Riley said he had investigated Day\u2019s injury as a potential homicide and that the decision not to consider it a homicide was part of an \u201congoing assessment\u201d that could be reversed at any time, including as a result of new information arising from the inquest. Asked whether he had any particular knowledge or training about the royal commission prior to Day\u2019s death, Riley said, \u201cI had knowledge of there being a royal commission but no training in relation to that and no knowledge in relation to it.\u201d \u201cI believe I conducted a thorough investigation,\u201d he said. Emrys Nekvapil, a barrister for Day\u2019s family, argued that since police replaced the process of charging and bailing a person for public drunkenness with issuing an infringement notice, there was no power to hold a drunk person in custody. \u201cIt is simply beyond the power for police officers to do what they have given evidence in this case they did, which is to take someone into custody purely for their own safety,\u201d Nekvapil said. The inquest is expected to run until Friday.",

      "bodyText": "It was the trip of a lifetime, a globe-trotting adventure halfway across the world, chronicled online for family and friends back home and for followers online. But in the eyes of the regime in Tehran \u2013 squeezed by sanctions and paranoid about the motives of outsiders \u2013 the act of flying a drone near a military installation on the outskirts of the Iranian capital appeared as an act of espionage. The arrest, 10 weeks ago, of Australian couple Mark Firkin and Jolie King (who also holds a British passport) has cast in stark relief the mistrust that characterises Iran\u2019s view of the west, and foreigners within its borders. From an external perspective, the couple\u2019s activities were entirely innocent: the harmless, if naive, documenting of their grand adventure driving from Australia to London. But Tehran saw spying and swooped. \u201cI don\u2019t think Iran targeted these individuals because they are Australian,\u201d said Prof Shahram Akbarzadeh, research professor of Middle East and Central Asian politics at Deakin University, as details of the couple\u2019s arrest emerged on Thursday. \u201cThe authorities in Iran are very suspicious of foreign nationals travelling to Iran if they are producing films or documentaries, interviewing people or taking pictures of sensitive sites. These kinds of activities are seen as having a hidden agenda. \u201cIt speaks to the insecurity, to the paranoia of the ruling regime in Iran. The regime feels under pressure from foreign powers. Even though what this couple is said to have done appears, from the outside, to be mundane, to be benign, to Tehran it looks suspicious, it looks like spying.\u201d Tehran welcomes tourists \u2013 even if only for the much-needed foreign currency they bring \u2013 but it wants tight control of their movements and on the picture of Iran they present to the outside world. Little is publicly known about the arrest and trial of a third Australian currently held in an Iranian jail. The Guardian understands the Cambridge-educated British-Australian academic had been teaching at a university in Melbourne. She was arrested last year and tried (the nature of the charges are not publicly known) and sentenced to 10 years in prison. She is reportedly being held in solitary confinement in the notorious Evin prison. Australia\u2019s ability to negotiate on behalf of its citizens held in Iranian jails might once have been relatively strong. But its bargaining position has been weakened by its overt alignment to bellicose American policy in the Middle East. In August, Australian became only the third country to commit to a US-led coalition patrolling the Strait of Hormuz, the waterway off Iran\u2019s south coast through which about a fifth of the world\u2019s oil passes. Scott Morrison said \u201cdestabilising behaviour\u201d \u2013 a thinly veiled reference to Iran\u2019s capture of foreign-flagged ships \u2013 was a threat to Australian interests. US officials \u2013 including senior figures such as the just-deposed national security adviser John Bolton and the secretary of state Mike Pompeo \u2013 have been seen as advocates for regime change in Iran (though Donald Trump has disavowed this publicly). However this, combined with the US president\u2019s unilateral decision to tear up the Iran nuclear deal (widely regarded as successfully negating Iranian nuclear ambitions) and to reimpose crippling economic sanctions, has squeezed Iran into a political and economic corner. In recent history, relations between Iran and Australia have been robust, if not always smooth. Australia has maintained diplomatic relations with Tehran through decades where other western nations have abandoned them or they have become acutely strained. After the signing of the nuclear deal in 2015, then foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop was one of the first international figures to visit Tehran. But those ties have weakened: Australia hosts significant numbers of Iran students (mainly at postgraduate level) but trade between the two countries has diminished in recent years. Australia has few diplomatic levers to pull, Akbarzadeh argues. \u201cI think Australia\u2019s presence in the Persian Gulf [patrolling with the US] is largely symbolic, it will be small and not very effective,\u201d the professor says. \u201cBut it sends a signal and Iran has received that signal: it says Australia is firmly in the US camp and firmly supports the US sanctions on Iran.\u201d Canberra\u2019s adherence to a hawkish US policy has undermined Australia\u2019s ability to speak to the Iranian government, Akbarzadeh says. \u201cThe leadership in Iran wants to speak to foreign powers on an equal footing, they don\u2019t want to be lectured, talked down to, or coerced into a position of weakness.\u201d Iran\u2019s foreign affairs minister has previously floated the idea of a prisoner swap, essentially conceding that those foreign nationals held in Iranian jails might be used as hostages in order to free Iranians (there are currently about 12 foreign nationals in Iranian prisons, most holding dual Iranian citizenship not recognised by Tehran). But significantly, Akbarzadeh argues, the Australians held in Iranian jails are under the control of the country\u2019s judiciary, which historically holds to a much harder line on foreign national prisoners than the foreign ministry does. Australia has also lost potentially crucial leverage in the form of Iranian citizen Negar Ghodskani, who was held in an Adelaide jail for more than two years while she fought a US extradition request over allegations of sanctions busting. Ghodskani was eventually extradited. Last month, she pleaded guilty in an American court to being part of a conspiracy to evade US sanctions and illegally export controlled technology. She faces up to five years in jail. Iran was displeased by Australia\u2019s acquiescence to the US request to arrest Ghodskani in 2017, to the extent of repeatedly summoning Australia\u2019s ambassador to protest her arrest and treatment (Ghodskani was pregnant when arrested and went on to give birth while in prison). In April this year, while Ghodksani was still in Australia, Iran\u2019s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif publicly canvassed her as a candidate for a prisoner swap for British citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe (though it is unlikely Australia would ever have acceded in the face of US opposition). But that potential diplomatic leverage is gone, the US alliance on which Australia depends for its security is acutely damaging in Tehran, and Australia has few other levers to pull.",

Once a thriving community, it was crumbling in the wake of the miners\u2019 strike, leaving teenagers like Clarke raging with pent-up frustration. \u201cIt was just a release,\u201d he says of that night. \u201cYou\u2019re not in the village no more, that dingy little place. You could let yourselves go.\u201d</p> <p>The arrival of the rave scene to West Yorkshire is the subject of Wasteland, a dance-theatre show by David\u2019s younger brother, the choreographer Gary Clarke. Clarke junior has form when it comes to documenting local history: his award-winning piece Coal covered the realities of life for the pitmen of Grimethorpe. When Coal went on tour, the post-show discussions would regularly turn into raucous debates on the politics of the 1984-5 strike and the fate of the mining industry. One night a hand in the audience went up, and it was David\u2019s. \u201cWhat about us, Gary?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat happened to the next generation?\u201d And Gary immediately saw there was room for a sequel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b28a75304ce8ba792ca8e743d9ff952b3d878ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b28a75304ce8ba792ca8e743d9ff952b3d878ef/0_0_4151_3292/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Local history \u2026 Gary Clarke\u2019s Coal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"793\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local history \u2026 Gary Clarke\u2019s Coal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Armitage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen you look at what happened to the next generation in post-industrial Britain, the next big movement was rave culture,\u201d Gary says, when we meet in the cafe at the Hepworth Gallery in Wakefield, less than 10 miles from Grimethorpe but a world away.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/09/jeremy-deller-on-raving-stormzy-and-dave-give-me-hope\">Jeremy Deller\u2019s documentary Everybody in the Place</a>, the connection between the social and political climate of the mid-80s and the rise of illegal ravers dancing in a field won\u2019t be an alien idea. In Wasteland, Gary follows how that played out for one village at the centre of industrial decline. He describes how the miners\u2019 strike broke spirits as well as faith in authority, and the decline and eventual closure of the pit, in 1993, left the village gutted, literally and metaphorically.</p> <p>\u201cIt imploded,\u201d says Gary. \u201cThere were four schools in the village and they all got burned to the ground, and we did it, the people of Grimethorpe. Drug use, violence, domestic violence, crime. People felt abandoned, emasculated, worthless.\u201d There were no jobs, no prospects. \u201cThere was nowt,\u201d says David. \u201cNo hope. I\u2019m glad he called it Wasteland because that\u2019s what it was like.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d54a5815970587094838799d5824bf9ff7a60869\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d54a5815970587094838799d5824bf9ff7a60869/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Deller\u2019s documentary Everybody In the Place.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dancefloor revolt \u2026 Jeremy Deller\u2019s documentary Everybody In the Place.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Jeremy Deller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOur generation had to find a way of coping,\u201d says Gary. The alternative to fighting or arson was getting your frustrations and anger out on the dancefloor. \u201cIt felt like there was an urgency and a need when the raves first started,\u201d he says. Unlike clubbing now, \u201cyou weren\u2019t just buying an experience, you were creating it.\u201d</p> <p>Finding out about them was all word of mouth, getting in a car and following someone else. \u201cThis lad bought an old transit van for 80 quid, no seats in or nowt, and had about 25 of us in the back,\u201d says David. They\u2019d go to Afterdark, to the Donny [Doncaster] Warehouse, and Hacienda \u2013 but not the Manchester Hacienda that everyone knows. \u201cThis Hacienda was in a field in Howden [in east Yorkshire],\u201d says David. \u201cI don\u2019t think they had permission, they just put decks and speakers into a farmer\u2019s field in the middle of nowhere. That was one of the best things I\u2019ve ever been to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt put a smile on our faces when we had nothing to smile about,\u201d says David, who is currently unemployed and is an amateur boxer. \u201cFor those two days you\u2019d be proper enjoying it, but you knew you\u2019d still have to come back to this shithole. That\u2019s why we went for days.

Also breaking up the party was the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994 and heavy-handed police crackdowns, in which Gary sees parallels with the miners\u2019 strikes a decade earlier.</p> <p>All these themes go into Wasteland, which features archive footage of miners on their last shift, as well as films of the early raves that were discovered in someone\u2019s garage. Some have called Gary\u2019s work a dance documentary. \u201cIt\u2019s explicitly political,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not abstract, I don\u2019t over-conceptualise it. I don\u2019t want my audience to scratch their heads.\u201d <br><br>When it came to making the rave part of the show, Gary watched endless videos of early raves on YouTube, much harder and darker in tone than the shiny commercial clubbing of the late 90s. \u201cWe looked at this idea of urgency and aggression, the dancers being like birds of prey in cages, trying to push their wings out.\u201d Whereas illegal raves might have had 5,000 people in a field, Gary was working with only five dancers, so he had to find a way to give that feeling of \u201cmasses of bodies in a small space, the kaleidoscopic-ness. You don\u2019t know whose limbs are whose\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd1b777b2a6de3e42eaabd80126c92a0c6bd28b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd1b777b2a6de3e42eaabd80126c92a0c6bd28b8/198_550_1826_1096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wasteland dance theatre show by choreographer Gary Clarke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You\u2019re not in the village no more \u2013 you could let yourself go\u2019 \u2026 Wasteland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Armitage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The dancers copied individual steps from the videos, which Gary then reorchestrated into something that appears spontaneous but is painstakingly put together. Thus the original material is authentic, just like the text in the show, all of which comes from interviews carried out by Gary. \u201cThe music, spoken word, movement, everything comes from a real source, it\u2019s facts rather than fiction,\u201d says Gary.<br><br>While making the show, Gary took his dancers to visit Grimethorpe. \u201cThey were shocked at how desolate it was,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a ghost village, there\u2019s very little prospect there.\u201d Nevertheless, after living in London, Gary has moved back home. \u201cThe people are just great, and the level of community is really strong.\u201d<br><br>Rave didn\u2019t solve Grimethorpe\u2019s problems, but it did change Gary\u2019s life. \u201cWithout that rave culture, I wouldn\u2019t be sat here, the choreographer I am,\u201d he says. It was through \u201cthrashing around\u201d to his brother\u2019s tapes as a kid that Gary found the way he loved to express himself. \u201cThen someone caught me dancing and said, \u2018Oh my god, I think you\u2019re a dancer\u2019, and it grew from that. I was nurtured by these brilliant teachers. Otherwise I really believe I would\u2019ve ended up going down the path some of my friends went down, burning cars, taking drugs and being destructive,\u201d he says. \u201cDance did save me.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The Wasteland tour starts on 25 September at <a href=\"https://www.northernstage.co.uk/Event/wasteland\">Northern Stage, Newcastle</a>.</p>",

Awesome.\u201d This was the beginnings of rave culture in England, and it changed everything for Clarke, then 15, growing up in the mining village of Grimethorpe. Once a thriving community, it was crumbling in the wake of the miners\u2019 strike, leaving teenagers like Clarke raging with pent-up frustration. \u201cIt was just a release,\u201d he says of that night. \u201cYou\u2019re not in the village no more, that dingy little place. You could let yourselves go.\u201d The arrival of the rave scene to West Yorkshire is the subject of Wasteland, a dance-theatre show by David\u2019s younger brother, the choreographer Gary Clarke. Clarke junior has form when it comes to documenting local history: his award-winning piece Coal covered the realities of life for the pitmen of Grimethorpe. When Coal went on tour, the post-show discussions would regularly turn into raucous debates on the politics of the 1984-5 strike and the fate of the mining industry. One night a hand in the audience went up, and it was David\u2019s. \u201cWhat about us, Gary?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat happened to the next generation?\u201d And Gary immediately saw there was room for a sequel. \u201cWhen you look at what happened to the next generation in post-industrial Britain, the next big movement was rave culture,\u201d Gary says, when we meet in the cafe at the Hepworth Gallery in Wakefield, less than 10 miles from Grimethorpe but a world away. If you\u2019ve seen Jeremy Deller\u2019s documentary Everybody in the Place, the connection between the social and political climate of the mid-80s and the rise of illegal ravers dancing in a field won\u2019t be an alien idea. In Wasteland, Gary follows how that played out for one village at the centre of industrial decline. He describes how the miners\u2019 strike broke spirits as well as faith in authority, and the decline and eventual closure of the pit, in 1993, left the village gutted, literally and metaphorically. \u201cIt imploded,\u201d says Gary. \u201cThere were four schools in the village and they all got burned to the ground, and we did it, the people of Grimethorpe. Drug use, violence, domestic violence, crime. People felt abandoned, emasculated, worthless.\u201d There were no jobs, no prospects. \u201cThere was nowt,\u201d says David. \u201cNo hope. I\u2019m glad he called it Wasteland because that\u2019s what it was like.\u201d \u201cOur generation had to find a way of coping,\u201d says Gary. The alternative to fighting or arson was getting your frustrations and anger out on the dancefloor. \u201cIt felt like there was an urgency and a need when the raves first started,\u201d he says. Unlike clubbing now, \u201cyou weren\u2019t just buying an experience, you were creating it.\u201d Finding out about them was all word of mouth, getting in a car and following someone else. \u201cThis lad bought an old transit van for 80 quid, no seats in or nowt, and had about 25 of us in the back,\u201d says David. They\u2019d go to Afterdark, to the Donny [Doncaster] Warehouse, and Hacienda \u2013 but not the Manchester Hacienda that everyone knows. \u201cThis Hacienda was in a field in Howden [in east Yorkshire],\u201d says David. \u201cI don\u2019t think they had permission, they just put decks and speakers into a farmer\u2019s field in the middle of nowhere. That was one of the best things I\u2019ve ever been to.\u201d \u201cIt put a smile on our faces when we had nothing to smile about,\u201d says David, who is currently unemployed and is an amateur boxer. \u201cFor those two days you\u2019d be proper enjoying it, but you knew you\u2019d still have to come back to this shithole. That\u2019s why we went for days. Donny finished at 6am, Hacienda opened at 6, we just bounced from one to another.\u201d \u201cIf mam had found out we were doing all this she\u2019d have killed me,\u201d David adds. What did she think you were doing? \u201cFishing. Two days fishing.\u201d And she wasn\u2019t suspicious when they came back with no catch? \u201cI just told her I was rubbish at fishing.\u201d To people such as David, the raves offered an escape that felt like salvation. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for that, there\u2019d have been a lot of lads topping themselves,\u201d David says. \u201cBut a lot did,\u201d Gary interjects. \u201cGrimethorpe cemetery is full of teenagers.\u201d Raves led them to drugs, heroin took hold, addiction and suicide became rife. Also breaking up the party was the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994 and heavy-handed police crackdowns, in which Gary sees parallels with the miners\u2019 strikes a decade earlier. All these themes go into Wasteland, which features archive footage of miners on their last shift, as well as films of the early raves that were discovered in someone\u2019s garage. Some have called Gary\u2019s work a dance documentary. \u201cIt\u2019s explicitly political,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not abstract, I don\u2019t over-conceptualise it. I don\u2019t want my audience to scratch their heads.\u201d When it came to making the rave part of the show, Gary watched endless videos of early raves on YouTube, much harder and darker in tone than the shiny commercial clubbing of the late 90s. \u201cWe looked at this idea of urgency and aggression, the dancers being like birds of prey in cages, trying to push their wings out.\u201d Whereas illegal raves might have had 5,000 people in a field, Gary was working with only five dancers, so he had to find a way to give that feeling of \u201cmasses of bodies in a small space, the kaleidoscopic-ness. You don\u2019t know whose limbs are whose\u201d. The dancers copied individual steps from the videos, which Gary then reorchestrated into something that appears spontaneous but is painstakingly put together. Thus the original material is authentic, just like the text in the show, all of which comes from interviews carried out by Gary. \u201cThe music, spoken word, movement, everything comes from a real source, it\u2019s facts rather than fiction,\u201d says Gary. While making the show, Gary took his dancers to visit Grimethorpe. \u201cThey were shocked at how desolate it was,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a ghost village, there\u2019s very little prospect there.\u201d Nevertheless, after living in London, Gary has moved back home. \u201cThe people are just great, and the level of community is really strong.\u201d Rave didn\u2019t solve Grimethorpe\u2019s problems, but it did change Gary\u2019s life. \u201cWithout that rave culture, I wouldn\u2019t be sat here, the choreographer I am,\u201d he says. It was through \u201cthrashing around\u201d to his brother\u2019s tapes as a kid that Gary found the way he loved to express himself. \u201cThen someone caught me dancing and said, \u2018Oh my god, I think you\u2019re a dancer\u2019, and it grew from that. I was nurtured by these brilliant teachers. Otherwise I really believe I would\u2019ve ended up going down the path some of my friends went down, burning cars, taking drugs and being destructive,\u201d he says. \u201cDance did save me.\u201d \u2022 The Wasteland tour starts on 25 September at Northern Stage, Newcastle.",

The recommendation comes as part of the digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee\u2019s report on immersive and addictive technologies, published on Thursday after months of parliamentary hearings with technology and gaming companies. Loot boxes, in-game rewards that offer a randomised selection of items to players who buy or earn them, should not be regulated if they are exclusively earned for in-game success, the committee says. But if they are purchased for real money, then, at the very least, the game should be marked as containing gambling and age-rated content accordingly, and the government should consider regulating the practice as a game of chance under the Gambling Act 2005, the report concludes. While loot boxes involve an element of chance because players do not know what they will get, they are not covered by existing gambling legislation because the items \u201cwon\u201d are not considered to have monetary value. But the report heard evidence that loot box winnings can be exchanged for money and that their use by game developers was likely to \u201cfacilitate profiting from problem gamblers\u201d. Damian Collins, the chair of the committee, said: \u201cLoot boxes are particularly lucrative for games companies but come at a high cost, particularly for problem gamblers, while exposing children to potential harm.

The report cited evidence from cognitive psychologists that such in-game features are \u201cdesigned to exploit potent psychological mechanisms associated with [...] gambling-like behaviours\u201d. Academics told the DCMS committee there was not yet enough evidence on the psychological effects that gambling-style features in games have on children, partly because the industry has not released data it holds on the subject. Loot boxes are already classed as gambling in Belgium, where MPs said video game companies had withdrawn them from sale rather than be forced to obtain a gambling licence. Labour\u2019s shadow DCMS minister, Tom Watson, said the report\u2019s findings bolstered his case for the Gambling Act 2005, introduced under Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government, to be replaced entirely. \u201cThis [the report] echoes the Labour party\u2019s long-standing position on loot boxes,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, making changes to the existing legislation will not be enough.

The National Deaf Children\u2019s Society\u2019s research shows the top 11 children\u2019s films were shown in an average of 581 cinemas, with only 171 cinemas providing at least one subtitled screening. \u201cThis research couldn\u2019t be clearer \u2013 deaf children across the UK are being denied a key part of their childhood because cinemas are refusing to put on subtitled performances,\u201d said Helen Cable, the director of children, young people and families at the charity. \u201cThe remedy couldn\u2019t be more straightforward: cinemas need to increase the number of subtitled films they show, and show them at times that are more convenient for families.\u201d The charity also recommended investment in new technology \u2013 such as tablets with subtitle technology and smart-caption glasses which are in use at the National Theatre \u2013 that would, it says, transform the cinema experience for deaf children. \u201cNone of this is rocket science but its impact would be enormous,\u201d Cable added.

      "bodyText": "National Grid began cutting hundreds of staff from the unit responsible for keeping the lights on several months before Britain\u2019s biggest blackout in a decade, the Guardian has learned. The owner of Britain\u2019s power system is reducing the workforce at its energy system operator division by a quarter, under a programme that will take aim at the part of the company responsible for managing the electricity system. The 1,148-strong team will shrink by almost 280 staff to 870, through a mix of voluntary redundancies and redeployments, in plans which have been under discussion since last summer. The energy giant, which made profits of \u00a31.8bn in the last financial year and hiked dividends to its shareholders, is under investigation by the industry regulator and an emergency government committee following the 9 August blackouts which left millions without electricity, and caused major travel disruption. One former National Grid employee said hundreds of senior staff have already left the unit, but the cuts were not made public because the majority were voluntary redundancies and agreed on \u201cvery good\u201d terms which are protected by non-disclosure agreements. National Grid hopes to \u201cget rid of more experienced, better paid\u201d staff, and \u201creplace them with less experienced, lower paid workers\u201d, according to the source. The company\u2019s regulated business plans show that the group will replace some of the staff with an extra 250 workers by the end of 2021. The source said the energy giant\u2019s older staff are understood to be on final salary pensions, whereas newer staff are less of a burden on the company\u2019s pension scheme. A spokesman for the electricity system operator said the changes have had \u201cno impact on the day-to-day running\u201d of National Grid\u2019s electricity system control room in Wokingham. He added that staffing levels and rotas \u201cremain tightly regulated to ensure a resilient electricity system which provides good value for customers\u201d. The decision to shrink the number of highly skilled workers has emerged despite warnings from one of its own senior executives that National Grid has been \u201cwalking blind\u201d into the risk of blackouts for over a year. Alan Whitehead MP, the shadow energy minister, said: \u201cGiven recent blackout events and near misses it is important that National Grid retains the skills and expertise needed to keep the lights on, trains running and hospitals powered. Cutting jobs and losing skills raises concerns that shareholders and dividends are being considered before their duty to serve the public.\u201d The August blackout, the biggest in a decade, struck just months after the energy system operator was hived off from National Grid\u2019s central business in April this year. The legal separation took place following growing political pressure for the company to be broken up because of claims from experts that running the energy system, while also owning and operating energy infrastructure, represents a conflict of interests. Steve Thomas, the national secretary of the Prospect trade union, said: \u201cNational Grid ESO has made a significant number of people redundant at considerable loss of expertise and experience. \u201cWith the business plan proposing the rehiring of 250 workers over the next couple of years it is our concern that one of the drivers for redundancy, and the decisions about who was offered redundancy, was shareholder concern rather than retaining the skills the company needs to maintain grid resilience now and in the future.\u201d National Grid did not directly respond when asked why it planned to reduce its staff before rehiring in the coming years.

      "bodyText": "The mood in Dublin Castle is sombre as 300 food businesses gather at a \u201cgetting Ireland Brexit-ready\u201d government workshop before a crucial cabinet meeting on a \u20ac5bn no-deal budget. In a show of hands, 80% of delegates confirm they have started preparations for a no-deal Brexit but just one man raises his hand when asked: who feels they are prepared? While the mood music over a possible Brexit deal appears to have shifted following the meeting between Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar in Dublin on Monday, the outlook in Ireland remains bleak. In July the Irish government outlined two Brexit budgets for 8 October with the cabinet opting to go ahead with the no-deal proposal on Wednesday, which they hope will mitigate against a predicted recession in rural Ireland, job losses and lower tax takes in the event of an expected slowdown in GDP growth. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council said a large budget deficit could emerge with the tax take down and spending increased to cushion the blow to agriculture, tourism and other industries. \u201cThe international economic outlook has deteriorated in recent months. While the situation is volatile and evolving, the risks of a hard Brexit are high,\u201d it said in its pre-budget submission on Wednesday. At Dublin Castle, the agriculture minister, Michael Creed, conceded that the all-island agri-food sector could be in serious trouble if the UK crashes out. \u201cI do accept that that\u2019s in some jeopardy now and obviously we are in negotiations with the [European] commission on what alternative arrangements can be put in place should the withdrawal agreement fall,\u201d he said. He declined to give any detail on what these arrangements would be, an omission that is causing increasing anxiety among farmers and food producers in the border regions. With 30% of all Northern Irish milk taken across the border for cheese and butter production and 400,000 sheep a year going south to abattoirs in the republic, farmers are deeply concerned. \u201cAll in all, no deal will be a total disaster and a percentage of farmers would be out of business,\u201d said Ivor Ferguson, president of the Ulster Farmers Union, who was also in Dublin Castle to try and buttonhole officials and ministers. There was a palpable sense of frustration about being kept in the dark about border checks as delegates mingled over a coffee break. \u201cThey just wouldn\u2019t answer the questions. The department officials on stage said that\u2019s a political question when asked about border checks, so it needs a political answer,\u201d said Eamonn Wall, plants manager at the Arboretum horticulture centre in Leighlinbridge in County Carlow. \u201cHow can you plan around that? It\u2019s like trying to organise a wedding without knowing who the bride and groom are,\u201d he said. Last week Varadkar confirmed for the first time that there would be checks on goods coming across the Northern Ireland border. \u201cSome may need to take place near the border\u201d rather than on the border but most would be in ports, airports and at businesses. That is of little comfort to agri-food businesses facing mandatory sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks. One poultry business told the Guardian they have been told that \u201cnear the border\u201d is actually 100 miles away at Dublin Port, the only place with a Brexit-ready border inspection post. Manor Farm in County Cavan, which slaughters 1m chickens a week, employs more than 800 people and relies on 160 farmers, faces major disruption and additional costs if this is the case, one of its executives revealed as they took stock of what little information they garnered at the Department of Agriculture seminar. They import day-old chicks from across the border in Dungannon and six weeks out they still don\u2019t know if they will have to make the 200-mile trip to Dublin just to keep their business running. \u201cBrexit is taking up a lot of our time \u2013 70% to 80% of my job in March was preparing for Brexit and we\u2019re back here again and you can\u2019t fathom what is going to happen. It changes by the hour,\u201d said Frances O\u2019Reilly who works in finance. Trade to and from the UK is a vital part of Ireland\u2019s economy with \u20ac16bn (\u00a314.3bn) worth of exports to the UK in 2018 including around 50% of its beef and almost half its cheddar cheese. The EU has already given Ireland permission to open the coffers to help businesses cushion themselves \u2013 and Irish businesses are demanding \u00a31bn to mitigate the Brexit shock. Representatives of the French government were also at Dublin Castle to explain the special corridor they have set up for Irish freight using the UK as a landbridge to the continent. They have built a new smart-border customs system in Calais which will allow officials to distinguish between trucks carrying Irish and British cargo. Scans of documents will be taken while the truck is passing through the Eurotunnel or on the ferry allowing them to be waved through in Calais as an \u201cEU member state\u201d truck not requiring SPS checks. But Padraic O\u2019Leary, the managing director of Walsh Mushrooms which exports 200 tonnes of mushrooms a week to UK supermarkets and the food industry, says Brexit has already been \u201ca disaster for the mushroom industry\u201d. Will the plastic punnets the mushrooms are placed in by the pickers incur tariffs? And what about the wooden pallets they are delivered on? Under EU law the pallets returning from the EU and entering Ireland will have to be heat-treated or fumigated for bugs and disease. But there is a shortage in the UK and the government has not been stockpiling them, Michael Gove revealed last week. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what comes down the track in terms of paperwork, what we can\u2019t deal with is the collapse in sterling,\u201d says O\u2019Leary. \u201cNobody is making money selling to the UK.

In this brave and unflinching documentary, Nelson explores how these \u201cjokes\u201d and taunts that labelled her as \u201cthe fat one from Little Mix\u201d led to serious struggles with her mental health. A must-watch that exposes the double standards of fame. Ammar Kalia Hairy Bikers: Route 66 8pm, BBC Two The hirsute chefs Simon King and Dave Myers are back on their bikes and as unshaven as ever, this time taking on that most iconic of American highways for their new gastronomic tour. First stop is the Windy City, Chicago, for a slab of BBQ, a soggy sandwich and a gut-busting \u201cconcrete custard\u201d. A homely take on some mammoth cuisine. AK Paul O\u2019Grady\u2019s Little Heroes 8.30pm, ITV Before he donned leopard print as Lily Savage and became the saviour of rescue dogs, Paul O\u2019Grady used to be a children\u2019s care worker. In the years since, he has clearly not lost the knack for putting at ease kids facing tough situations as he makes a heartwarming return to Great Ormond Street hospital, mucking in \u2013 and mucking about \u2013 on the wards. Graeme Virtue This Way Up 10pm, Channel 4 Aisling Bea\u2019s delicate and insightful comedy about a young woman recovering from a mental health crisis ends, with the urge to reach into the screen and hug Bea\u2019s alter ego Aine stronger than ever. It has been an engaging watch and is all set up for season two: a show as brave and deft as this surely has to return. Jack Seale Brassic 10pm, Sky One Joe Gilgun\u2019s Shameless successor is still joyriding through rural Lancashire at a breakneck pace. This week\u2019s wild ride involves a raid on a rival weed grower\u2019s farm and an encounter with Erin\u2019s on-the-run brother Ronnie.

AK Film choice The Ladykillers (Alexander Mackendrick, 1955), 5pm, Film4 This last of the Ealing comedies from Alexander Mackendrick is a very dark specimen.

The US central bank \u2013 the Federal Reserve \u2013 is coming under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/21/trump-raises-pressure-on-federal-reserve-to-cut-interest-rates\" title=\"\">huge pressure</a> from Donald Trump to cut interest rates and restart QE. The poor state of the German economy and the threat of deflation means that on Thursday the ECB will <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2019/09/11/why-banks-are-going-to-suffer-with-the-upcoming-ecb-decision/#359036b46534\" title=\"\">cut the already negative interest rate</a> for bank deposits and announce the resumption of its QE programme.</p> <p>But central banks are almost out of ammo. If cutting interest rates to zero or just above was insufficient to bring about the sort of sustained recovery seen after previous recessions, then it is not obvious why a couple of quarter-point cuts will make much difference now. Likewise, expecting a bit more QE to do anything other than give a fillip to shares on Wall Street and the City is the triumph of hope over experience.</p> <p>There were alternatives to the response to the 2008 crisis. Governments could have changed the mix, placing more emphasis on fiscal measures \u2013 tax cuts and spending increases \u2013 than on monetary stimulus, and then seeking to make the two arms of policy work together. They could have taken advantage of low interest rates to borrow more for the public spending programmes that would have created jobs and demand in their economies. Finance ministries could have ensured that QE contributed to the long-term good of the economy \u2013 the environment, for example \u2013 if they had issued bonds and instructed central banks to buy them.</p> <p>This sort of approach does, though, involve breaking one of the big taboos of the modern age: the belief that monetary and fiscal policy should be kept separate and that central banks should be allowed to operate free from political interference.</p> <p>The consensus blossomed during the good times of the late 1990s and early 2000s, and survived the financial crisis of 2008 . But challenges from both the left and right, especially in the US, suggest that it won\u2019t survive the next one. Trump says the Fed has damaged the economy by pushing up interest rates too quickly. Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/23/Here-s-What-Bernie-Sanders-Would-Do-Fed\" title=\"\">says</a> the US central bank has been captured by Wall Street. Both arguments are correct. It is a good thing that central bank independence is finally coming under scrutiny.</p> <p>For a start, it has become clear that the notion of depoliticised central bankers is a myth. When he was governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King lectured the government about the need for austerity while jealously guarding the right to set interest rates free from any political interference. Likewise, rarely does Mario Draghi, the outgoing president of the ECB, hold a press conference without urging eurozone countries to reduce budget deficits and embrace structural reform.</p> <p>Central bankers have views and \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly \u2013 they tend to be quite conservative ones. As the US economist <a href=\"https://thomaspalley.com/\" title=\"\">Thomas Palley</a> notes in a recent paper, central bank independence is a product of the neoliberal Chicago school of economics and aims to advance neoliberal interests. More specifically, workers like high employment because in those circumstances it is easier to bid up pay. Employers prefer higher unemployment because it keeps wages down and profits up. Central banks side with capital over labour because they accept the neoliberal idea that there is a point \u2013 the natural rate of unemployment \u2013 beyond which stimulating the economy merely leads to higher inflation. They are, Palley says, institutions \u201cfavoured by capital to guard against the danger that a democracy may choose economic policies capital dislikes\u201d.</p> <p>Until now, monetary policy has been deemed too important to be left to politicians. When the next crisis arrives it will become too political an issue to be left to unelected technocrats. If that crisis is to be tackled effectively, the age of independent central banks will have to come to an end.</p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor</p>",

If cutting interest rates to zero or just above was insufficient to bring about the sort of sustained recovery seen after previous recessions, then it is not obvious why a couple of quarter-point cuts will make much difference now. Likewise, expecting a bit more QE to do anything other than give a fillip to shares on Wall Street and the City is the triumph of hope over experience. There were alternatives to the response to the 2008 crisis. Governments could have changed the mix, placing more emphasis on fiscal measures \u2013 tax cuts and spending increases \u2013 than on monetary stimulus, and then seeking to make the two arms of policy work together. They could have taken advantage of low interest rates to borrow more for the public spending programmes that would have created jobs and demand in their economies. Finance ministries could have ensured that QE contributed to the long-term good of the economy \u2013 the environment, for example \u2013 if they had issued bonds and instructed central banks to buy them. This sort of approach does, though, involve breaking one of the big taboos of the modern age: the belief that monetary and fiscal policy should be kept separate and that central banks should be allowed to operate free from political interference. The consensus blossomed during the good times of the late 1990s and early 2000s, and survived the financial crisis of 2008 . But challenges from both the left and right, especially in the US, suggest that it won\u2019t survive the next one. Trump says the Fed has damaged the economy by pushing up interest rates too quickly. Bernie Sanders says the US central bank has been captured by Wall Street. Both arguments are correct. It is a good thing that central bank independence is finally coming under scrutiny. For a start, it has become clear that the notion of depoliticised central bankers is a myth. When he was governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King lectured the government about the need for austerity while jealously guarding the right to set interest rates free from any political interference. Likewise, rarely does Mario Draghi, the outgoing president of the ECB, hold a press conference without urging eurozone countries to reduce budget deficits and embrace structural reform. Central bankers have views and \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly \u2013 they tend to be quite conservative ones. As the US economist Thomas Palley notes in a recent paper, central bank independence is a product of the neoliberal Chicago school of economics and aims to advance neoliberal interests. More specifically, workers like high employment because in those circumstances it is easier to bid up pay. Employers prefer higher unemployment because it keeps wages down and profits up. Central banks side with capital over labour because they accept the neoliberal idea that there is a point \u2013 the natural rate of unemployment \u2013 beyond which stimulating the economy merely leads to higher inflation. They are, Palley says, institutions \u201cfavoured by capital to guard against the danger that a democracy may choose economic policies capital dislikes\u201d. Until now, monetary policy has been deemed too important to be left to politicians. When the next crisis arrives it will become too political an issue to be left to unelected technocrats. If that crisis is to be tackled effectively, the age of independent central banks will have to come to an end. \u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor",

      "body": "<p>One day, when she was a teenager, Casey Legler woke up with a hangover, then jumped into a pool and broke the Olympic freestyle swimming record. The year was 1996 and Legler was in Atlanta, a member of the French team, having a practice session as she awaited the Olympic finals the next day. Legler, at 6ft 2in, was built to swim. She had been groomed to be an Olympian from the age of 12. But when the finals came \u2013 the biggest day of her professional life \u2013 she bombed, coming 29th in the women\u2019s 50m freestyle.

The other is that she has Asperger\u2019s \u2013 she was diagnosed the day after she finished her book. To mitigate against sensory overload she might experience because of it, I have brought my dog to the interview. So, with a staffordshire bull terrier curled up against her on the banquette, she calmly shatters any illusions the public may have about what it is like to be a child sporting prodigy, especially if you are a girl.</p> <p>She is, she says, surprised she is not dead. \u201cI do know a couple of people who stopped drinking and taking drugs in their 20s and went on to have beautiful families,\u201d she says, \u201cbut, for an athlete, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the norm; that\u2019s the exception. But I can only speak to what it was like for me.</p> <p>\u201cWorking hard and drinking hard is just how we did it. Some of them were able to stop because they got to university and quit swimming, and some of them did not. Some of them died and some of them continue to struggle with drugs and alcohol.\u201d</p> <p>Legler was one of five children born to American parents. When she was a small child, the family lived in St Maxime, Cote D\u2019Azur, then spent two years in Louisiana, before returning to France when Legler was 12. Her mother gave up working as an artist after having children. \u201cMom spent her time crying,\u201d Legler writes, somewhat ambiguously. \u201cWe knew to pretend it wasn\u2019t happening.\u201d</p> <p>Her father, a professional basketball player who became an architect, she describes as \u201ca gorgeous, handsome, very smart, highly problematic patriarch. I was raised in a very patriarchal household where young girls were second class. It was very complicated for them to have such a high-functioning young person as a daughter. I was on the spectrum. I was a really complicated person.\u201d</p> <p>When she moved back to France, her mother took her to meet a swimming coach in Aix-en-Provence. There is an uncomfortable passage in her book describing this decisive encounter: \u201cI see him understand that he\u2019s hit the genetic jackpot with me. I am very skinny, and at 12, I am already just shy of 6ft tall \u2013 I am currency.\u201d</p> <p>The coach took her on and within two years she was taking part in international swimming meets around Europe, away from her parents but also unsupervised. Already her understanding of adults \u201cwas that they couldn\u2019t give two fucks about kids, and the only time they cared was when it impacted them\u201d. It is an attitude she came to see everywhere in her new life as a swimming prodigy. \u201cWhere were the adults? And if they were near, terrible things happened. In my book, I just wanted to lay into the normality of it. Hannah Arendt talks about the banality of evil. Not all the adults around us were perpetrators, but all of them looked the other way.\u201d</p> <p>The book spans her entire swimming career. \u201cBetween the ages of 12 and 20 \u2013 that\u2019s very young, right? To have the discipline I had to develop, to have the responsibilities I had,\u201d she says. \u201cBy the time you were 14, you were a professional athlete, you were put into a swimming programme of some sort. I took a correspondence course for my last years of high school. The only time you were around adults was at practice. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"17754eaecfa19afa4ab1f48101baab2cd1e82b77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17754eaecfa19afa4ab1f48101baab2cd1e82b77/0_60_2097_2619/801.jpg\" alt=\"Legler at the Michael Bastian show at New York fashion week, 2013.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Legler at the Michael Bastian show at New York fashion week, 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Startraks Photo/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She has calculated that her training and competing regime meant she spent three and a half years in the water. Incredibly, during this time she did not enjoy swimming. The team was often on the road, away from parents or living in boarding facilities at France\u2019s elite training institutes.</p> <p>\u201cI was one of 20 other girl swimmers at the hands of one coach. A one-to-20 ratio is not a good one,\u201d she says. By the time she was 14, she says, when not in the pool \u201cwe were just left alone. I could do whatever I wanted. So, on training trips, there was this juxtaposition between being given absolute freedom to do what I liked by the adults who were meant to be taking care of me and the absolute control these same adults had of my body; from when I got up to what I ate, how I trained, when I practised.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t unusual for this control to tip into abuse. When she was 13, she was sexually assaulted by a physiotherapist during a treatment. She likens what he did to what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/26/larry-nassar-abuse-gymnasts-scandal-culture\" title=\"\">Larry Nassar</a>, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor, was last year convicted of doing to hundreds of girls in his charge. \u201cIt was the same procedure: \u2018Are you sure? Are you OK with this?\u2019 It\u2019s so classic. I think that\u2019s the thing we have to understand. These are not accidents. These are routine.\u201d</p> <p>Yet this was not the only abuse she faced. \u201cIt\u2019s very common to be raped by someone you know,\u201d she says. She was still a virgin when two men raped her on a messy night out. Yet despite the scrutiny of her body, she says, physical signs of the assault were ignored by those around her. \u201cI walked on to the pool deck after being raped, with bruises on the inside of my thighs.\u201d</p> <p>It was the same attitude when anyone was injured, she says.<strong> </strong>\u201cWe would show up in the training room with injuries: tendonitis in the shoulders \u2013 cortisone shots. \u2018In you go.\u2019 Ice patch, ice bath. \u2018Get back in the water.\u2019 It was a continual Band-Aid.\u201d</p> <p>Then there was the time a doctor handed her a bag of unlabelled powder: \u201cThe next day \u2013 I\u2019d never swum so fast in my life.\u201d<strong> </strong>She puts what she calls \u201cthe normalisation of neglect\u201d down to the fact that<strong> </strong>\u201cthe cost of looking would have required a person of great character, which simply ... they were not around\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, she was left to deal with \u201cthis incessant violence, the incessant darkness that launched into my world over and over and over again\u201d in any way she could, whether that be \u201cirreverence, drugs and alcohol, breaking rules\u201d. And all around her, she saw peers doing the same. \u201cWe knew this was happening to everyone.\u201d </p> <p>Legler\u2019s hard drinking began at 15. She says her fast teenage metabolism allowed her to be both an alcoholic and an Olympic-level athlete. And she says the numbing effects of both swimming and alcohol, as toxic as they were to her, \u201csaved my life\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbf17d640246c9ab1e663b47d5da4596f8b200e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbf17d640246c9ab1e663b47d5da4596f8b200e4/0_156_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With her partner Siri Olsen, 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her partner Siri Olsen, 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick McMullan/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She was also smoking cannabis (something she tested positive for twice, resulting in just two therapy sessions). And alongside all this drinking and drugs was a kind of hooliganism. In the book, she describes an initiation ceremony among the young swimming team: \u201cWe make all the freshmen drink 100 shots of vodka that night for hazing and all the girls shave their vaginas and with their mouths pick cherries hanging off the dicks of the freshman guys. The vodka winner has a bucket next to her to throw up in as she keeps drinking shot after shot after shot.\u201d</p> <p>The French swim team, she says, \u201cwere quite proud of the reputation that we had as being the ones that partied the hardest\u201d at international meets \u2013 whether it was the Olympics or the European championships.</p> <p>\u201cI think that pride came from a place of absolute irreverence and disdain for the institution that we were representing. We took power back where we could and in typical adolescent fashion, by breaking all of the rules given to us by, in most cases, adults who we didn\u2019t respect at all because we knew what they were doing behind closed doors.</p> <p>\u201cGrowing up with them, you know the swimmers that are insane partiers and that was very much the reputation I had by the time the French team got to the Olympics. It was no accident people asked me to score drugs.\u201d</p> <p>In 1996, Legler showed up at the Olympics with a shaved head. If anyone had bothered to ask her about it, they would have discovered it was a protest against the expectations that she felt the girls in the team faced. \u201cThe coaches wanted the girls to be beautiful and thin,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the 90s, you had heroin chic coupled with the French ideas about fashion and beauty.\u201d Many of the girls, Legler says, including herself, had eating disorders.</p> <p>After Atlanta, Legler went off the rails altogether. \u201cMy life became darker as I got to 19 and 20 and I got more involved with gangs and drug dealing. That teenage irreverence and spikiness turned into total intimidation, with me using my height and my body to keep myself safe and, in other instances, to make other people afraid,\u201d she writes.</p> <p>\u201cI became more and more violent the more I drank. In the end, that was a known fact about me that I was very, very in touch with \u2013 how to wield cruelty or fear. I was a dangerous person.\u201d</p> <p>On 23 April 1998, three days before her 21st birthday, she went to rehab for the second time. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been clean ever since. Knock on wood. I never used again. And I stopped swimming the year after. Even in that year, I felt like I was tearing my skin off. Everything came out \u2013 the cutting came back, the eating disorder. That first year was very painful. Then I got my first job bagging groceries in a supermarket. On a good day it was humbling, but on a bad day it was deeply humiliating because I hadn\u2019t understood how I had gotten there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6066dd3d65d22ece25787de70a7b1c504cf54185\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6066dd3d65d22ece25787de70a7b1c504cf54185/0_326_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At Paris fashion week spring summer 2014 with Tilda Swinton and Karl Lagerfeld.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At Paris fashion week spring summer 2014 with Tilda Swinton and Karl Lagerfeld.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WENN Rights Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For years, she says, she could not talk about her life as an athlete. \u201cI had such a specific experience of torment and failure and in my heart, deep shame. It took many years afterwards to even tell anyone that I had been at the Olympics, and that I had broken the record the day before, then totally bombed and the day after had organised myself to deal drugs to my fellow athletes. It was so much not the story people wanted to hear.\u201d</p> <p>She began to re-evaluate her experiences after the therapist she was seeing told her: \u201c\u2018You are walking around as an adult with rancour and fear in your heart. You can do something about that. With it you will help ease the misery of others.\u2019 And it\u2019s like a super power.\u201d</p> <p>Now she wants her book to be a comfort to children and adults who have shared similar experiences. The paedophile physiotherapist is dead, so she won\u2019t be taking him to court, but she can influence whether other girls and women will be molested like she was. The good news, she says, \u201cis that people are on to it. The bad news is that that means bad things are still happening to young people.\u201d</p> <p>Alongside making sure girls are not left alone, as she was, with male doctors and coaches, she thinks the age that young athletes turn professional should be raised.<strong> </strong>\u201cAs an adolescent athlete, I was not showing any of the normal signs of someone who doesn\u2019t enjoy something. I was still swimming extraordinarily fast, I was still very much performing well at school \u2013 the best in my class. But just because someone is at the top of their game does not indicate they are happy.</p> <p>\u201cI want us to be talking more about what it might mean to be a young girl, to be very, very good at what you\u2019re doing and to come up within the system which is the patriarchy. At its mildest, it considers you disposable, in a way that it certainly doesn\u2019t consider young men and boys.\u201d</p> <p>She is optimistic things can change. \u201cWe can start talking about this in a way that is constructive and takes care of our young and they can have long, happy careers.\u201d</p> <p>Legler has started swimming again and, along with her advocacy work, including with the UN (she is moderating a panel about women\u2019s equality and empowerment next week), modelling and work as an artist, she has spent the past decade mentoring formerly incarcerated children. \u201cOne of them asked me: \u2018Is it hard being soft?\u2019 And I was able to tell her it was the best thing that had happened to me.\u201d </p> <p><em>Godspeed by Casey Legler is published by Scribe (\u00a314.99).

Her mother gave up working as an artist after having children. \u201cMom spent her time crying,\u201d Legler writes, somewhat ambiguously. \u201cWe knew to pretend it wasn\u2019t happening.\u201d Her father, a professional basketball player who became an architect, she describes as \u201ca gorgeous, handsome, very smart, highly problematic patriarch. I was raised in a very patriarchal household where young girls were second class. It was very complicated for them to have such a high-functioning young person as a daughter. I was on the spectrum. I was a really complicated person.\u201d When she moved back to France, her mother took her to meet a swimming coach in Aix-en-Provence. There is an uncomfortable passage in her book describing this decisive encounter: \u201cI see him understand that he\u2019s hit the genetic jackpot with me. I am very skinny, and at 12, I am already just shy of 6ft tall \u2013 I am currency.\u201d The coach took her on and within two years she was taking part in international swimming meets around Europe, away from her parents but also unsupervised. Already her understanding of adults \u201cwas that they couldn\u2019t give two fucks about kids, and the only time they cared was when it impacted them\u201d. It is an attitude she came to see everywhere in her new life as a swimming prodigy. \u201cWhere were the adults? And if they were near, terrible things happened. In my book, I just wanted to lay into the normality of it. Hannah Arendt talks about the banality of evil. Not all the adults around us were perpetrators, but all of them looked the other way.\u201d The book spans her entire swimming career. \u201cBetween the ages of 12 and 20 \u2013 that\u2019s very young, right? To have the discipline I had to develop, to have the responsibilities I had,\u201d she says. \u201cBy the time you were 14, you were a professional athlete, you were put into a swimming programme of some sort. I took a correspondence course for my last years of high school. The only time you were around adults was at practice. That\u2019s it.\u201d She has calculated that her training and competing regime meant she spent three and a half years in the water. Incredibly, during this time she did not enjoy swimming. The team was often on the road, away from parents or living in boarding facilities at France\u2019s elite training institutes. \u201cI was one of 20 other girl swimmers at the hands of one coach. A one-to-20 ratio is not a good one,\u201d she says. By the time she was 14, she says, when not in the pool \u201cwe were just left alone. I could do whatever I wanted. So, on training trips, there was this juxtaposition between being given absolute freedom to do what I liked by the adults who were meant to be taking care of me and the absolute control these same adults had of my body; from when I got up to what I ate, how I trained, when I practised.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unusual for this control to tip into abuse. When she was 13, she was sexually assaulted by a physiotherapist during a treatment. She likens what he did to what Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor, was last year convicted of doing to hundreds of girls in his charge. \u201cIt was the same procedure: \u2018Are you sure? Are you OK with this?\u2019 It\u2019s so classic. I think that\u2019s the thing we have to understand. These are not accidents. These are routine.\u201d Yet this was not the only abuse she faced. \u201cIt\u2019s very common to be raped by someone you know,\u201d she says. She was still a virgin when two men raped her on a messy night out. Yet despite the scrutiny of her body, she says, physical signs of the assault were ignored by those around her. \u201cI walked on to the pool deck after being raped, with bruises on the inside of my thighs.\u201d It was the same attitude when anyone was injured, she says. \u201cWe would show up in the training room with injuries: tendonitis in the shoulders \u2013 cortisone shots. \u2018In you go.\u2019 Ice patch, ice bath. \u2018Get back in the water.\u2019 It was a continual Band-Aid.\u201d Then there was the time a doctor handed her a bag of unlabelled powder: \u201cThe next day \u2013 I\u2019d never swum so fast in my life.\u201d She puts what she calls \u201cthe normalisation of neglect\u201d down to the fact that \u201cthe cost of looking would have required a person of great character, which simply ... they were not around\u201d. Instead, she was left to deal with \u201cthis incessant violence, the incessant darkness that launched into my world over and over and over again\u201d in any way she could, whether that be \u201cirreverence, drugs and alcohol, breaking rules\u201d. And all around her, she saw peers doing the same. \u201cWe knew this was happening to everyone.\u201d Legler\u2019s hard drinking began at 15. She says her fast teenage metabolism allowed her to be both an alcoholic and an Olympic-level athlete. And she says the numbing effects of both swimming and alcohol, as toxic as they were to her, \u201csaved my life\u201d. She was also smoking cannabis (something she tested positive for twice, resulting in just two therapy sessions). And alongside all this drinking and drugs was a kind of hooliganism. In the book, she describes an initiation ceremony among the young swimming team: \u201cWe make all the freshmen drink 100 shots of vodka that night for hazing and all the girls shave their vaginas and with their mouths pick cherries hanging off the dicks of the freshman guys. The vodka winner has a bucket next to her to throw up in as she keeps drinking shot after shot after shot.\u201d The French swim team, she says, \u201cwere quite proud of the reputation that we had as being the ones that partied the hardest\u201d at international meets \u2013 whether it was the Olympics or the European championships. \u201cI think that pride came from a place of absolute irreverence and disdain for the institution that we were representing. We took power back where we could and in typical adolescent fashion, by breaking all of the rules given to us by, in most cases, adults who we didn\u2019t respect at all because we knew what they were doing behind closed doors. \u201cGrowing up with them, you know the swimmers that are insane partiers and that was very much the reputation I had by the time the French team got to the Olympics. It was no accident people asked me to score drugs.\u201d In 1996, Legler showed up at the Olympics with a shaved head. If anyone had bothered to ask her about it, they would have discovered it was a protest against the expectations that she felt the girls in the team faced. \u201cThe coaches wanted the girls to be beautiful and thin,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the 90s, you had heroin chic coupled with the French ideas about fashion and beauty.\u201d Many of the girls, Legler says, including herself, had eating disorders. After Atlanta, Legler went off the rails altogether. \u201cMy life became darker as I got to 19 and 20 and I got more involved with gangs and drug dealing. That teenage irreverence and spikiness turned into total intimidation, with me using my height and my body to keep myself safe and, in other instances, to make other people afraid,\u201d she writes. \u201cI became more and more violent the more I drank. In the end, that was a known fact about me that I was very, very in touch with \u2013 how to wield cruelty or fear. I was a dangerous person.\u201d On 23 April 1998, three days before her 21st birthday, she went to rehab for the second time. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been clean ever since. Knock on wood. I never used again. And I stopped swimming the year after. Even in that year, I felt like I was tearing my skin off. Everything came out \u2013 the cutting came back, the eating disorder. That first year was very painful. Then I got my first job bagging groceries in a supermarket. On a good day it was humbling, but on a bad day it was deeply humiliating because I hadn\u2019t understood how I had gotten there.\u201d For years, she says, she could not talk about her life as an athlete. \u201cI had such a specific experience of torment and failure and in my heart, deep shame. It took many years afterwards to even tell anyone that I had been at the Olympics, and that I had broken the record the day before, then totally bombed and the day after had organised myself to deal drugs to my fellow athletes. It was so much not the story people wanted to hear.\u201d She began to re-evaluate her experiences after the therapist she was seeing told her: \u201c\u2018You are walking around as an adult with rancour and fear in your heart. You can do something about that. With it you will help ease the misery of others.\u2019 And it\u2019s like a super power.\u201d Now she wants her book to be a comfort to children and adults who have shared similar experiences. The paedophile physiotherapist is dead, so she won\u2019t be taking him to court, but she can influence whether other girls and women will be molested like she was. The good news, she says, \u201cis that people are on to it. The bad news is that that means bad things are still happening to young people.\u201d Alongside making sure girls are not left alone, as she was, with male doctors and coaches, she thinks the age that young athletes turn professional should be raised. \u201cAs an adolescent athlete, I was not showing any of the normal signs of someone who doesn\u2019t enjoy something. I was still swimming extraordinarily fast, I was still very much performing well at school \u2013 the best in my class. But just because someone is at the top of their game does not indicate they are happy. \u201cI want us to be talking more about what it might mean to be a young girl, to be very, very good at what you\u2019re doing and to come up within the system which is the patriarchy. At its mildest, it considers you disposable, in a way that it certainly doesn\u2019t consider young men and boys.\u201d She is optimistic things can change. \u201cWe can start talking about this in a way that is constructive and takes care of our young and they can have long, happy careers.\u201d Legler has started swimming again and, along with her advocacy work, including with the UN (she is moderating a panel about women\u2019s equality and empowerment next week), modelling and work as an artist, she has spent the past decade mentoring formerly incarcerated children. \u201cOne of them asked me: \u2018Is it hard being soft?\u2019 And I was able to tell her it was the best thing that had happened to me.\u201d Godspeed by Casey Legler is published by Scribe (\u00a314.99).

Does the sight of tanked-up thugs chanting your name in central London not give you pause for thought? A far-right street movement is real, serious and determined, and our rulers cannot dismiss it as irrelevant. Already, individuals with public platforms who hold unapologetic progressive opinions know that to express them is to put themselves and their loved ones at risk.</p> <p>The danger is that recent events foreshadow something much uglier. In the last election, Labour members were demonised as terrorist supporters and Britain-haters \u2013 tropes embraced by the far right. This time, the boots on the street are stronger, the political context more vicious and defined by increasingly irreconcilable divisions. In such a setting, what will an even uglier campaign waged by the Tories and their media outriders mean? Even before Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s team was <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-09-02/yellow-vest-protester-goddard-arrested-after-blocking-jeremy-corbyn-car/\" title=\"\">surrounded by far-right activists</a> \u2013 yelling \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201cWe love you, Boris, we do\u201d \u2013 in Salford last week, members of his operation fretted about the rising security threat.</p> <p>To be blunt, it is likely that more people will be hurt.

The far right can only ever be defeated by a non-violent protest movement \u2013 but their enablers must be confronted, too.</p> <p>To repeat for the benefit of our prime minister: a thuggish far right is real and dangerous, they treat you as their pin-up and they are emboldened by your rhetoric.

A far-right street movement is real, serious and determined, and our rulers cannot dismiss it as irrelevant. Already, individuals with public platforms who hold unapologetic progressive opinions know that to express them is to put themselves and their loved ones at risk. The danger is that recent events foreshadow something much uglier. In the last election, Labour members were demonised as terrorist supporters and Britain-haters \u2013 tropes embraced by the far right. This time, the boots on the street are stronger, the political context more vicious and defined by increasingly irreconcilable divisions. In such a setting, what will an even uglier campaign waged by the Tories and their media outriders mean? Even before Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s team was surrounded by far-right activists \u2013 yelling \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201cWe love you, Boris, we do\u201d \u2013 in Salford last week, members of his operation fretted about the rising security threat. To be blunt, it is likely that more people will be hurt. When that happens, we can expect Donald Trump-style talk of \u201cboth sides\u201d \u2013 and \u201cwhat about the left and their own inflammatory rhetoric?\u201d Toxic attempts to muddy the waters are belied by the facts: leftists have not sought to hurt, let alone kill, Conservative activists or MPs, while a global far-right movement has slaughtered socialists, Muslims, black people and Jews, from Norway to Yorkshire. The far right can only ever be defeated by a non-violent protest movement \u2013 but their enablers must be confronted, too. To repeat for the benefit of our prime minister: a thuggish far right is real and dangerous, they treat you as their pin-up and they are emboldened by your rhetoric. You will be held accountable for whatever they do from here on in. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

Seven new \u201cdata hubs\u201d are set to revolutionise medical research by giving doctors, scientists and academics access to unprecedented data about who gets ill in the first place and who responds best to treatment. However, the move is likely to raise anxiety about possible breaches of patients\u2019 privacy and also the commercialisation of patient records because drug companies are among those with whom the data will be shared.

There are just three flour mills on the island of Ireland and the only two that can supply industrial quantities are in Northern Ireland. \u201cWe have two mills in Belfast and 60% of their output goes into the Republic of Ireland. Ireland doesn\u2019t have any bulk commercial mill at all and imports the rest of its flour from the UK,\u201d said Michael Bell, the executive director of Northern Ireland\u2019s Food and Drink Association. Under a no-deal Brexit, flour would be subject to a tariff of \u20ac172 a tonne, which could add around 15 cents to the price of a humble sliced loaf. \u201cWe are not talking about there being no bread on the shelves, but that it is just going to be more expensive and depending on your income that will be more or less significant,\u201d said Alex Waugh, the director general of the National Association of British and Irish Millers (Nabim). In a no-deal scenario, EU tariffs will be applicable on a range of food items coming into Ireland from the UK. The tariffs on flour will hit bread, biscuits, cakes, confectionary and commercially produced frozen pizza assembled in factories outside Dublin but destined for the massive UK market. For Irish bakers, the choices are to absorb the cost, pass it on to the consumer or source flour in France, Germany or Lithuania. \u201cCan you source the flour in France? No,\u201d said Bell. \u201cTheir mill structure is different and their flour has a different protein content which is good for baguettes but not for high-rise bread.\u201d Bakers have looked at getting flour further afield, in Germany or Lithuania, said Waugh but the cost of getting it back to Ireland added significant overheads and logistical challenges. Currently, Ireland imports about 150-170 28-tonne tankers of flour a week from UK, with one third from Northern Ireland and two-thirds from Britain. Bakers south of the border are looking at stockpiling flour but that is not considered a sustainable solution. \u201cIt is the thing that people often forget in this debate, that tariffs are a tax and they are a tax on consumers because there just isn\u2019t sufficient margin in the supply chain to fully absorb so the costs will be passed on,\u201d says Paul Kelly, director of the Food and Drink Industry Ireland. He sees a no-deal Brexit as a disastrous misapplication of tariffs, which are designed as a tool to protect European farmers and food production for social reasons. \u201cThe social contract operating here is that farmers have a high cost base because of the high cost of living in the EU, high standards of regulation and safety that they have to adhere to,\u201d he says.

      "bodyText": "The Australian couple being held in Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin prison have been named as Jolie King and Mark Firkin, who were reportedly arrested 10 weeks ago near the Iranian capital. Firkin and King, who also holds a British passport, have been blogging a globe-trotting adventure since 2017 as they endeavoured to drive from Australia to London. Despite diplomatic efforts to keep their cases from public attention, the pair was named overnight on social media. Unrelated to the couple\u2019s case, a third Australian is also being held in Evin prison, reportedly in solitary confinement. The Cambridge-educated academic had been lecturing at an Australian university before she was arrested last year. She has reportedly been tried \u2013 the charges are unknown \u2013 and sentenced to 10 years in jail. The Australian government has been negotiating for the release of all three Australians since their arrests, news of which became public on Wednesday. The Guardian understands both Firkin and Jolie were travelling on Australian passports. The families of Firkin and King released a statement saying: \u201cOur families hope to see Mark and Jolie safely home as soon as possible.\u201d They said they would not be commenting further and asked for privacy. The editor of the Persian-language broadcaster Manoto TV, Pouria Zeraati, said on Twitter a source had told him the couple had been arrested \u201cfor flying a drone near the capital, Tehran\u201d. Earlier reports suggested the couple had been camping in a military area around Jajrood in Tehran province. The couple were blogging their travels on YouTube and Instagram. Dozens of videos and photographs posted online appear to have been shot using a drone. \u201cThe family says this was a misunderstanding and Jolie King and her fiance Mark Firkin were unaware of the Iranian law which bans drone flights without a licence,\u201d Zeraati said online. \u201cTheir trial has not been held yet and it is not clear what the Islamic Republic [of Iran] wants out of this arrest, as no one from the judiciary or intelligence services has made any comment on this.\u201d King, a building designer, and Firkin, a construction manager, have been documenting their travels on a blog called The Way Overland. On a plan listed on their blog, the couple said their plan was to drive from their home in the Perth suburb of Cottlesloe to London in a Toyota Landcruiser they converted into a mobile home. King and Firkin started by driving north to Darwin, where they shipped their car to Timor-Leste. The pair then drove through Indonesia, shipped the car to Malaysia and drove up through south-east Asia, India and Pakistan. The couple posted a video roughly once a week to YouTube and social media, and people following their journey raised concerns when there was silence from the pair. Their last post on social media was from the Naryn region of Kyrgyzstan on 26 June. Their last video was from Pakistan, posted on 25 June, showing the pair driving the Karakoram Highway. Their final activity on social media appears to have been on Sunday 30 June. Followers and friends began posting increasingly alarmed comments after their accounts fell silent, asking if they were safe. On social media, Firkin has said he is from Coffs Harbour in New South Wales, and the couple moved to Perth from 2015. There is little information publicly known about the third Australian being held in Evin. Also a British-Australian, the Cambridge-educated academic had been teaching at a university in Melbourne. She was arrested in Iran late last year. The Guardian understands the woman has been tried \u2013 on unknown charges \u2013 and jailed for 10 years. She is reportedly being held in solitary confinement. A spokesperson for Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed the department was providing consular assistance to the families of three Australians detained in Iran. The Australian government\u2019s travel advice for Iran warns: \u201cThere is a risk that foreigners, including Australians, could be arbitrarily detained or arrested in Iran. We can\u2019t guarantee consular access if you are detained or arrested. We also can\u2019t guarantee access to legal representation.\u201d The advice also urges travellers not to visit military or nuclear sites, which, it says, \u201care not always clearly marked\u201d.

      "body": "<p>What a difference two years make. The first time we checked in on Sydney Contemporary in 2017 the event had consolidated its position as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/09/sydney-contemporary-seduces-with-animated-flowers-charcoal-houses-and-a-live-dingo\">Australia\u2019s largest and most commercially successful art fair</a>.</p> <p>That event was marked by both its ambition and scope, and in total the fair sold just over $16m worth of art. That record was topped in 2018 with $21m in sales. At the press launch on Wednesday for the 2019 outing, Tim Etchells, director of Art Fairs Australia \u2013 the company that stages the event \u2013 speculated that they would see perhaps $26m in sales if the upward trend continued.</p> <p>And if the scale of the show is anything to go by, Etchells may well be right to be optimistic. <a href=\"https://sydneycontemporary.com.au/\">Sydney Contemporary</a> is a massive four-day event, spread out through the high-ceilinged galleries of Carriageworks in Redfern, with 95 galleries exhibiting new work by more than 450 artists from more than 12 countries, along with a series of performances, curated installation art works, a talks program and VIP events. On the surface it\u2019s all go-go-go.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d2a3d204e1f63fdca706dab1b33aede060f2c92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d2a3d204e1f63fdca706dab1b33aede060f2c92/0_0_6234_4254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sydney Contemporary Art Fair is open at Carriageworks until Sunday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sydney Contemporary Art Fair is open at Carriageworks until Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zan Wimberley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the Australian economy is in a very different place to where it was in 2017. The expectation that Australia could soon be in recession is widespread, and with flat consumer spending, right now might not be the best time to buy art. The key question in my mind as I toured the fair was how all this would play out in the actual art on offer in 2019.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It seems as though the gallery directors are thinking the same \u2013 let\u2019s get back to basics, and not scare the punters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The short answer is that, for the most part, the galleries are playing it safe with a lot of decorative art. There are vast stretches of tedious abstract painting in brown, black and red, the kind of stuff that looks good on the walls of houses advertised on real estate sites.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a lot of large-scale photography, much of it nature or animal themed \u2013 the better work in this vein being Joseph McGlennon\u2019s fantasy butterfly vistas at Michael Reid, and Laurence Aberhart\u2019s magisterial and moody photos of mountain peaks at the Gow Langsford stall \u2013 and some gentle faux-expressionist figurative work that serves as testament to the artist\u2019s lack of embarrassment, and the potential buyer\u2019s will to be edgy, but in a safe way.</p> <p>Another notable trend is the change in scale. Some argue that the size of an artwork is irrelevant to its aesthetic qualities, and that might be true, but it sure makes a difference to price. In 2019, the gargantuan canvases of the last few years have disappeared with more domestic-scale works now on offer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41ec3d7b864371195992472d16245a09cdb079eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41ec3d7b864371195992472d16245a09cdb079eb/0_0_6480_4320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sullivan + Strumpf\u2019s stall at Sydney Contemporary 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sullivan + Strumpf\u2019s stall at Sydney Contemporary 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zan Wimberley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e8c7050518dc2977dd62fde0487677ab42be4ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e8c7050518dc2977dd62fde0487677ab42be4ff/0_0_6311_4252/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Evi O at Saint Cloche gallery\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In 2019, the gargantuan canvases of the last few years have disappeared with more domestic-scale works now on offer\u2019: Evi O at Saint Cloche gallery</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zan Wimberley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As far as media goes, photography and sculpture are about as radical as it gets. There are a few pieces incorporating new media such as VR (Joan Ross\u2019s installation for example), and video and other screen art, so popular just a few years ago, has likewise disappeared.</p> <p>It\u2019s as though the gallery directors are all thinking the same thing: let\u2019s get back to basics, and not scare the punters.</p> <p>Sydney Contemporary is a commercial enterprise that attempts to lure in potential buyers at all levels. There are big-ticket items for sure \u2013 such as vintage work by John Olsen at Olsen Gallery, and some new examples of Tim Storrier\u2019s trademark landscapes and sculptures at Australian Galleries \u2013 but there\u2019s also an attempt to get people to buy in at entry level, with a few pieces starting at about $250.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"540e10ff54d4c19c3c49f28842b17043d41047fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/540e10ff54d4c19c3c49f28842b17043d41047fb/0_0_6292_4186/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The NEXT display offers affordable art by lesser-known artists\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The NEXT display offers affordable art by lesser-known artists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zan Wimberley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The NEXT offering is aimed squarely at that market, with prices starting at $1,200 up to $5,000. It\u2019s basically a wall next to the cafe featuring a salon-style array of mostly abstract works by lesser-known artists from commercial galleries, including pieces by Shinya Azuma ($1.6k), Nick Ferguson ($2.5k) and Tom Adair ($5k).</p> <p>In fact, there seems to be a bar or cafe every couple of hundred metres, and the long and winding route that visitors are meant to follow \u2013 marked out by a bright blue carpet \u2013 is, as one gallerist said to me, rather like Ikea, although without Swedish meatballs at the end.</p> <p>The late great art critic Robert Hughes once observed that the Australian art market is populated with \u201ctire kickers\u201d \u2013 people who come to look but don\u2019t actually buy. Due to my ongoing financial embarrassment, I am one of those people. I have a short list of things that attracted me: the list includes Amanda Williams\u2019 analogue photography of landscapes at The Commercial, James Drinkwater\u2019s brilliant post-ironic expressionist paintings at Nanda/Hobbs, and Laurie Steer\u2019s Crocodile Ate the Sun: an installation of odd little ceramics at the booth of New Zealand visitors Bowerbank Ninow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41917f6bc240e740e7a3567e8756461c520dd3e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41917f6bc240e740e7a3567e8756461c520dd3e4/0_0_5370_3649/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Drinkwater work at Sydney Contemporary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"680\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Drinkwater\u2019s \u2018brilliant\u2019 expressionist paintings, on display at Sydney Contemporary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zan Wimberley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the best work of the show for me was undoubtedly <a href=\"https://sydneycontemporary.com.au/seanclaire19/\">Tower of Power</a>: a not-for-sale installation by Claire Healy and Sean Cordeiro in which punters climb stairs inside a faux-medieval tower. At the top is an observation platform from which you can observe the main hall of the fair, or charge your phone via some handily installed charger cables.</p> <p>A woman standing next to me at the top was trying to work out how to use a pair of binoculars that are part of the work.

Sydney Contemporary is a massive four-day event, spread out through the high-ceilinged galleries of Carriageworks in Redfern, with 95 galleries exhibiting new work by more than 450 artists from more than 12 countries, along with a series of performances, curated installation art works, a talks program and VIP events. On the surface it\u2019s all go-go-go. But the Australian economy is in a very different place to where it was in 2017. The expectation that Australia could soon be in recession is widespread, and with flat consumer spending, right now might not be the best time to buy art. The key question in my mind as I toured the fair was how all this would play out in the actual art on offer in 2019. The short answer is that, for the most part, the galleries are playing it safe with a lot of decorative art. There are vast stretches of tedious abstract painting in brown, black and red, the kind of stuff that looks good on the walls of houses advertised on real estate sites. There\u2019s also a lot of large-scale photography, much of it nature or animal themed \u2013 the better work in this vein being Joseph McGlennon\u2019s fantasy butterfly vistas at Michael Reid, and Laurence Aberhart\u2019s magisterial and moody photos of mountain peaks at the Gow Langsford stall \u2013 and some gentle faux-expressionist figurative work that serves as testament to the artist\u2019s lack of embarrassment, and the potential buyer\u2019s will to be edgy, but in a safe way. Another notable trend is the change in scale. Some argue that the size of an artwork is irrelevant to its aesthetic qualities, and that might be true, but it sure makes a difference to price. In 2019, the gargantuan canvases of the last few years have disappeared with more domestic-scale works now on offer. As far as media goes, photography and sculpture are about as radical as it gets. There are a few pieces incorporating new media such as VR (Joan Ross\u2019s installation for example), and video and other screen art, so popular just a few years ago, has likewise disappeared. It\u2019s as though the gallery directors are all thinking the same thing: let\u2019s get back to basics, and not scare the punters. Sydney Contemporary is a commercial enterprise that attempts to lure in potential buyers at all levels. There are big-ticket items for sure \u2013 such as vintage work by John Olsen at Olsen Gallery, and some new examples of Tim Storrier\u2019s trademark landscapes and sculptures at Australian Galleries \u2013 but there\u2019s also an attempt to get people to buy in at entry level, with a few pieces starting at about $250. The NEXT offering is aimed squarely at that market, with prices starting at $1,200 up to $5,000. It\u2019s basically a wall next to the cafe featuring a salon-style array of mostly abstract works by lesser-known artists from commercial galleries, including pieces by Shinya Azuma ($1.6k), Nick Ferguson ($2.5k) and Tom Adair ($5k). In fact, there seems to be a bar or cafe every couple of hundred metres, and the long and winding route that visitors are meant to follow \u2013 marked out by a bright blue carpet \u2013 is, as one gallerist said to me, rather like Ikea, although without Swedish meatballs at the end. The late great art critic Robert Hughes once observed that the Australian art market is populated with \u201ctire kickers\u201d \u2013 people who come to look but don\u2019t actually buy. Due to my ongoing financial embarrassment, I am one of those people. I have a short list of things that attracted me: the list includes Amanda Williams\u2019 analogue photography of landscapes at The Commercial, James Drinkwater\u2019s brilliant post-ironic expressionist paintings at Nanda/Hobbs, and Laurie Steer\u2019s Crocodile Ate the Sun: an installation of odd little ceramics at the booth of New Zealand visitors Bowerbank Ninow. But the best work of the show for me was undoubtedly Tower of Power: a not-for-sale installation by Claire Healy and Sean Cordeiro in which punters climb stairs inside a faux-medieval tower. At the top is an observation platform from which you can observe the main hall of the fair, or charge your phone via some handily installed charger cables. A woman standing next to me at the top was trying to work out how to use a pair of binoculars that are part of the work. Once she had stared down at the gallery owners and their art, she joyfully remarked: \u201cAha! So little \u2013 and far away!\u201d \u2022 Sydney Contemporary Art Fair runs at Carriageworks until Sunday 15 September \u2022 This story was updated on 13 September 2019. It originally said pieces started at $1,200 while there are a few pieces starting at $250.",

Pohiva had been ill for the much of the last year and was receiving treatment in New Zealand for liver disease. He was evacuated to Auckland on Wednesday suffering from pneumonia, Radio New Zealand reported. He died on Thursday morning. Pohiva was a key figure in Tonga\u2019s pro-democracy movement, which saw him regularly clash with Tonga\u2019s monarchy over his more than three decades in politics. In 2014 he became the first commoner in Tonga to be elected to the position of prime minister by Parliament, rather than being appointed to the role by the king. Over the course of his parliamentary career \u2013 which began in 1987 \u2013 he was dismissed by the king along with the rest of his party, imprisoned for contempt of parliament, and twice charged with sedition. Partly because of Pohiva\u2019s push for democratic reforms, Tonga became a constitutional monarchy in 2010 and now has representative elections for parliament, however, reverence for the monarchy remains strong and the country has strict sedition laws. He was awarded the Defender of Democracy Award in 2013 by the Parliamentarians for Global Action, the first Pacific Islander to receive the prize. On Thursday local media reported that Tongan parliament had been suspended indefinitely in light of the news. Tributes were paid to the prime minister from across the region.

The Global Goalkeeper award recognises Narendra Modi\u2019s flagship Clean India programme, through which the government has built millions of toilets and publicised the benefits of sanitation and hygiene. The award comes amid growing criticism of the disenfranchisement, detention and deportation of Muslims in Assam and Kashmir. Alleged human rights violations in the two states under the governing Bharatiya Janata party have made front pages around the world. The award will be the latest addition to Modi\u2019s growing haul of prestigious international prizes. On Tuesday, a group of south Asian Americans working in philanthropy wrote an open letter to the Gates Foundation alleging that Modi had effectively confined millions to their communities, and urging the organisation to rescind the award. \u201cFor over a month now, PM Modi has placed 8 million people in Jammu and Kashmir under house arrest, blocked communications and media coverage to the outside world, detained thousands of people including children, and denied basic benefits. Reports of torture, including beatings and the murder of a young child by Indian security officers, are emerging as well,\u201d said the letter. \u201cThe award will signal the international community\u2019s willingness to overlook, and remain silent, in the face of the Indian government\u2019s brazen violations of human rights principles.\u201d Suchitra Vijayan, a lawyer and co-founder of the research and journalism portal Polis Project, said philanthropic organisations had played a crucial role in \u201cwhitewashing and normalising\u201d Modi\u2019s violations of human rights and democracy. Until his election to India\u2019s highest office in 2014, Modi had been unable to enter the US because of his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, in which thousands of Muslims were slaughtered during his tenure as chief minister. \u201cThe narrative is India being the world\u2019s largest democracy, India being a great place to invest, India shining,\u201d Vijayan said. \u201cAll that only counts if the international community recognises these narratives.\u201d Since Modi came to power, he has received accolades from governments and organisations around the world. The Philip Kotler presidential award honoured Modi for \u201cgiving new life to democracy and economic growth\u201d, while the Seoul peace prize credited him for reducing the social and economic disparity between the rich and the poor. The latter award was made despite worldwide criticism of Modi\u2019s economic policies, including demonetisation, by economic experts. Last year, the UN gave Modi the Champions of the Earth award, in spite of objections that his government has not only green lit projects that threaten to cause huge deforestation, but also allowed India\u2019s capital, New Delhi, to become one of the most polluted cities on Earth. The Swachh Bharat programme, for which Modi is receiving his latest award, has come under huge scrutiny in India. Modi\u2019s government has said that the scheme has provided 90% of Indians with access to clean toilets. However, press reports and a book called Where India Goes, which closely studied the programme, suggest that many of the newly-built toilets remain unused because of poor access to water and caste rules that restrict many people from cleaning them. India\u2019s government has employed controversial tactics to encourage use of the toilets, including \u201cgood morning squads\u201d that involve government officials publicly humiliating those defecating openly. One news channel ran a national \u201cname and shame\u201d campaign urging citizens to \u201cblow the whistle\u201d on those defecating openly. The Gates Foundation said in a statement that Modi was being recognised for \u201cthe progress India is making in improving sanitation, as part of its drive toward achievement of the UN sustainable development goals\u201d. \u201cGlobally, sanitation-related diseases kill nearly 500,000 children under the age of five every year,\u201d said the statement. \u201cYet despite its importance, sanitation has not received significant attention.

She compared it to improvements in violence and discrimination among British football fans over recent years. \u201cAfter changing the law, some changes in stadium infrastructure, implementing bans and increasing education, you can see that there is a very big change,\u201d she said.

Long-term sustainable change required getting into \u201cthe heads of staff\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou can fix all the paperwork up, anyone can do that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not necessarily going to fix up how you care for somebody.

You can put a Band-Aid on it, it will look good, but it will fall over in five minutes.\u201d</p> <p>She said managers of homes were under pressure to cut costs \u2013 including by restricting overtime, curbing the food bill and deploying fewer level-four trained carers on the floor because they are more expensive than inexperienced staff.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s pressure to not spend too much money on activities because there\u2019s no profit in activities,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She said general managers were constantly under pressure to sell beds.</p> <p>A former staff member who worked at Bupa Woodend in Victoria, who declined to give her name, said three lounge rooms had been recently converted to make way for extra bedrooms.</p> <p>\u201cThey pack them in like sardines.

      "bodyText": "When a tropical fish tank disappeared and guide dog puppies stopped visiting a Bupa nursing home on New South Wales\u2019s north coast, elderly residents were inconsolable. Amid horror stories of maggots growing in wounds, malnourishment, neglect, medication mismanagement, assault and sex abuse incidents at some of Bupa\u2019s 73 aged care homes, the abrupt end to pet time may seem trivial. But for Shane Thompson the incidents exemplified what was wrong with the corporate culture at Bupa nursing homes \u2013 an obsession with cost cutting which forgets residents are human beings. \u201cMy dad would go down to dinner every night in his wheelchair and would talk about the fish tank the next day. They all had names for the fish. Then all of a sudden it was just gone and nobody was told where it went,\u201d Thompson tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI said, \u2018What\u2019s the deal with the fish tank?\u2019 And they said, \u2018Well, it\u2019s in case someone hurts themselves.\u2019 I said: \u2018It\u2019s been there forever. Do you know how many people stop and look at the fish tank?\u2019\u201d Thompson\u2019s father Don died last November aged 95, after spending his last three-and-a-half-years at Bupa Pottsville Beach on the NSW north coast. The home received a notice of noncompliance from the federal health department in October 2018. Bupa, a health, insurance and nursing home business with headquarters in London, is the 30th largest company in Australia based on income. The company, which looks after an estimated 6,700 elderly residents, has been heavily criticised at the royal commission into the aged care sector. Analysis of recent audits and notices of sanctions and noncompliance shows nursing homes run by Bupa have a much poorer record than those of other providers. Guardian Australia analysed data from the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission\u2019s audit reports and the federal government\u2019s My Aged Care website\u2019s noncompliance checker. The audits, conducted over the past four years, show conditions in over a third of Bupa\u2019s facilities have been deemed to be a \u201cserious risk\u201d to residents. Nursing homes were rated on 44 benchmarks covering everything from administration and IT issues to clinical care of residents. Bupa had the lowest average audit score of large providers \u2013 40.38 out of 44. If an audit results in the facility failing a standard that presents a risk to clients in the facility, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner will notify the Department of Health and post a notice to that effect on its website. Twenty-five Bupa facilities have had a serious risk notice in the past four years, representing 34% of Bupa\u2019s facilities. For comparison, the next highest provider was 26% \u2013 and the average of all large providers was 6%. Following the risk decision, some facilities have corrected the issues. Thirteen of its nursing homes were hit with sanctions \u2013 two of them twice. Sanctions include funding cuts, bans on taking new residents, mandatory training and the appointment of administrators and advisers to get the home up to scratch at the company\u2019s cost. The results are not a surprise to Thompson, a business consultant who gave up full-time work so that he could monitor his father\u2019s care for two to three hours each day. \u201cI was one of the very few people who was there every single day to make sure that his room ran right,\u201d Thompson said. His said his biggest fear while his father lived at the Bupa nursing home was \u201cincompetence\u201d. \u201cMy dad had three heart attacks and I had to demand an ambulance on two [occasions] yelling my head off at them,\u201d he said. Thompson pointed to a shortage of staff, lack of handovers between shifts and problems with medication management. There was a turnover of three general managers in three years. \u201cI just became a grumpy bear by the end of it because you\u2019re pacing around trying to find someone,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI could walk his whole ward on some days and not find a person in uniform who worked there.\u201d After his father\u2019s death, Thompson said he felt a huge sense of relief. \u201cI thought, \u2018thank God, I never have to walk into Bupa again.\u2019\u201d \u2018They pack them in like sardines\u2019 It\u2019s a feeling Jane Rankin-Reid shares, after her late mother Lee\u2019s time at Bupa South Hobart. The nicest thing she can say about that Bupa home is that the gardens were \u201cimmaculate\u201d. \u201cYou have very attractive gardens that are meant to attract a particular wealth group. My mother would have been much happier beside a compost bin quite frankly,\u201d Rankin-Reid said. \u201cIn the 16-17 months she was there I don\u2019t think she was taken outside more than twice because of staff shortages. The gardens are always empty.\u201d Rankin-Reid said it took two weeks for someone to clean a chair in the 93-year-old\u2019s bedroom following a faeces accident. She said she hired an external cleaner to come regularly at her own expense. Whenever she made complaints, Rankin-Reid said, she was told she could move her mother if she didn\u2019t like the care she was receiving. She said there was an \u201cendless defensiveness\u201d from management and that she was labelled a troublemaker when issues were brought to their attention. She alleged her mother\u2019s room had allegedly been robbed multiple times and trinkets and cash were stolen, but Bupa was reluctant to investigate. \u201cThere was a high degree of pilfering but they would say \u2018your mother\u2019s got mental difficulties\u2019. The gaslighting. This is a woman who read seven books before she died in the last fortnight. But [staff] would say she\u2019s losing it,\u201d Rankin-Reid said. She alleged her mother was also robbed on the night she was dying. Bupa South Hobart was sanctioned in October 2018, but Rankin-Reid said she saw very little improvement afterwards. A former Bupa general manager from a nursing home in regional NSW, speaking on condition of anonymity, said penalties generally brought about short-term change in Bupa nursing homes. Long-term sustainable change required getting into \u201cthe heads of staff\u201d. \u201cYou can fix all the paperwork up, anyone can do that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you\u2019re not necessarily going to fix up how you care for somebody. [Staff] have to be given encouragement that will make them feel that when they get to work they want to do the best for Mrs Jones. You can put a Band-Aid on it, it will look good, but it will fall over in five minutes.\u201d She said managers of homes were under pressure to cut costs \u2013 including by restricting overtime, curbing the food bill and deploying fewer level-four trained carers on the floor because they are more expensive than inexperienced staff. \u201cThere\u2019s pressure to not spend too much money on activities because there\u2019s no profit in activities,\u201d she said. She said general managers were constantly under pressure to sell beds. A former staff member who worked at Bupa Woodend in Victoria, who declined to give her name, said three lounge rooms had been recently converted to make way for extra bedrooms. \u201cThey pack them in like sardines. It\u2019s insane,\u201d she said. That nursing home was hit with sanctions in September 2018 and a noncompliance notice in October the same year. \u201cAs soon as they get their accreditation back all of the things they put in place, to prevent further incidents \u2026 they ditch them and it goes back to how it was,\u201d she said. She described a mass exodus of trained staff when her nursing home was sanctioned. \u201cThey\u2019re happy if they just have numbers on the floor, they don\u2019t care about the mix. As a consequence we got a lot of junior [registered nurses]. Bupa don\u2019t provide the support for them, so you\u2019re sending them in blind,\u201d she said. \u201cIn terms of staffing levels it wasn\u2019t unusual for us most shifts to have up to 10 agency staff members. You have to show them what to do and it\u2019s another risk to the residents.\u201d For three years, Rod Medew\u2019s late mother Edna was at Bupa Traralgon, which was hit with a sanction in April after a previous sanction from July 2018 was lifted in February. The nursing home also had a notice of noncompliance in August 2018. \u201cSomething is going wrong at the top level,\u201d Medew told Guardian Australia. Lack of communication, distrust, problems with medication and poor food quality were among the family\u2019s biggest complaints. \u201cMum was simply not getting her medication [for Parkinson\u2019s disease that needs to be given at certain times]. My sister was finding it on the floor,\u201d Medew said. Marie Edwards\u2019 late mother Irene Ashford, 96, and late brother Michael, 56, who had Down syndrome and early-onset dementia, were cared for at Bupa Echuca in regional Victoria. The nursing home was hit with sanctions in March. Edwards said her brother developed scabies on two occasions and the staff failed to tell the family the first time it happened. \u201cI was there every single day and none of the nursing staff bothered to say he had an issue. We were gobsmacked,\u201d she said. \u201cI nearly fainted when I saw it [on his back with his shirt off].\u201d Edwards said her brother had gone into the home with the ability to play billiards but ended up in a wheel chair, never walked again, and couldn\u2019t feed himself. Battle with the tax office Bupa\u2019s aged care managing director Suzanne Dvorak insisted the company was trying to lift its game. \u201cWe apologise for the failings identified in these homes and are focused on fixing these problems so no resident experiences unsatisfactory care,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cSome of this will take time but we are already starting to see genuine progress.\u201d Dvorak said the company was hiring more nurses and carers, refurbishing homes and trying to improve meal options and training for all employees. \u201cThe vast majority of our homes are working well, passing external audits and providing the care residents should expect from a Bupa home,\u201d she said. In April, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission announced it was taking Bupa to the federal court for allegedly making false and misleading claims about the services it provided at 21 nursing homes. Bupa has also been in trouble with the Australian Taxation Office in recent years. Documents filed with the corporate regulator show Bupa\u2019s Australian aged care operation has been extremely lucrative, declaring a profit of $90m in 2017, but plunged into the red last year with a loss of $132m after it settled a long-running battle with the tax office. It paid $122m to settle a tax bill over borrowings from other group companies to finance the purchase of businesses in 2007 and 2008, Bupa ANZ Healthcare Holdings said in its annual report. Jason Ward from the Tax Justice Network said despite the royal commission and failures to meet care standards, the company continued to cut costs. He noted in the 2018 calendar year it cut $24m of spending on employees and suppliers, following a $3m cut the year before. Notes Guardian Australia scraped every service page on agedcarequality.gov.au to get the most recent audit outcome and most recent serious risk decision. We also scraped every entry on the myagedcare.gov.au compliance checker pages to get counts of current and archived notices of noncompliance, and current and archived sanction notices. The datasets were merged based on service name. Provider names were cleaned and matched where possible. Large providers are defined as those with 10 or more audited services.",

In late July 1978, Kaoru Hasuike and his girlfriend, Yukiko Okudo, walked several hundred metres along the sand, making sure to avoid a group of rowdy drinkers. After finding a quiet spot, they sat side by side to watch the sun set over the Sea of Japan.

Two days later, they arrived in North Korea, the victims of the communist regime\u2019s ambitious plans to create a cold war network of spies that would operate in Japan, its hated former colonial ruler. The couple married in North Korea in 1980 and returned to Japan in 2002 after the regime\u2019s then leader, Kim Jong-il, admitted the country had abducted more than a dozen Japanese citizens to teach their language and customs to Pyongyang agents. Now Hasuike, 61, believes North Korea\u2019s emergence as a nuclear power and talks between its ambitious leader, Kim Jong-un, and Donald Trump, offer the best hope yet of the return of abductees Japan believes are still in North Korea. Japan\u2019s government lists 17 people as having been abducted by North Korea during the 70s and 80s, including five from Niigata prefecture, whose coastline is just over 500 miles from North Korea. They include Megumi Yokota, a 13-year-old schoolgirl who was snatched as she walked home from after-school badminton practice in 1977. Five abductees, including Hasuike and Okudo, were allowed to return to Japan after a landmark summit in Pyongyang between Kim and the then Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi. Kim apologised for the abductions but his officials insisted that eight victims had died, most in a series of bizarre accidents and that four others had never entered North Korea. Yokota, they claimed, had killed herself in a psychiatric hospital in the early 1990s. But Japan\u2019s government and the victims\u2019 families refuse to believe that they are dead, citing forged death certificates and sightings of victims after they had supposedly died. DNA tests on remains North Korea claimed were those of Yokota were found to belong to people unrelated to the abductions. Her younger brother, Takuya Yokota, is convinced that the North is holding his sister and other Japanese citizens hostage because they know too much about the regime. \u201cMy parents are in their 80s and my father is chronically ill in hospital,\u201d said Yokota, who heads an association of families whose members were abducted by North Korea. \u201cThey\u2019ve waited more than 40 years to see their daughter. I won\u2019t stop until she is back. I would welcome her home, but the first words I would say to her are \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019.\u201d Trump has reportedly raised the abductions in two of his three meetings with Kim. Hasuike, though, believes a breakthrough will come only after the leaders have made substantial progress on Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons programme, paving the way for a meeting between Kim and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Abe, a hardliner on North Korea, insists that normalising diplomatic ties and providing Japanese aid are contingent on a resolution of the abduction issue. After his arrival in North Korea, Hasuike, an associate professor of Korean language and culture at Niigata Sangyo University, was initially trained to become an agent, undergoing daily instruction in the Korean language and the regime\u2019s ideology. His apprenticeship ended when two women abducted from Lebanon who had been trained as agents escaped while on assignment in Yugoslavia, prompting the regime to concede that its plan to build a global network of spies carried too many risks.

From his proxies\u2019 perspectives, a specific kind of melancholic misogyny emerged. There was a certain tragedy to the men Cameron embodied, and their invariably distorted, drunk and demoralising lenses guided the stories he laid out for listeners. In Country Figs he has \u201ca lap full of cum and a head full of steam\u201d as well as \u201ca skin full of piss and one last dart\u201d.</p> <p>Cameron came up in the Sydney music scene where a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/08/sydney-lockout-laws-to-be-scrapped-except-in-kings-cross\">teenager was fatally punched in 2012</a>, leading to lockout policies which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/feb/20/sydney-lockouts-seven-creatives-give-their-views-and-none-of-them-are-good\">punished the entire city\u2019s music scene</a> as a result of male violence. For the past three years, he\u2019s been living in New York City with Kirke and her children.</p> <p>They met while working on an ambitious mockumentary about male creative ego, which served as the music video for his song Marlon Brando. It was that song that triggered the most vocal and widespread blowback to Cameron and his work. The pitiable and pathetic man he sings about is the kind to toss off a homophobic slur with no regard for its damage, which Cameron does in character in the song.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m3vqGPS4cc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9m3vqGPS4cc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In the website <a href=\"https://junkee.com/alex-cameron-kirin-j-callinan-toxic-masculinity/125447\">Junkee</a> in 2017, Jared Richards compared Cameron\u2019s persona with other Australian artists Kirin J Callinan and Client Liaison, arguing that their attempts at ironic toxic masculinity weren\u2019t always successful. The layers of irony employed by Cameron, for instance, \u201cdon\u2019t shield a queer listener from the impact of hearing a slur they\u2019ve likely had hurled at them. It does, however, shield Alex.\u201d But Kirke defends the work. \u201cOne of the things we talked about when we first met was the use of the word \u2018faggot\u2019 in [Marlon Brando],\u201d she says. \u201cMy opinion on that, when he was deciding whether to use it or not, was that \u2026 they\u2019re the type of words that tell us about the person who\u2019s speaking. They tell us about the narrator, or the character.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>[They tried to] extrapolate fault in what I\u2019m doing. As if there\u2019s a gotcha! moment. Like I\u2019m just taking the piss</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In biopics and historical fiction, Kirke says, writers will put \u201cthese kinds of triggering, upsetting words\u201d in the mouths of the characters as a shorthand for who they are, or what context they occupy. But when the same content arrives packaged as a song \u201cpeople think it\u2019s the perspective of the songwriter, rather than \u2026 the story they\u2019re telling\u201d.</p> <p>Cameron references \u201ca small, vocal group of journalists\u201d who tried to \u201cextrapolate some kind of fault in what I\u2019m doing. As if there\u2019s, like, a <em>gotcha!</em> moment. Like I\u2019m just taking the piss.\u201d While there is something to be said of the privilege that grants Cameron the freedom to slip in and out of toxic identities, he has always been insistent on the truth at the core of the performance: that any comedy that came of the Alex Cameron character was born from a discomfort at being confronted with the horrors experienced by Alex Cameron the person: \u201cThere\u2019s no jokes in my songs. My songs are very real. Marlon Brando \u2026 is a song about Sydney. It\u2019s a real story.\u201d</p> <p>Miami Memory is about what happens when the hustler settles down and the irony dissipates. Here Cameron has evolved into a new kind of character: a role model, a reliable partner, a father figure and, occasionally, a daddy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5e4a99f0562d9a3bf1b1542679b4a502779f828\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5e4a99f0562d9a3bf1b1542679b4a502779f828/0_0_5383_8074/667.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Cameron and Jemima Kirke\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Cameron and Jemima Kirke in Brooklyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cameron describes it as a gift to Kirke, a romantic offering in lieu of any traditional token of commitment.</p> <p>In the video for the record\u2019s title track, they play a glamorous couple swanning around a palatial Miami fever dream, receiving cellulite massages and filming each other for future voyeuristic pleasures. Before the video was released, the enterprising artists sold polaroids, relics of their romance, to followers on Instagram.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BxLT4DmAa6W/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "\u201cNo matter how hard I try, I can\u2019t get away from writing about the behaviour of men,\u201d Alex Cameron says. The Australian singer is in a hotel room in Salt Lake City, Utah, a week away from the release of his third record, Miami Memory, and more than 3,200km away from New York City where he lives with his partner, the artist, actor and Girls star Jemima Kirke, for whom he wrote the record. Cameron\u2019s relationship with Kirke is mapped on to the record in ways that are incredibly open and occasionally explicit, but it frequently extends beyond the bounds of their bond, taking in her children from a past relationship (in the song Stepdad) and the aftermath of that marriage (Divorce). In the past, the swaggering performer assumed an ironic persona of a bitter misogynist which has been both critically acclaimed by Pitchfork and considered a joke taken \u201ctoo well, or too far\u201d by the New Yorker. On this record Cameron keenly reflects on the harm men\u2019s behaviour causes women in songs about the independent sex work industry (Far from Born Again), and boys\u2019 clubs scrambling to come to terms with one of their own being \u201cdone for a sexual harassment claim\u201d (Bad for the Boys). \u201cI\u2019ve always just been fascinated by [masculinity],\u201d he says. \u201cEven as a kid [I was] constantly analysing the way men were behaving around me, and it was inevitable that it was going to become something that I wrote about in my songs \u2019cos I\u2019ve just been smothered by it and at the same time expected to behave like that.\u201d On his first two albums, Jumping the Shark (2016) and Forced Witness (2017), Cameron wrote in character as men seeking out \u201cthe hottest barely legal age teens\u201d they can find online; as washed-up lounge singers with dashed dreams; as misanthropic deadbeats refusing to recognise the world has moved on without them \u2013 or knowing it, and resenting those who left them behind. From his proxies\u2019 perspectives, a specific kind of melancholic misogyny emerged. There was a certain tragedy to the men Cameron embodied, and their invariably distorted, drunk and demoralising lenses guided the stories he laid out for listeners. In Country Figs he has \u201ca lap full of cum and a head full of steam\u201d as well as \u201ca skin full of piss and one last dart\u201d. Cameron came up in the Sydney music scene where a teenager was fatally punched in 2012, leading to lockout policies which punished the entire city\u2019s music scene as a result of male violence. For the past three years, he\u2019s been living in New York City with Kirke and her children. They met while working on an ambitious mockumentary about male creative ego, which served as the music video for his song Marlon Brando. It was that song that triggered the most vocal and widespread blowback to Cameron and his work. The pitiable and pathetic man he sings about is the kind to toss off a homophobic slur with no regard for its damage, which Cameron does in character in the song. In the website Junkee in 2017, Jared Richards compared Cameron\u2019s persona with other Australian artists Kirin J Callinan and Client Liaison, arguing that their attempts at ironic toxic masculinity weren\u2019t always successful. The layers of irony employed by Cameron, for instance, \u201cdon\u2019t shield a queer listener from the impact of hearing a slur they\u2019ve likely had hurled at them. It does, however, shield Alex.\u201d But Kirke defends the work. \u201cOne of the things we talked about when we first met was the use of the word \u2018faggot\u2019 in [Marlon Brando],\u201d she says. \u201cMy opinion on that, when he was deciding whether to use it or not, was that \u2026 they\u2019re the type of words that tell us about the person who\u2019s speaking. They tell us about the narrator, or the character.\u201d In biopics and historical fiction, Kirke says, writers will put \u201cthese kinds of triggering, upsetting words\u201d in the mouths of the characters as a shorthand for who they are, or what context they occupy. But when the same content arrives packaged as a song \u201cpeople think it\u2019s the perspective of the songwriter, rather than \u2026 the story they\u2019re telling\u201d. Cameron references \u201ca small, vocal group of journalists\u201d who tried to \u201cextrapolate some kind of fault in what I\u2019m doing. As if there\u2019s, like, a gotcha! moment. Like I\u2019m just taking the piss.\u201d While there is something to be said of the privilege that grants Cameron the freedom to slip in and out of toxic identities, he has always been insistent on the truth at the core of the performance: that any comedy that came of the Alex Cameron character was born from a discomfort at being confronted with the horrors experienced by Alex Cameron the person: \u201cThere\u2019s no jokes in my songs. My songs are very real. Marlon Brando \u2026 is a song about Sydney. It\u2019s a real story.\u201d Miami Memory is about what happens when the hustler settles down and the irony dissipates. Here Cameron has evolved into a new kind of character: a role model, a reliable partner, a father figure and, occasionally, a daddy. Cameron describes it as a gift to Kirke, a romantic offering in lieu of any traditional token of commitment. In the video for the record\u2019s title track, they play a glamorous couple swanning around a palatial Miami fever dream, receiving cellulite massages and filming each other for future voyeuristic pleasures. Before the video was released, the enterprising artists sold polaroids, relics of their romance, to followers on Instagram. It\u2019s not the first time Kirke has been cast in a dramatisation of a loved one\u2019s lived experiences, having played the on-screen best friend of her real-life best friend Lena Dunham on HBO\u2019s Girls. \u201cIn Girls that stuff was referencing stories in Lena\u2019s life. And it\u2019s the same thing with Alex. He got ideas from our life, but they\u2019re still just stories. And I know [the songs are] not completely autobiographical; they\u2019re embellished.\u201d In a particularly vivid example, the song includes the line \u201ceating your ass like an oyster / the way you came like a tsunami\u201d. When it was released, Kirke took to Instagram to clarify: \u201cI didn\u2019t come from the ass eating that was an artistic embellishment!\u201d Making his relationship a focal point, Cameron says, is the next evolution of his vast and endless exploration of the male species. \u201cIf I\u2019m able to put this microscope up to characters then I need to be able to put it on myself as well\u201d. Other songs deal with Red Pill-ers, the \u201cPC brigade\u201d and gaslighting. What role do they play in a record that\u2019s ostensibly a gift, a velvet-lined offering to romance and intimacy? Cameron thinks for a moment. \u201cThey give me a chance to let Jemima know that I have some understanding of what she\u2019s been through and what men are capable of. And in some ways, in some instances on the record, what I\u2019m capable of.\u201d \u2022 Alex Cameron\u2019s album Miami Memory is out Friday 13 September",

This afternoon I found out that one of the two people I have hurt the most in this world will be publishing an essay about our friendship for The Cut. I don\u2019t know when this essay will go live. But it will be different than the articles that called me a scammer for clickbait. Everything in Natalie\u2019s article will be brilliant and beautifully expressed and true. I know this not because I have read her essay but because Natalie is the best writer I know. I still love her. Our friendship ended 2 years ago, but I still walk around New York sometimes, listening to music, running errands, thinking about her. Amsterdam. I\u2019ll let her tell you about that trip because it put her in danger\u2014not me\u2014so maybe it is hers to tell. Maybe she has custody of that story. Sometimes I all but gag with guilt. Sometimes I write emails to her in my head. Sometimes I imagine a future where we\u2019re friends again! Natalie suffered all the consequences of being loved by an addict and none of the benefits of being loved by the woman that recovery made me into. In early August Natalie liked one of my Instagram photos by accident. I knew it was by accident because I know Natalie. But still! I thought: Maybe she is checking in on me because she still wants to be friends! Maybe she still loves me, too. I realize now that she must have been working on the article about us that will be published soon by New York Magazine. My team asked two things of me: To ignore this essay in my posts so I don\u2019t drive traffic to it and to give them Natalie\u2019s email so they could reach out. This is the first time I\u2019ve disobeyed them. You should read Natalie\u2019s article when it comes out. I\u2019ll post a link when it does. Go leave a comment on nymag.com even if it\u2019s insulting me. Every digital impression will be another reason for The Cut to hire Natalie again and to pay her even more next time. And The Cut doesn\u2019t have access to the audience most interested in hating and loving Caroline Calloway. I do. So start anticipating this article. Get excited. Read it. I hope I can support Natalie now in ways I never did during my addiction.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/carolinecalloway/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Caroline Calloway</a> (@carolinecalloway) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-09-05T04:20:55+00:00\">Sep 4, 2019 at 9:20pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Since the story dropped, Calloway has been taking to Instagram to obsessively posting about the article and her relationship with the writer, rewriting the history of her own Instagram feed to edit Beach into the narrative.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jayratsbynyc/status/1171913107444326400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">caroline calloway - \u201ci don\u2019t have a lot of memories from the four years i was increasingly addicted to adderall\u201d<br>also caroline calloway - *currently in depth detailing who wrote exactly what for all 600+ of her instagram posts since 2013* <a href=\"https://t.co/XIAQksX6K3\">pic.twitter.com/XIAQksX6K3</a></p>&mdash; great ratsby (@jayratsbynyc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayratsbynyc/status/1171913107444326400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 11, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Why have I heard this name before?</strong></p> <p>Calloway has been bubbling in and out of mainstream consciousness for several years.

      "bodyText": "Hi Alyx. Who is Caroline Calloway, and why could no one stop talking about her at the pub last night? Caroline Calloway is the subject of an intense, emotionally complex long read in New York Magazine\u2019s the Cut. It was written by her former close friend and ghostwriter Natalie Beach, and now the internet can\u2019t stop talking about her \u2013 largely because Calloway herself can\u2019t stop talking about the article. Twitter has blown up. The Reddit thread about the story has 4,000 comments and counting. People are saying they\u2019re going to take the day off to watch the drama unfold. The reason for the obsession isn\u2019t just the piece itself, which is a complex, knotty look at toxic female friendship, class difference and mental illness. Calloway has 780,000-plus Instagram followers. As soon as she received an email from Beach forewarning her that the article was coming, she started writing about the piece on her Instagram feed and on her stories, and sharing screenshots of private conversations. She built a huge amount of hype for the story before it came out, teetering between magnanimity and hysteria. Since the story dropped, Calloway has been taking to Instagram to obsessively posting about the article and her relationship with the writer, rewriting the history of her own Instagram feed to edit Beach into the narrative. Why have I heard this name before? Calloway has been bubbling in and out of mainstream consciousness for several years. She blew up in 2015 as an early Instagram influencer who signed a six-figure book deal. Then in January she was at the centre of a Fyre festival-style meltdown, when her $165-a-ticket \u201ccreativity workshops\u201d turned out to be a disappointing shambles for her fans.

At one point, while pinning orchids into attendees\u2019 hair, she whispered: \u201cThe secret to flower crowns is there is no secret.\u201d The whole disaster was documented in real time via Instagram stories by both Calloway and her customers. Although her apologies have been complicated, Calloway did refund many customers who purchased tickets for the events. Two weeks ago she wrote a widely shared piece for Refinery 29 titled What Taylor Swift\u2019s Lover taught me about being a scammer, which included the truly superb line, \u201cScamming is my brand right now, but it\u2019s a narrative I would like to be excluded from.\u201d So tell me about this New York Magazine piece? First of all, clear your schedule, because it\u2019ll take you 30 minutes to read the whole thing properly. It chronicles seven years of intermittent codependency between Beach and Calloway.

      "body": "<p>James Button concluded his history of the Geelong Football Club with a comment from football manager Steve Hocking. \u201cDon\u2019t try to over-explain what happened here,\u201d Hocking told him \u201cThere\u2019s a mystery to it. Leave a bit of that mystery. Trying to explain it in words is like trying to catch the wind.\u201d</p> <p>The language emanating from football clubs these days is softer, almost mystical. The days of the autocratic, raving lunatic driving a team towards a premiership are thankfully long past. You\u2019d lose your young players if you carried on like that now. You\u2019d probably have the police at your door. These days, many of the senior coaches speak like yoga instructors. Along with their players, they\u2019ve embraced mindfulness and meditation. The key words at football clubs are \u201cconnection\u201d and \u201cvulnerability\u201d. It\u2019s the antitheses of how the previous generations of Australian men were raised, taught and coached. It\u2019s refreshing, and it clearly works.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/10/tributes-flow-after-danny-frawleys-death-leaves-afl-heartbroken\">Danny Frawley: AFL community mourns loss of a man who knew what mattered | Craig Little</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The emphasis on \u201cspirit\u201d is also significant. All the recent premiers have tapped into it. In a competition ostensibly designed to be even, having a point of difference is crucial. Increasingly, that hook is cultural, some would say spiritual. It\u2019s fitting that the book chronicling the Bulldogs\u2019 premiership was titled A Wink from the Universe. Last year\u2019s premiers had the mantra \u201cHead, heart and gut\u201d. Nathan Buckley, one of the most ruthless, driven footballers imaginable, has spoken of the shift away from being a \u201cchest-beating club\u201d. </p> <p>Even the Geelong sides of the pre-Chris Scott era embraced it. In 2007, Max Rooke found an old flask made of animal hide in an African secondhand shop. He gathered his teammates and asked them to write down their dreams and goals. He then lit a candle, set the papers alight, tipped the ashes into the flask and waxed it shut. \u201cIt was our religion,\u201d he said years later, echoing George Costanza in the Opposites episode. \u201cIt was something to believe in.\u201d Rooke went and became a human wrecking ball. The Cats barely lost a game for five years.</p> <p>Scott would probably think that\u2019s a load of old rope. He\u2019s blunt, guarded and very literal. He\u2019s not one for esotericism. He doesn\u2019t bear his soul to the footballing public. And nor should he have to. He\u2019s a footy coach, not a shaman. But his detractors are starting to line up. To many, he\u2019s a moaner, the architect of a stodgy game plan, a coach who haemorrhages talent. One <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-26/geelong-cats-qualifying-final-match-collingwood-magpies/11446678?section=sport\">ABC columnist</a> recently made him out to be the most miserable sod since Andrew Bolt. His defence-first game style has never resonated with the fan base. His decision not to play Rhys Stanley last Friday night was pilloried. He answers every question on the back foot. His Krakatoa act in the box is widely mocked.</p> <p>Those in his corner point out that his peers regularly rate him as the most difficult to coach against. They note that he has made do with virtually no high draft picks, yet manages to put his club in a position to contend nearly every year. Besides, they stress, it\u2019s not his fault the Cats finished top and drew the fourth-placed team in front of their own rabid crowd. It\u2019s not his fault that Gary Rohan missed a shot from 10 metres out. It\u2019s not his fault that Tom Hawkins, the All Australian full forward, kicked four behinds. It\u2019s not his fault his experienced players spent the opening quarter tripping over one another.</p> <p>Whatever your take, unlike the last four or five premiers, there has been no sense of destiny with this Geelong side. They\u2019ve never been totally convincing, never really caught the wave, never really had a hook. For eight years, they\u2019ve been the backdrop to some far more interesting footy stories.

      "bodyText": "James Button concluded his history of the Geelong Football Club with a comment from football manager Steve Hocking. \u201cDon\u2019t try to over-explain what happened here,\u201d Hocking told him \u201cThere\u2019s a mystery to it. Leave a bit of that mystery. Trying to explain it in words is like trying to catch the wind.\u201d The language emanating from football clubs these days is softer, almost mystical. The days of the autocratic, raving lunatic driving a team towards a premiership are thankfully long past. You\u2019d lose your young players if you carried on like that now. You\u2019d probably have the police at your door. These days, many of the senior coaches speak like yoga instructors. Along with their players, they\u2019ve embraced mindfulness and meditation. The key words at football clubs are \u201cconnection\u201d and \u201cvulnerability\u201d. It\u2019s the antitheses of how the previous generations of Australian men were raised, taught and coached. It\u2019s refreshing, and it clearly works. The emphasis on \u201cspirit\u201d is also significant. All the recent premiers have tapped into it. In a competition ostensibly designed to be even, having a point of difference is crucial. Increasingly, that hook is cultural, some would say spiritual. It\u2019s fitting that the book chronicling the Bulldogs\u2019 premiership was titled A Wink from the Universe. Last year\u2019s premiers had the mantra \u201cHead, heart and gut\u201d. Nathan Buckley, one of the most ruthless, driven footballers imaginable, has spoken of the shift away from being a \u201cchest-beating club\u201d. Even the Geelong sides of the pre-Chris Scott era embraced it. In 2007, Max Rooke found an old flask made of animal hide in an African secondhand shop. He gathered his teammates and asked them to write down their dreams and goals. He then lit a candle, set the papers alight, tipped the ashes into the flask and waxed it shut. \u201cIt was our religion,\u201d he said years later, echoing George Costanza in the Opposites episode. \u201cIt was something to believe in.\u201d Rooke went and became a human wrecking ball. The Cats barely lost a game for five years. Scott would probably think that\u2019s a load of old rope. He\u2019s blunt, guarded and very literal. He\u2019s not one for esotericism. He doesn\u2019t bear his soul to the footballing public. And nor should he have to. He\u2019s a footy coach, not a shaman. But his detractors are starting to line up. To many, he\u2019s a moaner, the architect of a stodgy game plan, a coach who haemorrhages talent. One ABC columnist recently made him out to be the most miserable sod since Andrew Bolt. His defence-first game style has never resonated with the fan base. His decision not to play Rhys Stanley last Friday night was pilloried. He answers every question on the back foot. His Krakatoa act in the box is widely mocked. Those in his corner point out that his peers regularly rate him as the most difficult to coach against. They note that he has made do with virtually no high draft picks, yet manages to put his club in a position to contend nearly every year. Besides, they stress, it\u2019s not his fault the Cats finished top and drew the fourth-placed team in front of their own rabid crowd. It\u2019s not his fault that Gary Rohan missed a shot from 10 metres out. It\u2019s not his fault that Tom Hawkins, the All Australian full forward, kicked four behinds. It\u2019s not his fault his experienced players spent the opening quarter tripping over one another. Whatever your take, unlike the last four or five premiers, there has been no sense of destiny with this Geelong side. They\u2019ve never been totally convincing, never really caught the wave, never really had a hook. For eight years, they\u2019ve been the backdrop to some far more interesting footy stories. They\u2019ve been like the movie star burned in Gordan Lightfoot\u2019s three-way script. On Friday night, like never before in Chris Scott\u2019s tenure, they stand revealed. What exactly is this side? Does Scott simply not have the cattle? Or do they, as one footy writer wrote last year, \u201cneed to feel the blade against their skin before finally getting themselves out of football bed\u201d? Scott described the immediate aftermath to last Friday\u2019s game as \u201ca period of mourning\u201d. As always, everything is magnified when you lose a qualifying final.

      "bodyText": "New York fashion week came to a suitably dramatic end on Wednesday night at the Marc Jacobs show. Dozens of big name models burst from a double doorway at one end of the historic Park Avenue Armory building\u2019s 55,000-square-foot Drill Hall, one of the largest unobstructed spaces in the city. By the time they reached the audience at the other end of the room they had fanned out like multi-coloured particles, expanding to the tune of Dream a Little Dream. Models including Alek Wek and Gigi Hadid weaved their way between the audience - that included the actor Zendaya and director Sofia Coppola \u2013 seated on a smorgasbord of stools, benches and rocking chairs. For his spring/summer 2020 collection, Jacobs was in a reflective mood. His 2001 show had taken place the night before 9/11. \u201cIt has been 18 years and a day we will never forget,\u201d he said. The after party had been held on the Hudson, against a skyline that would be irrevocably changed within hours. The 2001 show can be \u201cseen in context as a tragically dazzling snapshot of life in New York before the world changed the next morning,\u201d said a Paper Magazine article quoted in this show\u2019s notes. At the time, many fashion journalists in town for the shows diverted to reporting on the attacks. But this show, like the one of 2001, was a \u201ccelebration of life.\u201d It was an exploration of iconic images, from \u201cthe genius of Karl [Lagerfeld]\u201d to the \u201ctimeless style of Lee Radziwill\u201d. The clothes were high-fashion meets Annie\u2019s Miss Hannigan, dressing up box chic that made for a maximalist whole and veering from 60s shifts to an 80s-style pinstripe powersuit to a Stetson. The American designer and former Louise Vuitton creative director\u2019s recent preoccupation with volume was lived out in extravagantly proportioned dresses in Kermit-green and hot-pink. A 70s thread, which echoed the \u201cflower child\u201d direction of Jacobs\u2019 2001 show, saw model Kaia Gerber dressed in a floor-length, statement sleeved dress decorated with florals enough to rival a Kew greenhouse. There was a pair of patchwork denim flares, wide-legged jumpsuits and a blouse with sharp, statement collars. Jacobs took his end-of-show bow, the signal that New York fashion week is over for another season, wearing glam-rock-high red platform boots. The inspiration of \u201cthe effortless coolness of Anita Pallenberg\u201d, an icon of so-called boho-chic, was present in the collection\u2019s wide-brimmed floppy hats, feathers and long, flowing dresses. The colour palette didn\u2019t discriminate - deep burgundy velvet trousers were teamed with a post box red jacket and there was a hat and jacket combination in Ikea-blue and yellow. The big-name makeup artist Pat McGrath, along with a team that included Jin Soon Choi and Mei Kawajiri, had been tasked with creating individual beauty looks - from metallic eyeshadows and voluminous eyelashes - for the models. In recent years there has been a lot of speculation about the future of the brand, with rumours of decline and possible closure.

      "bodyText": "Labor has accused Scott Morrison of \u201chiding\u201d behind the Australian Chinese community as the prime minister defends embattled MP Gladys Liu and rejects suggestions she is under Beijing\u2019s influence. As Labor targeted the government for a second day over Liu\u2019s links to various Chinese groups, Morrison accused Labor of \u201csmearing\u201d the Chinese Australian diaspora by asking questions about her background, while refusing to reveal whether the government ever received any security advice about her suitability for parliament. The sustained attack on the Coalition over the Hong Kong-born member for Chisholm came as the former president of the Victorian Liberal party, Michael Kroger, rejected suggestions the party had been warned by security agencies that it would be \u201cunwise\u201d for her to run for parliament. \u201cNo one has ever raised with me any security concerns about Gladys,\u201d Kroger, who oversaw Liu\u2019s preselection, told Guardian Australia. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone from Asio in my life.\u201d In question time on Thursday, Labor attempted to pressure Morrison over Liu\u2019s membership of Chinese organisations linked to the Communist party, and asked the prime minister to clarify whether any security advice had been provided. Morrison accused Labor of mudslinging, and suggested the opposition was \u201ccasting a smear on Chinese Australians.\u201d \u201c[Shadow attorney-general Mark Dreyfus] should take a good hard look at himself and he should have a good hard look at the 1.2 million Australians who will see exactly what he is doing to Australians of Chinese descent,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cJust because someone was born in China doesn\u2019t make them disloyal.\u201d But Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman Penny Wong said Morrison was the only person linking the \u201cspecific and serious concerns\u201d about Liu to race. \u201cThe prime minister is hiding behind the entire Chinese-Australian community to avoid saying why he has ignored warnings from our national security agencies,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is one of the lowest acts I have seen in all my time in this place.\u201d In a press conference earlier on Tuesday, Morrison said accusations that Liu had inappropriate links with the Chinese Communist party are a \u201cgrubby smear\u201d, but has refused to confirm whether security agencies have ever raised concerns about her background. \u201cIt is a ridiculous suggestion and I think it is an insult to every single Chinese-Australian in this country,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThe Labor party have to take a good, hard look at themselves as to why they are pursuing this matter. \u201cThey might want to dress it up as national security, but I think 1.2 million Australians of Chinese heritage get the point.\u201d Morrison said there was \u201cno credible suggestion\u201d of any inappropriate behaviour in relation to Liu, saying the speculation about her links to the Chinese regime were based on nothing more than a \u201cclumsy interview\u201d. \u201cWhat we\u2019re left with is just a grubby smear by the Labor party who is in one of their most desperate hours, unable to explain their position on anything and so they have gone after a Chinese-Australian woman, the first so elected in this parliament. They should be celebrating her election, not attacking it.\u201d However, Morrison refused to provide any information on reports that security agencies had flagged concerns with the prime minister\u2019s office about Liu\u2019s associates that led to a \u201cmeet and greet\u201d event being cancelled. He said it was irresponsible for Labor to attempt such a line of questioning in parliament, which it was expected to do again in question time on Thursday. \u201cAnyone who sits around the national security committee of cabinet table, anyone who takes the management of our national security issues and how we deal with security agencies seriously \u2026 always knows that you are never in a position to be able to offer commentary on inquiries of that nature,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThat would be to undermine absolutely the nature of the relationship between agencies and the government.\u201d Morrison said Liu\u2019s Sky News interview with Andrew Bolt on Tuesday night in which she refused to criticise the Chinese government was \u201cclumsy\u201d. \u201cShe is a new member of parliament and if that were the grounds for which people weren\u2019t sitting in the parliament, it would be a pretty empty place. \u201cThere are clumsy interviews that are given from time to time and on this occasion one was given by a new member of parliament.\u201d Morrison said that as a member of the Chinese-Australian community, Liu was linked to many different organisations, some of which might have conferred membership without her knowledge. \u201cGladys Liu is part of a community, she is a great Australian,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cWhat I am very concerned about \u2013 very concerned about \u2013 given what I have just outlined to you about her background, there is 1.2 million Australians of Chinese heritage in this country. \u201cThis has a very grubby undertone in terms of the smear that is being placed on Gladys Liu and I think people should reflect very carefully in the way they have sought to attack Gladys over this matter and the broader smear that I think is implied in that over more than 1 million Australians.\u201d Morrison said the circumstances around Liu were very different to those of the former Labor senator Sam Dastyari, saying she had not accepted money for personal expenses, nor advocated a change of the government\u2019s position on the South China Sea. On Thursday morning Labor attempted to escalate the pressure on the government over Liu by suspending standing orders to demand Liu give an explanation to parliament. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said Liu needed to explain to the House her membership of groups associated with the \u201coverseas propaganda arms of the Chinese Communist party\u201d. Liu\u2019s alleged ties to the propaganda machine linked to the Chinese government were first reported by the ABC, which revealed a Chinese government online record listed her name as a council member of the Guangdong provincial chapter of the China Overseas Exchange Association between 2003 and 2015. The association was an arm of the Chinese government\u2019s central political and administrative body, and has since been merged with the Communist party\u2019s propaganda arm, the United Front Work Department. In the Sky News interview Liu said she could not recall if she was a member of the group and struggled to answer questions about China\u2019s activities in the South China Sea. \u201cThis is a very serious matter,\u201d Dreyfus said. \u201cWhen this kind of extraordinary revelation comes to light, it goes to whether or not the member concerned is a fit and proper person to be a member of this House.\u201d The attorney general, Christian Porter, said the suggestion that Liu was not \u201ca fit and proper person\u201d to sit in parliament based on her previous membership of Chinese organisations was \u201claughable\u201d. \u201cThat is the sole basis upon which members opposite put the assertion that the member for Chisholm is not a fit and proper person to be in this place,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThat is outrageous. That is xenophobic and that is something that you should all be disgraced about. It\u2019s absolutely disgraceful.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Well, it\u2019s been... a day. As CQ-Roll Call immigration reporter Tanvi Misra put it: Here\u2019s an updated recap of today\u2019s US politics news: The supreme court ruled on Wednesday to allow the Trump administration to enforce nationwide restrictions that would prevent most Central American immigrants from seeking asylum in the US. As the president celebrates the highest court\u2019s order as a victory, other lawmakers and immigrant rights activists say the move could cost lives. Democratic lawmakers also slammed federal immigration officials for refusing to explain why they stopped considering requests from immigrants looking to defer deportation due to medical reasons. In a tweet, the president announced he will be delaying implementing increased tariffs on Chinese goods as a \u201cgesture of good will\u201d toward Beijng. Trump referenced his canceled plan to hold peace talks with the Taliban while speaking at the Pentagon\u2019s 9/11 memorial ceremony. It has been 18 years today since the attacks that claimed nearly 3,000 lives. Trump said his administration was moving to ban flavored e-cigarettes in an attempt to crack down on teen vaping. Trump reportedly pushed his staff to pressure the NOAA to back up the president\u2019s false hurricane claim. Trump dismissed the reports as \u201cfake news.\u201d The president has offered no clarity on what gun legislation he would support, despite meeting with a bipartisan group of senators on the issue today. Joe Biden maintained his lead in the latest CNN polling, but he has lost his double-digit advantage on the eve of the next democratic debate, which will take place tomorrow in Houston. Biden also leads among registered voters in the NPR/PBS NewsHour Marist Poll, but trails Elizabeth Warren among democratic and democratic-leaning voters. Tomorrow is the third 2020 democratic presidential debate. The Guardian will be liveblogging as the two top contenders \u2014 Warren and Biden \u2014 face off for the first time. Andrew Yang has also promised a \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cunprecedented\u201d surprise \u2014 perhaps a new look? The Trump administration\u2019s acting director of citizenship and immigration services further celebrated the supreme court\u2019s action by calling it a \u201cYUGE Win\u201d, alluding to Donald Trump\u2019s particular way of speaking. The highest court\u2019s order allowing the administration to enforce nationwide restrictions on asylum seekers would prevent most Central American immigrants from seeking protection in the US, and render ineligible refugees from Africa, Asia and South America who arrive regularly at the southern border. Meanwhile, politicians and immigrant rights activists are decrying the move. 2020 presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, who lives in and once represent the border town of El Paso, Texas, said, \u201cThe Supreme Court has put lives in danger.\u201d Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, who chairs the House appropriations committee on homeland security, said the court is \u201cjeopardizing the lives of coutless asylum seekers \u2014 innocent men, women, and children.\u201d The Trump administration policy restricting asylum would ban everyone \u2014 including children traveling on their own \u2014 from seeking asylum in the US unless they apply first in their country of transit. In July, a federal judge in California who blocked the policy said it was unclear that Mexico and Guatemala could handle the volume of migrants passing through their countries and process their asylum claims. The president announced in a tweet that he will delay increasing tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods from China by two weeks, at the request of Beijing. Because October 1 \u2014 when the tariff increase was meant to kick in \u2014 is National Day of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Trump announced that he\u2019ll delay until October 15. US and Chinese officials have agreed to continue trade talks this month. California lawmakers approved statewide rent control, to ease the housing crisis. California has the nation\u2019s highest housing prices and a growing homeless population. The new bill will limit annual rent increases to 5 percent after inflation. It\u2019s likely to be signed by the state\u2019s democratic governor Gavin Newsom. In February, Oregon was the first to pass statewide rent control. Maryland, New Jersey, New York and the District of Columbia are the only other states to have rent control in some localities. Donald Trump is celebrating the Supreme Court ruling on asylum seekers as a victory, tweeting, \u201cBIG United States Supreme Court WIN\u201d Congress has passed a bill that would permanently bar drilling off US\u2019s Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and extend a moratorium on drilling off Florida\u2019s west coast. The bill is now headed to the Republican-controlled Senate, which is unlikely to act on it. Still, the legislation is a strong repudiation of the Trump administration\u2019s plans to expand offshore drilling, from both republican and democratic members of the House . Coastal lawmakers from both parties oppose offshore drilling, fearing another disaster like the 2010 BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico. More from the AP: \u201cIf we don\u2019t act, drilling rigs could soon appear off our beaches,\u201d said Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., the lead sponsor of the bicoastal drilling ban. Cunningham won his seat last year in part because of his opposition to drilling off South Carolina\u2019s beach-dominated coast. \u201cThe Low Country (near Charleston, S.C.) is a force to be reckoned with, and we stand firm in our opposition to drilling off our shoreline,\u201d Cunningham said. Offshore drilling could ruin the state\u2019s tourism-based economy, \u201cruin our vibrant natural resources\u201d and harm the state\u2019s \u201cunique way of life,\u201d he said. \u201cDrilling off the coast of Florida would create an industrial coastline less appealing to visitors, hinder our military readiness and adversely affect our environment,\u201d said Rep. Francis Rooney, R-Fla., co-sponsor of the Florida bill, which extends a moratorium set to expire in 2022. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision today undoes the lower court\u2019s ruling blocking Trump\u2019s asylum policy in some states along the border. Groups challenging the policy in court say that it violates the US refugee act and the UN refugee convention guaranteeing the right to seek asylum to those fleeing persecution. In a scathing dissent to today\u2019s order, justices Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Sonya Sotomayor say that the Supreme Court \u201csidesteps the ordinary judicial process\u201d by overriding proceedings in the lower courts. Their dissent is also critical of the Trump administration: Once again the Executive Branch has issued a rule that seeks to upend longstanding practices regarding refugees who seek shelter from persecution. Although this Nation has long kept its doors open to refugees\u2014and although the stakes for asylum seekers could not be higher\u2014the Government implemented its rule without first providing the public notice and inviting the public input generally required by law. Remember when the Trump administration tried to make a rule that would essentially ending asylum protections for almost all migrants who arrive at the US-Mexico border? The policy announced in July held that any asylum seekers who pass through another country before arriving at the southern border wouldn\u2019t be eligible for asylum unless they first applied for projection in the country they passed through? A federal judge in California blocked the policy. But today, in a brief, unsigned order, the Supreme Court permitted the Trump administration to carry on with the policy while legal challenges are ongoing. The president, who has been floating Eugene Scalia as a nominee for labor secretary since July, has formally sent the nomination to the senate. If approved, Scalia \u2014 son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia \u2014 would succeed Alexander Acosta, who resigned over public criticism of his handling of charges against late billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Joe Biden is leading not only in newly released CNN poll, but also in the NPR/PBS NewsHour Marist Poll. Among all registered voters, the former vice president has the highest favorability at 45%. But Warren is a close second, at 41%. Among democrats and democratic-leaning independents, however, Warren has the lead at 75% \u2014 up from just about 50% in January. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump said his administration was moving to ban flavored e-cigarettes in an attempt to crack down on \u201cvaping.\u201d The president said his national security adviser, John Bolton, was leaving the administration because they disagreed on matters like Venezuela and North Korea, although Bolton\u2019s stances on those issues was well known when he took the job. (Trump also laughably said he hoped the two had parted \u201con good stead.\u201d) Trump referenced his canceled plan to hold peace talks with the Taliban while speaking at the Pentagon\u2019s 9/11 memorial ceremony. It has been 18 years today since the attacks that claimed nearly 3,000 lives. Trump reportedly pushed his staff to pressure the NOAA to back up the president\u2019s false hurricane claim. Trump dismissed the reports as \u201cfake news.\u201d The president has offered no clarity on what gun legislation he would support, despite meeting with a bipartisan group of senators on the issue today. Joe Biden maintained his lead in the latest CNN polling, but he has lost his double-digit advantage on the eve of the next Democratic debate, which will take place tomorrow in Houston. Maanvi will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. CNN is one of the approved pollsters for the Democratic National Committee, so presidential candidates can use it to qualify for the fourth debate next month. But a Politico reporter noted that the results didn\u2019t push any candidate closer to the debate stage next month. Joe Biden still leads the pack of Democratic presidential candidates in the latest CNN poll, but he has lost the double-digit advantage he held last month as the primary race has tightened. According to the poll, Biden attracts the support of 24 percent of Democratic supporters, while Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are virtually tied at 18 and 17 percent. No other candidate reached double digits. Biden\u2019s showing is still impressive, but he has slipped a bit from his 14-point lead over the second-place finisher, Sanders, in August. The poll adds to the evidence that the primary is currently a three-way race between Biden, Warren and Sanders. The fourth-place finisher, Kamala Harris, has slipped to 8 percent. This dynamic will likely weigh heavily on candidates\u2019 minds when they take the debate stage in Houston tomorrow. The top two candidates in CNN\u2019s poll, Biden and Warren, have never faced off onstage before. Democratic presidential candidates are denouncing the Trump administration\u2019s decision not to grant Temporary Protected Status to the Bahamians affected by Hurricane Dorian. Trump and the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Patrol, Mark Morgan, sent contradictory messages Monday about Bahamians receiving TPS. Morgan said during a White House briefing he thought it would be \u201cappropriate\u201d to grant TPS, while Trump seemed to dismiss the idea. Another debate unfolding on Capitol Hill revolves around how exactly House Democrats will define an impeachment inquiry. The House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, sparked confusion earlier today when he told reporters that Democrats were not conducting an \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d That comment flew in the face of arguments from the House judiciary committee chairman, Jerry Nadler. So Hoyer walked that initial comment back, saying he misunderstood reporters\u2019 question. \u201cI thought the question was in regards to whether the full House is actively considering articles of impeachment, which we are not at this time,\u201d Hoyer wrote in a statement. \u201cI strongly support Chairman Nadler and the Judiciary Committee Democrats as they proceed with their investigation \u2018to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the full House,\u2019 as the resolution states.\u201d But that statement also seemed to contradict Nadler\u2019s position, as a Politico reporter noted. Confused? You\u2019re not alone. House Democrats\u2019 messaging on impeachment has become increasingly muddled, likely in an attempt to appease the progressive and moderate wings of their caucus. But the strategy is starting to irritate even fellow Democrats, as demonstrated by this tweet from a former senior adviser to Barack Obama. It appears Trump was similarly vague on supporting a background check expansion while meeting with a bipartisan group of senators earlier today. Toomey, a Democrat, and Manchin, a Republican, were the architects of a 2013 proposal to expand background checks to gun shows and Internet sales, which was defeated in the Senate. Murphy, a Democrat, has been a fierce advocate for strengthening gun laws since the Sandy Hook shooting took place in his home state of Connecticut. Asked about what gun proposals he is considering after last month\u2019s mass shootings, Trump offered no clarity, surely enraging the Democratic leaders calling on him to endorse the House-approved background checks bill. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things under discussion,\u201d the president said. \u201cSome things will never happen \u2026 and some very meaningful things can happen.\u201d Keep in mind that this was in response to a question about whether Trump would support background checks on all private gun sales. So the president responded to a very specific question with an exceedingly vague response, which doesn\u2019t inspire much confidence about actually getting a gun bill signed. While speaking to reporters in the Oval Office today, Trump was asked about the New York Times\u2019 reporting that senior White House officials were involved in pressuring the NOAA to back up the president\u2019s false hurricane claim. \u201cNo I never did that,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI never did that. That\u2019s a whole hoax by the fake news media, when they talk about the hurricane and when they talk about Florida and when they talk about Alabama. That\u2019s just fake news \u2026 it\u2019s a fake story.\u201d But another outlet, the Washington Post, has now confirmed the Times\u2019 reporting, adding that the president himself pressed his staff on the issue. President Trump told his staff that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration needed to deal with a tweet that seemed to contradict his statement that Hurricane Dorian posed a significant threat to Alabama as of Sept. 1, in contrast to what the agency\u2019s forecasters were predicting at the time, senior administration officials said. This led chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to call Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to tell him to fix the issue, the officials said. Trump had complained for several days about the issue, according to the senior officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. Mulvaney then called Ross but did not instruct him to threaten any firings or make any punitive threats, officials said. He simply told Ross that the agency needed to fix the matter immediately, leading to a new statement that was issued Friday, Sept. 6. A Chinese woman who was arrested at Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s Florida club, earlier this year was found guilty of lying to a Secret Service agent and trespassing. NBC News reports on the bizarre trial: Jurors handed down the verdict against Yujing Zhang on Wednesday. Zhang was arrested on March 30 after she allegedly told a Secret Service agent guarding Mar-a-Lago that she was there to use the pool. Once inside the posh Palm Beach resort she told a receptionist she was there to take pictures for a United Nations friendship event. Prosecutors said Zhang knew that the event had been canceled. The trial had several twists and turns. The 33-year-old consultant from Shanghai fired her public defenders in June and chose to represent herself, a decision Judge Roy Altman did not like. He tried several times during the trial to convince Zhang to let her public defenders try the case but she refused. ... She was charged with unlawful entry of restricted buildings and grounds and false statements and was convicted on both counts. Oil tycoon and corporate raider-turned philanthropist T. Boone Pickens, who amassed a fortune and and gave much of it away, has died. He was 91 and lately had become an advocate for renewable energy. Spokesman Jay Rosser confirmed Pickens\u2019 death Wednesday to The Associated Press. Pickens made his first millions in oil, burnishing an image as a maverick, unafraid to take on giants in the oil patch. Even his name seemed to fit, like central casting\u2019s idea of what an oilman should be named. Starting in the 1980s, he became known for launching hostile corporate takeover bids that often resulted in a huge payoff. His fortune soared into the billions. Pickens flirted with the idea of marketing water from West Texas to the state\u2019s metropolitan areas. In a break from his past, he also developed wind farms. In an interview with the Guardian at the Dallas offices of his new wind turbine venture 11 years ago, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t get the idea that I\u2019ve turned green. My business is making money, and I think this is going to make a lot of money.\u201d A busy news morning and every chance the rest of the day will continue in the same vein. Here are the main developments so far: Donald Trump said his administration will propose banning flavored e-cigarettes over health concerns about vaping, especially among children. He spoke at an Oval Office briefing for reporters, with Melania Trump present. Gone John. Trump said of departing national security adviser John Bolton \u201cI hope we left in good stead\u201d after yesterday\u2019s sudden firing of the longtime Republican hawk, over policy and personality clashes. At a ceremony at the Pentagon to mark the 18th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks by Al-Qaida, the president repeated a dubious claim about time spent at \u201cGround Zero\u201d as the attack site in New York was known. Trump slammed leaders of the Federal Reserve as \u201cboneheads\u201d, in another attack on chairman Jerome Powell, demanding lower interest rates. More on Trump\u2019s tension with Bolton: the president said he bristled at the national security adviser\u2019s positions on Venezuela and North Korea. But those stances were well known for much of Bolton\u2019s tenure and, in the case of Venezuela, bolstered by the administration\u2019s own position. For example, Trump said, \u201cWhen [Bolton] talked about the Libyan model for Kim Jong-un, that was not a good statement to make. ... It set us back.\u201d But a Post reporter noted that comment came more than a year before Bolton\u2019s ouster. Alexander Azar, the health and human services secretary, provided additional clarification on the new regulation after Trump\u2019s Oval Office meeting with reporters. E-cigarette companies appeared taken aback by the White House\u2019s announcement, if this comment to a CBS News reporter is any indication. But some of Trump\u2019s former aides may use their influence to try to change the president\u2019s mind in the coming weeks, a Politico reporter noted. Minor correction: the White House does not appear to be trying to ban vaping entirely. The FDA is looking at banning flavored e-cigarettes, which are particularly popular among the industry\u2019s youngest customers. Trump has now concluded his Oval Office meeting with reporters, where he announced the planned regulation on e-cigarette companies. But the president touched on a number of other topics while taking reporters\u2019 questions, including the ouster of his now-former national security adviser, John Bolton. \u201cI hope we left on good stead, but maybe we haven\u2019t,\u201d Trump said. Given that the president appeared to fire Bolton by tweet and then Bolton almost immediately contradicted Trump\u2019s version of events in his own tweet, it seems safe to say that they did not leave on \u201cgood stead.\u201d \u201cJohn wasn\u2019t in line with what we were doing,\u201d the president said in explanation of Bolton\u2019s departure. But Trump emphasized he would not have trouble filling the job: \u201cWe have a lot of good people who want that position. ... We\u2019ll have five people who want it very much.\u201d Trump said he would announce his new national security adviser, his fourth in less than three years, next week. It appears e-cigarette companies will have some time to prepare for (and likely lobby against) the proposed ban. Trump noted in his informal announcement of the policy that the first lady has been passionate about the issue. \u201cShe\u2019s got a son ... she feels very strongly about it,\u201d the president said of his wife and the son they share, Barron. Trump is attempting to crack down on e-cigarette products despite the fact that several of his former advisers have gone on to work for Juul, one of the biggest suppliers of e-cigarettes. Trump denied he had any involvement with his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, pressuring the NOAA to back the president\u2019s false hurricane claim, as the New York Times just reported. Trump is taking questions from reporters in the Oval Office and said he would announce a new national security adviser to replace John Bolton next week. The president said Bolton \u201cwasn\u2019t in line with what we were doing\u201d and that his hawkish history was unflattering to leaders like Kim Jong-un. The health and human services secretary, Alexander Azar, said his department was currently finalizing the guidance on banning flavored e-cigarettes. The first lady, who was present for Trump\u2019s e-cigarette announcement in the Oval Office, tweeted Monday about the \u201cepidemic\u201d of the product\u2019s use among minors. Trump just announced in an Oval Office meeting with White House reporters that the Food and Drug Administration is banning flavored e-cigarettes. Michigan became the first state to ban flavored e-cigarettes earlier this month, falling in the footsteps of liberal cities that have done the same. Jessica Glenza reported a week ago: Michigan\u2019s Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer announced the state health department would immediately ban retail and online sales of flavored e-cigarettes through an emergency rule-making process. The move will prohibit the sale, and the misleading marketing, of flavored nicotine vaping products. \u2018I\u2019ve got teenagers at home,\u2019 Whitmer said on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe on Wednesday. \u2018I was talking with them about the prevalence of vaping in their schools, and it\u2019s everywhere.\u2019 Whitmer said she was concerned about fruit and candy flavored e-cigarettes being marketed to children as healthier alternatives to smoking. Trump appears to be planning to make an announcement about e-cigarettes any minute at the White House. At least three people have died recently as a result of a severe respiratory illness linked to vaping, Jessica Glenza reported last week. Officials are investigating more than 450 possible cases of a severe breathing illness among otherwise \u2018healthy young people\u2019, they said on Friday. Possible cases have been identified across 33 states and one US territory. Symptoms of the illness include vomiting, nausea, shortness of breath, coughing and chest pain. All confirmed cases appear to have a kind of non-infectious pneumonia, called lipoid pneumonia, developed when oil is inhaled. In all confirmed cases, patients vaped either nicotine or the marijuana constituent THC in the last 90 days. An estimated 9 million adults and 3.6 million US teenagers vape, including 20% of high school students. It looks like the president may be preparing to speak to reporters at the White House, so stay tuned. White House officials were directly involved with efforts to pressure the NOAA to affirm Trump\u2019s false claim that Hurricane Dorian was threatening Alabama, the New York Times reports. Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, to have the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration publicly disavow the forecasters\u2019 position that Alabama was not at risk. NOAA, which is part of the Commerce Department, issued an unsigned statement last Friday in response, saying that the Birmingham, Ala., office was wrong to dispute the president\u2019s warning. In pressing NOAA\u2019s acting administrator to take action, Mr. Ross warned that top employees at the agency could be fired if the situation was not addressed, The New York Times previously reported. Mr. Ross\u2019s spokesman has denied that he threatened to fire anyone, and a senior administration official on Wednesday said Mr. Mulvaney did not tell the commerce secretary to make such a threat. Quick reminder: this whole controversy stems from an incorrect tweet the president sent more than a week ago. If he had just corrected himself and left it at that, the White House could have avoided all of this bad press. But acknowledging fault isn\u2019t really Trump\u2019s style. A third former aide to John Bolton has announced she will also leave the National Security Agency. Reuters has more on the departures: Garrett Marquis, Bolton\u2019s top spokesman, Sarah Tinsley, his communications director, and scheduler Christine Samuelian all resigned in what a source called an amicable fashion. \u2018It was an honor to serve my country, and I wish the president and the administration success moving forward,\u2019 Marquis said in a brief statement. The trio of aides has worked for Bolton for years. Meanwhile, fallout continues from Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of his national security adviser, John Bolton. (Or did he resign? More on that later.) At least two of Bolton\u2019s closest aides at the National Security Council have announced they will also leave their roles. Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff said yesterday there would not be mass firings at the agency in light of Bolton\u2019s departure, but the former national security adviser\u2019s allies likely see little reason to stick around. Several Democratic presidential candidates have shared statements and remembrances in honor of the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. \u201cI was a sophomore in college when the planes hit. My roommates and I sat transfixed on a futon, glued to the horror unfolding on NBC\u2019s Today Show,\u201d wrote Pete Buttigieg, a veteran who served in Afghanistan. \u201cYears later, I would find myself carrying an M-4 in Kabul, Afghanistan \u2014 the country that had hosted the men who had conceived and implemented unimaginable attacks against other human beings. But in that moment I just sat there, stunned.\u201d Several other Democratic candidates expressed their gratitude for the first responders and remembered the attacks\u2019 victims. And Bernie Sanders used the anniversary as an opportunity to discuss his foreign policy proposals: A New York Times reporter who previously covered the rebuilding of the World Trade Center said back in July, when the president claimed he spent \u201ca lot of time\u201d at Ground Zero, that she recalled only one instance of Trump visiting the site. She also drew a distinction between Trump and the first responders who came to the aid of the attacks\u2019 victims: While speaking at the Pentagon\u2019s 9/11 memorial ceremony, the president also repeated his dubious claim that he went down to Ground Zero shortly after the attacks. Trump recounted how he was watching CNBC when the first plane struck the World Trade Center. \u201cI was looking out of a window from a building in midtown Manhattan directly at the World Trade Center when I saw the second plane at a tremendous speed go into the second tower,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was then that I realized the world was going to change.\u201d He continued: \u201cSoon after I went down to Ground Zero with men who worked for me to try to help in any little way that we could. We were not alone.\u201d Trump similarly said back in July, while signing a bill to fund the medical care of 9/11 first responders, that he spent \u201ca lot of time\u201d at Ground Zero. But Richard Alles, a retired deputy chief with the New York Fire Department, cast doubt on that. \u201cI spent many months there myself, and I never witnessed him,\u201d Alles told the New York Times in July. \u201cHe was a private citizen at the time. I don\u2019t know what kind of role he could have possibly played.\u201d Here is Trump\u2019s full quote on the canceled Taliban peace talks while speaking at the Pentagon\u2019s 9/11 memorial ceremony: \u201cWe had peace talks scheduled a few days ago. I called them off when I learned that they had killed a great American soldier from Puerto Rico and 11 other innocent people. They thought they would use this attack to show strength, but actually what they showed is unrelenting weakness. The last four days, we have hit our enemy harder than they have ever been hit before. And that will continue. \u201cAnd if for any reason, they come back to our country, we will go wherever they are, and use power, the likes of which the United States has never used before. And I\u2019m not even talking about nuclear power. They will never have seen anything like what will happen to them. No enemy on earth can match the overwhelming strength skill and might of the American armed forces.\u201d The president has just finished speaking at the Pentagon\u2019s memorial ceremony for the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. It\u2019s safe to say he likely went off the teleprompter a bit. Most notably, Trump invoked his scrapped plans to hold peace talks with the Taliban at Camp David. \u201cWe had peace talks scheduled a few days ago,\u201d Trump told the crowd assembled at one of the sites of the attacks that collectively killed thousands. \u201cI called them off when I learned that they had killed a great American soldier from Puerto Rico and 11 other innocent people ... The last four days we have hit our enemy harder than they have ever been hit before.\u201d One reporter described the audience\u2019s response as \u201cpolite.\u201d Joe Biden released a statement in honor of the 9/11 anniversary, saying the event \u201chas become synonymous with America\u2019s iron will to never bend, never break in the face of terror.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s also become a reminder of who we are as a nation and what Americans are capable of when we come together, united in shared purpose,\u201d said the Democratic presidential candidate, who was in the Senate when the attacks occurred. Biden concluded: \u201cThis year, on 9/11, we once more honor the memories of those Americans whose lives were too cruelly cut short, and we renew our commitment to upholding the best of what it means to be an American\u2014and to all that sets the United States apart.\u201d More on that Washington Post/ABC News poll: Joe Biden has the largest lead over Trump in a hypothetical match-up, besting the president by 15 points. Bernie Sanders holds a 9-point lead over Trump, and Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris both have 7-point leads. Pete Buttigieg has a more narrow lead over Trump that falls within the poll\u2019s margin of error. So overall, the poll is good news for Democrats. But pollsters and strategists are historically skeptical of general election polls this far out from Election Day. The Fed isn\u2019t the only thing irking the president this morning. More results have been released from the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll, and they show Trump trailing Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris in hypothetical general election match-ups. This two-part tweet thread continues several falsehoods, not to mention the derogatory nickname he throws in for Warren, so let\u2019s take them one at a time. First of all, as the blog covered yesterday, the Washington Post/ABC News poll is well regarded. It has an A+ rating from the polling and analysis website FiveThirtyEight. Second of all, the outlets\u2019 final poll before the general election in 2016 showed that Hillary Clinton would beat Trump nationally by 4 points. That was very close to the actual result, where Clinton defeated Trump in the popular vote by 2 points. (She obviously lost the Electoral College and the presidency along with it.) Third, there is no evidence that pollsters are skewing their results in an attempt to undermine Trump. Fourth, Trump has been campaigning since he took office. He has held campaign rallies consistently since his inauguration. Fifth, Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference is very much confirmed and is not at all \u201cfake news.\u201d Sixth, Trump has egregiously exaggerated how much Dan Bishop, the Republican who won last night\u2019s special congressional race in North Carolina, was down in the polls. It\u2019s amazing how many falsehoods can be stuffed into two 280-character tweets. Good morning, live blog readers \u2014 I hope you all take a moment today to remember the 2,997 people lost 18 years ago. Our president\u2019s focus seems to be drifting toward other topics this morning. While simultaneous celebrating his party\u2019s narrow victory last night in a North Carolina special congressional race, Donald Trump is lashing out against the leaders of the Federal Reserve as \u201cBoneheads.\u201d The central bank is expected to once again lower interest rates next week after doing so for the first time in a decade during its July meeting. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be appeasing Trump, who has previously complained that the Fed\u2019s chairman, Jerome Powell, supposedly raised interest rates too fast and then lowered them too slowly. This is very well-trodden territory for Trump. He has repeatedly lashed out against Powell to blame the chairman for the slowing US economy, even though the president\u2019s trade war has done far more damage in that arena. But this poll released yesterday, showing a majority of Americans expect a recession in the next year, is almost certainly on the president\u2019s mind, too. Trump is counting on a strong economy to win re-election. If he doesn\u2019t have it, he\u2019ll at least need a bogeyman to blame for the slump. Why not the Fed chairman? Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Americans across the country will recognize the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Trump and the first lady are attending a 9/11 observance ceremony at the Pentagon. Robert Wilkie, the VA secretary, will continue his five-day trip through Israel. The blog is watching all of that, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "A parliamentary committee initiated by the Coalition will investigate how porn websites can verify Australians visiting their websites are over 18, in a move that looks similar to the troubled UK age verification system. The family and social services minister, Anne Ruston, and the minister for communications, Paul Fletcher, referred the matter for inquiry to the House of Representatives standing committee on social policy and legal affairs. The chair of the committee, LNP MP Andrew Wallace, said in a statement announcing the inquiry that it was \u201cconcerning\u201d that people accessing pornography online did not have to verify they were over 18. \u201cThis is concerning, as research shows that accessing pornography negatively influences young peoples\u2019 attitudes to sex, sexuality and relationships.\u201d The committee will examine how age verification works for online gambling websites, and see if that can be applied to porn sites. Wallace noted that \u201cappropriately classified\u201d adult websites in Australia would not be the focus of the inquiry. Australia\u2019s strict classification regime would mean the vast majority of adult websites would be in the focus of this inquiry. According to the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference, the committee will examine whether such a system would push adults into unregulated markets, whether it would potentially lead to privacy breaches, and impact freedom of expression. The committee has specifically been tasked to examine the UK\u2019s version of this system, in the UK Digital Economy Act 2017. Under the scheme, which is not yet in operation due to delays in its implementation, websites must carry out age verification, and those that refuse face being blocked from access by internet service providers in the UK. The UK is believed to be the first in the world to implement such a system, should it come into effect in the next few months. The scheme has faced issues in its implementation, with the British government forced to exempt social media sites such as Twitter, Reddit and Imgur, which would otherwise be blocked for the adult content they host. There have also been concerns that the system would result in large databases of UK viewers of porn, which would be a privacy issue if the databases are leaked. In Australia, the Coalition prior to the 2013 election floated a policy of opt-out internet filtering that would operate in such a way where people would need to tell their ISP that they wished to access adult content in order not to be subject to the filter. The policy was quickly dropped when news of the plan was reported just two days out from the election, despite the then junior shadow communications minister Paul Fletcher endorsing the policy at the time. The previous Labor government abandoned plans for a mandatory internet filter in 2012. Eros Association, which represents the adult industry in Australia, said in a Facebook post it would resist attempts to follow the UK model for age verification.",
