Their latest album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/23/hot-chip-bath-full-of-ecstasy-review\">A Bath Full of Ecstasy</a>, is a kaleidoscopic pastel dive into house music and the halcyon days of rave, and earned them praise as \u201cBritain\u2019s best pop band of the last 10 years\u201d by this paper, made even more bittersweet, tragically, with the sudden death of its co-producer, Philippe Zdar, two days prior.<br></p> \n  <p>One word that may have not yet been associated with Hot Chip is epic, but their latest stage show, bathed in pastel light, feels like step up. It\u2019s perhaps easy to forget how many massive tracks they have, even if they don\u2019t have the top 10 singles to show for it \u2013 One Life Stand and Night + Day are by now anthemic, as much as Over and Over and Ready for the Floor, their breakthrough hits, which sound refreshed here on the Park stage.</p> \n  <p>Their new music, however, adds a new, more galvanising dimension to their sound. They bring out their Domino label-mate Georgia for the effervescently catchy Hungry Child while Spell - originally written for Katy Perry - is a spacious, sultry banger. Melody of Love is perhaps their songwriting at its best, about finding solace in joy. </p> \n  <p>There are echoes of the band\u2019s old quirks when they\u2019re joined by Morris dancers for the shiny techno chomper Flutes and by their old school friend Four Tet to play guitar on their slaying version of Beastie Boys\u2019 Sabotage \u2013 but this is a Hot Chip reborn, slicker, far slicker than your average.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d17ef8b8f080e8285151c94\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time

Gillies/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Two and a half decades in the game, Wu-Tang have undergone changes that would have probably seen off other groups. Deaths, falling outs and other assorted departures have winnowed down its original lineup, and their West Holts set is hampered further by the absences of Method Man and Inspectah Decks. Still sometimes compactness can be a virtue. </p> \n  <p>Certainly this a more spirited effort than their last appearance here in 2011, where Method Man\u2019s decision to turn up in his dressing gown spoke to the drowsy, half-interested nature of the performance. Here, despite the absences, RZA, Ghostface etc al are in a more crowd-pleasing mode, leading call-and-responses with the audience. </p> \n  <p>Deference is paid both to the late, great Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard, with his son (stage name: you guessed it, Young Dirty Bastard) tearing through Shimmy Shimmy Ya in his stead, and, inexplicably, Kurt Cobain, with a cover of Smells Like Teen Spirit. </p> \n  <p>The real highlights though come when they dip into their debut and \u2013 still \u2013 greatest album, Enter the Wu (36 Chambers), which somehow celebrated its 25th anniversary last year. Shame on a Nigga and Protect Ya Neck sounds as great as they did a quarter-century ago.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-29T23:18:43.057Z\">at 12.18am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d17e92e8f082364d7cf380b\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-29T22:44:16.708Z\">11.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">This year's headliners</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>So, a triumph for Stormzy on Friday, and the Killers managed to win me over tonight.

Making their name with 2013\u2019s Austerity Dogs for Williamson\u2019s stream of consciousness rant-raps set to Fearne\u2019s sparse, lo-fi beats, they have since developed their own knack for criticising the minutiae of daily life in Britain with cutting precision and skewed humour.</p> \n  <p>The fact that they are playing on Shangri-La\u2019s Truth stage seems particularly fitting then \u2013 caustic honesty being Williamson\u2019s lyrical speciality. The duo take to the stage with typical swagger and nonchalance, Fearne stood behind a lone laptop sipping a beer and Williamson hunched over the adjacent mic, spewing out lines like: \u201cGraham Coxon looks like a leftwing Boris Johnson.\u201d The crowd is sparse but hanging off of Williamson\u2019s every word, jumping around to rave-led tracks from this year\u2019s Eton Alive album like Flipside and Kebab Spiders.</p> \n  <p>This shouty soothsaying definitely won\u2019t be to everyone\u2019s taste, its minimalism too unvarnished to digest. Yet, Williamson is mesmerising, hip-swaying like Mick Jagger, high-kicking like a can can dancer and spitting venom like Keith Flint \u2013 his is a voice that certainly deserves to be heard. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-29T22:38:03.148Z\">at 11.38pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d17e4ad8f080e8285151c7b\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-29T22:25:28.545Z\">11.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mr Brightside</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And Johnny Marr stays on stage with the Killers for the song everyone has been waiting for.

I completely get why they\u2019re headlining, because they\u2019ve got some big songs that everyone knows, but I do wonder if Glastonbury limits its headline pool by refusing to countenance any hard rock ever. I saw Kiss in Amsterdam on Tuesday, and I\u2019m convinced \u2013 whether you like them or not \u2013 they have enough songs people know to carry off a headline slot, and they certainly have the show to do so. Though there might be issues when they demand the right to sell off the the first 20 yards in front of the stage to their own fans. Ditto Def Leppard.

Well, Elvana \u2013 a sort of cabaret-cum-moshy karaoke mish-mash of both, with sequinned twin backing dancers/cheerleaders and musicians in suits and bowties. The singer is in full hip-wiggle mode, bedecked in a white jumpsuit emblazoned with an eagle, completed with a cape, medallion and Kurt Cobain\u2019s distinctive red oval sunglasses. Except these are the distinctively crunchy guitars of the grunge kings that we\u2019re hearing, mixed up with the King himself\u2019s 50s classics. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are Elvana from Disgraceland,\u201d announces the frontman, whose name is unclear \u2013 Elbain? \u2013 before they run through Nirvana\u2019s In Bloom and School and then flip into a distorted rendition of Presley\u2019s I Feel So Lonely. Later comes A Little Less Conversation mashed into Smells Like Teen Spirit, in which the frontman surfs into an adoring crowd. It\u2019s idiotic, bafflingly brilliant and perfectly Glastonbury-shaped \u2013 there\u2019s a reason why they\u2019re playing three times over the weekend. Elvana manage to create something original and hilarious from time-worn songs that it would otherwise seem contrived to resurrect.

And so they did. The park was not busy, and they were the only object of interest to the monkeys, who quickly surrounded the car. The Driver pulled to a standstill, and the monkeys leapt on the vehicle. They started pulling at the fittings: first the trim from the side of the car, then the windscreen wipers. </p> \n  <p>Finally, the weekend\u2019s excesses caught up with The Driver, and he snapped. Ignoring all the park\u2019s advice, he opened the door, got out, and chased the monkeys through the enclosure. He caught up with the one who had wrenched off the windscreen wipers, and began wrestling the wiper back. He had reached the low point in his life. Still addled from the weekend, he was furiously fighting a monkey in a safari park. The wiper won back, he returned in triumph to the car, where one last monkey \u2013 a male \u2013 was astride the bonnet, performing an unspeakable act upon himself. And when he had finished, the lack of wipers meant there was no way to clean the windscreen.</p> \n  <p>The next day The Driver returned the car to the hire company. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of damage,\u201d he said, handing over a single windscreen wiper. The hire company, perhaps unsurprisingly, disagreed. A few days later, The Driver\u2019s boss received a bill for \u00a35,000.</p> \n  <p>There is a coda, though. A few days later, The Driver left the office for lunch, and his boss sat down at his desk, and began typing an email from The Driver\u2019s account, to Longleat, asking them to consider the distress of his girlfriend on having to see a monkey pleasure himself from just a few feet away. And a little while later, a reply arrived.</p> \n  <p>\u201cDear The Driver,\u201d it said, \u201cWe were disappointed to hear of your experience at Longleat. However, our monkeys are wild animals, and they behave as such. We warn all visitors of this fact. However, we would be delighted to welcome you both back to the park, and we will arrange an identity parade of our monkeys, so you can pick out the miscreant.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The Driver never went back to Longleat.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d17be8c8f080e8285151c1c\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-29T19:40:58.995Z\">8.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">My favourite ever Glastonbury story, part two</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Wolf turned around. Behind them, on the back seat, The Disco King had fallen asleep. With a lighted cigarette in his fingers. Well, it had been in his fingers at one point. Now it had fallen to the seat, and set it on fire.</p> \n  <p>Back to the hard shoulder, where The Driver and The Wolf woke The Disco King, and between the hapless three of them, they used whatever came to hand \u2013 cans of beer, jackets \u2013 to smother the fire, leaving the car a smoky hole, and the back seat half destroyed by flame. And they hadn\u2019t even reached the M3.</p> \n  <p>Dawn was breaking by the time they reached London. The Driver dropped off The Wolf and The Disco King, and headed home. At last, to sleep. He unlocked the door of his flat, desperate to get to his bed. But there was his girlfriend. \u201cYou promised me you\u2019d take me wherever I wanted today, because you don\u2019t have to have the car back until tomorrow.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cBut I want to sleep.

But at least his girlfriend would be happy.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d17be148f082364d7cf37ba\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-29T19:39:50.018Z\">8.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">My favourite ever Glastonbury story, part one</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>While Kurt Vile noodles away in the background, I shall take advantage to share this. It\u2019s long, so I\u2019m breaking it up. </p> \n  <p>My favourite Glastonbury story involves three minor functionaries of the music industry \u2013 we shall call them The Driver, The Disco King, and The Wolf \u2013 and a series of very unfortunate and sometimes illegal events. They had spent the weekend \u2013 this was some years ago \u2013 partaking very enthusiastically of all Glastonbury had to offer. Which made their decision to drive back on the Sunday evening, in the rented car The Driver had persuaded his boss to splash out for, all the more peculiar.</p> \n  <p>Still, they were very happy with their decision, fleeing the site before the flood from the car parks had become horrific, and made good time to the A303, the road from hell. As darkness enveloped them, the effects of the weekend began to take their toll. Suddenly they were jolted to attention by the sound of a massive smash against the front of the car.</p> \n  <p>They pulled over to the hard shoulder, and walked back. There, at the side of the road, was a dead deer. (I should say that in some versions of the story, it was a crow, and it was flattened against the windscreen.)</p> \n  <p>\u201cDo we have to call the police because we\u2019ve had an accident?\u201d asked The Driver.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do that!\u201d The Wolf said. \u201cNot like this!

But the truth is that she\u2019s been grafting ever since she released her debut album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/15/lizzobangers-review-lizzo-rap-pants-vs-dress\">Lizzobangers</a> in 2013. As she sweeps onto the West Holts stage at Glastonbury, a star in a cloud of glitter and chiffon, she\u2019s keen to remind us of the long journey she\u2019s had up to this point. \u201cLast time we played Glastonbury, it was 2013, and there was two people in the crowd,\u201d she announces. But now? \u201cThere\u2019s thousands of y\u2019all motherfuckers.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Fresh from a set on Thursday in Milwaukee for Summerfest, where she alleges that security staff \u201cslapped and manhandled\u201d her stylists in a racist attack, Lizzo appears more dignified and defiant than ever. Flanked by her Big Girls, delivering tirelessly athletic choreography in black leotards, and swigging from a bottle of Patron, she blazes through a set that includes her 2019 hits \u2013 the Missy Elliot-featuring Tempo, and the bass-heavy Boys among them \u2013 as well as older, would-be hits, like 2016\u2019s infectious Scuse Me.</p> \n  <p>As well as the back catalogue of an older star, Lizzo shows the crowd at every possible moment that she\u2019s a quadruple threat: a soul singer (she interpolates Respect and No Scrubs during the set), a rapper, a dancer, and a flautist, dashing off not one but two flute solos during her biggest hits, Truth Hurts and Juice. Some of her droll interjections might encourage you to add comedian to the list, too. </p> \n  <p>But what she\u2019s arguably most well known for, and what she brings to Glastonbury in spades, is her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/19/body-positive-rapper-lizzo-my-job-is-to-emote-and-communicate-and-bop\">gospel of self-love</a>. The crowd, who scream adoringly for such a long time at one point that Lizzo begins twerking to the sound, are eating from the palm of her hand as she instructs us to grab the person next to us, and tell them that they can do anything. \u201cI\u2019m gonna keep loving myself like its the honeymoon,\u201d she announces. Its clear that, however long she\u2019s been grafting for, this crowd is firmly in the honeymoon period with her too.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-29T17:52:11.579Z\">at 6.52pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d17a0658f081e8727350fb5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-29T17:36:56.911Z\">6.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The photographers are understandably in love with Janet\u2019s hair.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b92bc4d436ea5fe9f7cf8cf105808a184ce043c0\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b92bc4d436ea5fe9f7cf8cf105808a184ce043c0/0_0_3891_2565/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Janet Jackson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a8b77b1fdb805be8e865b23a4b9d2af3ece1868\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a8b77b1fdb805be8e865b23a4b9d2af3ece1868/0_0_1874_1250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Janet Jackson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd57abed93f5c2a529c51478487c1158929cfce1\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd57abed93f5c2a529c51478487c1158929cfce1/0_0_1847_3500/528.jpg\" alt=\"Janet Jackson\" width=\"528\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d179fd48f082364d7cf373a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-29T17:29:17.718Z\">6.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Forget Janet, forget Foals, because it\u2019s about to get Seriously Romantic over on the Acoustic stage.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BzTL5GxnP33/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

And then, with perfect comic timing: \u201cWell, you have come to the wrong fucking set my friends. However, if you like questionably chubby young men from Scotland to sing sad songs, you\u2019re in for a treat.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>And boy, are they sad. So universally so that they start to bleed into one another like the ink on a tear-stained love letter. Beats from Carl Cox\u2019s four-hour set in the Glade cut into Capaldi\u2019s more spartan songs like a mate telling him to cheer up. Had it been raining, as it so often does at Glastonbury, this could have been insufferably dreary. But Capaldi has such charisma, and such a beautifully burnished soul voice, that the majority of this set is engaging, at times moving.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/29/lewis-capaldi-at-glastonbury-2019-review-laughter-through-the-tears\">Read Ben Beaumont-Thomas\u2019s full review</a></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-29T17:04:52.156Z\">at 6.04pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d178ef68f080e8285151b21\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/laurencochrane\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-29T16:21:59.837Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Farm fashion, part four</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Mary-Ellen, 57, ex-nurse, campaigner</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d60b1898ded5f0394ba68ca6887c8912534b1ca\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d60b1898ded5f0394ba68ca6887c8912534b1ca/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018People don\u2019t approach disabled people because they are taught not to stare\u2019 ...

If you\u2019re not a fan, a little of it goes a long way \u2013 though none of the masses at the John Peel stage seem terribly concerned about that.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-29T15:13:27.986Z\">at 4.13pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d177b9b8f080e8285151abb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/laurencochrane\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-29T15:01:10.782Z\">4.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Glastonbury serving looks pt 3</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Millie Sandy, 21, textile design student</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d81caef5e9053af64b0639f0c2725a0b39eb2897\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d81caef5e9053af64b0639f0c2725a0b39eb2897/0_732_3000_3750/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I made the earrings using a fork!\u2019 ...

It\u2019s a beautiful thing!\u201d She\u2019s a long way from the corporate enormo-domes that the country star plays in her native US. Underwood says they had no idea what wellies were until it was suggested they get some just in case \u2013 and the crowd is initially a little sparse, a little wary of the sight of two fiddles and a banjo at Saturday lunchtime. But Underwood\u2019s rock bona fides start drawing in curious onlookers: on Cowboy Casanova, she pulls off a battering vocal run that makes its vengeful sentiment (\u201cYou better run for your life\u201d) even more brilliantly menacing; she punks up Just a Dream, and belts so hard on Blown Away that the veins on the side of her head pop. Plus, she\u2019s often found standing atop a black pyramid, contributing electric and acoustic guitar to her eight-piece band\u2019s brawny chug. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/26/carrie-underwood-interview-glastonbury\">Carrie Underwood: 'I'd put on a happy face, then go home and fall apart'</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>It\u2019d be easy to approach Underwood with preconceptions \u2013 blond, country, non\u2013partisan \u2013 but there\u2019s an unapologetic libidinousness (Last Name\u2019s lusty bewilderment about getting with a guy purely on first name terms) and femininity (\u201cYou can\u2019t cry pretty\u201d) to her songs that earns her a place in country\u2019s outlaw lineage, bringing the margins of women\u2019s lives into a genre that has, recently, sought to sideline their experiences despite them being foundational country touchstones. She looks beyond them, too: although Love Wins isn\u2019t exactly Relax when it comes to a full-throated celebration of queerness, in country terms it\u2019s something close to that.

The forward-thinking indie label celebrated its milestone birthday at Glastonbury last night by taking over one of its most beloved and secretive areas, the Rabbit Hole, complete with a crawl-through entrance (seriously, you are not allowed to stand) and dancers dressed as playing cards. As well as the Transgressive DJs keeping up the birthday party vibes with R&amp;B bangers and the occasional Fatboy Slim moment, there was an appearance from 18-year-old poet Arlo Parks, and a lively, very sweaty throwback set from the Mystery Jets. Unfortunately there was a slight dampener on proceedings, though, when at 3am a man dressed as a rabbit in sunglasses announced that the label\u2019s most recent and compelling success story, the experimental freak-pop duo Let\u2019s Eat Grandma, would no longer be performing. The weird and wonderful evening was a suitably joyful celebration of all that Transgressive have achieved in the past 15 years, though sadly missed an integral, shining part of their future.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d1761098f082364d7cf35a5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/laurencochrane\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-29T13:10:46.501Z\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">The best looks being served at Glastonbury</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Lauren Cochrane here \u2013 I\u2019m a senior fashion writer at the Guardian, and have been going round the site to find the greatest outfits and people who are managing to stay chic in 30C weather.

In one of the most face-palm clashes of Glasto so far, Hot Chip are up against Chemical Brothers as Saturday night\u2019s dance headliner, but no matter: they\u2019re already winning summer with flying colours. Their latest album, A Bath Full of Ecstasy, is a kaleidoscopic pastel dive into house music and the halcyon days of rave, and earned them praise as \u201cBritain\u2019s best pop band of the last 10 years\u201d by this paper, made even more bittersweet, tragically, with the sudden death of its co-producer, Philippe Zdar, two days prior. One word that may have not yet been associated with Hot Chip is epic, but their latest stage show, bathed in pastel light, feels like step up. It\u2019s perhaps easy to forget how many massive tracks they have, even if they don\u2019t have the top 10 singles to show for it \u2013 One Life Stand and Night + Day are by now anthemic, as much as Over and Over and Ready for the Floor, their breakthrough hits, which sound refreshed here on the Park stage. Their new music, however, adds a new, more galvanising dimension to their sound. They bring out their Domino label-mate Georgia for the effervescently catchy Hungry Child while Spell - originally written for Katy Perry - is a spacious, sultry banger. Melody of Love is perhaps their songwriting at its best, about finding solace in joy. There are echoes of the band\u2019s old quirks when they\u2019re joined by Morris dancers for the shiny techno chomper Flutes and by their old school friend Four Tet to play guitar on their slaying version of Beastie Boys\u2019 Sabotage \u2013 but this is a Hot Chip reborn, slicker, far slicker than your average. undefined Two and a half decades in the game, Wu-Tang have undergone changes that would have probably seen off other groups. Deaths, falling outs and other assorted departures have winnowed down its original lineup, and their West Holts set is hampered further by the absences of Method Man and Inspectah Decks. Still sometimes compactness can be a virtue. Certainly this a more spirited effort than their last appearance here in 2011, where Method Man\u2019s decision to turn up in his dressing gown spoke to the drowsy, half-interested nature of the performance. Here, despite the absences, RZA, Ghostface etc al are in a more crowd-pleasing mode, leading call-and-responses with the audience. Deference is paid both to the late, great Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard, with his son (stage name: you guessed it, Young Dirty Bastard) tearing through Shimmy Shimmy Ya in his stead, and, inexplicably, Kurt Cobain, with a cover of Smells Like Teen Spirit. The real highlights though come when they dip into their debut and \u2013 still \u2013 greatest album, Enter the Wu (36 Chambers), which somehow celebrated its 25th anniversary last year. Shame on a Nigga and Protect Ya Neck sounds as great as they did a quarter-century ago. So, a triumph for Stormzy on Friday, and the Killers managed to win me over tonight. What are the Cure going to pull out tomorrow? Part of me hopes Robert Smith \u2013 a QPR supporter, it is always worth remembering \u2013 goes full misery guts and does something like play Pornography in full, twice in a row. But the odds have to be on a setlist packed full of 80s hits, don\u2019t they? Hot Chip slip in some Jonathan Richman! It only makes me love them more that they put a snippet of I Was Dancing in the Lesbian Bar into Night and Day. BBC Two is now showing Hot Chip. I\u2019ll be off to bed soon \u2013 well, strictly, I\u2019ll be off to have my tea, very late. But I know what you\u2019re wondering: \u201cFor every major act this evening \u2013 except the Killers \u2013 this man has produced, as if by magic, an interview with that act. Can he do the same with Hot Chip?\u201d Damn right I can, courtesy of Jude Rogers. Jason Williamson and Andrew Fearne, AKA Sleaford Mods, seem to embody the radical politics of Glastonbury. Making their name with 2013\u2019s Austerity Dogs for Williamson\u2019s stream of consciousness rant-raps set to Fearne\u2019s sparse, lo-fi beats, they have since developed their own knack for criticising the minutiae of daily life in Britain with cutting precision and skewed humour. The fact that they are playing on Shangri-La\u2019s Truth stage seems particularly fitting then \u2013 caustic honesty being Williamson\u2019s lyrical speciality. The duo take to the stage with typical swagger and nonchalance, Fearne stood behind a lone laptop sipping a beer and Williamson hunched over the adjacent mic, spewing out lines like: \u201cGraham Coxon looks like a leftwing Boris Johnson.\u201d The crowd is sparse but hanging off of Williamson\u2019s every word, jumping around to rave-led tracks from this year\u2019s Eton Alive album like Flipside and Kebab Spiders. This shouty soothsaying definitely won\u2019t be to everyone\u2019s taste, its minimalism too unvarnished to digest. Yet, Williamson is mesmerising, hip-swaying like Mick Jagger, high-kicking like a can can dancer and spitting venom like Keith Flint \u2013 his is a voice that certainly deserves to be heard. And Johnny Marr stays on stage with the Killers for the song everyone has been waiting for. And yes, I do like this one. Actual goosebumps. I wasn\u2019t mad about most of this set, but the Killers are finishing with half an hour of intensely focused crowd-pleasing. This is brilliant on the telly, but it must be overwhelming in the crowd. Brilliant choice of guests \u2013 aside from Jimmy Carr, which was just a bit odd \u2013 and perfect songs for them to play. Great, too, to keep them on for a Killers song afterwards. Crikey. The Killers are pulling everything out for the closing stages of their set. That distinctive jingle, and we\u2019re into one of the all-time great British singles. And we don\u2019t even have to listen to Morrissey singing it. Brandon Flowers looks absolutely thrilled. \u201cAre we human, or are we dancer?\u201d Another song I have issues with, because my teacher when I was nine was called Fred Dancer. And this always puts me in mind of him. Blimey, the Killers\u2019 set is turning into therapy. Please let them turn this into the Always in My House version. Please. Do you remember when the Killers went all rock on Sam\u2019s Town? Neil Tennant was asked in an interview what modern groups he liked, and said he had had high hopes for the Killers, but then they grew beards. He\u2019s obviously forgiven them. Imagine how great it would have been, though, if Pet Shop Boys had joined Hot Chip to do Always on My Mind. That would have been mind-blowing. I had swapped to the mighty Hot Chip on the iPlayer. But I had the shock of my life. They appeared to be doing a completely straight version of Crazy Town\u2019s Butterfly. Then I realised I had the sound on the iPlayer off, but YouTube had scrolled through annoying American hits after playing Mr Brightside, and Hot Chip weren\u2019t playing Butterfly. Would have been a daring move. Oh, back to the Killers! Jimmy Carr has literally swept the stage and Pet Shop Boys have come on to do You Were Always on My Mind with the Killers! Really, mate? I\u2019ve got arms but I\u2019m not an army. I\u2019ve got a cat, but I\u2019m not a catalyst. I\u2019ve got a kit, but I\u2019m not a kitchen. I\u2019ve got a car, but I\u2019m not a carpet. I\u2019ve got a bed, but I\u2019m not a Bedouin. I have an absolutely visceral hatred of this song, partly because it was in heavy rotation on MTV (in the days when it still played music) when my son, the new star of British rap, was tiny. He would wake very early, and I\u2019d take him downstairs and the sound of MTV would put him back to sleep. But if I turned it off he would wake. So I heard this 429,000 times. And also because I hate the glibness of that line: sounds meaningful, but is completely empty. Here\u2019s the crowd at the Chemical Brothers. What with their continued success (and that of Underworld), combined with all the posters I see around London for back to the 90s nights, I wonder why no one has yet anointed a Dad Rave scene, to succeed Dad Rock. Mind you, both the Chems and Underworld are pretty ace, unlike most of the Dad Rock bands. Mr Brightside is currently trending on Twitter, with people demanding the Killers play it now. NOW! NOW! Look, if you really can\u2019t wait another hour, have it here. If Brandon Flowers got a decent English accent and learned to act, he\u2019d be a shoo-in to be the next James Bond, because good God, he can wear a suit. From a Daily Mail commenter. Food for thought, eh? Back with the Killers, who\u2019ve just been playing Glamorous Indie Rock &amp; Roll, a song that sounded mildly snarky when it was released 15 years ago, but now sounds like a tragedy, with indie rock\u2019n\u2019roll having been so completely denuded of any hint of glamour in the intervening years. Another Glastonbury story from inside the music industry \u2026 \u201cThe last time I went to Glastonbury (2007) it was another Chems year, and, in what can only be described as \u2018marketing\u2019, I arranged for some giant inflatable hands (as featured on the album artwork) to be erected by the motorway on the approach to the site. A man was employed to sit in a car in the field at night to guard them. He fell asleep on the first night, and someone came along and stole ONE of them. The hands must have been at least 20 feet tall and were firmly secured to prevent them blowing away, so a pretty impressive feat. Never found out who it was or what happened to said inflatable hand, I\u2019d love to know.\u201d Lewis Capaldi and Liam Gallagher. Top level trolling of Noel. I\u2019ve switched over from the Killers because they were doing their not very good version of disco, to the Chemical Brothers who, I think, are now headlining a major Glastonbury stage for the sixth time, which is more even than Mad Dick from the 1970 bill managed. They\u2019re starting in relatively restained fashion, with Go, from 2015\u2019s Born in the Echoes. But then the electronic percussion machine guns the crowd, everything goes wobbly and we prepare to lift off \u2026 And here\u2019s Alexis Petridis interviewing the Chems. By Laura Snapes, who loves her some geezer rock. We interrupt the Killers to bring you this photo of Slowthai in his socks. I await the fashion desk\u2019s verdict. My 15-year-old son is agnostic about Slowthai, but then he\u2019s competition. My son is working on his own career in the UK rap scene, both with his drill crew \u2013 look, don\u2019t @ me about that; I\u2019m only his father \u2013 the Dartmouth Spartanz, but also as a solo artist. He has one track on Soundcloud, but I\u2019m not going to post it here. He\u2019d be furious. As he explained, the rapping\u2019s too quiet, which was because he did it on a school night when he was meant to be asleep, so he had to mutter his rap into his phone to make sure his mum and I didn\u2019t hear him. Serves me right. I express my doubts about the Killers, do a quick search, and then find them doing something absolutely lovely. Wales Online reported the other day that, knowing Mike Peters of the Alarm was at their Cardiff gig, they played a version of Rain in the Summertime in his honour. That\u2019s a nice story. You\u2019d find it hard to argue that the Somebody Told Me hitmakers are anything less than ruthlessly efficient. And when you\u2019re playing to the biggest crowd of the day, who are there strictly to party, there\u2019s nothing wrong with ruthlessly efficient. But it feels a bit like being in music\u2019s equivalent of a mid-market chain restaurant. Yes, you know it\u2019s going to be palatable, and in the right company you\u2019ll have a pleasant time. But I can\u2019t get more out of it. On the other hand, Brandon Flowers is headlining Glastonbury, whereas I\u2019m a month away from turning 50 and I\u2019m sitting on my sofa liveblogging it. Shows how much I know. Blimey, the Somebody Told Me hitmakers are going for it early, opening with Jenny Was a Friend of Mine, then Somebody Told Me. At this rate they\u2019ll have run through their hits by 10 past 10, so they can get back to the hotel to watch the cricket highlights (Brandon Flowers has been avoiding the score all day). There go my hopes of a set entirely composed of songs from the eight \u2013 eight! \u2013 albums the members have made outside the Killers. Curry goat, rice and peas and fried plantain from the Jerk Chicken stall near the Other Stage \u2014 not the cheapest food I\u2019ve tried (and nor should it be, with meat involved), but one of my favourite so far. Slow cooked until it falls from the bone with the merest flick of a tongue, and aromatic as hell, it\u2019s very good ballast for the headline acts this evening; especially with a side of properly caramelised plantains. Might come back for a pattie later. Yes, the most successful Mormon pop combo since the Osmonds are about to bring the magic. But, I wonder, which of the Somebody Told Me hitmakers\u2019 songs is the one that resonates most with the crowd? Why, it just so happens I have an article here that addresses that very question. And here we have the pictorial evidence: Janet Jackson on a chair with Michael Cragg. Janet Jackson on a chair. May see if I can find my photo of Angus Young standing on a chair to have his photo taken with me. Here\u2019s Dorian Lynskey\u2019s review of the first half of this year\u2019s Glastonbury, for the Observer. Looking forward to reading this, by one of my favourite writers. OK, while I wait for the Killers, I\u2019ve got Bugzy Malone on the iPlayer, who has been addressing anxiety and depression. And is now bringing Wonderwall into his set, like Stormzy last night shouting back to Jay Z. A great year for British black music at Glastonbury, with big slots on big stages. Now, The Killers. I completely get why they\u2019re headlining, because they\u2019ve got some big songs that everyone knows, but I do wonder if Glastonbury limits its headline pool by refusing to countenance any hard rock ever. I saw Kiss in Amsterdam on Tuesday, and I\u2019m convinced \u2013 whether you like them or not \u2013 they have enough songs people know to carry off a headline slot, and they certainly have the show to do so. Though there might be issues when they demand the right to sell off the the first 20 yards in front of the stage to their own fans. Ditto Def Leppard. They could easily do this. And here\u2019s some further proof that, yes, there is moshing at Glastonbury. Here are some Mancunians for you! On Twitter, Jeremy Mortimer draws my attention to \u201cproper moshing\u201d, as tweeted by someone else \u2026 Here\u2019s proof Liam got his organ from the grocer. And here\u2019s Sigrid. Given her wardrobe, she was probably the happiest person in Somerset with the weather. What happens when you cross Elvis with Nirvana? Well, Elvana \u2013 a sort of cabaret-cum-moshy karaoke mish-mash of both, with sequinned twin backing dancers/cheerleaders and musicians in suits and bowties. The singer is in full hip-wiggle mode, bedecked in a white jumpsuit emblazoned with an eagle, completed with a cape, medallion and Kurt Cobain\u2019s distinctive red oval sunglasses. Except these are the distinctively crunchy guitars of the grunge kings that we\u2019re hearing, mixed up with the King himself\u2019s 50s classics. \u201cWe are Elvana from Disgraceland,\u201d announces the frontman, whose name is unclear \u2013 Elbain? \u2013 before they run through Nirvana\u2019s In Bloom and School and then flip into a distorted rendition of Presley\u2019s I Feel So Lonely. Later comes A Little Less Conversation mashed into Smells Like Teen Spirit, in which the frontman surfs into an adoring crowd. It\u2019s idiotic, bafflingly brilliant and perfectly Glastonbury-shaped \u2013 there\u2019s a reason why they\u2019re playing three times over the weekend. Elvana manage to create something original and hilarious from time-worn songs that it would otherwise seem contrived to resurrect. Here\u2019s hoping for Sinatras of the Stone Age next. In the comments, Lemon5 has a question. My bet, today at least, would be that after a day of blistering heat, no one has the energy to mosh. And here\u2019s an answer to my question about what it\u2019s like in the middle of the Pyramid Stage crowd. At Longleat, The Driver\u2019s girlfriend professed her desire to drive through the monkey enclosure. And so they did. The park was not busy, and they were the only object of interest to the monkeys, who quickly surrounded the car. The Driver pulled to a standstill, and the monkeys leapt on the vehicle. They started pulling at the fittings: first the trim from the side of the car, then the windscreen wipers. Finally, the weekend\u2019s excesses caught up with The Driver, and he snapped. Ignoring all the park\u2019s advice, he opened the door, got out, and chased the monkeys through the enclosure. He caught up with the one who had wrenched off the windscreen wipers, and began wrestling the wiper back. He had reached the low point in his life. Still addled from the weekend, he was furiously fighting a monkey in a safari park. The wiper won back, he returned in triumph to the car, where one last monkey \u2013 a male \u2013 was astride the bonnet, performing an unspeakable act upon himself. And when he had finished, the lack of wipers meant there was no way to clean the windscreen. The next day The Driver returned the car to the hire company. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of damage,\u201d he said, handing over a single windscreen wiper. The hire company, perhaps unsurprisingly, disagreed. A few days later, The Driver\u2019s boss received a bill for \u00a35,000. There is a coda, though. A few days later, The Driver left the office for lunch, and his boss sat down at his desk, and began typing an email from The Driver\u2019s account, to Longleat, asking them to consider the distress of his girlfriend on having to see a monkey pleasure himself from just a few feet away. And a little while later, a reply arrived. \u201cDear The Driver,\u201d it said, \u201cWe were disappointed to hear of your experience at Longleat. However, our monkeys are wild animals, and they behave as such. We warn all visitors of this fact. However, we would be delighted to welcome you both back to the park, and we will arrange an identity parade of our monkeys, so you can pick out the miscreant.\u201d The Driver never went back to Longleat. The Wolf turned around. Behind them, on the back seat, The Disco King had fallen asleep. With a lighted cigarette in his fingers. Well, it had been in his fingers at one point. Now it had fallen to the seat, and set it on fire. Back to the hard shoulder, where The Driver and The Wolf woke The Disco King, and between the hapless three of them, they used whatever came to hand \u2013 cans of beer, jackets \u2013 to smother the fire, leaving the car a smoky hole, and the back seat half destroyed by flame. And they hadn\u2019t even reached the M3. Dawn was breaking by the time they reached London. The Driver dropped off The Wolf and The Disco King, and headed home. At last, to sleep. He unlocked the door of his flat, desperate to get to his bed. But there was his girlfriend. \u201cYou promised me you\u2019d take me wherever I wanted today, because you don\u2019t have to have the car back until tomorrow.\u201d \u201cBut I want to sleep. I have to sleep. You don\u2019t understand the night I\u2019ve had.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not my fault. You promised.\u201d The Driver sighed. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d \u201cLongleat.\u201d Having driven all the way from Glastonbury, overnight, through flames and death, The Driver now had to get back in the burned-out car, and go back exactly the way he had come, back down the M3, back down the A303. But at least his girlfriend would be happy. While Kurt Vile noodles away in the background, I shall take advantage to share this. It\u2019s long, so I\u2019m breaking it up. My favourite Glastonbury story involves three minor functionaries of the music industry \u2013 we shall call them The Driver, The Disco King, and The Wolf \u2013 and a series of very unfortunate and sometimes illegal events. They had spent the weekend \u2013 this was some years ago \u2013 partaking very enthusiastically of all Glastonbury had to offer. Which made their decision to drive back on the Sunday evening, in the rented car The Driver had persuaded his boss to splash out for, all the more peculiar. Still, they were very happy with their decision, fleeing the site before the flood from the car parks had become horrific, and made good time to the A303, the road from hell. As darkness enveloped them, the effects of the weekend began to take their toll. Suddenly they were jolted to attention by the sound of a massive smash against the front of the car. They pulled over to the hard shoulder, and walked back. There, at the side of the road, was a dead deer. (I should say that in some versions of the story, it was a crow, and it was flattened against the windscreen.) \u201cDo we have to call the police because we\u2019ve had an accident?\u201d asked The Driver. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that!\u201d The Wolf said. \u201cNot like this! Get back in the car! We\u2019ve got to run!\u201d And they did. The Driver concentrated on the road, The Wolf beside him, chivvying him away from the scene of the crime. And then they noticed something. A smell. The smell of burning. BBC2 - Janet Jackson from earlier BBC4 - Foals and Neneh Cherry from earlier (but not at the same time) iPlayer - Liam Gallagher without his Parka iPlayer - Bastille (\u201cmust watch Glastonbury\u201d) iPlayer - Kurt Vile Next on - Courteeners, who could sell out Glastonbury themselves if it were just called Bury and held in Lancashire Next on - Jungle, the sound of the west London suburbs in 1985, and I don\u2019t mean that in a good way Next on - Bugzy Malone. And that\u2019s your current TV lot. I was watching the end of Sharon Van Etten\u2019s glorious set, but Laura Snapes tells me Liam dedicated Champagne Supernova to Keith Flint. Hey, can we all stop calling it Glasto? It\u2019s always been Nbury. And Sharon Van Etten is following Black Boys on Mopeds with Seventeen. This is glorious. I\u2019m a big fan of this kind of early 80s soft rock reconditioned for the 21st century. It\u2019s ecstatic and melancholic and makes you long for a past you never lived. Michael Cragg may dwarf Janet Jackson, but he still bows before her. If you are not watching Sharon Van Etten covering Sinead O\u2019Connor\u2019s Black Boys on Mopeds, you are missing A TREAT. \u201cChris Martin just admired the gong bath in the healing fields,\u201d according to Guardian photographer Alicia Canter. Back when he was still with Gwyneth Paltrow, my wife saw Chris Martin in the cafe at London Zoo with his kids. He was not giving them macrobiotic quinoa salads. He was giving them KP crisps. Bet he didn\u2019t tell Gwyneth that when he got home, the rascal. Over on the iPlayer, to the John Peel Stage where Sharon Van Etten is playing. Do watch: her most recent album, Remind Me Tomorrow, is fabulous, and the shows she did earlier this year were sensational. I hope I haven\u2019t missed Seventeen. And I love her turn of phrase. This, from I Told You Everything, is wonderful: \u201cSitting at the bar, I told you everything / You said, \u2018Holy shit, you almost died.\u2019 \u201d Laura Barton interviewed her earlier this year, and you can read it here if so you wish. Our own Michael Cragg and Chris Godfrey report that they were in a press group brought into the presence of Janet Jackson. They were not allowed to ask any questions. But Janet asked how tall Michael is \u2013 he\u2019s about 11 feet. I\u2019m 6\u20193\u201d and he towers over me \u2013 and then he made her stand on a chair to have her photo taken with him. And here\u2019s the Late Nite Tuff Guy remix of When I Think of You. Glastonbury has never been very good at keeping a secret, but even by its standards, the news that Foals were the Park Stage\u2019s secret set was spread ridiculously widely. Long before they appeared on stage the place was packed, bringing to mind the logjam that accompanied Radiohead\u2019s secret set here eight years ago. That Foals attract that level of attention will come as a surprise to anyone who still associates them with diffident mathiness, but what is clear from this muscular set is that they\u2019re very much a proper \u201crock\u201d band now, boasting big riffs and arms aloft choruses. Mountain at My Gates offers plenty of the former and prompts a frenetic most pit, while the irrepressibly catchy My Number delivers on the latter front. Foals are in the big leagues \u2013 the secret is out. Low are on the telly, filmed earlier on the John Peel stage, and it\u2019s rather more tuneful than Liam is being. And Alan Sparhawk\u2019s soloing is incandescent, in a skronky, Neil Young sort of a way. Who\u2019d have thought they would be hitting a career high, decades on? Shockwave, his newest single, perks things up a bit. But a fiver says the commonest conversation among those in front of the Pyramid Stage is some variant of \u201cDo you think he\u2019s going to do Cigarettes and Alcohol?\u201d OK, there\u2019s no way around it. That version of For What It\u2019s Worth was pretty horrible. An apology song delivered with all the sensitivity of someone excusing themselves for not doing the washing up by saying it wasn\u2019t them who had the bloody beans, so why should they have to scrape off the dried sauce from the pan, oh, all right, I\u2019ll put it on to soak, how\u2019s that? Happy now? Hmmm. Removing the electric guitars and going all mellow is rather highlighting Liam\u2019s issues with high notes, isn\u2019t it? Just so you can see what Liam is \u201cfreezing\u201d in \u2026 Here\u2019s a typically good value Liam interview, by our own Alexis Petridis, from last year. For a while it seemed as though Liam was going to be the new subject for the old joke about his brother \u2013 \u201cHave you seen Noel Gallagher\u2019s put out a new album to promote his latest round of interviews?\u201d \u2013 but he very much appears to be BACK BACK BACK these days. He hadn\u2019t even got to the end of his first song before people started assessing his set \u2026 Good to see him addressing the Parka issue, though. \u201cDon\u2019t wear the Parka, you\u2019ll die. Now I\u2019m freezing me tits off up here,\u201d made me laugh. For what it\u2019s worth, I think this is sounding agreeably brutal. Obviously, they bought the organ from a greengrocer, what with its slogan of ROCK \u2018N\u2019 ROLL. And he walks on to huge cheers to open with Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Star. Or ROCK \u2018N\u2019 ROLL STAR. He didn\u2019t carry out his threat to wear a Parka, but I bet he\u2019s going to be sweating like me at an all-pork buffet in that top. What\u2019s it like standing in the middle of the crowd at the Pyramid? When I went I stood way off at the side. It looks terrifying being in the middle of that many people \u2026 Clearly, everyone at Glastonbury is talking about the big headline set tonight. But will Hawkwind on the acoustic stage at 9.40pm be able to top Stormzy last night? And will it be even odder than their orchestral shows last year, with Mike Batt of the Wombles conducting? At the Palladium in London, a furious man behind me stood up and shouted: \u201cFrom Austria I came for this shit! From Austria! Shit!\u201d It\u2019s likely Hawkwind playing acoustically will be too much for The Man, so expect the BBC to pay more attention to the Killers (onstage at 9.45pm), and Liam Gallagher (7.15pm, though the live TV doesn\u2019t start til 7.30) on the Pyramid Stage. The Other stage brings us Sigrid (on right now), then the Courteeners, and finally the Chemical Brothers. There\u2019s Wu-Tang Clan and Jungle on West Holts; Sean Paul, Bugzy Malone and the brilliant Sharon Van Etten on the John Peel Stage; and Hot Chip, Kate Tempest and Kurt Vile on at The Park. But let\u2019s be honest, nothing can beat the 1970 festival. Mad Mick! Free milk! Can you, in all good conscience, listen to the Smiths in 2019, knowing what you know about the views of their erstwhile lead singer? It\u2019s a knotty problem, but Johnny Marr has found a solution. He\u2019ll sing the songs himself, removing the problematic aspect altogether. Job sorted. Sure, he can\u2019t quite match the croon of He Who Shall Not Be Named, but nor does he have a For Britain badge pinned to his lapel. Starting \u2013 fittingly \u2013 with Bigmouth Strikes Again, Marr rattles through a set peppered with Smiths classics. Inevitably tracks from his most recent album, Call the Comet, can\u2019t help but feel anticlimactic in comparison but a welcome airing of Getting Away With It from his Electronic days provides a helpful reminder that Marr\u2019s career doesn\u2019t begin and end with that other bloke. It\u2019s Saturday night at Glastonbury, for 170,000 people. And it\u2019s Saturday night on the sofa for me, Michael Hann, taking over from Ben and Laura as they go off to revel, and I finish off my Fruit Pastilles lolly and prepare for five hours of merriment. Feel free to tweet me \u2013 @michaelahann \u2013 with tips on what to watch on the telly or the iPlayer, and any observations. To a casual observer, Lizzo may seem brand new, suddenly experiencing her breakthrough moment in 2019. But the truth is that she\u2019s been grafting ever since she released her debut album Lizzobangers in 2013. As she sweeps onto the West Holts stage at Glastonbury, a star in a cloud of glitter and chiffon, she\u2019s keen to remind us of the long journey she\u2019s had up to this point. \u201cLast time we played Glastonbury, it was 2013, and there was two people in the crowd,\u201d she announces. But now? \u201cThere\u2019s thousands of y\u2019all motherfuckers.\u201d Fresh from a set on Thursday in Milwaukee for Summerfest, where she alleges that security staff \u201cslapped and manhandled\u201d her stylists in a racist attack, Lizzo appears more dignified and defiant than ever. Flanked by her Big Girls, delivering tirelessly athletic choreography in black leotards, and swigging from a bottle of Patron, she blazes through a set that includes her 2019 hits \u2013 the Missy Elliot-featuring Tempo, and the bass-heavy Boys among them \u2013 as well as older, would-be hits, like 2016\u2019s infectious Scuse Me. As well as the back catalogue of an older star, Lizzo shows the crowd at every possible moment that she\u2019s a quadruple threat: a soul singer (she interpolates Respect and No Scrubs during the set), a rapper, a dancer, and a flautist, dashing off not one but two flute solos during her biggest hits, Truth Hurts and Juice. Some of her droll interjections might encourage you to add comedian to the list, too. But what she\u2019s arguably most well known for, and what she brings to Glastonbury in spades, is her gospel of self-love. The crowd, who scream adoringly for such a long time at one point that Lizzo begins twerking to the sound, are eating from the palm of her hand as she instructs us to grab the person next to us, and tell them that they can do anything. \u201cI\u2019m gonna keep loving myself like its the honeymoon,\u201d she announces. Its clear that, however long she\u2019s been grafting for, this crowd is firmly in the honeymoon period with her too. The photographers are understandably in love with Janet\u2019s hair. Forget Janet, forget Foals, because it\u2019s about to get Seriously Romantic over on the Acoustic stage. And the secret Park set is... Foals! They\u2019re just kicking off now. Janet Jackson is burning through her set with an unbelievably tight band and set of backing dancers. If I Was Your Girl, Control, All for You, The Best Things in Life Are Free and more have all been deployed and we\u2019re only 30 minutes in. Massive bonus points for playing R&amp;B Junkie \u2013 one of her greatest deep cuts. Full review coming soon! I have never had a more welcome ice cream in my life. Vanilla and peanut butter and chocolate double scoop from Shepherds in the Greenpeace area, made with sheep\u2019s milk in Hay-on-Wye. Gloriously clean and light and under a fiver \u2013 next time I\u2019m going for the sesame and honey which is pure Ottolenghi genius in action. And maybe some other flavours too. All weekend, in homage to Janet Jackson\u2019s epic Control, we\u2019ve been asking punters what they would do if they were put in charge of Glastonbury. Most of their requests have revolved around water and shade. Proving that JJ is truly the one in control, she appears to have summoned a light covering of cloud and an extremely welcome temperature drop in the moments before she appears on the Pyramid stage. We stan a meteorological legend, etc. \u201cGlastonbury, do you like rock\u2019n\u2019roll?\u201d, Lewis Capaldi asks the sprawling Other stage crowd at the start of his set, as if about to launch into a rollicking Great Balls of Fire. And then, with perfect comic timing: \u201cWell, you have come to the wrong fucking set my friends. However, if you like questionably chubby young men from Scotland to sing sad songs, you\u2019re in for a treat.\u201d And boy, are they sad. So universally so that they start to bleed into one another like the ink on a tear-stained love letter. Beats from Carl Cox\u2019s four-hour set in the Glade cut into Capaldi\u2019s more spartan songs like a mate telling him to cheer up. Had it been raining, as it so often does at Glastonbury, this could have been insufferably dreary. But Capaldi has such charisma, and such a beautifully burnished soul voice, that the majority of this set is engaging, at times moving. Read Ben Beaumont-Thomas\u2019s full review Mary-Ellen, 57, ex-nurse, campaigner \u201cI like purple in particular and I sing in a choir where red is our colour so I have red roses on my chair. People don\u2019t approach disabled people because they are taught not to stare \u2013 having things like this on my chair breaks down that barrier. I have been going to Glastonbury since 2001 \u2013 the Green Futures area is the best place to be.\u201d Aaron Molloy, 33, musician and cafe owner \u201cThis is my ruff \u2013 I like it for the pow! My friend made it, things like this seem to follow me around. I will wear this on stage when I perform, but I would also wear it down Brixton market. I loved seeing Extinction Rebellion \u2013 I felt like I was in the 60s.\u201d Tony Myers, 61, works for the NHS \u201cWe knew the pier was going to be here \u2013 Glastonbury-on-Sea \u2013 so we decided a hanky and rolled-up trousers would be good. It\u2019s like Gumby from Monty Python. I make the gates at Glastonbury. This is the first time I have dressed up \u2013 people have been taking photos. It\u2019s good to know there\u2019s a place on the planet where you can wear something like this and know everyone else will be dressed up.\u201d As far as stage riders go, socks don\u2019t occupy the same legendary status as, say, \u201cfruit and flowers\u201d, or M&amp;Ms with all the brown ones taken out. But for permanently shirtless Northampton rapper Slowthai over on the West Holts Sstage, they\u2019re unexpectedly key: he chucks his socks and shoes off during his first song, but then realises the error of his ways, yelling: \u201cWhere are my socks? It\u2019s so hot I\u2019m going to blister my feet!\u201d Enter \u201cRick\u201d and a comedy sequence whileduring which the audience waits for said socks to adorn Slowthai\u2019s feet before he launches into a pulverising rendition of Drug Dealer, from his incisive debut album, Nothing Great About Britain. His set is full of quotable moments: \u201cShout out the K-hole, it\u2019s taken hold of me too many times\u201d; \u201cmMandem don\u2019t forget to make your girl cum, otherwise you\u2019re not doing it right\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m tripping balls\u201d; a singalong to Wonderwall that seems incongruous at first but isn\u2019t, really \u2013 his swagger and cheeky boyish charm are pure Liam Gallagher. It\u2019s goofy stuff \u2013 he\u2019s obsessed with the mosh pit, constantly telling the audience to make it bigger, and bringing on Loyle Carner to gee people into creating a vortex \u2013 but none of it quashes the undeniable sense that Slowthai is one of British rap\u2019s best new talents. Only the day after Stormzy\u2019s headline set, which marked a formative moment for British rap finally leaving its American shadow behind, Slowthai\u2019s relentless energy and restless creativity \u2013 raw and guttural, as in tune to punk and he is jazz \u2013 marks out the promise of excellent things to come. He\u2019s so boyishly charming that he gets away with playing Drug Dealer twice. The mosh pit is wild and unwieldy, reflecting the chaos that underpins Slowthai\u2019s blazing talent. Glastonbury\u2019s newest dance stage is a giant head filled with avant-garde club music. Here\u2019s a time-lapse video of it being built. Just when you thought Jeff Goldblum and his jazz orchestra (playing the West Holts tomorrow) had the award for strangest Glasto novelty act sewn up, here\u2019s a strong challenger. Fun Lovin\u2019 Crime Writers are a six-piece covers band made up of thriller authors, including on vocals one Val McDermonid. And you know what \u2013 despite all the self-deprecating gags made about \u201cmurdering songs\u201d \u2013 they\u2019re actually pretty tight. McDermonid, it turns out, has a decent set of pipes on her, barrelling through Sweet\u2019s glam classic Block Bbuster and doing her best Bowie on The Jean Genie. There\u2019s a playfulness in their song choices, too, with all of them on a crime theme \u2013 Psycho Killer and I Predict a Riot make appearances. Crucially, they don\u2019t outstay their welcome, even if the third encore appearance of Whisky in the Jar is a shade self-indulgent. Over to you, Goldblum! If it wasn\u2019t steamy enough at Glasto already, then the Love Synth Orchestra, playing the songs of Barry White, took it up a notch in the heat stakes. A star cast including Gruff Rhys, Lianne La Havas, Nadine Shah, jaw-dropping saxophonist YolandDa Brown and more joined an ensemble of players from the British Paraorchestra and Army of Generals orchestras, wielding synths and taking the bassy one\u2019s songs to a cosmic, joyful level. Shah\u2019s warm baritone lifted MyYour\u2019e the First, the Last, My Everything, as Gruff held up his customary signs, asking the crowd to applause at the right time and then to let out a holy roar. With so many players crammed on to the stage, it could have been a jumble but the result \u2013 led by conductor Charles Hazlewood, resplendent in a loud jacquard suit \u2013 was a gloriously uplifting take on Barry White\u2019s baby-makers. Via Ben Beaumont-Thomas: \u201cLewis Capaldi opened his set with a video of Noel Gallagher saying modern music is \u2018wank\u2019 and asking \u2018who\u2019s this Capaldi feller?\u2019 And then comes out dressed as Noel Gallagher in a parka. And then unzips it to reveal a T-shirt depicting Noel inside a heart.\u201d Who has just started on the West Holts stage. Caspar Llewellyn Smith sends this: \u201cSlowthai is immediately brilliant: after taking his white sports socks off, he complains that the stage is far too hot on his feet. Cue the comedy of trying to find where he put them and only starting again once he\u2019s comfortably clothed: straight into Drug Dealer and a huge mosh pit appearing in front of the stage.\u201d An eye-wateringly enormous crowd has amassed for Ezra Collective, the UK jazz scene\u2019s very own boy band from south London. It feels like a flashpoint for the movement \u2013 proof, if any was needed, of how it has taken root and continued to nudge overground. Ezra trade exclusively in good vibes, which is perfect for a sweltering Saturday afternoon. They use their platform to urge people to bring joy into their lives, and it doesn\u2019t feel contrived. \u201cToo much of the media is about negativity among young people,\u201d says drummer and bandleader Femi Koleoso, with the charisma of a younger Stormzy. \u201cAnd we want to be a beacon of positivity.\u201d Their set does indeed radiate warmth and a refreshing vigour: laid-back brass, delicate keys that twinkle like sunbeams and drums that bang like an old-school hip-hop track. Most of their songs swirl around a variety of black music genres that reflects one of the beacons of London diversity, Notting Hill Carnival: not just jazz but dub, afrobeat, jungle, grime and soul. Guests help to break up the jams: they bring out collaborator Jorja Smith for their single Reason in Disguise from their latest album, You Can\u2019t Feel My Joy, then Loyle Carner comes through for What Am I to Do, underlining how UK soul, hip-hop and jazz do not have to be mutually exclusive. \u201cWe wrote this song for the people who couldn\u2019t afford to pay their rent but still bought a ticket to Glastonbury,\u201d Koleoso says before set closer For Pablo, a spiritual Fela Kuti-indebted party jam, which is what they do best. Boundaries feel like they\u2019re being broken, not just in terms of ridding jazz if its stuffy image but also in terms of the lines between genres dissolving: Ezra aren\u2019t just one of the best new UK jazz bands \u2013 they\u2019re one of the UK\u2019s best new bands full-stop. Lottie, 25: \u201cI\u2019d run an actual train along the train tracks so people can get to stages faster. There\u2019s no shelter too \u2013 I\u2019d plant some nice acacia trees to provide shade, otherwise everyone is getting burnt to a crisp. For the music, I\u2019d have Bruce Springsteen headlining every single day because he\u2019s the Boss!\u201d \u201cNot vegan \u2013 but from a Dartmoor farm that\u2019s part of the Farm Wilder wildlife-friendly sustainable agriculture scheme, so I thought it was probably allowed. Made from 28-day aged rib-eye cap pasture-fed beef, with Somerset cheddar and proper crispy bacon, Nelly\u2019s Barn Burgers near the Park also do (soya-based) vegan burgers if that\u2019s your thing. If it isn\u2019t though, try this.\u201d Even in this age of streaming-assisted overnight megastardom, it seems more than a little remarkable that an unsigned artist \u2013 who released his debut album after crowdfunding the cost of production \u2013 has not only earned a plum afternoon slot on one of Glastonbury\u2019s biggest stages but packed it out to such a degree that thousands of fans are stuck outside. It\u2019s possibly the most oversubscribed gig at the John Peel tent since the Killers played a secret set here in 2017. And given they\u2019re headliners this time around, you get a sense of the exalted company the Glasgow singer-songwriter born Gerry Crosbie finds himself in these days. \u201cIt\u2019s a wee revolution starting,\u201d he says. Still, if it is a revolution, it\u2019s one built on pretty traditional foundations. Crosbie\u2019s brand of optimistic pop-folk feels almost cynical in its mass appeal: relentlessly major key and full of shout-along choruses that seem geared towards festival singalongs and home insurance ads. If you\u2019re not a fan, a little of it goes a long way \u2013 though none of the masses at the John Peel stage seem terribly concerned about that. Millie Sandy, 21, textile design student \u201cI got such bad sunburn yesterday and this dress is really good for this weather. I found the hat in a charity shop and I made the earrings using a fork! I was looking forward to seeing Tame Impala - I had seen them once before but I was quite drunk.\u201d Christy and Antonio Fadden, 9 and 7. Christy and Antonio\u2019s mum: \u201cWe came from Northern Ireland \u2013 the boat landed at 6.30am on Friday so we have only just got here really. They wanted to have different colours because they\u2019re not the same. They\u2019ll have it \u2019til September when they go back to school.\u201d Richard Hembling, 36, Formula 1 cameraman \u201cI had a similar pair of trousers when I came two years ago. I like getting in the festival spirit and my mum always told me it was better to seen to be safe. This is my second time. It was good enough to miss work \u2013 I would have been in Austria this weekend.\u201d Greenpeace have already run out of their homemade Marmite produced from brewing waste (which I thought Marmite was made from anyway, but could be wrong \u2013 I only eat the stuff by the gallon) \u2013 however, they are selling a really superb root and kale crisp (bear with me) bap on fresh sourdough to make up for this salty disappointment. The crisps are fried in olive oil, which came all the way from Spain on a sailing boat \u2013 very Leonard Cohen, but also very delicious. Recommend when the temperature drops below 30C. It\u2019s a packed Left Field tent for a panel called How to Save Our Planet (no pressure!), with Caroline Lucas in particular given a rock-star welcome. Chaired by the Guardian\u2019s own John Harris, fellow panellists are Clive Lewis, 16-year-old activist George Bond, Minnie Rahman of Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants and Barbara from the excellently named Fracking Nannas (\u201cIf I can get involved in activism in my late 50s, anyone can\u201d). It\u2019s possible that the large turnout is down to the stifling heat (the climate crisischange, guys) pushing people into the respite of the shade \u2013 I spot a few weary nappers \u2013 but more likely it is because climate activism has blown up in big way in the last year. The sense of urgency seems to have cut through, as we\u2019ve seen with Extinction Rebellion (who marched to the Stone Circle yesterday). The vibe is mostly positive and optimistic. Someone asks a question on how we can help move away from the doom-and-gloom narrative in general \u2013 but important points are made by Rahman and Lewis in particular about how social justice, racial justice and climate justice are linkedconnected. George and Barbara are inspiration detailing their direct action. Lucas talks the Green New Deal, and a mention of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is greeted with a huge cheer. George throws out a date to remember: the on 20th September, he says, there will be \u201cthe largest climate demonstration this country\u2019s has ever seen. It\u2019s gonna be huge, it\u2019s gonna be beautiful, but it\u2019s also gonna be filled with anger and rage that nothing has been done.\u201d Mark it in the calendar. And she had some excellent facial expressions. It\u2019s T-two hours (I have no idea what T stands for in this equation) until Janet Jackson graces the main stage, and Glastonbury\u2019s punters have more ideas about what they\u2019d do if they were put in charge. At this stage on a sweltering Saturday afternoon, when everyone\u2019s body feels like a fleshy rockery covered in dozens of tiny sweat waterfalls, it\u2019s no surprise that they mostly concern water, whether for washing or guzzling. Alex: \u201cI\u2019d to see Nicolas Jaar on the Pyramid stage playing a really full-on set. And a deadly water slide.\u201d Jon: \u201cI\u2019d give everyone free leg rubdowns at 4am. Lower back massages for all. And a massive slip and slide.\u201d Kerry: \u201cI\u2019d make more facilities for toilets and I\u2019d have Coldplay headline every year. I know Chris Martin came on with Stormzy last night, but unfortunately we were up at Shangri-La. People should be going around with ice and water.\u201d Frank: \u201cLike at a race course. And more shaded seating areas. Fleetwood Mac is our shared dream headliner.\u201d Connie: \u201cI would have better toilets and more water stations so that there\u2019s less queues everywhere. More stalls for things like milk on your way back to the campsites. My dream headliner would be Ariana Grande. She doesn\u2019t do that many performances in England and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s been to Glastonbury.\u201d Felicity Cloake\u2019s food tour: pukka pakoras Vegetable pakora at the Permaculture Cafe \u2013 \u201cthe only food grown and eaten on site\u201d and cooked on a wood fire, served with green tomato chutney and kimchi. Crunchy and packed with veg, this is definitely the best \u00a33 we\u2019ve spent so far, but go early because apparently later the queues are enormous (though I\u2019m sure they\u2019re very chilled out). Ben Randm, 35, standup comedian \u201cThis outfit is about bringing Tame Impala joy to life. I like leopard because it\u2019s lairy. I like the robe because it\u2019s shamanic. Inclusivity, that\u2019s what it is all about. I\u2019m practical, too \u2013 these scarves aren\u2019t just scarves, they\u2019re wristbands to wipe my forehead.\u201d Tom Shepherd, 16, school-leaver \u201cI have seen quite a few of these hats, some with a mohawk. I liked the horns, and the Jack Daniels logo. I bought it here, and the sunglasses, too. I have been to Glastonbury the last four times. I don\u2019t dress like this normally \u2013 I usually wear dark things. My favourite band is AC/DC \u2013 my dad is into them.\u201d That stab-proof vest that Stormzy wore on stage last night? Designed by Banksy, it turns out. Comedians, musicians and friends of Jeremy Hardy gathered to celebrate the late comic and Glastonbury regular in a special event this lunchtime. Appearing in Hardy\u2019s customary early afternoon slot at the Cabaret tent, performers including Mark Steel, Seann Walsh, Katherine Williams and Billy Bragg performed standup, songs and stories in memory of Hardy, who died earlier this year after a battle with of cancer. The tone was celebratory rather than funereal, with plenty of pointed digs aimed at the current Conservative leadership campaign. Hardy, a staunch supporter of the Labour party and Jeremy Corbyn, was known for lending his comedy a strong activist bent both on stage and on Radio 4 panels shows such as Just a Minute. Yet, as political comedian Steel, a close friend said, Hardy wanted to change the world and have fun doing it. That sense of mischief was underlined by a clip of Hardy performing Leonard Cohen\u2019s Hallelujah in the style of George Formby. As the tribute concluded, Steel led the audience in a chorus of his tweaked version of the Corbyn chant that took the festival by storm two years ago. \u201cOh Jeremy Hardy,\u201d he sang, prompting what will surely turn out to be one of the most rousing singalongs of the weekend. Glastonbury have put out a statement about reports concerning water shortages at this year\u2019s festivals \u2013 after showers have been temporarily shut off across the site. There is not a water shortage at this year\u2019s Glastonbury. Our supply is running as normal. As always in hot weather, demand for water has increased, so we have put in place the usual restrictions on staff/guest showers and the limited number of public showers. We have more than 850 taps on site, all of which provide free drinking water. These taps all have a ready supply of water. All bars are also offering free tap water. And although we no longer sell water in single-use bottles, all of our food traders are selling both water and soft drink in cans. There is also not a shortage of this canned water, which is available for those who wish to purchase it. Water is also being given out from our Iinfo points and we have roving teams providing water from backpacks. So far, the on-site ambulance control have had just 27 heat-related calls for assistance, covering the 200,000+-plus people on site. There may be queues for taps at some of the busier places, so we ask everyone to be patient and to look for taps in quieter areas of the site. Thank you. Here\u2019s some more superfans down the front of the Pyramid stage, enduring the heat to get up close and personal with their faves. Antony \u201cI\u2019m a massive Janet Jackson fan. This is my fourth Glastonbury and I was so excited when they announced that she was playing because I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get a chance to see her again. She clashes with Lizzo, which is a tough choice to make, but it\u2019s got to be Janet. I\u2019ve got my water, I\u2019ve eaten \u2013 now just for That\u2019s the Way Love Goes. Tony and Jo \u201cWe\u2019re going to be right at the front for Janet, Kylie and Miley. We love it camped out here stage-side \u2013 we\u2019ve done it for Foo Fighters, Coldplay and Ed Sheeran, and they were some of the best shows I\u2019ve ever seen. With older acts like Janet, you never quite know what you\u2019re going to get but we\u2019re hoping she\u2019ll smash it just like Barry Gibb did a couple of years ago.\u201d Next up to play I\u2019m in Control, where we ask Glastonbury-goers what they would do if they were in charge, is Corinne. \u201cIn general, I\u2019d love there to be more showers, there aren\u2019t any in the general camping areas [the festival says it is limiting shower access to conserve water today]. Also, more water stations would be handy, and maybe more sheltered areas for the sun or the rain. I can\u2019t really think of a headliner \u2026 Actually, I\u2019d love for Madonna to do it. I heard a rumour she was going to do it this year, so I\u2019d love her to do it in 2020.\u201d Carrie Underwood is having her mind blown at the Pyramid stage. \u201cI have never seen event security pass out water to people before. It\u2019s a beautiful thing!\u201d She\u2019s a long way from the corporate enormo-domes that the country star plays in her native US. Underwood says they had no idea what wellies were until it was suggested they get some just in case \u2013 and the crowd is initially a little sparse, a little wary of the sight of two fiddles and a banjo at Saturday lunchtime. But Underwood\u2019s rock bona fides start drawing in curious onlookers: on Cowboy Casanova, she pulls off a battering vocal run that makes its vengeful sentiment (\u201cYou better run for your life\u201d) even more brilliantly menacing; she punks up Just a Dream, and belts so hard on Blown Away that the veins on the side of her head pop. Plus, she\u2019s often found standing atop a black pyramid, contributing electric and acoustic guitar to her eight-piece band\u2019s brawny chug. It\u2019d be easy to approach Underwood with preconceptions \u2013 blond, country, non\u2013partisan \u2013 but there\u2019s an unapologetic libidinousness (Last Name\u2019s lusty bewilderment about getting with a guy purely on first name terms) and femininity (\u201cYou can\u2019t cry pretty\u201d) to her songs that earns her a place in country\u2019s outlaw lineage, bringing the margins of women\u2019s lives into a genre that has, recently, sought to sideline their experiences despite them being foundational country touchstones. She looks beyond them, too: although Love Wins isn\u2019t exactly Relax when it comes to a full-throated celebration of queerness, in country terms it\u2019s something close to that. Also she chucks in a verse from George Michael\u2019s Freedom 90, which turns out to make an excellent country rager. Our photographer David Levene was at the side of the stage for Jorja Smith\u2019s West Holts set, and got some beautiful shots. What better way to celebrate 15 years of Transgressive Records than burrowing down a rabbit hole? The forward-thinking indie label celebrated its milestone birthday at Glastonbury last night by taking over one of its most beloved and secretive areas, the Rabbit Hole, complete with a crawl-through entrance (seriously, you are not allowed to stand) and dancers dressed as playing cards. As well as the Transgressive DJs keeping up the birthday party vibes with R&amp;B bangers and the occasional Fatboy Slim moment, there was an appearance from 18-year-old poet Arlo Parks, and a lively, very sweaty throwback set from the Mystery Jets. Unfortunately there was a slight dampener on proceedings, though, when at 3am a man dressed as a rabbit in sunglasses announced that the label\u2019s most recent and compelling success story, the experimental freak-pop duo Let\u2019s Eat Grandma, would no longer be performing. The weird and wonderful evening was a suitably joyful celebration of all that Transgressive have achieved in the past 15 years, though sadly missed an integral, shining part of their future. Lauren Cochrane here \u2013 I\u2019m a senior fashion writer at the Guardian, and have been going round the site to find the greatest outfits and people who are managing to stay chic in 30C weather. First up: Laura Murray, 25, who works for British Heart Foundation. \u201cThis dress is from the 70s \u2013 when I scored it from eBay I did a little celebratory dance. I like things that are a bit retro, and I think the clown hat will help me blend in with the Circus field. This is an exaggerated version of what I wear away from Glastonbury, but I always like to reuse clothes \u2013 and save the planet that way.\u201d Next up is 27-year-old marine pilot Josh Clerk. \u201cThe outfit felt natural today \u2013 I let my inner animal out. It\u2019s very comfortable, too. Is leopard a trend? It\u2019s one I am setting. I have never been to Glastonbury before. There is something for everyone, and you can be as weird as you like.\u201d More fabulousness to come later on the liveblog \u2026 In a particularly low period in the late noughties, I had a pulled-pork burrito loaded up with guacamole and sour cream every Friday as a treat. Then I quit my job and gave up burritos for at least a decade. On the plus side, this vegan BBQ pulled-jackfruit number from Club Mexicana is unlikely to impede my recovery, because it tastes so healthy it\u2019s almost like eating a salad wrap \u2013 but something a bit salty and spicy and fatty in there wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss to balance that tangy, sweet BBQ sauce. Not pork though, obviously. I\u2019ve been down the front of the Pyramid stage, where people are planning to stay all day \u2013 in this heat! \u2013 to ensure a perfect view of their favourite artists. First up is Janet Jackson fan Matt. \u201cI\u2019m here for Janet Jackson; I absolutely love her and have always listened to her music. I\u2019ve been to Glastonbury many, many times and I try to get to the front a lot as nothing compares to being that close and personal with these superstars \u2013 you can almost touch them. I was here yesterday too and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\u201d Christine \u201cThis is my first Glastonbury and I\u2019m so excited for the Killers and Janet Jackson. I used to listen to Janet when I was younger so her set will bring back some special memories I\u2019m sure. The Killers are a fantastic band too \u2013 I\u2019m here for the Mr Brightside singalong and then I have to go back to my job at the medical tent at midnight. At least with that in my head it\u2019ll keep me energised!\u201d While the chief put sunshine on the Pyramid stage, the Reid twins knocked out a Joyful Kilmarnock Blues you could have heard in Ayrshire. There was some banter, but not too much; there were some solos but they didn\u2019t overdo it. This was a slick, blast-through of the big numbers as the crowd sweltered, swayed, leapt and danced in the midday heat. I\u2019m On My Way was an irresistible singalong, Sunshine on Leith was the heartbreaking highlight and I\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles) ended a knockout 45-minute slot. The Scottish fans were in raptures: What could be more ideal at a baking Glastonbury than a nice trip to the beach? This year the festival\u2019s unveiled a 70-metre-long pier called Glastonbury-on-Sea, only, well, there\u2019s no water to cool down in and from a distance it looks a chance to show off some high-grade decking. For non-wood enthusiasts, it also represents the opportunity to be transported to any gloriously tacky seaside town, apparently from the 1960s. (In the queue to get in I heard a \u201clifeguard\u201d say: \u201cNice breasts, I mean breaststroke\u201d at a passing punter.) So there\u2019s a sweet shop selling Glasto rock, you can have your fortune told by a man wearing a halo of stuffed gloves, stock up on souvenirs (branded socks! Lighters! Tea towels!!), play in the amusements, watch some Punch and Judy, and from the crowds of people perched on the end of the pier, it\u2019s a great spot to update your Instagram. In the central bandstand, animatronic robots reminiscent of the white lovers in Bjork\u2019s All Is Full of Love video gyrate about, while a mechanical wheelie bin produces two boxing gloves at the touch of a button. And, if you\u2019re keen to see your breakfast/lunch/dinner again, there\u2019s some suitably rickety-looking bumper cars just outside soundtracked, like all good fun-fair rides should be, by Sean Paul. There are also Redcoats dotted about. I spoke to Will and Jess, and both seemed to be adamant the Spice Girls will appear at some point tomorrow. What are you doing exactly? W: We are Redcoats, so we\u2019re assisting people and making sure they have a lovely time. Wearing really incredible hats. J: Yes exactly. We\u2019re meant to be emulating sort of 50s and 60s redcoats. W: This is the first year and we\u2019ve got it for the next five years at least. It\u2019s an amazing feat of engineering. A lot of work has gone into it. It would be lovely if there was some cool water underneath to cool off in. J: Imagine. Even if it was just some cool mist spraying every now and then. I might propose that next year. Have you been on the dodgems? J: Not yet, but we\u2019re going to later. I think they stop them at the right time, about six-ish, so before people are too pissed. In honour of Janet Jackson and her seminal hit Control \u2013 which will get an airing on the Pyramid stage during her set at 5.45pm \u2013 we\u2019ve been asking Glastonbury punters what they would do if they were in control of the festival. Here\u2019s Ngaio, 29, from Bristol, giving her best Janet pose while she\u2019s at it. \u201cI would make sure there were more stages making a 50/50 gender split and bring collectives of colour to run their own venues such as BBZ or gal-dem, or our collective which is called Booty Bass. I think the female run venue Sisterhood is a step in the right direction. It\u2019s important for people to feel safe in a venue and not harassed.\u201d We\u2019ve been asking Glastonbury punters what they would do if they were part of a people\u2019s assembly on Brexit. Next up with her solutions it\u2019s Emma, 22, from Bristol. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have made the Brexit vote during Glastonbury, I think that jinxed it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as common for young people to be aware of the postal vote and they could have done a postal area at Glastonbury or made it clearer if there was one. I think it was a strategic move to do it during the festival.\u201d Extreme shade-seeking measures: a lady is sitting inside the coffee sign. Don\u2019t blame her. Drake, Adele, Wiley and David Lammy are among those who have paid tribute to Stormzy\u2019s performance last night \u2013 we\u2019ve rounded up all the reaction here. Starting the day with homemade kefir in a proper mug in the Permaculture cafe. I would have preferred a coffee if I\u2019m 100 % honest, but when at Glastonbury ... Also, apparently, it will give me flawless skin, put me in a brilliant mood and \u201cmight even make me experience the festival in an entirely new way\u201d, and you can\u2019t say that for a macchiato. A Glastonbury institution: Manic Organic have been at the festival for 33 years, and I reckon their manic breakfast would keep you going for at least half that time. Ploughing through a huge plate of fried potatoes, tomato and homemade vegan sausage mix was a tough job when the temperature must be over 30C without a breeze, but hey, someone\u2019s got to do it. Carbalicious! A giant industrial crane spewing out globules of oily fire may not seem like the most on-brand look for verdant, eco-conscious Glastonbury. Yet there is a tantalising hedonism in the opening of Bristol\u2013based rave stage Arcadia\u2019s Pangea on Friday night \u2013 a chance for revellers to indulge themselves and to have reason enough to seek out the Healing Fields the next day. Irish duo Bicep take their place within the crane, following opener the Black Madonna, as it rotates and spits fire, confetti, and shards of light on to a suitably refreshed crowd. Beginning with a selection of minimal, jittering deep house cuts, their seamless mixing is punctuated by yelps from the crowd each time a fireball erupts to the beat, before moving on to quick cuts of gut-churning techno taken straight from the DJ Stingray playbook. It was only an hour-long set, and it wasn\u2019t until the second half that things got properly moving, when Bicep showcased their own productions from their self\u2013titled debut album, ending on the infectious breakbeats of single Glue. The duo play with a focused intensity that provides the perfect backing to their theatrical setting. Water is being saved for drinking at Glastonbury, and the showers have been temporarily shut off to preserve it. It\u2019s another bump in the road after the festival banned plastic bottles from sale on site \u2013 which led in part to 40-minute queues for some of the water refill stations yesterday. Festival organisers are saying that there are no queues for most of them today, however. All weekend long at Glastonbury you\u2019ll hear rumours of secret sets due to happen: Florence and the Machine are playing an acoustic set in the Crow\u2019s Nest! Kylie\u2019s singing with Nick Cave at a backstage bar! Is that Craig David drinking a protein shake behind the DJ booth? Most of the rumours are, of course, unfounded but the Park stage is reliably starry \u2013 Pulp and Radiohead have appeared in previous years, and later today there\u2019ll be a \u201cmuch loved British band\u201d playing. And this morning, it\u2019s another turn from Sunday Pyramid stage players Vampire Weekend. The band were clearly pleased with the honour, and front man Ezra Koenig greeted the crowd with the line that \u201cthis really is the best stage, it\u2019s the vibiest\u201d, before launching into a set largely comprised of audience requests from their back catalogue. Spanning everything from B-sides like Giant to early hit Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa and the obscure Finger Back, Vampire Weekend showcase a formidable knowledge of their own work but also the breadth of their sound, taking in everything from synth\u2013pop to guitar-driven indie and highlife melodies. Koenig\u2019s falsetto is pitch-perfect throughout and the newly revamped band are precise and controlled. Rounding out the set with a joyous cover of Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Everywhere, Vampire Weekend gave a taste of what is shaping up to be one of the Pyramid stage sets of the weekend tomorrow. Sitars faintly twinkle over Balearic house rhythms as Kieran Hebden, AKA Four Tet, serenades a packed morning crowd either running on the dregs of last night\u2019s festivities or the early morning sun at his breakfast DJ set on the Stonebridge stage. Delving deep into the ambient selections that characterised the more serene, pensive moments of his most recent album New Energy and 2003\u2019s Rounds, Hebden deftly mixes new age pan pipes into undulating breakbeats and washes of floating synths. With the sun shining over the Stonebridge tent, the atmosphere soon morphs into what can only be described as a neo-spiritual sweat lodge; dreadlocked cybergoths waving hands in the air, shirtless lads swaying like nearly-felled timber, perspiring couples locked in an embrace. Not one to play to expectations, though, Hebden soon disregards the spirituals in favour of the thumping house that has marked him out as one of the UK\u2019s most in-demand DJs and producers, taking this most varied of crowds along with him for the ride. An invigorating start to the second day\u2019s music. We spent last night dancing to Midland and Erick Morillo in NYC Downlow, punctuated by a Janet Jackson-themed drag performance \u2013 just one of endless options to thoroughly deprive yourself of sleep at Glastonbury. But it wasn\u2019t always thus, as Joe Muggs found in this feature looking at how Michael Eavis was finally won round to club culture. Everyone had been telling me I needed to try a Buddha Bowl (surely peak Glasto food), and now I have. And I can tell you that a pot of creamy vegan massaman curry and brown rice topped with steamed kale, carrot kimchi, seeds and (optional) grilled halloumi is nice... in the way that eating roast beef and prawn cocktail together because you\u2019ve got overexcited at the all-you-can-eat buffet is weirdly nice. The pineapple hidden at the bottom with the potato was a bit of a surprise, but frankly, if it contains halloumi, it\u2019s ok with me. Liam Gallagher is on later, and is clearly gearing up for a \u201cman\u2019s not hot\u201d moment. Catch him sweating profusely but pretending not to care at 7.15pm tonight. Tame Impala are in an unenviable position \u2013 around the corner from them a groundbreaking moment is taking place, as the first black British Pyramid headliner takes to the stage. And, when a burst of fireworks rockets up above the Pyramid, what seems like a significant proportion of the Other Stage crowd glances across enviously. It doesn\u2019t help that Kevin Parker\u2019s psych romanticists aren\u2019t quite providing enough pyrotechnics themselves. This is largely the same set the band played here in 2016, give or take a pair of recent-ish singles and some snazzy new visuals. It\u2019s hard not to feel a sense of water being treaded. Still, they possess a few trump cards and there are a few arms aloft moments in the form of Elephant and Feels Like We Only Go Backwards. You suspect, given Parker\u2019s restless, inventive energy, that when they return here it will be in triumphant form. And hopefully they won\u2019t be facing off against Stormzy then, too. Welcome back! We\u2019ll be bringing you all the action on day two at Glastonbury, right through til midnight tonight \u2013 highlights along the way include Janet Jackson, Lewis Capaldi, Johnny Marr and Lizzo. We\u2019re still reeling from that five-star Stormzy performance last night, hailed by various random people we met last night as one of the best headliners ever. It really was sensational. On one level technically excellent, his flow utterly on point throughout, and his naive singing style appealingly immediate. But on a whole other level it was an emotional celebration of how far he has climbed, by just 25 years old, and how he has pulled a whole black British music scene up a rung or two as well. Having a Pyramid stage audience singing along to Shut Up \u2013 a freestyle recorded in a park \u2013 was brilliantly dissonant. Jeremy Corbyn was a fan too:",

Or look to people like Roj Amedi who has been campaigning in the streets of Victoria alongside other community organising volunteers to get marginalised communities connected to each other, bypassing existing barriers like geography and language. Or the example of Tim Lo Surdo who works to make sure local activists are trained and supported so they can keep organising and working in grassroots civil society.

The 500,000-strong protest in Hong Kong against a proposed subversion law in 2003 and the 79-day \u201cUmbrella\u201d civil disobedience movement in 2014 were also similarly blamed on \u201cforeign forces\u201d set to undermine China.</p> <p>Amid the recent protests, a Hong Kong representative to the Chinese parliament warned of \u201cforeign forces\u2019 interference\u201d and warned people not to become \u201cpawns\u201d in the US-China trade war.</p> <p>\u201cAccording to the Communist ideology, \u2018We are the people\u2019s representatives\u2019, so the party cannot accept people rising up against it and forcing it to back down,\u201d said Joseph Cheng, retired political science professor at the City University of Hong Kong.</p> <p>The authorities also have a deep-rooted tendency to blame problems on foreign interference instead of their own governance weaknesses, political commentator and veteran journalist Ching Cheong said.</p> <p>\u201cChina sees Hong Kong as influenced by years of colonial rule and having no sense of responsibility to introduce laws to protect the national security or to help the country nab fugitives,\u201d said Ching. \u201cAnd they believe that hostile forces are using \u2018colour revolution\u2019 to subvert China through Hong Kong.\u201d</p> <p>Chinese leaders have many times warned against \u201ccolour revolution\u201d \u2013 movements that lead to regime changes through non-violent resistance \u2013 and Chinese President Xi Jinping in January warned officials to be vigilant against political risks that could threaten the Communist Party\u2019s rule.</p> <p>\u201cThe Communist Party fears mass protests,\u201d said Willy Lam, a China expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who said Xi was particularly frightened of unpredictable events that could disturb the stats quo.</p> <p>After the current crisis, analysts believe the Hong Kong government will likely start a new round of retaliatory measures against its critics while the Chinese government will tighten its grip on the city.</p> <p>\u201cThey will definitely seek revenge, otherwise they can\u2019t justify themselves as an effectual regime,\u201d said Lam.</p> <p>Analysts expect that the Hong Kong government will widen the prosecution of people active in the protests. Last week, the police said 32 people had been arrested over the recent demonstrations and five have been charged with rioting, which carries a maximum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment.</p> <p>Analysts also expect the government to continue weakening the pro-democracy camp by disqualifying more of its election candidates. Six members of the legislature have already been ousted and candidates seen as pro-independent have been prevented from running for public office.</p> <p>And Beijing will likely try to assume more power over Hong Kong, speed up its integration with China, and intensify ideological education, analysts say.</p> <p>\u201cChina will step up its intervention.

And more resources will likely be dedicated to initiatives to fuel patriotism, such as stepping up ideological education among youngsters, analysts say.</p> <p>Having antagonised not only the pro-democracy camp, but also the business community and even pro-government politicians in the recent crisis, Hong Kong\u2019s leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/13/hong-kong-protests-extradition-carrie-lam-riot-police\">Carrie Lam will lean even more heavily on her Beijing masters</a> for support, Cheng said. \u201cShe will get even closer to China,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But in the absence of any real solution to address Hong Kong people\u2019s plights for democracy and more freedoms, these strategies will only deepen Hong Kong\u2019s political crisis and more angry outbursts of discontent are expected on the streets.</p> <p>\u201cThe crux of the issue is that there is no democracy and there are no checks and balances so bigger mistakes will occur,\u201d warned Cheng. \u201cConflicts will keep accumulating and one day these will explode.\u201d</p>",

Mao Zedong in 1930 famously used the traditional saying: \u201ca single spark can start a prairie fire\u201d to remind fellow Communists the power of strikes and uprisings when they were a fledgling opposition party under the one-party Nationalist rule. Today, Chinese leaders are likely to take a much grimmer view when they see images of millions protesting a controversial law in Hong Kong this month. Rocked by its biggest political crisis in decades, millions have thronged to the streets to protest a proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi told reporters last week that it was \u201chighly alarming that Western forces have been stirring up trouble and provoking confrontation in an attempt to undermine Hong Kong\u2019s peace and stability.\u201d Casting protests as conspiracies fomented by \u201cWestern hostile forces\u201d is a narrative that is not new for the Chinese government. The 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy movement, eventually crushed by the military, was labelled as a plot backed by Western powers to topple communist rule. The 500,000-strong protest in Hong Kong against a proposed subversion law in 2003 and the 79-day \u201cUmbrella\u201d civil disobedience movement in 2014 were also similarly blamed on \u201cforeign forces\u201d set to undermine China. Amid the recent protests, a Hong Kong representative to the Chinese parliament warned of \u201cforeign forces\u2019 interference\u201d and warned people not to become \u201cpawns\u201d in the US-China trade war. \u201cAccording to the Communist ideology, \u2018We are the people\u2019s representatives\u2019, so the party cannot accept people rising up against it and forcing it to back down,\u201d said Joseph Cheng, retired political science professor at the City University of Hong Kong. The authorities also have a deep-rooted tendency to blame problems on foreign interference instead of their own governance weaknesses, political commentator and veteran journalist Ching Cheong said. \u201cChina sees Hong Kong as influenced by years of colonial rule and having no sense of responsibility to introduce laws to protect the national security or to help the country nab fugitives,\u201d said Ching. \u201cAnd they believe that hostile forces are using \u2018colour revolution\u2019 to subvert China through Hong Kong.\u201d Chinese leaders have many times warned against \u201ccolour revolution\u201d \u2013 movements that lead to regime changes through non-violent resistance \u2013 and Chinese President Xi Jinping in January warned officials to be vigilant against political risks that could threaten the Communist Party\u2019s rule. \u201cThe Communist Party fears mass protests,\u201d said Willy Lam, a China expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who said Xi was particularly frightened of unpredictable events that could disturb the stats quo. After the current crisis, analysts believe the Hong Kong government will likely start a new round of retaliatory measures against its critics while the Chinese government will tighten its grip on the city. \u201cThey will definitely seek revenge, otherwise they can\u2019t justify themselves as an effectual regime,\u201d said Lam. Analysts expect that the Hong Kong government will widen the prosecution of people active in the protests. Last week, the police said 32 people had been arrested over the recent demonstrations and five have been charged with rioting, which carries a maximum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. Analysts also expect the government to continue weakening the pro-democracy camp by disqualifying more of its election candidates. Six members of the legislature have already been ousted and candidates seen as pro-independent have been prevented from running for public office. And Beijing will likely try to assume more power over Hong Kong, speed up its integration with China, and intensify ideological education, analysts say. \u201cChina will step up its intervention. Like after the 2003 protest, China will watch more closely,\u201d said Cheng. At China\u2019s behest, Hong Kong has already put in place a number of infrastructure projects that aid integration with the mainland, such as a bridge linking Hong Kong, Macau and Southern China\u2019s Greater Bay Area, and a multi-billion-dollar high-speed rail linking the city and mainland cities. And more resources will likely be dedicated to initiatives to fuel patriotism, such as stepping up ideological education among youngsters, analysts say. Having antagonised not only the pro-democracy camp, but also the business community and even pro-government politicians in the recent crisis, Hong Kong\u2019s leader Carrie Lam will lean even more heavily on her Beijing masters for support, Cheng said. \u201cShe will get even closer to China,\u201d he said. But in the absence of any real solution to address Hong Kong people\u2019s plights for democracy and more freedoms, these strategies will only deepen Hong Kong\u2019s political crisis and more angry outbursts of discontent are expected on the streets. \u201cThe crux of the issue is that there is no democracy and there are no checks and balances so bigger mistakes will occur,\u201d warned Cheng. \u201cConflicts will keep accumulating and one day these will explode.\u201d",

Ava\u2019s family member, who attempted suicide several times while in detention, was brought to Australia for treatment for mental illness and spent a month in hospital, under Serco guard. \u201cShe gets severe anxiety when she would go to the detention centre to see her [IHMS] doctor,\u201d Ava said. \u201cSeeing the fences traumatises her.\u201d \u2018If I die in my room no one would understand\u2019 For the past three weeks, Raha* has been separated from a close family member, living in a section of Melbourne\u2019s immigration transit accommodation for single women. She is the only refugee in the complex; the others are women whose visas have been cancelled. Since being brought to Australia from Nauru for medical treatment, Raha and her family member have been moved regularly, between complexes and cities. She says they spent six weeks in the Brisbane detention centre transit accommodation and were then sent to a hotel in the Brisbane CBD for another eight weeks. Afterwards they were sent to Adelaide for almost three months, and have now been in Melbourne for more than two months. Raha had wanted to be in Melbourne, where another family member lives, but the transit accommodation does not have adequate facilities for her to stay with family in a private room; as a result they are sleeping in separate complexes, designed for singles. Raha says she has had difficulty arranging family visits and accessing a psychiatrist. \u201cIf I die in my room no one would understand,\u201d Raha said. \u201cI can\u2019t cope with constant relocation any more.\u201d For refugees brought to Australia from offshore detention on orders to receive medical treatment, their legal situation is perilous. They do not have a visa or status in Australia, and can be detained and moved at the whim of authorities. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has the ability to grant a \u201cresidence determination\u201d that would allow a refugee to live in the community while legally remaining in immigration detention. While Nesha contends her ongoing detention contradicts a federal court order that she reunite with her family, her lawyer cannot assist in having her released into the community. \u201cIt is more difficult for us to fight against you being detained, as this is a decision that the minister must personally make and the courts can\u2019t force him to release you,\u201d Nesha\u2019s lawyer wrote to her. The Australian Border Force sent a statement to Guardian Australia on Tuesday, six days after an initial offer to provide comment. The department said it did not conduct \u201ccavity searches\u201d and that \u201cpat searches\u201d were conducted by guards above the clothing, rather than underneath as refugees have said. *Names have been changed \u2022 On 3 July 2019 this article was amended to incorporate comment from Australian Border Force.",

An assault in 1992 had left him with an acquired brain injury that severed his olfactory nerve, leaving the sensual, hedonistic Hutchence with no sense of smell or taste.

At the time of his death, Hutchence hadn\u2019t slept for between 36 and 48 hours, had a large quantity of alcohol in his system, and was locked in a bitter custody dispute with Bob Geldof for his daughter with Paula Yates, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily (known as Tiger).</p> <p>It was a perfect storm. \u201cHis ability to navigate cognitive and emotional dilemmas was severely impaired,\u201d Lowenstein says.

Off stage, he comes across as needy: he could be the life of the party, a prankster who had to be the centre of attention. \u201cHe felt he had to entertain you,\u201d Lowenstein says, and while the men around Hutchence had the rock-star war stories, Lowenstein avoided them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"891d0461c6d0bfceeca9244da2b34997bbdf8471\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/891d0461c6d0bfceeca9244da2b34997bbdf8471/0_0_2160_1702/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still of Michael Hutchence from the documentary, Mystify, about the INXS frontman\u2019s life\" width=\"1000\" height=\"788\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homemade footage of Kylie Minogue and Michael Hutchence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Madman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s the footage featuring Minogue, Hutchence\u2019s partner between 1989 and 1991 \u2013 home video and stills shot by the pair in Hong Kong, on the Orient Express, and in various hotel rooms \u2013 that provide Mystify with some of its most touching, whimsical moments.</p> <p>The other key woman Lowenstein connected with was Tiger, just 16 months old at the time of her father\u2019s death. Now 22, Tiger provided the key to licensing a selection of INXS\u2019s songs for the film. Up to that point, the band had withheld permission, leaving Lowenstein with only the music of Max Q, Hutchence\u2019s collaboration from 1989 with Ollie Olsen, and an underscore by Warren Ellis.</p> <p>Lowenstein met Hutchence\u2019s daughter at a cafe in London. He had his laptop, with the film on it, and Tiger suggested they adjourn to her flat to watch it. \u201cWe watched it in her share-house flat, which funnily enough reminded me of a scene from Dogs in Space [Lowenstein\u2019s 1986 film featuring Hutchence]. She was living with some friends, and she wasn\u2019t by any means a rich kid.</p> <p>\u201cShe watched it, she liked it and was quite emotionally affected by it, and said, \u2018Well, you obviously loved my dad and you need his music, what do you want me to do?\u2019\u201d Lowenstein dissuaded Tiger from writing an open letter to the Guardian in support of his cause; instead she composed an email to the band. Within 24 hours, Lowenstein had permission to use nine songs, giving the film its musical backbone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d72ead6fe27d22bbddc1c9c9aebf9d8d1be5dc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d72ead6fe27d22bbddc1c9c9aebf9d8d1be5dc7/0_0_4717_2830/1000.png\" alt=\"A still of Michael Hutchence from the documentary, Mystify, about the INXS frontman\u2019s life\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lowenstein, pictured with Hutchence, who once described the filmmaker as his best friend but added, \u2018I don\u2019t think he knows it\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Madman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The presence of the music, and concert footage, allows Hutchence to shape-shift before our eyes on screen, as we watch him transform from a vulnerable man, who hated being alone, to the lounge lizard rock star who commanded stadiums of up to a hundred thousand people at a time, and back again.

      "bodyText": "If the X factor is that indefinable charisma that gives a performer star power, the late Michael Hutchence had it in abundance. On stage, the INXS singer took moves from Jagger, Jim Morrison and Iggy Pop and transformed into a serpentine, almost supernatural presence. In Mystify, a new documentary by his longtime collaborator Richard Lowenstein, he fills the screen, but slides in and out of focus, as though untouchable. Which, in death, he is. It\u2019s now 22 years since Hutchence took his own life in a Sydney hotel room. Lowenstein says his film is an apology, of sorts, that he wasn\u2019t there for his friend. When the surviving members of INXS saw his film, Lowenstein tells Guardian Australia, he saw \u201call these people still incredibly damaged, not by the ups and downs of being in a band with Michael Hutchence, but the damage done by his departure. He\u2019s left this huge hole in everyone.\u201d Mystify is not a standard rock documentary. There are no talking heads, and there\u2019s no narrator. Instead, Lowenstein relies entirely on archival footage \u2013 much of it shot by the singer himself, or by his intimate partners, including Kylie Minogue \u2013 with his story told as an off-camera oral history by associates, lovers, and mother figures, in particular INXS\u2019s manager in the US, Martha Troup. The result is a far more intimate, close-up portrait of a complex man who, by the end, had been reduced to an unbecoming tabloid caricature. An assault in 1992 had left him with an acquired brain injury that severed his olfactory nerve, leaving the sensual, hedonistic Hutchence with no sense of smell or taste. The coroner\u2019s report \u2013 acquired by Lowenstein \u201cby nefarious means\u201d \u2013 reported two walnut-sized lesions on his frontal lobe. According to a neurologist Lowenstein consulted for the film, that traumatic injury alone put Hutchence in the highest risk category for suicide. At the time of his death, Hutchence hadn\u2019t slept for between 36 and 48 hours, had a large quantity of alcohol in his system, and was locked in a bitter custody dispute with Bob Geldof for his daughter with Paula Yates, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily (known as Tiger). It was a perfect storm. \u201cHis ability to navigate cognitive and emotional dilemmas was severely impaired,\u201d Lowenstein says. Band members and Hutchence\u2019s partner between 1991 and 1995, Helena Christensen, report the change that came over the formerly gentle singer after the accident: he became erratic and sometimes aggressive, and INXS lost their way as their singer lost his. Lowenstein first met Hutchence in 1984, filming the video clip for Burn for You, the third single from their breakthrough album The Swing. Over the course of the next 13 years, he got to know him \u201cfairly well, on the level that any Australian male knows another Australian male\u201d. Once asked who his best friend was, Hutchence replied \u201cI think Richard is, but I don\u2019t think he knows it,\u201d and Lowenstein says \u201cthat encapsulated us\u201d. Hutchence confided more in the women in his life, and Mystify leans on their accounts (and home videos) to get a glimpse of the private person. Off stage, he comes across as needy: he could be the life of the party, a prankster who had to be the centre of attention. \u201cHe felt he had to entertain you,\u201d Lowenstein says, and while the men around Hutchence had the rock-star war stories, Lowenstein avoided them. It\u2019s the footage featuring Minogue, Hutchence\u2019s partner between 1989 and 1991 \u2013 home video and stills shot by the pair in Hong Kong, on the Orient Express, and in various hotel rooms \u2013 that provide Mystify with some of its most touching, whimsical moments. The other key woman Lowenstein connected with was Tiger, just 16 months old at the time of her father\u2019s death. Now 22, Tiger provided the key to licensing a selection of INXS\u2019s songs for the film. Up to that point, the band had withheld permission, leaving Lowenstein with only the music of Max Q, Hutchence\u2019s collaboration from 1989 with Ollie Olsen, and an underscore by Warren Ellis. Lowenstein met Hutchence\u2019s daughter at a cafe in London. He had his laptop, with the film on it, and Tiger suggested they adjourn to her flat to watch it. \u201cWe watched it in her share-house flat, which funnily enough reminded me of a scene from Dogs in Space [Lowenstein\u2019s 1986 film featuring Hutchence]. She was living with some friends, and she wasn\u2019t by any means a rich kid. \u201cShe watched it, she liked it and was quite emotionally affected by it, and said, \u2018Well, you obviously loved my dad and you need his music, what do you want me to do?\u2019\u201d Lowenstein dissuaded Tiger from writing an open letter to the Guardian in support of his cause; instead she composed an email to the band. Within 24 hours, Lowenstein had permission to use nine songs, giving the film its musical backbone. The presence of the music, and concert footage, allows Hutchence to shape-shift before our eyes on screen, as we watch him transform from a vulnerable man, who hated being alone, to the lounge lizard rock star who commanded stadiums of up to a hundred thousand people at a time, and back again. But it was in that hotel room in Double Bay that, on 22 November 1997, he found himself alone, at his wit\u2019s end. \u201cIf Michael had gotten through that moment \u2013 if he could see the pleasures in life and the love of his daughter, whatever the troubles that were there \u2013 half an hour, an hour later, he would have made a totally different decision,\u201d Lowenstein says. Still, there is doubt. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really knew what was going on in Michael\u2019s head. He was a performer, and what he was showing his friends, especially his male friends, was a performance.\u201d But even for Lowenstein, occasionally, the mask dropped. \u201cHe identified with the quiet types,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019d be sitting in the corner while the classic rock\u2019n\u2019roll party was going on, and you\u2019d just find that he would just come and quietly sit next to you.\u201d \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is 1800 737 732.

Especially one of the biggest teams in the game. They are playing well and had a totally dominating performance, they should absolutely be confident. We like confidence in America don\u2019t we?\u201d she added with a wry smile. The swagger of this USA team as they power towards reclaiming their status as world champions is unyielding. Except while the Americans have led from the front for so long, streaks ahead of their closest rivals, now they are looking over their shoulders. The Europeans are catching up fast, with increasing investment in the domestic leagues fuelling the charge. The USA were the only non-European side in the quarter-finals, and they will be flying the flag for the rest of the world in the last four. Rapinoe can see the difference and where they need to improve if they are to pull clear once more. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret we have to get better on the ball, better playing with it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe level is just growing every day in the women\u2019s game. You\u2019ve seen some fantastic performances.\u201d With the heat meaning many teams are training early and late, watching the Lionesses\u2019 3-0 defeat of Norway was not a planned sit-down affair, but they did catch bits. \u201cEngland were super-clinical against Norway so we absolutely have our work cut out,\u201d said Rapinoe, who is unsurprised by the growth of this England team. \u201cI think that they, as a federation, have put a lot of money behind that programme and they\u2019ve been on the rise. \u201cWithout that devastating own goal in the last World Cup [which condemned England to a 2-1 defeat by Japan in the semi-finals] we could\u2019ve been facing them in the final in Canada. They have been right there and have such a strong squad and really good young players coming up.\u201d With five goals to bring her level with her teammate Alex Morgan, England\u2019s Ellen White and the eliminated Australian Sam Kerr, the battle between Rapinoe and Crystal Dunn versus Lucy Bronze and Nikita Parris on the wings will be the focus of Tuesday evening\u2019s semi-final in Lyon. Ali Krieger, the defender who spoke out on Twitter in support of Rapinoe\u2019s criticism of Donald Trump, said \u201cIt\u2019s tough to be silent\u201d after Friday\u2019s 2-1 defeat of the hosts France. \u201cBecause you feel like you\u2019re complicit. I don\u2019t want to be that anymore, it doesn\u2019t take a lot of mind space to tweet something and refocus. It\u2019s funny, women can multitask. Imagine that! Two things at once. \u201cI thought it was really important for me to not make [Rapinoe] feel like she has to process this all alone, and a lot of us have similar feelings.\u201d Krieger described Thursday night\u2019s England game as \u201c\u2018great fun to watch\u201d, adding: \u201cThe goals were really good. They\u2019re a strong, physical team, they\u2019re mentally tough, but we\u2019re prepared for whatever team comes at us. It\u2019s going to be another exciting game, it\u2019s going to be so much fun because at the highest level you want to play against the best teams in the world \u2013 and we\u2019re doing that right now.\u201d Jill Ellis, the USA coach, said: \u201cI watched some of it. We had training but caught some of the game. I think it was a dominant performance as Megan said. They\u2019ve got a lot of talented players. To single one out? I don\u2019t know, their frontline and the striker is hot right now. I still want to know what this [she does Ellen White\u2019s celebration with one hand] means? But they are a good team front to back, with a lot of experienced players so it\u2019s going to be a good match up.\u201d The Americans have a day less than England to recover and, having played a more gruelling match, essentially what many have described as a final two games before the actual final, efficient recovery is key. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in this position before, and the tournament is mentally, emotionally, physically draining,\u201d said the 34-year-old Krieger. \u201cYou have to take a step back, put the phones away, say hello to your families quickly and get back to refreshing and recovering, getting your body back to 100% for three days from now. It\u2019s tough, but we\u2019re immune to that. We\u2019re very good at it, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been training for the last four years and some of us even beyond that. We\u2019re used to it, we\u2019re comfortable doing it and we\u2019re prepared to do it.\u201d Ellis added: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to let players enjoy this moment because that was a gritty win. Again, we\u2019re going to have less days recovery than our opponent but that\u2019s the rhythm for us in this cup, so be it.\u201d",

It feels like a territorial land grab in the face of young pretenders \u2013 later he thanks Michael and Emily Eavis for \u201cletting me continue my Glasto residency\u201d \u2013 and to a degree he\u2019s earned it: nobody looks more the part, with his hands clasped at the bottom of his spine, top lip hanging off the microphone like a rottweiler refusing to relinquish a rubber toy. Even from the outer fringes of the stacked main stage, where the speakers make the guitars of (What\u2019s the Story) Morning Glory sound like a washing machine on the blink, the effect is still transcendent. But how much can he lay claim to the crown when it\u2019s based on rehashing former glories \u2013 and, as Stormzy proved, when the concept of rock stardom has evolved light years beyond his 90s heyday? Tumbleweed blows across the field whenever he plays most of his solo material. The leering Wall of Glass gets a mild roar of recognition, but For What it\u2019s Worth and Bold are arduous plodders, and both find Gallagher on the defensive, his least convincing mode. He introduces a brand new song, River, presumably from his forthcoming second solo album \u2013 an announcement met with as much enthusiasm as a weather report announcing a return to the 30C weather, ie none. Coming back to Capaldi, this dull strummer of a song entrenches the age-old mystery of how such witty, quicksilver men fail to translate their verbal genius into decent songwriting. There\u2019s no escaping the fact that Gallagher is a diminished figure. The sepia colouring of the visuals either side of the stage reflect the ageing of his voice \u2013 he no longer attempts the high notes of Columbia. He\u2019s constantly jousting with an invisible antagonist, chin up as thousands of people show him their love. Fortunately for him, he still lays claim to some of the most fantastic, nonsensical rock songs of all time, the kind made to withstand wear and tear. It\u2019s hard to imagine any other act at the festival has a run of hits like Gallagher\u2019s home straight: Cigarettes and Alcohol, Wonderwall, Supersonic and Champagne Supernova, which he dedicates to the late Keith Flint. But it\u2019s also hard not to imagine how glorious it would be if the brothers finally buried the hatchet and graced the Pyramid together. For all that they like to fire shots at one another, the diminishing returns of their respective solo careers reveal two men continuing to play themselves rather than one-up each other.",

The pitches have been slowish, often two-paced, and two-faced \u2013 promising runs but delivering wickets, mainly to fast left-armers. Starc took five today, to become the first man ever to take three World Cup five-fors in a career; Trent Boult took four, including a hat-trick, which ended up as a magnificent irrelevance. </p> <p>Thanks for your company and your emails to Geoff and me.

It did, thanks to Alex Carey, the only man on either side to come in and find the boundary consistently \u2013 he hit 11 fours in his 71, which was six more than Usman Khuwaja in his 88, and nine more than any New Zealander. </p> <p>Armed with 243, which shouldn\u2019t be enough, Australia made it even harder for themselves by seeing if their captain Aaron Finch could set a new world record for the most bowling changes in a one-day innings. He chopped, he changed, he behaved like Mike Brearley on speed. He used eight bowlers, many of them starting with one-over spells. It was like insisting on hiring a Volkswagen Beetle when you already have a Bentley.

What price a Steve Smith three-for?</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d178c958f082364d7cf36a2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/geoff-lemon\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-29T16:11:33.502Z\">5.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">New Zealand must chase 244 to win</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>An exciting finish for New Zealand, and they\u2019ll go into the rooms with the buzz of having nearly bowled Australia out. However, they still missed a trick in not applying more pressure earlier in the Australian innings. Boult didn\u2019t bowl for 30 overs through the middle, while Khawaja and Carey were running away with a substantial partnership. Williamson could have attacked more purposefully when Australia were 92-5. Instead they were allowed to recover to 199 before the next wicket fell. Mind you, Khawaja was dropped twice. </p> <p>244 isn\u2019t the biggest target, but it could be tough on this surface against some good bowling. It looks like the wicket will spin, which will bring Lyon into play, and it looks abrasive enough to produce reverse swing, which does nicely for Mitchell Starc. Imagine the way Boult finished the innings but add 15 kilometres per hour.</p> <p>New Zealand have a tough fight on their hands, but if they can win this chase then they\u2019ll lay a marker.</p> <p>That\u2019s enough from me \u2013 thanks for all your emails and tweets, and you can now direct them to Tim de Lisle for the chase. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d178c2e8f081e8727350f26\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-29T16:06:37.879Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>50th over: Australia 243-6 (Cummins 23, Lyon 0) </strong>Four in four for Trent Boult?

The pitches have been slowish, often two-paced, and two-faced \u2013 promising runs but delivering wickets, mainly to fast left-armers. Starc took five today, to become the first man ever to take three World Cup five-fors in a career; Trent Boult took four, including a hat-trick, which ended up as a magnificent irrelevance.

New Zealand have 11 too, but from two more games, and now with a much worse net run rate (0.57 to India\u2019s 1.16). Pakistan have crept up to fourth with nine from eight. Somebody with three defeats is going to fiddle their way through to the semis: England have to make sure it\u2019s them. ...is not Mitchell Starc. Clearly taking five for 26 is not enough. The award goes to Alex Carey, which is fair comment in a way as he turned the match with his fluent strokeplay. A game that seemed beautifully poised turned out to be nothing of the sort. It wasn\u2019t really a cricket match at all \u2013 it was a pair of sadistic experiments. The Aussies, who had been relying rather too heavily on their openers, decided it would be fun to collapse to 90-odd for five, to see if the lower order could bail them out. It did, thanks to Alex Carey, the only man on either side to come in and find the boundary consistently \u2013 he hit 11 fours in his 71, which was six more than Usman Khuwaja in his 88, and nine more than any New Zealander. Armed with 243, which shouldn\u2019t be enough, Australia made it even harder for themselves by seeing if their captain Aaron Finch could set a new world record for the most bowling changes in a one-day innings. He chopped, he changed, he behaved like Mike Brearley on speed. He used eight bowlers, many of them starting with one-over spells. It was like insisting on hiring a Volkswagen Beetle when you already have a Bentley. The Bentley, when he went back to it, cruised out and ran over the New Zealanders, who went from 97-2 to 157 all out in 18.1 overs. They were both timid and chaotic at the same time: it was as if they were suddenly being managed by Boris Johnson. It\u2019s all over. Starc is now so dominant that he can take a wicket with an awful ball. It\u2019s short, it\u2019s wide, it\u2019s going for at least one wide and possibly six, until Santner helps it round to long leg. That is a drubbing. 43rd over: NZ 157-9 (Santner 12, Boult 2) Santner has been watching this nonsense from the other end, and he\u2019s had enough. He swings Lyon for six, then has such a big mow that his inside edge is missed by Carey behind the stumps. Lyon\u2019s figures can afford to take a slight dent: he finishes with 10-1-36-1. 42nd over: NZ 144-9 (Santner 5, Boult 0) So that\u2019s a wicket maiden for Starc, who now has the frankly ridiculous figures of 9-1-26-4. Nice moment for the pub quizmasters: Trent Boult, who took a hat-trick earlier, comes in to try and stop Mitch Starc taking one. And he succeeds, getting neatly behind a straight one. Finch, so much for being Mr Funky, gave Starc only a slip and a gully for that ball, when Steve Waugh would surely have had six slips, two gullies, a silly point and a short leg. Yet another one. Starc\u2019s nip-backer is too good for Lockie Ferguson, taking out his off stump. 41st over: NZ 144-8 (Santner 5, Ferguson 0) Lyon races through another tidy over. 40th over: NZ 141-8 (Santner 4, Ferguson 0) Yet another wicket for the majestic Starc. He now has 22 wickets, as many as he got in the whole of the 2015 World Cup, when he was Player of the Tournament. With the clatter of wickets, I didn\u2019t have time to look at Twitter, where a news story may now be developing. \u201cIs that Smith on the grandstand boundary?\u201d says Michael Keane. \u201cLooks like stuff\u2019s being thrown at him.\u201d Three minutes later he tweets again: \u201cNow lots of security. Getting ugly. And a naval officer. F**k\u2019s sake people, this is Lord\u2019s.\u201d Another one! Starc is reversing it now and his inswinger comes booming in to pin Sodhi in front. Sodhi reviews, but it's umpire\u2019s call. 39th over: NZ 136-7 (Santner 3, Sodhi 4) A New Zealander plays a decent attacking shot, at last, as Ish Sodhi lofts an off-break from Lyon over the man at short fine leg. That was like a sweep played with an upright bat. It\u2019s all over bar the tiny innovations. Desperate times, desperate measures: Jimmy Neesham tries the skies too and Lyon says \u201cthat\u2019s mine\u201d. 38th over: NZ 131-6 (Neesham 9, Santner 2) Starc\u2019s seventh over goes for just a single. Early on, there was a big four in this tournament. Then England had a wobble and there was a big three. Now it\u2019s a big two. The last half-hour means that Australia are more likely to avoid India in the semis, and therefore meet them, back here at Lord\u2019s, on July 14. And here\u2019s Geoff Wignall again. \u201cAren\u2019t the Aussies just taking the opportunity to play around with and test their bowling options in a game they don\u2019t especially need to win but are going to anyway?\u201d he wonders. \u201cA bad day for England - points for Pakistan and final game incentivising for NZ.\u201d 37th over: NZ 130-6 (Neesham 8, Santner 2) A better over for New Zealand: nobody gets out. They need 114 off 13 overs at a rate of nearly nine. 36th over: NZ 126-6 (Neesham 4, Santner 1) So that was three wickets for seven runs in four overs. Devastating from Australia, dismal from New Zealand \u2013 but they should still make the semi-finals. If England lose tomorrow, not only do India go through, but they take NZ with them, as England would then be unable to get more than 10 points, and NZ already have 11. Whether they will go any further is doubtful: their excellent early form is draining away. Latham chips into the leg side, and Smith, cheered by that wicket, takes off like a salmon and catches it like a retriever going after a frisbee. Game over, I suspect. 35th over: NZ 124-5 (Latham 14, Neesham 4) On the progress chart, the black worm is almost going downwards, waving goodbye to the yellow one. These two have 18 off 41 balls between them. They could reverse that in the next three overs and still have a battle to get over the line. 34th over: NZ 121-5 (Latham 13, Neesham 2) Off goes Cummins and back comes Lyon, who whistles through an over for just a single. NZ need another 123 off 16 overs, which suddenly looks like far too many. 33rd over: NZ 120-5 (Latham 13, Neesham 1) So, at last, one of the funky bowling changes comes off. Finch deflects the credit, giving two thumbs-up to the Australian balcony, where Justin Langer is sitting with Ricky Ponting. There had just been a drinks break, smuggled in when Taylor was out, so maybe the message was sent out then. Well bowled Steve Smith, who tried several googlies in that over. The commentators think the wicket-taking ball was one of them, but I reckon it just went straight on. How do you turn a drama into a crisis? Launch your first ball, which is also the first ball of a new spell from a part-time leggie, straight to long-off. Oh dear. 32nd over: NZ 118-4 (Latham 12, de Grandhomme 0) Taylor had just played a handsome pull for four, so he can\u2019t have been feeling too tied down \u2013 maybe he was intoxicated. Anyway he tried to be Viv Richards and the upshot is that NZ have lost both their big wickets. Taylor suddenly hits a full ball straight up in the air. I can\u2019t even work out how he did that. It stays up there for several minutes, and when it finally comes down Carey does well to keep calm and cling on. Australia are on top. 31st over: NZ 112-3 (Taylor 25, Latham 11) You\u2019ll never guess what\u2019s just happened. A bowling change! Lyon\u2019s off-breaks give way to Maxwell\u2019s, which is like replacing Paul McCartney with Noel Gallagher. Maxwell, to be fair, goes for only three, but I\u2019m not sure what Finch is doing here \u2013 he could win it with just his main men. \u201cGood afternoon,\u201d says Ed Smyth. \u201cSurely the answer to what happens to the ball in this heat is that the sunburn makes it a Test ball?\u201d Ha. The four serious bowlers are making it feel like that. 30th over: NZ 108-3 (Taylor 23, Latham 9) Finch continues his bid for the world record for bowling changes in one innings by taking Starc off (5-0-18-1) and recalling Cummins. He starts with four dots and rattles both batsmen with his bounce. 29th over: NZ 107-3 (Taylor 23, Latham 8) Another good over from Lyon nearly brings a run-out, as a direct hit comes in and Latham saves his skin by scraping some of it on the pitch, with a very committed dive. I haven\u2019t been bothering with the run rate required, as it\u2019s been so modest, but it has now reached six and a half. 28th over: NZ 104-3 (Taylor 22, Latham 6) Starc concedes only a single. Latham is right out of form, which can perversely help a batsman \u2013 no better time to clamber out of a slump. The bowling figures are showing that there\u2019s a reason why part-timers are part-timers. Smith, Finch, Stoinis and Maxwell have combined figures of 6-0-34-0, while the four proper bowlers have 22-1-67-3. We\u2019re watching two different ball games. 27th over: NZ 103-3 (Taylor 22, Latham 5) It\u2019s as if all those part-time bowlers were just a dream. Finch, fully awake now, brings back Lyon, who bowls a better, sharper, more testing over than 0-6 might suggest. 26th over: NZ 97-3 (Taylor 21, Latham 1) So Finch, after being too funky, finds exactly the right note. And Starc is the first man to 20 wickets in this World Cup. The top five are all seamers, and Jofra Archer is the only right-armer, outnumbered by Starc, Lockie Ferguson, Mohammad Amir and Trent Boult. \u201cHow is the heat affecting people?\u201d asks John Starbuck. \u201cYou\u2019d think the Aussies would be right at home, otherwise why would they live in an extreme country? It\u2019s warm here in t\u2019north but not properly hot, which I gather is the case down south. Does it do anything significant to the ball, though?\u201d It makes it a bit grumpy. What do you do when your bowling changes suddenly go wrong? You make another one. Finch summons a proper bowler, Mitchell Starc, and he does the business, moving one away from Williamson for a regulation caught behind. That\u2019s the big one. 25th over: NZ 92-2 (Williamson 36, Taylor 20) Maxwell bowls something so slow that Williamson changes his mind a couple of times before driving it, whippily, to mid-off. He picks up a single which takes him to 6,000 in this format. What a player he is, and he confirms it by hitting his next whippy drive in the air, over mid-off. Off the past five overs, New Zealand have doubled the scoring rate (six an over rather than three). And all they\u2019ve had to do is help themselves from the hotel buffet. 24th over: NZ 85-2 (Williamson 31, Taylor 18) A caption shows that Kane Williamson now has the most singles of any batsman in this World Cup, nudging \u2013 or nurdling \u2013 ahead of Joe Root. As if hearing this, he suddenly produces a six, flicked into the Mound Stand off Stoinis. That\u2019s the first six of the day, as the world\u2019s best players do their best to turn the 50-over game into Test cricket. 23rd over: NZ 77-2 (Williamson 23, Taylor 18) As a captain, you have to treat yourself the same way you treat your troops, so Finch banishes himself after a single over, same as Smith. He continues the merry-go-round by sending for Maxwell. The batsmen say thank you very much and enjoy their cartons of milk. Has Finch been too funky? 22nd over: NZ 73-2 (Williamson 22, Taylor 15) Finch makes his fourth bowling change in four overs as Behrendorff finally gets a rest and Marcus Stoinis comes on. The past two overs have been a drink in the desert for the batsmen. 21st over: NZ 68-2 (Williamson 19, Taylor 14) Finch has now officially jumped the shark. He takes Smith off after one over and brings on... himself! One ball is straight from club cricket, a full toss that would be a wide down leg had Taylor not swatted it for four. That;\u2019s the first boundary for nine overs. 20th over: NZ 61-2 (Williamson 18, Taylor 8) Behrendorff is bowling his ninth over, which is refreshing. Though not for him in this heat, and he shows it by serving up two wides. The legitimate deliveries are on the spot as ever, with one bringing not so much a shout for LBW against Taylor as a plea. It was turned down, rightly, as the ball pitched just outside leg. So the second batch of ten overs produced even fewer runs than the first \u2013 30 rather than 31. 19th over: NZ 57-2 (Williamson 17, Taylor 7) Aaron Finch may not have got runs today, but he\u2019s on fire with his captaincy. He sees Lyon doing so well (3-0-6-0) and takes him off, perhaps for a change of ends. And he brings on... Steve Smith, with his part-time leg-breaks. I thought I was joking when I said he might get a three-for. 18th over: NZ 53-2 (Williamson 15, Taylor 5) Williamson breaks the shackles for a moment, cutting Behrendorff for two, and then he\u2019s dropped again! And again there\u2019s no blame attached, as it was a slower ball and Carey did well to get a fingertip to it, diving away to his right. Williamson is the cat who\u2019s got away with giving two quarter-chances. 17th over: NZ 49-2 (Williamson 12, Taylor 4) Lyon beats Taylor with an arm ball and pushes Williamson into a lap, off middle stump, which would be plumb LBW had he not got a whisper of glove on it. In the last five overs, NZ have managed 9-1. They need to assert themselves, by hook or by crook. 16th over: NZ 47-2 (Williamson 11, Taylor 3) Behrendorff continues to make anyone who thought he was due a bad day (17:30) look stupid. He got that out of his system in his first spell (2-0-11-0) and has been immaculate in his second (5-0-11-2). And that\u2019s drinks, with Australia resurgent. Much will hinge on whether Williamson and Taylor survive long enough to tuck into Stoinis and Maxwell. 15th over: NZ 46-2 (Williamson 11, Taylor 2) Lyon is getting some turn and he has Williamson dropped by Smith at slip, off Carey\u2019s pad was it? Yes, his knee. Lyon did so well, tossing it up and luring Williamson into a drive. It was tough to adjust for Smith, but he hangs his head, knowing he may have dropped the match. The win predictor has swung to 53-47: still favouring NZ, but beautifully poised. 14th over: NZ 44-2 (Williamson 10, Taylor 1) The replays show that Guptill missed that one by some way. It was only brushing the outside of leg stump, but would have been umpire\u2019s call, so a review wouldn\u2019t have saved him. Congrats to Behrendorff, who now has seven wickets at Lord\u2019s this week, and to Finch for bringing him back after an anodyne opening spell. One of Guptill\u2019s least explosive innings turns out to be a damp squib as he misses an inswinger. Game on. 13th over: NZ 42-1 (Guptill 20, Williamson 10) Finch, who knows he has to get Williamson early, turns to Nathan Lyon and gives him a short leg, square and deepish (while not nearly as deep as the mysterious stationary man in the 10th over). Both batsmen treat him warily. 12th over: NZ 40-1 (Guptill 19, Williamson 9) Williamson sees Behrendorff drop only slightly short, jumps back and plays a push-cut for four. He can smell victory here. \u201cI\u2019m curious,\u201d says Geoff Wignall, \u201cas to why a hat-trick is a live-blogger\u2019s nightmare [17:18 and 17:26]. Doesn\u2019t the change of batsman provide as much time as you\u2019d normally expect between overs?\u201d Geoff, are you being logical? About writing? What you\u2019re saying ought to be the case, but (at the risk of going all first-world-problems) any wicket is hard work and three in a row are a headache. The phrase \u201cdidn\u2019t trouble the scorers\u201d, as the late Bill Frindall liked to say, is exactly the wrong way round: it should be for a 0 not out. 11th over: NZ 33-1 (Guptill 18, Williamson 3) Williamson thinks about holding a masterclass by playing a back-foot prod under his eyes, but then Cummins runs one down the slope and even Williamson is pushing at thin air. \u201cNip\u2019n\u2019tuck,\u201d declares Ian Smith. True enough: we\u2019ve seen very few runs, but it\u2019s been quietly fascinating. 10th over: NZ 31-1 (Guptill 17, Williamson 2) In comes Kane Williamson, one of the maestros of this World Cup. Finch does have a plan for him: get him chipping to leg \u2013 suddenly there\u2019s a short midwicket and a stationary square leg, 20 yards back but trying to look like a catcher. Williamson, calm as ever, softens his hands, nudges to the stationary man\u2019s right and gets off the mark with a speedy two. Behrendorff strikes again! With an awful ball! It was down the leg side, and would have been a wide, had Nicholls not feathered it to give Carey a simple catch. 9th over: NZ 29-0 (Guptill 17, Nicholls 8) A maiden from Cummins to Guptill. The Australians don\u2019t need to win this one, but they clearly want to. An email from our resident schoolkid. \u201cCricket-lovers are as sporting as Mr Lemon,\u201d says OB Jato, \u201cwhen they co-host a critically-acclaimed podcast where they can read out their love letters to one of the best bowlers of the modern era, appreciating his hat-trick in the process. The Final Word Daily Review during the World Cup has been an essential feature of my mornings while I get ready for school... Good going, sir, and hoping to hear a rant arrive in my inbox tomorrow about why heart patients should not watch Pakistan, ever!\u201d 8th over: NZ 29-0 (Guptill 17, Nicholls 8) Another little victory for NZ as Finch takes Starc off and brings back Behrendorff. He bowls a better over and has a noisy shout for LBW against Guptill, around leg stump. Finch prefers not to review; HawkEye says it was hitting, but would have been umpire\u2019s call. And here\u2019s the reassuring sound of Brian Withington. \u201cCare to venture an English perspective on who we should be rooting for today? Geoff adroitly ducked the question earlier - I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s immaterial if we can\u2019t beat India, but what\u2019s your take?\u201d It\u2019s not a game in which England have much skin. A defeat for NZ would mean two in a row and a dent to the confidence before England face them on Wednesday, but it would also mean that they would need to win that game, so it seems much of a muchness. 7th over: NZ 28-0 (Guptill 16, Nicholls 8) Nicholls keeps Cummins out, seeing a bouncer early and declining to have a bite of it. Brendon McCullum, ace captain turned commentator, reckons the Aussies have no particular plan for Nicholls \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s just a safe field\u201d. The win predictor is saying NZ 76 per cent, Australia 24, which feels about right. 6th over: NZ 27-0 (Guptill 15, Nicholls 8) Nicholls has been getting so little of the strike that he may suspect Guptill sees him as a tailender. Now he faces Starc, and immediately gets a 95mph half-volley which he pushes back past the bowler with the minimum of fuss. When Starc strays onto his pads, he tucks him away for four more. When Starc bounces him, the lift is so extravagant that it\u2019s a wide. 5th over: NZ 18-0 (Guptill 15, Nicholls 0) Aaron Finch has lost patience with Behrendorff already. He brings on Pat Cummins, who presents Guptill with a friendly loosener, tickled for four. With his fifth ball, Cummins gets everything right, jagging one down the slope and beating the bat. Pakistan have won that nail-biter, so they go above England, who are now out of the top four. England have a game in hand, but it\u2019s against India, the only invincibles so far. 4th over: NZ 14-0 (Guptill 11, Nicholls 0) Starc keeps Guptill quiet, conceding only a wide and a single off the edge to third man, which may have been a leg bye. 3rd over: NZ 12-0 (Guptill 11, Nicholls 0) Behrendorff is looking much the gentler of these two propositions. When he drops a touch short, Guptill chops for two; when he goes a touch full, Guptill drives for four. When he goes down the leg side, it\u2019s a wide, and when he goes both full and leg-ish, Guptill clips him for three. Experience telling. 2nd over: NZ 2-0 (Guptill 2, Nicholls 0) Mitchell Starc, who\u2019s been immense in this World Cup, saws Guptill in half, twice, by bringing the ball back into the right-hander and getting steep bounce. Meanwhile, the other game has come down to a classic finish: Pakistan need 18 off three overs, Afghanistan need three wickets. Permission to join Rob Smyth. 1st over: NZ 1-0 (Guptill 1, Nicholls 0) It is Jason Behrendorff, lolloping in from the Nursery End. Martin Guptill takes a firm stride forward to push the first ball for a nice, solid, nerve-settling single. He has a new partner, Henry Nicholls, who replaces Colin Munro. He\u2019s twitchy between deliveries and watchful when they arrive. A line from the old lags. \u201cGet in, stay in,\u201d says Ian Smith, from the crease. \u201cThat\u2019s the key for New Zealand.\u201d Michael Clarke makes the same point in different words: \u201cOne of the top four has to get a hundred.\u201d He expects Behrendorff to open the bowling again, after his shock five-for, also at Lord\u2019s, against England. But old mother cricket may have something to say about that: she\u2019s like a teacher who\u2019s always looking to share the form prize around. Correction. A hat-trick is not every live-blogger\u2019s nightmare. \u201cGlad to get the chance of a hat-trick,\u201d says Geoff, amiable as ever. \u201cGood times.\u201d Have Australian cricket-lovers always been this sporting? Hello everyone, thanks Geoff and commiserations on the hat-trick \u2013 every live-blogger\u2019s nightmare. So New Zealand have shown the world how to deal with Australia\u2019s opening batsmen. Can they do the same with the opening bowlers? That\u2019s where this game is likely to be won and lost. New Zealand have so much time, they may opt to see off Starc and Cummins \u2013 but that could be risky with this surface offering something to all the bowlers, even the part-time spinner. What price a Steve Smith three-for? An exciting finish for New Zealand, and they\u2019ll go into the rooms with the buzz of having nearly bowled Australia out. However, they still missed a trick in not applying more pressure earlier in the Australian innings. Boult didn\u2019t bowl for 30 overs through the middle, while Khawaja and Carey were running away with a substantial partnership. Williamson could have attacked more purposefully when Australia were 92-5. Instead they were allowed to recover to 199 before the next wicket fell. Mind you, Khawaja was dropped twice. 244 isn\u2019t the biggest target, but it could be tough on this surface against some good bowling. It looks like the wicket will spin, which will bring Lyon into play, and it looks abrasive enough to produce reverse swing, which does nicely for Mitchell Starc. Imagine the way Boult finished the innings but add 15 kilometres per hour. New Zealand have a tough fight on their hands, but if they can win this chase then they\u2019ll lay a marker. That\u2019s enough from me \u2013 thanks for all your emails and tweets, and you can now direct them to Tim de Lisle for the chase. 50th over: Australia 243-6 (Cummins 23, Lyon 0) Four in four for Trent Boult? Nearly! Nathan Lyon steps across outside off and tries to ramp. The ball hits his pad and bounces through to Latham, who tries to throw down the stumps and run him out. No dice. But three wickets and two runs from the final over for Boult to keep Australia short of 250. IT\u2019S A HAT-TRICK FOR TRENT BOULT! The Australians review, just to deflate the moment a bit, but that\u2019s not going to be overturned. Behrendorff a right-hander gets a ball swinging into him from left-arm over the wicket, beating his defensive shot and hitting his back boot, I think, in front of leg stump. That\u2019s out. First ball! Boult on a hat-trick. Mitchell Starc dishes out a lot of those, and now he gets one back. In-swing, full, and Starc plays across it and misses as the ball cleans him up middle and off stump. Lovely delivery. Through him! Khawaja steps across to the off side hoping to open up space on leg. Boult delivered a yorker, a bit of swing helping it tail towards leg stump. Khawaja might have got a touch on it, might not, but either way it sneaks past his bat, past his heel, and clips his leg stump. Outski. Vital innings from Khawaja, who made 89 against Bangladesh, 89 in a warm-up against Sri Lanka, and 88 here today. Hasn\u2019t had the enjoyment of raising a hundred, but if Australia win today then he\u2019ll be the key. 49th over: Australia 241-6 (Khawaja 87, Cummins 22) Ferguson with the penultimate over. A couple of singles, then Khawaja misses the lot as he tries to uppercut. Swings a pull shot away for a single next ball. That\u2019s alright, because Cummins is scoring faster than Usman. A nice thick edge to third man for a brace, then Ferguson errs with a full toss and Cummins smacks it through cover for four! He\u2019s making an impression with the bat. Meanwhile, Pakistan have lost a fifth wicket, with the score on 146 chasing 228. Hmmmm. 48th over: Australia 232-6 (Khawaja 85, Cummins 15) Boult now, and Cummins gets off strike with a nudge. Khawaja bowls a beautiful yorker to himself, charging a length ball and making it very full. But he gets a lucky boundary out of it by squeezing it past the keeper. Then a single, letting Cummins glide two more. The runs flow. 47th over: Australia 224-6 (Khawaja 80, Cummins 12) The 47th over is the Cummins show. Leg-spin is more his speed. He goes hard at Sodhi, with mixed degrees of aesthetic but remarkably consistent utility. He nails one big slog sweep, knocked down in the deep. Slices a shot that falls safely past mid-off. Slices another that hangs in the air for an eternity, but Boult coming up from long-on doesn\u2019t commit to the dive. The bowler himself might have trekked back to that more effectively. Finally there\u2019s another slog sweep, connected cleanly, smoked to the deep. And all of those shots are worth? Two runs each. Why bother looking good? Just score. Cummins takes a single to keep the strike. 46th over: Australia 215-6 (Khawaja 80, Cummins 3) Ferguson misses his line once in that over and gets carved away for four over backward point. Khawaja up and running. A single though brings Cummins on strike, and he\u2019s not doing much against the bouncers coming his way. Kenrick Riley emails in. \u201cToday\u2019s team is rather good looking. Would you ruminate on what changes might be made for the Test series?\u201d I assume you mean the Australian team, in which case there\u2019s a fair bit of overlap with the possible Ashes team. The differences would be that the Finch experiment has been tried in Test cricket, and unless he had a go in the middle order, I don\u2019t think they would want to disrupt his white-ball game again by a reprise. Warner will open, Khawaja three, Smith four. Probably five is Travis Head. I\u2019d love them to punt on Maxwell at six, but Kurtis Patterson probably has a last-start claim on that spot. Tim Paine will keep ahead of Carey, and Josh Hazlewood will come in for Behrendorff. Starc, Lyon and Cummins will remain. 45th over: Australia 209-6 (Khawaja 75, Cummins 2) Slapped by Khawaja. The reverse-sweep really is his pet shot against spin, and he plays it better than just about anyone in the world I reckon. Nails yet another from Sodhi, over backward point and into the gap for six. Sodhi has had a strange old day. 44th over: Australia 202-6 (Khawaja 69, Cummins 1) What an over from Ferguson. He\u2019s been fast and furious all day, but accurate too. Bowls a perfect bouncer that Khawaja has to evade, then a slower ball mistimed straight to the field, then another textbook bouncer. Ferguson has been right at the helmet every time he\u2019s gone short today. 43rd over: Australia 199-6 (Khawaja 67) Williamson has 1 for 25, taking that wicket from the final ball of his seventh over. Carey was brilliant, getting Australia out of jail, and they\u2019re a chance to make a reasonable score. Pat Cummins will be next in, and he can bat. A situation like this might suit him more than usual, because he has a few overs and just needs to bat, rather than slog. Finally New Zealand break through. The ball has followed Guptill all day, to mixed results, but he catches that one. Williamson tosses up, Carey tries to loft over cover, but only lifts it straight to the man stationed there. 42nd over: Australia 194-5 (Khawaja 64, Carey 69) Not quite timing things as easily off Boult this over, as Carey chips over cover, then flicks a single to move to 69. Nice. The century partnership comes up as well. 41st over: Australia 190-5 (Khawaja 63, Carey 66) Williamson burgles another over. He\u2019s bowled six of them for 20 runs. Meanwhile he\u2019s got two specialist spinners in his team who have bowled seven overs between them. \u201cCan you clear something up for me?\u201d asks John Spencer. \u201cFrom an English perspective who should we be cheering for today?\u201d I would have thought that morally the English would want Australia to lose anytime. And if Australia win they\u2019ll probably top the table, which means England would play Australia in a semi if finishing fourth. But then if New Zealand beat Australia and top the table, England would play New Zealand two games in a row. That might make England feel more like it\u2019s a nice bilateral series, in which case they\u2019ll win? I don\u2019t know where we\u2019ve arrived, to be honest. 40th over: Australia 188-5 (Khawaja 62, Carey 65) Here\u2019s Boult, with four overs in hand from his allotment. Carey doesn\u2019t time the first couple, but when Boult rather floats one up, Carey off-drives it perfectly for four. What timing. He\u2019s now made 102 from 90 balls at this ground in the World Cup, unbeaten thus far. The partnership is 96! New Zealand have literally and figuratively dropped the ball today. 39th over: Australia 182-5 (Khawaja 62, Carey 60) Williamson is still doing the job, including drawing a thick edge from Carey that hits the keeper Latham and bounces off him. Not really a catching chance at that pace, with Carey aiming a full-blooded cover drive at it. Four from the over. 38th over: Australia 178-5 (Khawaja 59, Carey 59) Good Lord\u2019s, Alex Carey. He is in some touch today. Ferguson comes back, looking to muscle out some wickets, but instead Carey crashes away a pull shot with perfect timing. Middled that for four. That was after he\u2019d cut a couple of runs, half saved by Guptill to stop it zooming away towards the Warner Stand. Nice of them to name one after Little Davey. Carey has caught up to Khawaja, and also gone to his highest ODI score out of his three half-centuries so far. 37th over: Australia 172-5 (Khawaja 59, Carey 53) Williamson will keep himself on forever at this rate. He drops Khawaja into a pot of glue, thrashing around for five deliveries before he can find a single. \u201cVis-\u00e0-vis Shannon\u2019s comments,\u201d writes Reg Gorczynski, who has obviously found the accent function on his keyboard, and well done, \u201cI\u2019m following both games from Toronto. My niece (in Yorkshire) is an avid NZ fan, to my dismay (I\u2019m an England fan of course)\u2026 I\u2019m avoiding contacting her as NZ are faring so well, as indeed are Pakistan, which drives us deeper into a hole\u2026 I feel for the Aussie waiter!\u201d 36th over: Australia 170-5 (Khawaja 58, Carey 52) There\u2019s the first false shot from Carey. Unfortunately for Neesham it comes off an inside edge past off stump and cuts back inside the keeper to race for four. That\u2019s after Carey had slapped a pull shot for a boundary. The second of those raises his fifty, and he\u2019s up past a run a ball as well. 35th over: Australia 160-5 (Khawaja 57, Carey 43) Williamson rattles through another over for four singles, seeing if he can sneak through his full ten before Australia notice. 34th over: Australia 156-5 (Khawaja 55, Carey 41) De Grandhomme bowls a few on the spot to Carey, dotting him up, but strays too short and Carey nails his pull for four. Every big shot he\u2019s played has been crisp and sure. 33rd over: Australia 150-5 (Khawaja 54, Carey 36) Williamson continuing with his off-breaks. Presumably with two left-handers in, he wants to turn the ball away from them rather than have Sodhi spinning it in. So the skipper keeps tossing the ball up, trying to tempt something excessive from the batsmen. Three singles from the over. 32nd over: Australia 147-5 (Khawaja 53, Carey 34) The Kiwis are letting this slip, I fancy. A fifty up for Khawaja, who has been dropped twice. A fifty partnership up for this pair as well, in good time. Six from the de Grandhomme over. Carey scoring with relative ease and not much risk. \u201cDo I have enough credit in the OBI bank to be permitted to play the cameo role of jaundiced English observer for just a moment?\u201d Alright Brian Withington, here\u2019s your chance. \u201cWhere exactly do Australia keep their on/off switch? Would be nice to know because England\u2019s is currently missing (or stuck). So great to see NZ warming up ominously for their last game, too.\u201d Australia has been off for just under four years. It\u2019s just that the on switch has accommodated a couple of World Cup campaigns. 31st over: Australia 141-5 (Khawaja 49, Carey 32) Kane Williamson having a bowl. He did get a wicket against Pakistan, but that was Mohammad Hafeez, who specialises in getting out to part-time spinners. The singles keep coming, and a fat nick (not Santa Claus) from Khawaja\u2019s bat. 30th over: Australia 136-5 (Khawaja 45, Carey 31) De Grandhomme goes for five runs. I\u2019ve been distracted by trying to upload a photo from Peter Kell, which holds the answer to the mystery about throwing cricket bats off trains. But I can\u2019t make the picture work. It\u2019s of a sign on a Swedish train, I think banning vodka bottles or similar? It does look a bit like a cricket bat, I can confirm. Visual gags don\u2019t work so well without the visual, sorry. 29th over: Australia 131-5 (Khawaja 44, Carey 27) Ferguson is using the short-pitched attack at Carey, sizzling one past him. Similiar to the Warner ball, but Carey dropped his gloves successfully. A couple more follow, then a gimme ball on leg stump that Carey clouts through square for four. Back and forth the needle goes. 28th over: Australia 126-5 (Khawaja 43, Carey 23) Colin de Grandhomme is back for Neesham, like for like. Tight in line and length, giving away only two singles. Here\u2019s a lovely email. \u201cFollowing the CWC on guardian in Sweden on Inlandsbanan train going north to the Arctic circle. Swedes are curious about cricket. Here it looks like they are saying don\u2019t throw cricket bats out of the train! Best wishes. Keep the great comments on CWC.\u201d Peter Kell, thanks for your message. I don\u2019t entirely follow your meaning about the bats, but throwing cricket bats out of a train sounds fun. So if you\u2019re going to do it, count me in. 27th over: Australia 124-5 (Khawaja 42, Carey 22) Here is Ferguson on cue. He\u2019s swung around to the Pavilion End, perhaps hoping to use the slope to jag his short balls across Khawaja from leg stump to off. Khawaja jams a yorker, then uses that angle for a single to third man. Carey isn\u2019t intimidated, driving through cover again for four! He\u2019s in wonderful touch in this series, and perhaps this is Carey\u2019s chance to do more than slice and slash 30 or 40 in the dying overs. \u201cWelcome as it is to come across Tom Eliot quotes on the OBO, I suspect they might be better saved for the England inquest in a few days,\u201d write Geoff Wignall. \u201cAs examples: the \u2018vacant interstellar spaces\u2019 (have I remembered that right?) of the Vince defensive technique. The leadership\u2019s tactical \u2018thought\u2019. Or maybe the sometime need to be \u2018still and still moving\u2019, as exemplified by Root but ignored by most. Fear in a handful of dust might yet represent the Ashes campaign.\u201d In the rooms the batsmen come and go, talking of Michaelangelo. 26th over: Australia 118-5 (Khawaja 41, Carey 17) I\u2019d be very inclined to get Ferguson back on. Go for the win now. He\u2019s only bowled four overs, and one more wicket all but does the job for New Zealand. Neesham continues, and Carey plays another perfect cover drive for four. 25th over: Australia 112-5 (Khawaja 40, Carey 12) Khawaja is going serenely along, putting his close scrapes out of mind. He\u2019s got the reverse sweep going nicely against Santner, who is turning the ball into the left-hander. Khawaja cracked the code for this shot in Dubai last October, where he reversed the leg-spinner Yasir Shah to distraction while saving an unsalvageable Test against Pakistan. 24th over: Australia 108-5 (Khawaja 37, Carey 11) Neesham in to Khawaja and another catch is dropped! They\u2019ve taken some rippers and dropped some mediums, and that was a medium. It would have been a good stretch from Latham behind the wicket, high and to his left with one glove, but it wasn\u2019t flying off the outside edge, and another keeper would have held that. Khawaja does tend to go after wide balls, and he\u2019s reprieved for a second time. 23rd over: Australia 105-5 (Khawaja 35, Carey 10) Huge leg-before shout against Khawaja, who\u2019s beaten by sharp turn from Santer spinning into the left-hander. It hits Khawaja on his back leg, but could have been going down leg side or possibly bouncing over. I suspect that would have been clipping, umpire\u2019s call. NZ don\u2019t bother going upstairs. Khawaja gets off strike next ball, and Carey reverse-sweeps for four! Audacious shot, but smart enough with one man behind point and a big gap. It beats the cover sweeper running around, the shot gorgeously placed. 22nd over: Australia 97-5 (Khawaja 32, Carey 5) Alex Carey is next in, and picks up where he left off against England here a few days ago. He laces Neesham through cover from his second ball for four. What a catch! Another stunner from New Zealand, this time from Neesham. Maxwell likes to take on the short ball, but he\u2019s taking on a slowish seamer on a slowish surface. The ball stops on him, taking the toe end of his bat. That shouldn\u2019t matter, it should just be lobbing away towards short cover for a dot ball. But Neesham is on the right foot for a dive, and hurls himself over away from the pitch. At six-foot-plenty, he just gets a hand under the ball. 21st over: Australia 92-4 (Khawaja 32, Maxwell 1) Mitchell Santner comes on for his first roll of the arm, left-arm orthodox, and Khawaja wants to take him on straight away. Unsettle him. So the batsman carves away behind point, and a diving attempt in the deep can\u2019t stop four. Santner is affected, because he bowls too far leg side after that, and while Khawaja\u2019s genuflecting sweep doesn\u2019t make contact, the ball rolls for four extra wides. Maxwell gets off the mark with a nudge to fine leg. 20th over: Australia 81-4 (Khawaja 27) So Stoinis is out from the last ball of the over. He hasn\u2019t done the job with the bat at all in this tournament, and the lack of all-rounder backup is an ongoing problem for Australia. It hasn\u2019t cost them yet, but it might. A lot riding on Khawaja now. And Glenn Maxwell walks to the middle, with plenty of time left in the game for once. He needs to play accordingly, as he did on occasional in India and the UAE recently. That partnership ends. Neesham would have been the bowler Australia was least worried about, but his line there was immaculate. Just on the off stump, using the Lord\u2019s slope to deck away a touch, and Stoinis was just coming forward in defence and got a thin edge. Fine bowling. 18th over: Australia 72-3 (Khawaja 24, Stoinis 17) Jimmy Neesham comes on with his medium-pacers, and he settles into a nice tight line. Khawaja drives powerfully a couple of times, but can only drive straight and the field is well set for it. Just the one single for Stoinis from the first ball. Shannon Campell is writing in from Deutschland, Deutschland, uber alles. \u201cHi Geoff, I\u2019m following the OBO while catering a very swanky affair in Berlins western suburbs. I\u2019ve already spilled a little anti pasti on my screen and im surrounded by Germans who are completely oblivious to what\u2019s going in in the cricket world. Then I hear a little groan and I see one of the waiting staff checking his phone as Ferguson does for Warne, I think I might have an Aussie here, which spices things up enormously! 19th over: Australia 77-3 (Khawaja 26, Stoinis 20) This pair have added 30 now, and they\u2019re looking decent. Three more singles from Sodhi\u2019s over as they just look to hang in there. Pakistan are chasing 227 at Headingley and have lost an early wicket, Fakhar Zaman out to the young spinner Mujeeb. 17th over: Australia 72-3 (Khawaja 24, Stoinis 17) Sodhi is bowling nicely here, using a lot of flight, throwing in a googly that hits Stoinis on the pad and draws a loud appeal. Khawaja sweeps a couple, and that\u2019s never his most convincing shot. He plays the reverse well when the ball is outside off, but his conventional sweep is often a bit heart-in-mouth. Here\u2019s Phil Withall. \u201cThis morning, on my walk to work, I caught up with the latest episode of the excellent The Spin podcast. In it the panel unanimously dismissed New Zealand as a threat to England\u2019s qualification hopes. I was more than a little sceptical when I heard that statement, I am more so now.\u201d I hope that wasn\u2019t the episode I was on? I\u2019d never say such a thing. \u201cThe Kiwis are so much more than they would appear on paper, a true collective of talent and camaraderie that could well be the dark horse the tournament needs. Even as an Englishman who has suffered so much pain during the 18 years I\u2019ve lived in Australia I\u2019d be very happy if they knocked England out and went on to upset millions of people and win the thing.\u201d 16th over: Australia 68-3 (Khawaja 21, Stoinis 16) Ferguson carries on, and this is some spell. First he zings through a proper bouncer that has Khawaja leaping out of the way. Then, after Usman flays away a single with some trepidation, Stoinis is very nearly caught at mid-off. Stoinis can\u2019t time his drive, and Ferguson\u2019s pace sees it carry, and carry, then just bounce short of Williamson diving forward. The Kiwi skipper shakes his head ruefully at his bowler. So Ferguson goes back to the well and bowls the yorker he bowled to Faf du Plessis, except Stoinis is just able to jam down in a puff of dirt and adrenaline. \u201cI will show you fear in a handful of dust.\u201d 15th over: Australia 61-3 (Khawaja 20, Stoinis 16) Stoinis is keen to get things going, so he takes on Sodhi and plays a lofted swat over mid-on. Less controlled than his cover drive, I can assure you. But gets away with it. Then a couple of singles follow. A little partnership forming. 14th over: Australia 61-3 (Khawaja 19, Stoinis 11) That is luvvverly from Stoinis. He has been in very average nick for a long while with the bat, but he does have clean strokeplay when he gets going. Could today be the day? He drives Ferguson on the up through cover for four. 13th over: Australia 55-3 (Khawaja 18, Stoinis 6) Ish Sodhi comes on for his first over of leg-spin. No immediate dramas, as the Australians collect five singles. John Ryan emailed before the last two wickets fell to ask what a good score was on this pitch, suggesting 270. I think that was about right, but Australia would do well to get 250 from here. 12th over: Australia 50-3 (Khawaja 15, Stoinis 4) Australia juggle the batting order with so many overs to go, and send in Stoinis ahead of Maxwell. Good move, as Stoinis also likes time to build into an innings. He gets a bonus boundary courtesy of Boult, who inexplicably fumbles while picking the ball up at third man and drops it while falling over the rope, only for it to roll onto the rope itself. Australia\u2019s 50 is up, but their three biggest guns have been decommissioned. What a catch! Third time lucky for Guptill. He\u2019s dropped a tough one, a straightforward one, and now he snares a worldly one. Ferguson\u2019s pace does for Smith, who is trying to hook a short ball but got it high on the splice. It goes flat rather than up, but Guptill at backward square leg takes off to his left and takes it one-handed away from his body. Exceptional, and Australia are rocking. 11th over: Australia 45-2 (Khawaja 14, Smith 5) Boult carries on, into his sixth. How many overs of his strike bowler will Williamson use? Smith drives down through long-on ground and strolls back for a third run. 10th over: Australia 40-2 (Khawaja 12, Smith 2) Another fumble for Guptill in the gully, who is being given a horror day by the ball. Smith skews a shot past him on the bounce for two. Ten overs done, a slow start for Australia and their two most prolific batsmen gone. This is now very interesting. What a delivery! What a start from Lockie Ferguson! First ball he bowls! Excuse the exclamation marks, but I\u2019m exclaiming. Ferguson has been held back. He\u2019s fast. He\u2019s fierce. He has 15 wickets already in the World Cup, then he goes to 16 with his first ball in the match. It takes off from a fullish length, it rears at Warner like a viper, and though the batsman sways back to get out of the way, it flicks his glove as it soars through to Latham. Unbelievable bowling. 9th over: Australia 38-1 (Warner 16, Khawaja 12) Now it\u2019s Khawaja\u2019s turn to get moving, comfortably collecting a pair of twos from Boult, then glancing four fine. When Khawaja is scoring effortlessly, it\u2019s a real problem for opponents. He can cruise when conditions are right. And he likes making runs against New Zealand. 8th over: Australia 30-1 (Warner 16, Khawaja 4) Warner is warming into his task, as he strides forward and whacks de Grandhomme with a lot of wrist back through mid-off. That was a kind of hockey slap more than a drive. \u201cI always support Australia but two things worry me about today\u2019s match,\u201d writes Kev McMahon. No one named Kev could support anyone but Australia, surely? \u201cFirstly, it\u2019s a dead rubber - we\u2019re already in the semis, so will we care? (Historically, no.) Secondly, NZ plays better against Australia than anyone else. They hate losing to us, and fair enough too. Their memories go back way before any sandpaper...\u201d Their memories sure do, but they still tend to lose to Australia most of the time, unless someone named Hadlee is playing. 7th over: Australia 25-1 (Warner 12, Khawaja 3) Another close call for Australia, and Guptill, as Warner shapes to cut but is surprised by bounce from Boult, and ends up toe-ending the ball over point and over Guptill\u2019s leap. Two runs result, then Warner feels more in control when he gets a ball whose shorter length he can read, and pull for four. 6th over: Australia 19-1 (Warner 6, Khawaja 3) Pretty ropey start from Khawaja, who prods around at de Grandhomme\u2019s medium pace offerings before eventually knocking two runs to the leg side. I wonder if this is David Warner\u2019s lowest score after six overs of a one-day innings. \u201cNo,\u201d writes Amod Paranjape sternly in answer to my earlier question. \u201cNew Zealand is going to win, mate as is Afghanistan. Gut Instinct.\u201d If you want to follow Afghanistan\u2019s progress as they finish their batting innings, Tom Davies has you covered. 5th over: Australia 16-1 (Warner 6, Khawaja 1) The one consolation for Australia is that Khawaja bats best in one-dayers when he has plenty of time to get in, and time in the Powerplay. He has both now. But he\u2019s almost sent back straight away, except Guptill drops another one! This was more straightforward, at slip this time. Leaning away to his right but it came direct and high enough to take. Boult should have had two. What will that cost? \u201cMorning Geoff, morning everyone,\u201d writes Andrew Cosgrove in true Richie style. \u201cI\u2019m sitting in South London, wishing I was at Lord\u2019s. It\u2019s a beautiful day, and this could be a cracker. A lot will depend on whether Guptill can get out of this slump of form, and whether new man Nicholls can do better than Monroe. It would be interesting to see what Williamson and Taylor can do with a platform, rather than having to rescue a disastrous start again. Taylor feels like he\u2019s due a score, it seems like he has done OK without reaching the heights we know he is capable of. But really, it all comes down to whether the Aussies can get Williamson early. They look worryingly like they are hitting form at just the wrong (or right, from your point of view, I guess) time.\u201d Scott Lowe called it. Boult strikes early, over the wicket, a bit of shape on the ball and it came back into Finch, beating his inside edge and striking him a bit high but right back in front of his stumps. Finch has just gone past 500 runs for the tournament, but he\u2019s been key to almost all of Australia\u2019s wins. Big loss. 4th over: Australia 11-0 (Warner 6, Finch 4) If you\u2019re labouring under the misapprehension that we know everything at the Guardian, I only just realised that Colin de Grandhomme bowled the second over. I just assumed it would be Lockie Ferguson, but Williamson must be hoarding his fast-bowling resources given he only has two front-line options. Watching live rather than on TV, I spent the entire second over wondering why Ferguson had changed his run-up and made it so short. And why he looked slow through the air and was bowling neat out-swingers. Anyway, that\u2019s all airbrushed out of history now. De Grandhomme keeps his second over almost as tidy as his first, three runs. 3rd over: Australia 8-0 (Warner 5, Finch 3) First run of the day for Australia comes in the third over, as Boult gets too straight and Warner nudges a single. But they flow thereafter as Boult stays on the pads for both batsmen, with Finch whipping a couple through midwicket to provoke a great chase and save from Neesham, then gliding a single, before Warner whips four in similar fashion. 2nd over: Australia 0-0 (Warner 0, Finch 0) Colin de Grandhomme from the Nursery End now. He has Finch defending, then driving to cover, then dropped! Very tough chance. They\u2019ve packed the off-side field to let Ferguson attack off stump. Guptill is in at a very short cover, and Finch drives hard, hit it flush, and Guptill dives across to save. The ball carried but was struck so hard that it bounced off his hand. Morally that\u2019s four runs saved rather than a catch gone down. Finch cracks another drive straight to mid-off. The Kiwis are switched on today. Another maiden. \u201cHi Geoff,\u201d writes Anna Halford. \u201cVery excited about the trans-Tasman clash today (Kiwi supporter). Deep respect for the Aus bowling attack, though, and they\u2019ll have their tails up from the England match too, which is worse. Following from Cameroon on a mobile signal so the OBO is my only link with the day\u2019s play - I\u2019m counting on you. Hoping to be raising a beer to a Black Cap victory later!\u201d Once more into the break for you and all, Anna. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (Warner 0, Finch 0) And we are away! Trent Boult to start things off to Warner. Boult is bowling left-arm swing from the Pavilion End, and he\u2019s swinging it immediately. Warner is content to cover up and wait. Once punch nearly squeaks through cover, but is well fielded. One ball from Boult holds its line and takes a thick edge on the bounce to gully. A maiden to start. Since you might all be sick of me before long, I\u2019ll start with a very kind email from Brian Withington. \u201cJust finished luxuriating in your sublime description of the Mitchell Starc dismissal of Ben Stokes, he gushed. I particularly enjoyed your metaphor of the relaxed wrist \u2018opening a warm bread roll\u2019, which brought back fond memories of the Duckworth-Lewis celebration of Shane Warne\u2019s ball of the last century https://youtu.be/wa_iG_W0gvk, with its imaginary \u2018cheese roll\u2019 that would never have evaded the bemused Mike Gatting.\u201d Thanks Brian. If you want a longer pre-match read, here it is. Who says I can\u2019t write 1500 words on one delivery? Ten minutes to go, with the anthems and all that stuff to come. You can fill in a minute by reading Virat Kohli\u2019s assessment (with some sympathy) of the England team\u2019s current predicament. He\u2019s not shy of an answer, Kohli. What is everybody\u2019s hunch today? It feels like a comfortable Australian win for me. New Zealand have won a lot of games but had some tight squeezes. Australia have won the toss on a batting day. They still don\u2019t look like a complete team: they\u2019ve won their matches based on some big opening partnerships, a couple of handy score boosts from Smith and Maxwell, and consistent genius bowling by Starc backed by dot-ball pressure from Cummins. A couple of other players have made cameos. But ultimately Australia have been consistent, even if they have parts of the XI that don\u2019t click. Two changes for the Kiwis, with pacer Matt Henry making way for leg-spinner Ish Sodhi, and opening bat Colin Munro dropped for Henry Nicholls after a poor run of form. One Henry in, one out. But still a Colin, thankfully. Martin Guptill Henry Nicholls Kane Williamson Ross Taylor Tom Latham Jimmy Neesham Colin de Grandhomme Mitchell Santner Ish Sodhi Lockie Ferguson Trent Boult No changes for Australia, who go in with the team that beat England. Aaron Finch * David Warner Usman Khawaja Steve Smith Glenn Maxwell Marcus Stoinis Alex Carey Patrick Cummins Mitchell Starc Nathan Lyon Jason Behrendorff That\u2019s a bit advantage for the green and gold. Runs on the board will be key today. It\u2019s a used pitch, and even the two fresh ones here this week have been slow and hard to time shots on. As always, you are the OBO and the OBO is you. Get involved with today\u2019s game by e-mailing me, as our ancestors have done since time immemorial. And I will do my best to keep an eye on the old Twitter feed as well. Email: geoff.lemon@theguardian.com Twitter: @GeoffLemonSport Good morning from the House of Lords. Wait, sorry, that\u2019s the other joint across town, where democracy\u2019s shining sword cleaves shiningly through the thickets of governance. Good morning from a house, of Lord. The chap who has been confusing people with a possessive apostrophe since the dawn of cricket. Apostrophes can be very possessive. Once they get hold of you they won\u2019t let you go. Australia and New Zealand today. The supporters are streaming in already, with more yellow shirts than I saw in the whole match against England. Has the trans-Tasman rivalry seen my fellow nationals fire up, or is it just that English people didn\u2019t dominate the ballot and the resale market? There are plenty of people who applied for tickets but missed out on every game, and plenty of others who didn\u2019t but are paying way over the odds from scalpers. But put aside all those worries. Let us fiddle while Rome burns. Well, while France burns anyway. It\u2019s a warm but not terrifyingly-end-times hot in London today, like a nice mid-range day in Sydney. A bit humid, bright sunshine. Away we go.",

On Thursday, three children on a school trip from the nearby town of Arles were taken to hospital suffering from heat exhaustion. \u201cI don\u2019t think their supervisors were being very sensible,\u201d said Gomel. \u201cApparently they were letting them run around everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>He was taking no chances this weekend. Fire trucks were trundling around, soaking the pathways with water. Parts of the park with steep inclines were off-limits: no lions or bears today. The zoo\u2019s current star attraction \u2013 the cheetahs, who gave birth last November \u2013 were showing how it\u2019s done, lying like lean, furry chaise-longues in the shadows.</p> <p>France remains chastened by the memory of the 2003 heatwave, in which an estimated 15,000 people died. Not this time, said the health minister, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, who was visiting Car\u00e9meau hospital in N\u00eemes. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s impossible to guarantee that no one will die, but we\u2019ve put everything in place to ensure it\u2019s the lowest number possible. Compared with 2003, we\u2019re extremely well prepared \u2013 especially with respect to the elderly, especially those isolated at home.\u201d </p> <p>The preparations seemed to be working this weekend. The inpatient hall was quiet; there were more security guards for the ministerial visit outside. \u201cThey\u2019ve put in a lot of preventative measures in advance this time,\u201d said Xavier Faure, who works with the regional health agency. Canicule, or heatwave, warnings were ubiquitous last week. The end-of-day statistics at Car\u00e9meau hospital on Friday seemed to justify the approach: only seven people were admitted to casualty for heat-related reasons, one in cardiac arrest; an 8% to 10% increase in call activity.</p> <p>Over in N\u00eemes, no one was walking on the limestone esplanade outside the arena walls; the fake centurion union had obviously given everyone the day off. A hot wind, which felt like it bypassed the eyelids to begin desiccating the corneas directly, licked the streets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6956beda9df1ae14aafd1d0769adf07fbe4f2e0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6956beda9df1ae14aafd1d0769adf07fbe4f2e0d/0_332_5356_3214/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An evening swim in lake Walensee in Switzerland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An evening swim in lake Walensee in Switzerland, which was hit by temperatures of up to 39C.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gian Ehrenzeller/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few hundred metres away at a refreshment point \u2013 one of three set up by the city \u2013 offering bottled water and a place for a breather in the Maison Carr\u00e9e arts centre, Alina Richard echoed the good news from the hospital; she had only had to serve one person in real distress. She offered lunch advice to a student. \u201cYou should eat something fresh and cooling,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI had a salade Ni\u00e7oise!\u201d he offered, beaming.</p> <p>Even the Jardin de la Fontaine, with its ornamental canals, offered little respite. Dust swirled off the ground where a group of locals were playing p\u00e9tanque.</p> <p>Patric, a retired N\u00eemois lorry driver, shrugged off the pressure cooker atmosphere. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing \u2013 we\u2019re used to it. You\u2019ve just got to let it pass,\u201d he said. But Baptiste, a psychology student from Bordeaux who was dousing himself at a water fountain, was fearful about the future: \u201cWe already have an unstable economy \u2013 can you imagine adding regular droughts to that too?\u201d</p> <p>Back down by the arena, Thierry, a roadie working for an events company, thought there may be a lesson for National Rally-voting N\u00eemes. \u201cIt\u2019s the degree or two extra that makes doing this tough,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why sub-Saharan African has nothing \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to work in conditions like this.

At Montpellier zoo, Gomel wasn\u2019t worried so much for the animals as for the visitors. On Thursday, three children on a school trip from the nearby town of Arles were taken to hospital suffering from heat exhaustion. \u201cI don\u2019t think their supervisors were being very sensible,\u201d said Gomel. \u201cApparently they were letting them run around everywhere.\u201d He was taking no chances this weekend. Fire trucks were trundling around, soaking the pathways with water. Parts of the park with steep inclines were off-limits: no lions or bears today. The zoo\u2019s current star attraction \u2013 the cheetahs, who gave birth last November \u2013 were showing how it\u2019s done, lying like lean, furry chaise-longues in the shadows. France remains chastened by the memory of the 2003 heatwave, in which an estimated 15,000 people died. Not this time, said the health minister, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, who was visiting Car\u00e9meau hospital in N\u00eemes. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s impossible to guarantee that no one will die, but we\u2019ve put everything in place to ensure it\u2019s the lowest number possible. Compared with 2003, we\u2019re extremely well prepared \u2013 especially with respect to the elderly, especially those isolated at home.\u201d The preparations seemed to be working this weekend. The inpatient hall was quiet; there were more security guards for the ministerial visit outside. \u201cThey\u2019ve put in a lot of preventative measures in advance this time,\u201d said Xavier Faure, who works with the regional health agency. Canicule, or heatwave, warnings were ubiquitous last week. The end-of-day statistics at Car\u00e9meau hospital on Friday seemed to justify the approach: only seven people were admitted to casualty for heat-related reasons, one in cardiac arrest; an 8% to 10% increase in call activity. Over in N\u00eemes, no one was walking on the limestone esplanade outside the arena walls; the fake centurion union had obviously given everyone the day off. A hot wind, which felt like it bypassed the eyelids to begin desiccating the corneas directly, licked the streets. A few hundred metres away at a refreshment point \u2013 one of three set up by the city \u2013 offering bottled water and a place for a breather in the Maison Carr\u00e9e arts centre, Alina Richard echoed the good news from the hospital; she had only had to serve one person in real distress. She offered lunch advice to a student. \u201cYou should eat something fresh and cooling,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a salade Ni\u00e7oise!\u201d he offered, beaming. Even the Jardin de la Fontaine, with its ornamental canals, offered little respite. Dust swirled off the ground where a group of locals were playing p\u00e9tanque. Patric, a retired N\u00eemois lorry driver, shrugged off the pressure cooker atmosphere. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing \u2013 we\u2019re used to it. You\u2019ve just got to let it pass,\u201d he said. But Baptiste, a psychology student from Bordeaux who was dousing himself at a water fountain, was fearful about the future: \u201cWe already have an unstable economy \u2013 can you imagine adding regular droughts to that too?\u201d Back down by the arena, Thierry, a roadie working for an events company, thought there may be a lesson for National Rally-voting N\u00eemes. \u201cIt\u2019s the degree or two extra that makes doing this tough,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why sub-Saharan African has nothing \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to work in conditions like this. People here should go and work there. It\u2019d be an education for some people.\u201d The World Meteorological Organisation said last week that 2019 was on track to being one of the hottest years globally, and 2015 to 2019 would then be the hottest five-year period on record. It said the European heatwave was \u201cabsolutely consistent\u201d with extremes linked to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. Back at the water fountain in N\u00eemes, the psychology student contemplated the possibility of record temperatures being beaten regularly in the years ahead. \u201cHave you seen the film Interstellar?\u201d he said. \u201cThe Earth isn\u2019t going to die all of a sudden. It\u2019ll be a slow, sad decline.\u201d",

Hunt was very polished. He seemed to have an answer for everything. He comes across as more prime ministerial. My heart says Boris, but my gut feeling is that Hunt may be better.\u201d</p> <p>Bentley is not alone. There is plenty of affection for Johnson among the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/21/more-than-half-of-tory-members-would-ruin-party-over-brexit\" title=\"\">Tory faithful</a>, who will decide on behalf of the entire country who will enter No 10 well before the end of next month. They laugh at his jokes and love his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/boris-johnson-chances-of-no-deal-brexit-are-a-million-to-one-against\" title=\"\">\u201cdo or die\u201d</a>, \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d commitment to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October. Few seem to worry about the recent complications in his private life, which have hardly been mentioned in two days of hustings along the south-west coast.</p> <p>But do they think he can be prime minister? As she gets up to leave the conference hall outside Exeter, Gail Vickery, who has come all the way from Polzeath in north Cornwall, gives her answer and, strikingly, it is much the same as Bentley\u2019s. \u201cI came thinking I would vote for Boris against my better judgment. Now I think I am going to vote for Hunt because he will make the better prime minister, though I do hope he doesn\u2019t let me down over Brexit. We need to leave on 31 October.\u201d</p> <p>Down the aisle of emptying seats, half-a-dozen elderly gentlemen stay behind and are chatting. They all seem undecided now, whereas before they indicated that they, too, had been leaning towards Johnson.</p> <p>Chris Waite, from Sherborne, Dorset, is getting closer to a decision, however. He arrived in a state of thoughtful indecision, but now his mind is clearing. \u201cBoris gave the audience a buzz,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Hunt\u2019s arguments were so much better. If you saw a transcript of their answers, there would be no comparison. If I had to vote now as I walk out of here, I would vote for Hunt.\u201d</p> <p>Ballot papers go out to the 150,000 or so paid-up Tory members this week. Party organisers say that they expect many to return them without much delay. \u201cExperience shows us that a lot of our members reply by return [of post]. They are very organised, this lot,\u201d said one party source. This, therefore, is a crucial time in the contest and members are taking their duties very seriously.</p> <p>\u201cAfter last time, when we got Theresa May, they know how important it is,\u201d said an MP who is on tour with the \u201cHas to be Hunt\u201d campaign. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get a say in that election because May got in unopposed. They are determined to get this one right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e96f8137212f770eb91a0c5d88523f47d65f680\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e96f8137212f770eb91a0c5d88523f47d65f680/0_54_3063_1838/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Hunt speaking during a hustings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Hunt speaking during a hustings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Forsyth/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yesterday the hustings rolled in to Manchester and went north to Carlisle. There are still a dozen to go up and down the country and Johnson remains the clear favourite. Our Opinium poll of 1,000 Tory voters today shows 52% would back him and 30% Hunt to be the next PM.</p> <p>But there are signs of hope for Hunt. While 61% think Johnson would be most likely to beat Jeremy Corbyn in a general election (against 19% for Hunt), the gap is narrower when Conservative backers are asked who they think would be the better prime minister, the question uppermost in many members\u2019 minds (47% say Johnson and 27% say Hunt). While opinions of Johnson have not changed over the past fortnight, despite last weekend\u2019s stories about a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/boris-johnson-dodges-questions-about-row-with-partner\" title=\"\">late-night row with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds</a>, more Tories have begun to feel positively about Hunt than did so two weeks ago.</p> <p>Most of Johnson\u2019s appeal to the Tory faithful rests in his hardline message on Brexit. In Bournemouth on Thursday night and Exeter on Friday, he went briefly for the pantomime approach, telling his audience that there are \u201cthree things\u201d the next leader needs to get done. \u201cAnd the first is what? What?\u201d he thundered. \u201cBrexit!,\u201d cheered the members in response. \u201cYes! Get Brexit done!,\u201d Johnson roared. But this was as raucous as it got. There is a limit to how much fun these Tories want to have in the prime ministerial auditions, and Johnson knows it. He tries hard to rein back the humour. But when it turns to dry policy, he can fare less well. In Bournemouth a local member asked what he would do to improve NHS dentistry, something Johnson had to admit he had yet to turn his mind to in great detail, if at all.</p> <p>By contrast, Hunt has to try to be funny, as his natural default setting is managerial, sober and reassuring. When he comes on stage after Johnson, it can all seem rather flat. But in a strange way \u2013 and with time \u2013 that plays to his strength, as the Hunt message is all about seriousness. \u201cThese are serious times and we need a serious person in No 10,\u201d the Hunt campaign team says with tedious predictability in response to almost every question. Hunt himself also plays the \u201centrepreneur\u201d and \u201cnegotiator\u201d cards with grating regularity. \u201cAnd how many people here have set up a business?\u201d he asks at each hustings. A few put up their hands in the Bournemouth Pavilion theatre, but not that many. \u201cSo that is the Tory party, then!\u201d he says, ploughing on regardless.</p> <p>Wherever the two candidates pitch up, Johnson\u2019s fans are out there in force, as are Hunt\u2019s. Just as the country and political parties are split over Brexit, the Tory party is split over its next leader. There are strong feelings on both sides. Steve Parselle, from Bournemouth, declared on Thursday evening that it was no contest. \u201cBoris is bringing some invigoration back to politics,\u201d he said. \u201cJeremy Hunt would be Theresa May in trousers. I think Boris will give hope back to the country.\u201d</p> <p>But yards away an elderly lady, who asked not to be named because she feared a dressing down from her local party, said of Johnson: \u201cI have told him that when he has learned to cut his hair and tuck his shirt in, I might vote for him. And he is a complete master of obfuscation. It makes me cringe. I will back Hunt as the lesser of two evils.\u201d Michael Draper, from the Romsey and Southampton North party, said he too was worried about Johnson. \u201cIf you are going to put your finger on the nuclear button, you don\u2019t want someone doing it who just cracks jokes,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Down in Exeter, after watching both candidates, Paul Bradly from Yeovil was more generous to Johnson, but also made his preference clear. \u201cI like Boris and I enjoy listening to him. But I want someone who I can respect and who I am proud to have leading my country.\u201d</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago, after Johnson won the ballot of Tory MPs by a mile, it seemed the hustings tour would be one long victory parade for the former foreign secretary, with the current one, Jeremy Hunt, going along just for the ride. But it does not feel that way now.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Tory leadership tour has reached Exeter, and as party member Louise Bentley from Bridgwater waits patiently to hear Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt make their pitches she already seems sure who she wants to be the next prime minister. \u201cI think I will vote for Boris,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are times when this country needs someone to take us out of a crisis, like Churchill, and I think he can do that.\u201d Two hours later, after the contenders have left the stage \u2013 both having been well received \u2013 Bentley turns round and announces a potential switch of allegiance: \u201cI think I may have changed my mind. Hunt was very polished. He seemed to have an answer for everything. He comes across as more prime ministerial. My heart says Boris, but my gut feeling is that Hunt may be better.\u201d Bentley is not alone. There is plenty of affection for Johnson among the Tory faithful, who will decide on behalf of the entire country who will enter No 10 well before the end of next month. They laugh at his jokes and love his \u201cdo or die\u201d, \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d commitment to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October. Few seem to worry about the recent complications in his private life, which have hardly been mentioned in two days of hustings along the south-west coast. But do they think he can be prime minister? As she gets up to leave the conference hall outside Exeter, Gail Vickery, who has come all the way from Polzeath in north Cornwall, gives her answer and, strikingly, it is much the same as Bentley\u2019s. \u201cI came thinking I would vote for Boris against my better judgment. Now I think I am going to vote for Hunt because he will make the better prime minister, though I do hope he doesn\u2019t let me down over Brexit. We need to leave on 31 October.\u201d Down the aisle of emptying seats, half-a-dozen elderly gentlemen stay behind and are chatting. They all seem undecided now, whereas before they indicated that they, too, had been leaning towards Johnson. Chris Waite, from Sherborne, Dorset, is getting closer to a decision, however. He arrived in a state of thoughtful indecision, but now his mind is clearing. \u201cBoris gave the audience a buzz,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Hunt\u2019s arguments were so much better. If you saw a transcript of their answers, there would be no comparison. If I had to vote now as I walk out of here, I would vote for Hunt.\u201d Ballot papers go out to the 150,000 or so paid-up Tory members this week. Party organisers say that they expect many to return them without much delay. \u201cExperience shows us that a lot of our members reply by return [of post]. They are very organised, this lot,\u201d said one party source. This, therefore, is a crucial time in the contest and members are taking their duties very seriously. \u201cAfter last time, when we got Theresa May, they know how important it is,\u201d said an MP who is on tour with the \u201cHas to be Hunt\u201d campaign. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get a say in that election because May got in unopposed. They are determined to get this one right.\u201d Yesterday the hustings rolled in to Manchester and went north to Carlisle. There are still a dozen to go up and down the country and Johnson remains the clear favourite. Our Opinium poll of 1,000 Tory voters today shows 52% would back him and 30% Hunt to be the next PM. But there are signs of hope for Hunt. While 61% think Johnson would be most likely to beat Jeremy Corbyn in a general election (against 19% for Hunt), the gap is narrower when Conservative backers are asked who they think would be the better prime minister, the question uppermost in many members\u2019 minds (47% say Johnson and 27% say Hunt). While opinions of Johnson have not changed over the past fortnight, despite last weekend\u2019s stories about a late-night row with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds, more Tories have begun to feel positively about Hunt than did so two weeks ago. Most of Johnson\u2019s appeal to the Tory faithful rests in his hardline message on Brexit. In Bournemouth on Thursday night and Exeter on Friday, he went briefly for the pantomime approach, telling his audience that there are \u201cthree things\u201d the next leader needs to get done. \u201cAnd the first is what? What?\u201d he thundered. \u201cBrexit!,\u201d cheered the members in response. \u201cYes! Get Brexit done!,\u201d Johnson roared. But this was as raucous as it got. There is a limit to how much fun these Tories want to have in the prime ministerial auditions, and Johnson knows it. He tries hard to rein back the humour. But when it turns to dry policy, he can fare less well. In Bournemouth a local member asked what he would do to improve NHS dentistry, something Johnson had to admit he had yet to turn his mind to in great detail, if at all. By contrast, Hunt has to try to be funny, as his natural default setting is managerial, sober and reassuring. When he comes on stage after Johnson, it can all seem rather flat. But in a strange way \u2013 and with time \u2013 that plays to his strength, as the Hunt message is all about seriousness. \u201cThese are serious times and we need a serious person in No 10,\u201d the Hunt campaign team says with tedious predictability in response to almost every question. Hunt himself also plays the \u201centrepreneur\u201d and \u201cnegotiator\u201d cards with grating regularity. \u201cAnd how many people here have set up a business?\u201d he asks at each hustings. A few put up their hands in the Bournemouth Pavilion theatre, but not that many. \u201cSo that is the Tory party, then!\u201d he says, ploughing on regardless. Wherever the two candidates pitch up, Johnson\u2019s fans are out there in force, as are Hunt\u2019s. Just as the country and political parties are split over Brexit, the Tory party is split over its next leader. There are strong feelings on both sides. Steve Parselle, from Bournemouth, declared on Thursday evening that it was no contest. \u201cBoris is bringing some invigoration back to politics,\u201d he said. \u201cJeremy Hunt would be Theresa May in trousers. I think Boris will give hope back to the country.\u201d But yards away an elderly lady, who asked not to be named because she feared a dressing down from her local party, said of Johnson: \u201cI have told him that when he has learned to cut his hair and tuck his shirt in, I might vote for him. And he is a complete master of obfuscation. It makes me cringe. I will back Hunt as the lesser of two evils.\u201d Michael Draper, from the Romsey and Southampton North party, said he too was worried about Johnson. \u201cIf you are going to put your finger on the nuclear button, you don\u2019t want someone doing it who just cracks jokes,\u201d he said. Down in Exeter, after watching both candidates, Paul Bradly from Yeovil was more generous to Johnson, but also made his preference clear. \u201cI like Boris and I enjoy listening to him. But I want someone who I can respect and who I am proud to have leading my country.\u201d A couple of weeks ago, after Johnson won the ballot of Tory MPs by a mile, it seemed the hustings tour would be one long victory parade for the former foreign secretary, with the current one, Jeremy Hunt, going along just for the ride. But it does not feel that way now.",

It was Stormzy\u2019s generosity as much as his ambition and energy that put this in the same league as Jay-Z\u2019s 2008 headliner, which brought hip-hop to the Pyramid stage, and even Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s fabled Coachella sets. It is one thing to deliver an exceptionally crafted performance without a dull moment; it\u2019s quite another to use your platform to champion a whole culture. Historic and then some.",

What the rest of the world probably thinks is that this country enjoys the cash-splashing bit in the middle more than the actual football. Money is essentially what makes the Premier League so uniquely eye-catching and, boy, do we like to see it spent. Just look at all the criticism levelled at Tottenham a year ago for keeping their chequebook in their pocket. Never mind they were building a new stadium or that Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s existing squad proved to be good enough to reach the Champions League final, a Premier League club refusing to chuck money around is evidently inviting the same sort of suspicion as the bloke who tells his mates in the pub he intends to stick to water all night. So if the news that Spurs had come to their senses and bought their first player for 18 months was greeted with something approaching relief, even if 18-year-old Jack Clarke was bought from Leeds with an eye on the future, signs that the club may be willing to break its transfer record for Tanguy Ndombele were practically an occasion to put out the bunting. Unfortunately the Lyon chairman, Jean-Michel Aulas, seems prepared to play the same sort of hardball in which Daniel Levy specialises and, having seen Spurs raise their bid for the France midfielder from \u00a345m to \u00a365m, he appears to think the price can still go higher. This will be a test for Levy, usually so adept at making sure the selling club obtain the highest price possible and relatively new to bidding for top-ranked players at top-end fees with the rest of the game eagerly following the outcome, but it appears Spurs are following a pre-agreed Pochettino blueprint to both strengthen and rejuvenate the side. Ndombele is 22, with most of his career ahead of him, while Fulham\u2019s Ryan Sessegnon, also interesting Tottenham, is 19. It remains to be seen whether Spurs will manage to tie down all their targets but, having succeeded in keeping hold of Pochettino amid interest from at home and abroad, they are clearly thinking long-term. There will probably never be a better time to sign young players than when you have just reached your first Champions League final and, though Manchester City and Liverpool remain the obvious destinations for anyone with talent and ambition, the Spurs mix of Pochettino and an evolving side still capable of improvement is an attractive one. Tottenham hoovering up some of the most promising young prospects around would not only make Good Morning Transfers happy it would also increase the frustration at Chelsea who, as things stand, cannot even attempt to replace Eden Hazard until next summer. A cynic might suggest that is part of the reason Chelsea have abandoned their previous policy of hiring coaches with proven pedigrees in Europe and are about to announce their first English manager in 23 years. The next manager is going to have to work with the resources already at Chelsea\u2019s disposal, though not only are they considerable but it is frankly about time someone did. While bringing in Frank Lampard could be seen as a risk in view of his limited coaching experience, in terms of his ability to relate to and assimilate talents such as Fikayo Tomori, Reece James and the army of other players who have been out on loan, the return of the club\u2019s former midfielder would make perfect sense. Realistically Chelsea might struggle to match last season\u2019s third place \u2013 he might even get the credit he deserves at some point for a decent end to a difficult campaign \u2013 yet, if his successor can call in some of the players the club have posted around Europe and forge a team ethos similar to the one Pochettino has fostered at Spurs, that could also be regarded as progress.

At this point in history, they were very much the bosses of Germany, having also beaten then 4-0 in the third-place play-off at the inaugural World Cup four years earlier.</p> <p><strong>But the tables have since turned dramatically.</strong> The two countries met again in the 2003 final, Nia K\u00fcnzer scoring a golden goal for the Germans. Subsequently, whenever the Swedes have come up against Germany while chasing the big prizes, they\u2019ve been sent packing, whether it\u2019s been the Olympics, the Euros or the World Cup. Last time round, in Canada, the Germans were 4-1 victors in the round of 16. This is a lop-sided rivalry.</p> <p><strong>There\u2019s always hope in football, though. </strong>The Swedes are on a high after an impressive win over Canada, while Germany, by their own lofty standards, have yet to find top gear at this tournament. A strange thing to say about a team who have won all their games and are yet to concede a goal, but there it is. They will be welcoming back the influential Dzsenifer Marozsan from injury, however. She\u2019s certain to play some part, whether from the start or coming off the bench, and will send a shiver down Swedish spines after her match-winning contribution in the 2016 Olympic final.</p> <p><strong>So it\u2019s all set up nicely. </strong>A place in the semi-final is up for grabs, with qualification for next year\u2019s Olympics thrown in. We\u2019re playing for big stakes; this promises to be a cracker. It\u2019s the quarter final of the World Cup. It\u2019s very hot. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off:</strong> 5.30pm BST, 6.30pm local.</p> </div>   </div>",

All that\u2019s left is to direct you towards the match report ... and here it is, just a simple click away. Enjoy, and thanks for reading. The semi-final line-up, then. England v USA (Tuesday) Netherlands v Sweden (Wednesday) Sweden are the first team in the knockout stage of this World Cup to come from behind and win! They\u2019re the first side to inflict such a turnaround on Germany in the World Cup since the USA did it in 1999. Tonight they\u2019re gonna party. They cavort in celebration, exhausted but exhilarated. Germany, who went into this match as favourites, look stunned ... but they were very much second best today. They couldn\u2019t cope with Stina Blackstenius at any point, and the Link\u00f6pings striker delivered the killer blow just after the break. Pity poor Lina Magull, whose magnificent opening goal was all for nothing. Sweden will play Netherlands in the semi-final next Wednesday, after a deserved victory that\u2019s been 24 years in the making! 90 min +5: Rolfo is replaced by Hurtig. Sweden are so close to the semis now. 90 min +4: Asllani looks to have won a corner on the right, but the flag goes up for a goal kick. She nearly complains her way into the book. 90 min +3: A huge chance for Germany! Huth is sent scampering down the right and wedges a cross towards Hegering at the far post. Under pressure from Glas, she flashes her header high and wide from close range. 90 min +2: Marozsan manages to dig out a cross from the tightest of positions on the right. Lindahl does extremely well to claim a ball that would have looped into the net. 90 min: Oberdorf dribbles down the left and cuts back for Dabritz, who shoots straight at Lindahl. There will be six minutes of added time. 89 min: Blackstenius sends a screaming shot over the bar from 25 yards. Sweden have had their chances to put this to bed. Incidentally, the offside decision against Germany was preposterously marginal, Magull\u2019s arm dangling over the line. But what\u2019s right is right. 88 min: What a chance for Germany to save themselves! It\u2019s another free kick, this time out on the right. Marozsan waves her wand at the ball, curling it to Oberdorf at the far post. Lindahl had come out flapping and missed. The goal was gaping ... but Oberdorf sent her header wide. 86 min: Now Popp\u2019s knocked to the floor by Ilestedt. A free kick, 30 yards out. Before it\u2019s taken, Sweden swap Rubensson with Bjorn. Then Marozsan floats the free kick into the mixer. Popp clips Seger, and it\u2019s a pressure-releasing free kick. 84 min: The tension is palpable as referee Stephanie Frappart converses with the denizens of the VAR studio. Popp was definitely offside, so Lindahl\u2019s subsequent intervention, knocking Popp down as she tried to punch clear, is neither here nor there. The ref waves play on. 82 min: Marozsan probes down the left, checking back, then turning and whipping a stunning cross onto Popp\u2019s head, ten yards out. Popp\u2019s offside, though. But Lindahl had clattered into Popp, and so there\u2019s a VAR check for a penalty kick. 80 min: Germany remain strangely flat. Patience is all good and well, but time is running out. They need to raise the tempo. Sweden are looking very comfortable at the moment. 78 min: Jakobsson was clearly listening to Lindahl, and with renewed vigour, nearly sends Sweden into the semis for sure. She dances down the inside-right channel and sashays past Hegering on the edge of the area with great ease. A shot\u2019s battered towards the top right; Schult does very well to parry and gather. 77 min: We\u2019re off again. Lindahl delivered quite a speech during that break. Only 15 minutes to go and we\u2019re in the semis, would have been the gist of it, I\u2019ll be bound. 75 min: COOLING BREAK. Smart Water all round. Other beverages are available. 73 min: A couple of German corners. Neither delivered convincingly by Marozsan. The two-time winners and current Olympic champions are beginning to run out of ideas. Lindahl hasn\u2019t had much to do. 71 min: Blackstenius powers down the left into acres of space left by Doorsoun. For a second, it looks as though she\u2019s going to make it into the box ahead of Hegering and shoot, but the defender holds her ground and ushers the striker away from goal. Under pressure from Hegering, Blackstenius takes a fresh-air swipe and falls, allowing Schult to gather. 70 min: Germany make their final substitution in the regulation 90 minutes. They\u2019ll have another if they take the game to extra time. But for now this is it: Schuller is replaced by Oberdorf. 69 min: It\u2019s all Germany right now ... but it\u2019s sterile domination. All in the middle of the park. When they press forward, a loose pass flies out for a goal kick. Sweden holding their shape very well. 67 min: A free kick for Germany out on the left, and a chance to load the box. Everyone on the edge of the area. Marozsan loops the set piece towards Popp, but Sembrant gets in ahead of the German striker and heads clear. 66 min: Fischer\u2019s back up and about, but it looks as though she\u2019s going to be subbed. She wants to continue, but on comes Ilestedt. 64 min: A searching cross from the right by Maier causes momentary panic in the Swedish box, but Fischer eventually clears. The Swedish defender then goes down with cramp. On comes the doc. 62 min: The game\u2019s gone a little bit scrappy. Plenty of loose play in the midfield in the last couple of minutes. There\u2019s not been too much of that in this highly entertaining match. 60 min: ... there\u2019s no action of note. A poor delivery by Dabritz that sails harmlessly over everyone in the box. On the touchline, Martina Voss-Tecklenburg doesn\u2019t look best pleased. 59 min: Germany are slowly working their way back into this. Huth dribbles down the left and earns a corner. From which ... 57 min: Lindahl races out of her box to clear a loose ball. She shanks it towards Dabritz, who tries to return it into the unguarded net from 40 yards. Dabritz pulls the effort well left, saving the Sweden keeper\u2019s blushes. Lindahl smiles sheepishly. 55 min: Rolfo will miss the semi if Sweden make it. She\u2019s booked for sticking a leg across Magull. She suddenly realises the implications of her actions, and holds her head in despair. 54 min: Blackstenius nearly bulldozes her way past Doorsoun and Hegering. Not quite, but she\u2019s so dangerous at full pace. 53 min: Popp crosses from the left. Schuller nearly gets a head to it, ten yards out. But not quite. Huth recycles possession on the right and fizzes in a cross that forces Sembrant to concede a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece, but this is better from Germany, who haven\u2019t asked Sweden many questions since taking the lead. 51 min: As things stand, Germany won\u2019t be in Japan next year to defend their Olympic title. A huge 40 minutes ahead of us. 50 min: Blackstenius hadn\u2019t scored an international goal for a year before her winner against Canada. Now she\u2019s got two in six days! London buses, huh. Schult meanwhile was appealing for a foul in the build-up - Glas had clipped Magull on the halfway line - but VAR didn\u2019t pull it back. Germany had plenty of other chances to stop Sweden, but couldn\u2019t do it. Jakobsson powers down the right and stands one up to the far post. Rolfo rises highest and guides a header towards the top right. Schult manages to claw the ball out, but it drops to Blackstenius, who roofs it from six yards. Could Sweden\u2019s 24-year run of misery against Germany come to an end today? 47 min: Marozsan throws herself into a couple of challenges. Clearly not worried about that toe. And we\u2019re off again! A big change, with Germany going for it, replacing Dallmann with Dzsenifer Marozsan. \u201cThoroughly enjoying this World Cup and as a long-time devotee of women\u2019s football it is so good to see the rise in both floor and ceiling of the game,\u201d writes Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cThat said, much like the last men\u2019s World Cup, one change I\u2019d like to see is a re-seeding after the Group phase. One side of the draw has the three strongest sides in the US, England and the gone-too-soon France. Could Germany, Sweden or the Netherlands win the Cup? Sure, but much like Croatia last year it would be one heck of an upset.\u201d Half-time entertainment. Suzanne Wrack has been zig-zagging around France, staying in hotels with no air con so you don\u2019t have to. Here\u2019s her diary! An entertaining first half comes to a close. The players troop off to get themselves some water and shade. Germany will be happy to hear the whistle, because Sweden were beginning to cause quite a lot of trouble in their final third. It\u2019s going to be a cracking second half, as this is on a knife-edge. Extra time and penalties a real prospect! 45 min: More bedlam in the German box, as Blackstenius and Rubensson take each other out while trying to latch onto a loose ball. Germany boot it away from danger. It\u2019s really not clear how Germany kept four clean sheets before this match, because their back line has been all over the place today. 44 min: Simon can\u2019t continue. She\u2019s replaced by Maier. 43 min: Sweden go long again. Fischer nearly releases Blackstenius, but Doorsoun nicks the ball, passing back to Schult who is forced to hack out for a corner. From the set piece, there\u2019s some head tennis in the box, then a game of pinball. Germany hack clear, eventually, but not particularly convincingly. The increasingly dangerous Blackstenius bombs down the left and hooks a shot over the bar from a tight angle. 41 min: Simon is off the field having treatment on her knee. Germany, down to ten, go on the attack anyway. Magull thinks she\u2019s won a corner off Fischer, but the referee awards a goal kick. Simon comes back on. A scrappy couple of minutes. 39 min: Asllani picks up a misplaced Simon pass and drives forward. She rolls a pass upfield, with the intention of releasing Blackstenius again, but Hegering gets a toe to it and guides it back to her keeper. Sweden look like busting the German offside trap every time they go forward. 37 min: Popp rises highest to head the corner clear. Germany\u2019s captain, who scores every other game on average, is putting in quite the defensive shift today. 36 min: We\u2019re off again! And Sweden are quickly bearing down on the German goal again. Rolfo, playmaking from deep, rolls a pass down the inside-right channel to release Blackstenius, who looks for the top right from distance. Schult is forced to tip over. Corner. 34 min: COOLING BREAK. Time for isotonic beverages and wet towels around the neck. 32 min: Blackstenius nearly breaks clear down the right, but Popp sticks on her shoulder and forces her to turn back. Sembrant then has a shot from the best part of 40 yards; full marks for ambition. 30 min: The effervescent Magull nearly bustles her way through the centre of the Swedish defence. She\u2019s an absolute menace. Sweden don\u2019t know how to deal with her. A flick intended for the nearby Huth goes awry. She might have done better by continuing to barge through. 28 min: Gwinn is sprung into space down the right. She cuts back for Dabritz, who has space just inside the box. But a heavy touch means she can\u2019t get a shot away. The flag goes up for offside, sparing her blushes, because that was a fine chance. Sweden don\u2019t look particularly convincing at the back, though. Quite a few sloppy mistakes. 26 min: A dismal lapse in concentration by Fischer, who lets a rolling ball slip under her foot and allows Huth to skedaddle down the left wing. Huth drifts inside and thinks about shaping a shot towards the top right, but can\u2019t find the space. Fischer\u2019s defensive team-mates got her out of hole there. 24 min: Germany have been rattled a little by that goal, which came from nothing. Blackstenius is gifted possession by Popp, and she\u2019s got options either side. A poorly weighted through ball sails harmlessly through to Schult. \u201cJakobsson is intimidating,\u201d opines Mary Waltz. \u201cShe strides across the pitch like the Night King across the ice.\u201d Game on, right here! A long blooter of a clearance by Sembrant sends Jakobsson clear of a snoozing German back line! Jakobsson powers down the middle, drifts a little to the right and, under pressure from Simon, guides a fine finish across the advancing Schult and into the bottom left! Germany finally concede in this World Cup. 20 min: Jakobsson dribbles down the right and hooks a cross into the mixer. It\u2019s brought down and cleared by Fischer without too much fuss. Sweden are getting plenty of joy down both wings, but the centres haven\u2019t been accurate enough. 18 min: Sweden try to strike back immediately. Some space for Jakobsson down the left. But her cross is easily claimed by Schult. Germany go up the other end, Huth working her way down the right and dinking infield for Schuller, who sends a header straight at Lindahl. What a goal this is! Eriksson gifts the ball to Dabritz, who blazes down the inside-right channel before gliding infield. Dabritz draws a couple of defenders and dinks a cute pass forward for Magull, who is just inside the area, and in a lot of space. Magull flicks the ball up, then swivels and lashes a bicycle kick into the bottom left! That\u2019s some finish. 15 min: Space for Schuller down the left. Sweden are on the back foot again. But she runs the ball out of play for a goal kick. 13 min: The first shot in anger, as Jakobsson is released down the inside-left channel by a superb Asllani pass. Schult comes out to close the angle and block. A corner, from which Eriksson heads harmlessly over. But Sweden are right in this now after a slow start. 11 min: Huth zips down the right and briefly threatens to break clear, but eventually meanders down a cul-de-sac and the danger\u2019s gone. 10 min: Sweden show in attack for the first time, Jakobsson and Aillani taking turns to bother Germany down the right wing. A cross by the latter is fumbled by Schult, but there\u2019s nobody nearby in blue, so it\u2019s not a desperate mistake. Germany clear. 9 min: Simon, deep and tight on the left touchline, rolls a gorgeous diagonal pass towards Huth, taking three Swedes out of the game and nearly releasing her team-mate into the area. Huth can\u2019t quite shake off Glas, though, and she\u2019s forced to check back. What a pass, though. 7 min: Germany are first to everything right now. Dabritz strides towards the Swedish box and falls backwards while taking a shot. Lindahl brings it in. Dabritz had Magull in quite a bit of space to her left then; perhaps shooting wasn\u2019t the best option. 6 min: Magull looks for the top-left corner. She doesn\u2019t get anywhere near it, and it\u2019s an easy gather for Lindahl. 5 min: Dallmann wins the ball in the middle of the park with a crunching tackle on Seger. She shuttles the ball forward for Magull, who backflicks to Dabritz on the edge of the box. She\u2019s crudely checked, and that\u2019s a free kick in a very dangerous position, just to the left of the D. 4 min: It\u2019d been a quiet start on the pitch too, but suddenly Dabritz rolls a pass down the left for Simon, who earns the first corner of the match. From the set piece, Popp rises at the far post and sends a soft header into the arms of Lindahl. 2 min: An eerie quiet. It\u2019s almost as though the crowd don\u2019t want to deplete their energy levels too soon in this heat. Eventually there\u2019s a ripple of applause and everyone gets going. And we\u2019re off! Germany get the party started, and stroke it around the back awhile. Everyone gets a touch. The teams are out! Germany wear their famous white (with Atari Breakout stripes) while Sweden are in second-choice blue. Both anthems are proudly played, sung and fully respected with warm applause from all four corners of the stadium. Followers of a certain men\u2019s team who also play in white, please take note. Hands are clapped, coins are tossed, pennants are exchanged. We\u2019ll be off in a hot minute! This match is a repeat of the 2003 final. Relive all the German joy and Swedish heartache here, as Nia K\u00fcnzer\u2019s golden header in Carson, California secured Die Nationalelf\u2019s first World Cup. The winner of this match will play the Netherlands on Wednesday evening. The Dutch booked their place in the semi-finals - and next year\u2019s Olympics - by seeing off Italy. Vivianne Miedema and Stefanie van der Gragt did the business with second-half headers. Kieran Pender was at the Stade du Hainaut; his report is a mere click away. It\u2019s very warm indeed in Guardian Towers Rennes. Roazhon Park is like an oven, a cauldron, a tandoor. It\u2019s 31\u00b0C, or 88\u00b0F in the old money. During their pre-match exercises, players have cooled down by standing in the spray of the pitch sprinklers. There will be drinks breaks during the match. Both teams have been provided with a portable air-conditioning unit in their dressing rooms. They\u2019ll be chugging away like billy-o as we speak. Phew, what a scorcher! Dzsenifer Marozsan doesn\u2019t make the Germany starting XI. But she will be on the bench with a view to coming on if required, as Martina Voss-Tecklenburg suggested yesterday. Voss-Tecklenburg makes two changes to the XI sent out against Nigeria in the last round. Carolin Simon replaces Verena Schweers at left-back, while Linda Dallmann comes in for Melanie Leupolz in the centre of midfield. Sweden coach Peter Gerhardsson names the same team that began the match against Canada. And he\u2019s refusing to worry about his country\u2019s wretched run against the Germans. \u201cIt\u2019s history. We have new players now.\u201d Germany: Schult, Gwinn, Doorsoun, Hegering, Simon, Dabritz, Dallmann, Magull, Huth, Popp, Schuller. Subs: Benkarth, Hendrich, Maier, Oberdorf, Goessling, Marozsan, Elsig, Schweers, Leupolz, Buhl, Knaak, Frohms. Sweden: Lindahl, Glas, Fischer, Sembrant, Eriksson, Rubensson, Asllani, Seger, Jakobsson, Blackstenius, Rolfo. Subs: Faik, Andersson, Janogy, Hurtig, Ilestedt, Roddar, Bjorn, Zigiotti Olme, Anvegard, Larsson, Schough, Musovic. Referee: Stephanie Frappart (Paris). Sweden haven\u2019t beaten Germany at a major tournament for nearly a quarter of a century. In 1995, as hosts of the World Cup, they triumphed 3-2 in a sensational group encounter, coming back from two down at half time thanks to a couple of goals from Malin Andersson and one from the legendary Pia Sundhage. At this point in history, they were very much the bosses of Germany, having also beaten then 4-0 in the third-place play-off at the inaugural World Cup four years earlier. But the tables have since turned dramatically. The two countries met again in the 2003 final, Nia K\u00fcnzer scoring a golden goal for the Germans. Subsequently, whenever the Swedes have come up against Germany while chasing the big prizes, they\u2019ve been sent packing, whether it\u2019s been the Olympics, the Euros or the World Cup. Last time round, in Canada, the Germans were 4-1 victors in the round of 16. This is a lop-sided rivalry. There\u2019s always hope in football, though. The Swedes are on a high after an impressive win over Canada, while Germany, by their own lofty standards, have yet to find top gear at this tournament. A strange thing to say about a team who have won all their games and are yet to concede a goal, but there it is. They will be welcoming back the influential Dzsenifer Marozsan from injury, however. She\u2019s certain to play some part, whether from the start or coming off the bench, and will send a shiver down Swedish spines after her match-winning contribution in the 2016 Olympic final. So it\u2019s all set up nicely. A place in the semi-final is up for grabs, with qualification for next year\u2019s Olympics thrown in. We\u2019re playing for big stakes; this promises to be a cracker. It\u2019s the quarter final of the World Cup. It\u2019s very hot. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm BST, 6.30pm local.",

      "bodyText": "Cameroon probably just edged it but, in truth, it was not a very good game at all. Thanks for joining me. 90 mins: Jordan Ayew is held up by Ngadeu and goes down under the pressure but the referee is having none of it. Yiadom picks up the loose ball but his shot is poorly hit and straight at the goalkeeper. Partey smashes a shot very high over the bar from 25 yards. 88 mins: An utterly atrocious pass from Biyik allows in Kwabena who dribbles towards the edge of area, cuts in and whacks a vicious shot against the bar, making all weldings in the ground winces. 86 mins: This game deserves to be a goalless goal. 84 mins: Malong comes off the bench, immediately gives the ball away and then fouls his opponent when trying to retrieve it 25 yards from his own goal. Not the best start from him. Wakaso hits the wall with the free-kick. 81 mins: Fai smashes a cross - or maybe it was a shot - but it goes nowhere near the net or any players in the box. Bassogog hits the post after a neat one-two with Choupo-Moting but the assistant referee\u2019s flag goes up to call an offside despite him being two yards onside. 79 mins: Asamoah Gyan is on! Good to see he has not retired today. 77 mins: The foul count in this game must be huge! What\u2019s the record? Ps Ghana still can\u2019t string two passes together. 75 mins: Left-back Bong is replaced by Choupo-Moting, which will mean some sort of formation change. A ball is crossed into the box and lands on Bassogog\u2019s left foot and he whacks a vicious volley which smashes straight into Mensah\u2019s chest. That has got to hurt. 73 mins: Asamoah adds to the list of woeful cross just whacking one straight out for a goal-kick from the left wing. Kana-Biyik is caught by Jordan Ayew\u2019s studs and stays down for a while. Not much to see. Cameroon give the ball back, which is nice of them. 71 mins: Fai, with all the time in the world, puts the ball behind his own goal. Wakaso\u2019s corner is cleared at the front post. 69 mins: Wakaso gets a free-kick after getting the better of a couple of challenges and looks to break upfield but the referee puts a stop to that by calling a foul. 67 mins: Mark Bright is on co-comms and has just referenced a Guardian article, so that\u2019s lovely stuff. The pace of the has seriously dropped here. Here it is, from your main man Paul Doyle. 65 mins: Kasim is the first man to go into the book after catching Toko on the neck. He is just trying to palm the striker off but catches him quite high, so the referee finally pulls his cards out. 63 mins: The free-kick is sent into the box but the Ghanaian attackers are ruled offside, so that\u2019s the end of that chapter. 61 mins: Jordan Ayew is pushed over by Anguissa. It is a professional foul but the referee is not good enough to spot that it\u2019s worth a booking. 59 mins: Fai gets the ball out of his feet on the right and curls in a wonderful cross which looks destined for Njie\u2019s head but Mensah in front of him gets the slightest of flicks on it, sending it beyond Njie. 57 mins: Choupo-Moting is warming up and his presence is becoming increasingly necessary. 55 mins: Rahman whips in a cross for Andre Ayew to attack, he tries to volley it ahead of Ngadeu but his effort goes well wide. Ayew complains to the referee who laughs in his face, which works for me. Wakaso thwacks another shot at goal, this one flashing just wide, so he\u2019s getting closer. 53 mins: Ghana\u2019s passing has been particularly poor through this. They haven\u2019t created a notable chance since the ninth minute and have just keep overhitting balls over the top to no one. They need to be far cleverer here, maybe getting Andre Ayew into it more. Mandeck cleans out Jordan Ayew cynically before he can get away from him. 51 mins: Wakaso does Bassogog with a foul but the Cameroon winger has a cunning plan and just takes his opponent down. Fai drives in a cross but Yiadom heads clear. 49 mins: Wakaso runs through the middle of the park and decides to whack a shot from distance, he connects but it just keeps rising and rising. Down the other end, Bassogog tries to get the better of Rahman but forgets to take the ball with him and watches the Ghanaian run away with it. 47 mins: I can\u2019t wait for the attendance to be confirmed as it will be pretty embarrassing. Empty seats all over the place. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! The Ayew brothers have barely had a kick. They need to offer more if Ghana are going to get into this game. Cameroon have been the better team here but really it\u2019s been a forgettable half. Oh and the referee is poor. 45 mins: Njie has just tried to score a free-kick from around 40 yards and it was utterly woeful, whacking it 55 yards over. One minute added on. 44 mins: Njie lifts a cross to the back post where Ngadeu climbs highest but he can only direct his header wide from six yards. Wakaso cuts down Anguissa for his own amusement to give away a free-kick but is not booked for his crime. 42 mins: WHAT A CHANCE! Some fine work by the Cameroon attackers, ending with Bassogog getting the ball in space in the area from a Toko pullback but his shot from 12 yards is close to the goalkeeper who sticks his arm up to tip it over. 40 mins: At least Eurosport have finally put this match on, which is very kind of them. We are cooking with gas! Additionally, it\u2019s becoming more watchable. 38 mins: The referee stops play after a shot is blocked and rebounds off him. He then stops the game and gives Ghana the ball back. This referee is awful. A cross is then sent into the Cameroon box and it just goes over Andre Ayew. 36 mins: Andre Ayew rolls around on the ground for a while, claiming he\u2019s been the wronged. Cameroon are supposed to kick it back but instead it\u2019s sent down the pitch to Njie in space, as the Ghana players are expecting the ball back they do not defend, allowing the winger to whack a shot which Ofori blocks with his chest. Cameroon not doing much for fair play in the last seven days. 34 mins: It\u2019s getting more exciting! Mensah chases down Toko who is after a ball over the top and manages to put in a superb tackle to stop a certain goal. Kana-Biyik whacks the subsequent corner at goal but it\u2019s flicked behind. 32 mins: Kana-Biyik tries to play a through ball but no one reads what he is trying to do and therefore it just runs through to the goalkeeper. No wonder Eurosport forgot to change the feed. Don\u2019t worry! If on Eurosport Player you click onto the link for highlights from the Ibiza Marathon, you can now watch the game. Cheers, lads. 30 mins: Jordan Ayew is given the chance to prove me wrong when a vicious cross lands on the edge of the six-yard box but the stretching striker can\u2019t control the ball and it bounces out for a goal kick. 28 mins: I do not want to speak ill of this game but it\u2019s pretty awful. For now, I will blame the heat. In half an hour I will blame Jordan Ayew for not being very good. 26 mins: Great that Eurosport promised to show this online but instead have left the superbikes on. Anyway ... Ghana have a corner but it will never be taken as the referee is moaning about nothing. This guy is already getting on my nerves. After a minute of arguing, the corner is delivered and cleared. Speed it up!! 24 mins: Yiadom takes down Njie with a reasonably fair challenge and looks annoyed that it\u2019s given. The bright-haired Njie is also angry. Nothing happens from the free-kick so it\u2019s all meaningless in the end. 22 mins: Njie takes down a long ball on his chest inside the area but he doesn\u2019t cushion it perfectly and it runs away from him, forcing him to foul a defender. 20 mins: The referee seems to be giving every little foul, which is a bit boring. Let it flow, mate. 18 mins: Not the quickest tempo to the game thus far, probably due to the fact it\u2019s so warm in Ismailia. There\u2019s a bit of noise in the stands but it certainly is not full. I am currently also getting live updates from Nick Ames who is actually in Egypt. He\u2019s not at the game, so they\u2019re quite mundane. 16 mins: Bassogog Sends in a corner to the back post where Ngadeu is waiting but the referee calls up the big Cameroon defender for a foul. 14 mins: A quiet passage of play as Atsu gets treatment on his hamstring for two minutes before wandering off. It looks like he will be replaced. 12 mins: Ghana get the ball moving quickly forward with Atsu driving up the pitch, before cutting in and whacking a shot just wide with his left. Sadly, for him, it looks like he has damaged himself and needs treatment. 10 mins: Cameroon break down the left through Bong but he slips the ball out of play. 8 mins: An Atsu corner goes through the box and is just about cleared. 4 mins: Not much happening at the moment, I\u2019ll be honest. Here we go! Teams (again)!! Had to jump onto the cricket due to Rob Smyth\u2019s losing electricity, so apologies for a quiet buildup. A reminder of how warm it is ... My contribution to this year\u2019s Afcon ... Pathetic planning, it would seem ... Come in singing ... All the players to watch ... Cameroon: Onana, Fai, Kana-Biyik, Ngadeu-Ngadjui, Bong, Bassogog, Zambo-Anguissa, Mandjeck, Oyongo, Toko-Ekambi, N\u2019Jie Ghana: Ofori, Yiadom Rahman, Mensah, Kasim. Wakaso, Partey A Ayew, J Ayew, Atsu, Asamoah Good evening! Cameroon are looking to seal a spot in the knockout stages with a win here this evening. They are reigning champions so will be looking to keep their crown but Ghana will be tricky opposition in Ismailia. Guinea-Bissau held out for over an hour against Cameroon in their opening fixture, so Ghana will be confident they can get something tonight. Ghana will be disappointed to only draw against Benin last time round but they have the firepower to do some damage in this tournament. The Ayew brothers found the net in the 2-2 draw with Benin, so they will be looking to follow that up. Should be an interesting encounter!",

Now, two days on from that wonder strike against Norway, she is back on <em>terra firma</em> in Lyon, the French city that has long been the ultimate finishing school for her and other world-class players, preparing for England\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup semi-final against the USA on Tuesday.</p> <p>When Bronze moved to France from Manchester City in 2017 she was already an excellent player.

Then I got up to speed. It\u2019s definitely been the right move.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/29/womens-world-cup-diary-england-lucy-bronze\">Women\u2019s World Cup diary: Bronze brilliance and carbohydrate cursing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The bald statistics are striking. Lyon have steamrollered their way to the last 13 titles in France\u2019s Division 1 F\u00e9minine, as well as the last four Champions Leagues, making them without any doubt, the greatest club team in women\u2019s football history. For good measure they also have 16 players at this Women\u2019s World Cup, including England\u2019s Nikita Parris, who recently joined from City, as well as the Ballon d\u2019Or winner, Ada Hegerberg, who declined to play because she did not think Norway\u2019s setup was professional enough.</p> <p>Hegerberg\u2019s tone is very different when it comes to talking about Lyon, calling them \u201cthe perfect model of how you should run a modern club\u201d. You can see why. While many other clubs pay lip service to women\u2019s football, Lyon push it at the front and centre.</p> <p>The women\u2019s teams from the academy upwards, for instance, share facilities with the men \u2013 including training pitches, medical staff and a cryotherapy chamber. There is also \u201cthe mental cell\u201d which helps with the psychological pressures of performing. And as Dahbia Hattabi, the Lyon correspondent for <em>Foot Mercato</em> in France explains, ideas are exchanged and fermented between staff too. \u201cThere is a lot of interaction between coaches of both teams, and the players know each other well too,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything is together for both teams to think only football. The only difference is that the men play at Groupama Stadium, while the women only play there for big matches, usually in the Champions League.\u201d</p> <p>Lyon\u2019s president, Jean-Michel Aulas, who started the women\u2019s team in 2004, also regularly comes to watch and provides charter jets for the players. Recently he also recruited a new coach, Jean-Luc Vasseur, who has managed in Ligue 1 with Reims. It is difficult to imagine an English Women\u2019s Super League club attracting \u2013 or being able to pay \u2013 someone with such experience.</p> <p>\u201cBut you notice the little things at Lyon too,\u201d says Laetitia B\u00e9raud, a women\u2019s football writer at <em>Le Monde</em>. \u201cFor instance they will often weigh each player before and after training and matches to track hydration levels in order to make sure each player is at their best level. That shows how professional the club is.\u201d</p> <p>But B\u00e9raud insists there is something else as well: an understanding that both sexes are treated the same way from the top level down to the kids. \u201cI am 26 now, but even when I was growing up in Lyon we knew the club was scouting girls as well as boys to join their academy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt seemed normal to us. Only later did I realise how radical that was. It allowed girls to dream they could make it as a professional too. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d also highlight the attitude of the men\u2019s team too. At training it is not unusual to see them happily watching and waiting for the women to finish. In many clubs the women would be not be allowed to use those same facilities \u2013 they would be for the men\u2019s teams only.\u201d</p> <p>Crucially, they pay well, too. When <em>L\u2019\u00c9quipe</em> published the salaries of the top French players at the World Cup they were led by Lyon\u2019s Wendie Renard and Amandine Henry on \u20ac29,000 (\u00a326,000) a month, with several other Lyon players on between \u20ac10,000-\u20ac18,000. Meanwhile Hegerberg is reportedly on somewhere around \u20ac34,000 a month. True, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo will earn about 70 times that much. But for the women\u2019s game these are extraordinary figures, especially for a team that does not regularly attract more than a few thousand supporters each week.</p> <p>It is also telling that Lyon recently sold their TV rights to Canal+ for \u20ac1.2m a year. In 2017 that same deal was for \u20ac200,000 leading you to wonder what it might be in another two years\u2019 time.</p> <p>So how have Lyon been so successful? It helps that they established a women\u2019s team early. They were not quite the first movers \u2013 Montpellier established their women\u2019s team before them \u2013 but they were up and running in 2004, while most English clubs only started to merge their operations when the women\u2019s domestic league turned professional in 2010. Incredibly, two of the biggest clubs in Europe, Manchester United and Real Madrid, have only launched women\u2019s teams in the past year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/19/nikita-parris-lyon-manchester-city-england-womens-world-cup-david-beckham\">Nikita Parris: \u2018Lyon are irresistible because they\u2019re the best\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lyon\u2019s men dominated French football in the early 2000s but a sharp dip in their performances coincided with the national women\u2019s team reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2011. \u201cThat was a revelation,\u201d says B\u00e9raud. \u201cWe had never seen women\u2019s football on public TV and when the semi-final happened a lot of people got interested, they saw a lot of players were from Lyon. That definitely sparked a massive interest in the women\u2019s team. Now they are very popular.\u201d</p> <p>Aulas increased his investment in Lyon\u2019s women\u2019s team. As Anthony Hernandez of <em>Le Monde</em> explains, he was motivated by a mixture of idealism and pragmatism. \u201cI think Aulas understood earlier than most this was the right thing to do but also that he didn\u2019t have to put [in] too much money to dominate the women\u2019s game.\u201d</p> <p>Hernandez also cites the smart recruitment policy \u2013 which has included bringing in the captains of Germany and Japan, Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n and Saki Kumagai, as well as players such as Bronze and Parris \u2013 as important factors. However, he insists it is not just about money.</p> <p>\u201cPSG and Manchester City could spend more money on the women\u2019s game than Lyon, and maybe one day they will. But can they replicate the culture?\u201d he asks. \u201cThat is the big thing here. The women\u2019s players really feel like they are part of the club. Other teams might let them wear the shirt but otherwise they make them feel like second-class citizens.\u201d</p> <p>And Hattabi, who follows Lyon more closely than most, does not see their superiority ending any time soon. \u201cThey always want to win and they plan to dominate France and Europe for several more years,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not like they are resting on their laurels. There are young players like Selma Bacha and England\u2019s Nikita Parris arriving so the next generation is ready \u2013 and waiting to fire.\u201d</p>",

Meanwhile Hegerberg is reportedly on somewhere around \u20ac34,000 a month. True, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo will earn about 70 times that much. But for the women\u2019s game these are extraordinary figures, especially for a team that does not regularly attract more than a few thousand supporters each week. It is also telling that Lyon recently sold their TV rights to Canal+ for \u20ac1.2m a year. In 2017 that same deal was for \u20ac200,000 leading you to wonder what it might be in another two years\u2019 time. So how have Lyon been so successful? It helps that they established a women\u2019s team early. They were not quite the first movers \u2013 Montpellier established their women\u2019s team before them \u2013 but they were up and running in 2004, while most English clubs only started to merge their operations when the women\u2019s domestic league turned professional in 2010. Incredibly, two of the biggest clubs in Europe, Manchester United and Real Madrid, have only launched women\u2019s teams in the past year. Lyon\u2019s men dominated French football in the early 2000s but a sharp dip in their performances coincided with the national women\u2019s team reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2011. \u201cThat was a revelation,\u201d says B\u00e9raud. \u201cWe had never seen women\u2019s football on public TV and when the semi-final happened a lot of people got interested, they saw a lot of players were from Lyon. That definitely sparked a massive interest in the women\u2019s team. Now they are very popular.\u201d Aulas increased his investment in Lyon\u2019s women\u2019s team. As Anthony Hernandez of Le Monde explains, he was motivated by a mixture of idealism and pragmatism. \u201cI think Aulas understood earlier than most this was the right thing to do but also that he didn\u2019t have to put [in] too much money to dominate the women\u2019s game.\u201d Hernandez also cites the smart recruitment policy \u2013 which has included bringing in the captains of Germany and Japan, Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n and Saki Kumagai, as well as players such as Bronze and Parris \u2013 as important factors. However, he insists it is not just about money. \u201cPSG and Manchester City could spend more money on the women\u2019s game than Lyon, and maybe one day they will. But can they replicate the culture?\u201d he asks. \u201cThat is the big thing here. The women\u2019s players really feel like they are part of the club. Other teams might let them wear the shirt but otherwise they make them feel like second-class citizens.\u201d And Hattabi, who follows Lyon more closely than most, does not see their superiority ending any time soon. \u201cThey always want to win and they plan to dominate France and Europe for several more years,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like they are resting on their laurels. There are young players like Selma Bacha and England\u2019s Nikita Parris arriving so the next generation is ready \u2013 and waiting to fire.\u201d",

As police were ordered to bring them home, rightwing militia groups vowed to defend them, raising the prospect of violent confrontation. The issue that sparked the disorder in the Pacific Northwest state: climate crisis. The Republican senators were responding to an incremental, market-based, cap-and-trade plan aimed at curbing climate crisis. But, when faced with the climate bill, Republicans pulled their senators out of the state, and denied the Senate a quorum. Earlier in the session, they did the same thing when faced with a bill raising taxes for education, and Democrats broke the deadlock by abandoning bills intended to limit exemptions to vaccination and introduce gun control measures.

Rightwing patriot movement groups have, along with many Republicans, long expressed disbelief in human-induced global heating, and have sometimes embraced conspiracy-minded beliefs about environmental measures. The so-called \u201cAgenda 21\u201d conspiracy theory \u2013 which holds that there is a UN-driven plot to undermine US sovereignty, and exert \u201cfull spectrum dominance\u201d over a submissive population \u2013 is heavily discussed on the websites of groups such as the Oath Keepers. Some observers also saw the protest as evidence of a widening divide that exists in Oregon, and other western states, between urban liberals and rural conservatives \u2013 a miniature version of the national split between red states and blue. But it also pointed to the mainstreaming of patriot movement groups as a part of Oregon\u2019s conservative coalition. This has led to accusations by many that the local Republican party has become dangerously extreme and even courts \u201can armed wing\u201d. Joe Lowndes, a political scientist at the University of Oregon who researches rightwing politics, said: \u201cIf the Oregon Republican party were a European political party it would be an authoritarian far-right party. It really has that character, that extraordinary truculence,\u201d he said. During the standoff over climate crisis, Lowndes said, Republicans \u201cwere essentially gloating about having an armed wing of the party.

Senate Republicans did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The situation has led some to warn that conservatives elsewhere in the US may be similarly obstructive in the difficult but urgent efforts to address the climate crisis and may seek to adopt similar tactics. \u201cUnlike Vegas, what happens in Oregon doesn\u2019t stay in Oregon,\u201d said Eric Ward, executive director of the Western States Center, a progressive nonprofit. He added: \u201cIt should be a warning and a wake up call to the rest of the nation that, even when a governance system exists, even if you have a supermajority, that democratic practice itself is still vulnerable to being undermined, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.\u201d Citing the presence of often-armed patriot movement groups, and the unwillingness of Republicans to draw \u201ca clear moral line\u201d around such groups, Ward said: \u201cIf we were in Afghanistan, if we were in Iraq, if we were in Sudan, if we were in the former Yugoslavia, and this was taking place, we would call it a political crisis, and we would call it a threat to democratic practice.\u201d Others have observed an emerging nationwide pattern among conservatives of stretching or disregarding the norms that have previously helped political systems to function.

A spokesperson for the senate Democrats admitted: \u201cWe are in uncharted territory, but we are taking a long-term view and will not be deterred from passing significant climate action legislation,\u201d adding that Democrats may change quorum rules to prevent future deadlocks. Such a long-term view may be at odds with the pressing nature of the climate crisis \u2013 and the current political crisis in the state.

Writing in the Observer days after the presenter Jeremy Kyle chose not to appear before his committee\u2019s inquiry into reality television, Damian Collins, the Conservative MP for Folkestone and Hythe, says new powers are required that would punish witnesses who fail to give evidence. Collins, chair of the all-party digital, culture, media and sport committee, writes: \u201cWe need to formalise these powers and have a clear real-world sanction for those that refuse to comply with a request to provide evidence to a parliamentary committee. \u201cIn some countries, once this has been established, legal proceedings are commenced which could lead to a fine or some other appropriate sanction being enforced.\u201d The inquiry questioned ITV executives about the death of a participant in The Jeremy Kyle Show.

Another snub came from Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook. He was invited three times to appear before an inquiry into the effects of fake news on British democracy, but he refused to testify.

      "bodyText": "Considering he has been one of the biggest advocates of equal rights for men and women on the tennis tour, it is something of an irony that Andy Murray should so far have drawn a blank in his search for a mixed doubles partner at Wimbledon as he steps up his return, five months after hip surgery. The former world No 1, always a voice of reason whenever the odd naysayer raises his head to discuss equal prize money or other occasionally contentious issues, has been putting his name and number out there in the past couple of weeks, almost like a teenager begging for a date. And like a teenager, he has had to deal with more than his share of rejection. Ashleigh Barty, the recently crowned French Open champion who is already down to play women\u2019s doubles as well as singles, said she could not manage three events, a decision she described as one of the hardest she has ever had to make. And France\u2019s Kristina Mladenovic, who won the mixed title at Wimbledon in 2013, also politely declined for similar reasons. The Czech Barbora Strycova and Kirsten Flipkens of Belgium are among those who took to social media to offer their services, while the Australian Casey Dellacqua, who partnered Barty to three grand slam doubles finals, said she would consider coming out of retirement if Murray should come knocking. Murray has yet to decide, but just as he might have been despairing that he might not find an ideal partner, up stepped a rather unlikely possibility: Serena Williams. \u201cI\u2019m available,\u201d the 23-times grand slam singles champion said on Saturday, her tongue perhaps in cheek. \u201cI\u2019m feeling better now, so I\u2019m definitely available.\u201d Williams turns 38 in September and goes into Wimbledon without a warm-up event under her belt, the effect of a lingering knee injury leaving her unable to practise on grass until the start of last week. Whether her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, would countenance a decision to play mixed in addition to her singles is debatable and, as Williams said, her fitness is her first priority as she chases her 24th major title, a win that would equal the all-time record of the Australian Margaret Court. \u201cLet\u2019s see how my knee\u2019s going,\u201d said Williams, who won the mixed title in 1998 with Max Mirnyi of Belarus. \u201cI\u2019m finally doing good. I don\u2019t want to, like, go back.\u201d Having won the title at the Fever-Tree Championships on his return alongside Feliciano L\u00f3pez, Murray will partner Pierre-Hugues Herbert of France \u2013 winner of all four grand slam men\u2019s doubles titles \u2013 in the men\u2019s event.

It was convened by an exasperated Donald Tusk, the outgoing European council president, after this month\u2019s regular heads-of-government meeting failed to agree on his successor or who will fill other key posts, including European commission president and president of the European central bank.

But this time the standoff reflects some more basic, structural problems. Perhaps the biggest is that the Franco-German motor \u2013 the axis that has traditionally powered the EU \u2013 is stalling. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/19/the-franco-german-tussle-at-the-heart-of-who-will-lead-the-eu-commission\" title=\"\">Macron and Merkel are at odds</a> over much more than who can best fill Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s boots.</p> <p>Since becoming modern France\u2019s youngest president in 2017, Macron, 41, has lobbied hard for a \u201cEuropean renaissance\u201d, meaning a more integrated EU that acts as a bulwark against reactionary populist-nationalist forces at home and wields strategic influence globally. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/04/europe-brexit-uk\" title=\"\">open letter to Europe\u2019s citizens in March</a> called for enhanced budgetary, financial and defence cooperation \u2013 and an \u201cinternal security council\u201d overseeing borders, migration and a common asylum policy.</p> <p>Merkel, 64, who was a government minister when Macron was still at school, is much more cautious. The German chancellor and her Christian Democrat-led coalition are wary of grand French ambitions, partly because her business supporters worry Germany would end up paying. Merkel, brought up in East Germany under Soviet domination, is wedded to Nato and the transatlantic alliance in a way French leaders rarely are.</p> <p>Europe\u2019s apparent inability to rescue the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran from Donald Trump\u2019s ravages illustrates the limits of its bid to be a global player. The EU has sought ways to circumvent American oil and trade sanctions, and so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/26/credit-line-to-be-announced-to-ease-eu-and-iran-trading\" title=\"\">prevent the deal\u2019s collapse</a>. But it was castigated last week by Iran for not trying hard enough, and by the US for trying at all.</p> <p>To defy Washington in this way, albeit unsuccessfully, was unusual for EU leaders. Yet the main reason for their failure was economic, namely the pre-eminence of the dollar as the international currency of choice. Any company or bank that wants to keep on doing business round the world, or in America itself, simply cannot risk US treasury reprisals for breaching sanctions.</p> <p>\u201cThe brute reality, as things stand, is that Europe does not yet have the tools \u2013 or the will \u2013 to project its power,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/06/us-iran-sanctions-eu/592489/\" title=\"\">wrote Tom McTague in <em>Atlantic</em> magazine</a>. \u201cThe euro cannot be a credible alternative to the dollar as a reserve currency until it is radically reformed, and without a credible reserve currency Europe\u2019s financial might cannot match that of the US.\u201d On this analysis, it could be argued Macron\u2019s European vision is the right one.</p> <p>Europe\u2019s ambitions on the global stage will be further constrained by a clutch of pressing internal problems. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2019/may/26/eu-election-results-2019-across-europe\" title=\"\">EU parliamentary elections last month</a> revealed a continent experiencing extreme political volatility.

That will pose critical management challenges for whoever takes up the top EU posts this autumn. And these shifts are mirrored at the national level. Macron, under withering fire from <em>gilets jaunes</em> protesters, struggling with low approval ratings, and harried by a formidable hard-right rival in Marine Le Pen, is fighting to save his presidency. These stresses could push him into more disruptive positions on contentious European issues.</p> <p>In contrast, Merkel\u2019s reassuring presence has long provided Europe with a sense of continuity and stability.

      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel has the shakes. Emmanuel Macron has the collywobbles. And still Europe has no idea who will be in charge as it contemplates a stormy autumn strewn with political booby traps. In Britain, the Brexit deadline of 31 October is the only date that matters. But the EU, fragmented, disputatious and wounded to an extent unusual even by its fractious standards, is taking one day at a time. Sunday\u2019s special summit is a case in point. It was convened by an exasperated Donald Tusk, the outgoing European council president, after this month\u2019s regular heads-of-government meeting failed to agree on his successor or who will fill other key posts, including European commission president and president of the European central bank. Now they are having another try. Arguments over who gets what plum job are nothing new. But this time the standoff reflects some more basic, structural problems. Perhaps the biggest is that the Franco-German motor \u2013 the axis that has traditionally powered the EU \u2013 is stalling. Macron and Merkel are at odds over much more than who can best fill Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s boots. Since becoming modern France\u2019s youngest president in 2017, Macron, 41, has lobbied hard for a \u201cEuropean renaissance\u201d, meaning a more integrated EU that acts as a bulwark against reactionary populist-nationalist forces at home and wields strategic influence globally. His open letter to Europe\u2019s citizens in March called for enhanced budgetary, financial and defence cooperation \u2013 and an \u201cinternal security council\u201d overseeing borders, migration and a common asylum policy. Merkel, 64, who was a government minister when Macron was still at school, is much more cautious. The German chancellor and her Christian Democrat-led coalition are wary of grand French ambitions, partly because her business supporters worry Germany would end up paying. Merkel, brought up in East Germany under Soviet domination, is wedded to Nato and the transatlantic alliance in a way French leaders rarely are. Europe\u2019s apparent inability to rescue the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran from Donald Trump\u2019s ravages illustrates the limits of its bid to be a global player. The EU has sought ways to circumvent American oil and trade sanctions, and so prevent the deal\u2019s collapse. But it was castigated last week by Iran for not trying hard enough, and by the US for trying at all. To defy Washington in this way, albeit unsuccessfully, was unusual for EU leaders. Yet the main reason for their failure was economic, namely the pre-eminence of the dollar as the international currency of choice. Any company or bank that wants to keep on doing business round the world, or in America itself, simply cannot risk US treasury reprisals for breaching sanctions. \u201cThe brute reality, as things stand, is that Europe does not yet have the tools \u2013 or the will \u2013 to project its power,\u201d wrote Tom McTague in Atlantic magazine. \u201cThe euro cannot be a credible alternative to the dollar as a reserve currency until it is radically reformed, and without a credible reserve currency Europe\u2019s financial might cannot match that of the US.\u201d On this analysis, it could be argued Macron\u2019s European vision is the right one. Europe\u2019s ambitions on the global stage will be further constrained by a clutch of pressing internal problems. EU parliamentary elections last month revealed a continent experiencing extreme political volatility. Rightwing nationalists, such as Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, made advances, but so, too, did greens and liberals. The losers, overall, were traditional mainstream centre-left and centre-right parties. A likely consequence is that the new European parliament will be a less biddable, more unpredictable creature. That will pose critical management challenges for whoever takes up the top EU posts this autumn. And these shifts are mirrored at the national level. Macron, under withering fire from gilets jaunes protesters, struggling with low approval ratings, and harried by a formidable hard-right rival in Marine Le Pen, is fighting to save his presidency. These stresses could push him into more disruptive positions on contentious European issues. In contrast, Merkel\u2019s reassuring presence has long provided Europe with a sense of continuity and stability. But the \u201cMutti Merkel\u201d era is coming to a close. Falling support for the CDU, evidenced by state election reverses, has already led her to declare she will not stand for re-election in 2021. Inevitable speculation over her health, after she was twice seen physically shaking in public, will add to uncertainty about Germany\u2019s future course. The autumn looks troublesome for other reasons, too. The commission is pushing, perhaps unrealistically, for a 2021-27 budget deal \u2013 always a divisive issue. Pressure from Green MEPs and climate crisis activists will increase following the failure of this month\u2019s summit to agree a 2050 carbon-neutral emissions target. East European states were blamed, but France and Germany\u2019s inability to collaborate effectively was again cited as a factor. A dispute between Cyprus, Greece and Turkey over oil and gas exploration rights in eastern Mediterranean waters is potentially turbulent. Meanwhile, rightwing nationalist governments in Hungary and Poland, which goes to the polls in November, remain at odds with the commission over judicial and media freedom and governance issues. And then, to cap it all, there is the Brexit deadline. EU leaders insist this is Britain\u2019s problem to resolve. But there are tense undercurrents. Once again, France and Germany do not see eye to eye, with the latter more open to another British membership extension. And Macron seems to be itching for a fight with Boris Johnson.

The jockey who caused one of the biggest upsets in Epsom history, on the 40-1 shot Wings Of Eagles two summers ago, was at it again here, riding Sovereign, at 33-1, to a six-lengths victory in the Irish Derby which all but silenced a huge crowd crammed into the Curragh\u2019s new \u20ac81m grandstand.</p> <p>Sovereign, who is trained by Aidan O\u2019Brien, was generally assumed to be in Saturday\u2019s field to set a strong pace for his stable companion Anthony Van Dyck, who took <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/01/derby-2019-race-report-anthony-van-dyck-aidan-o-brien\" title=\"\">the Derby at Epsom</a> in a tight five-way finish earlier this month.

The pace was right, Padraig set perfect fractions, started to increase from halfway and he wasn\u2019t for stopping.

      "body": "<p><strong>Q: There are many books about young adulthood, but far fewer about ageing. I am searching for stories that can help me reflect on the state of my body and mind.</strong><br><em>Inna, aged 38, Berlin</em></p> <p><strong>A: Deborah Moggach, author and screenwriter, writes:</strong><br>Your question made me think about novels and how richly they can explore ageing, dealing as they do with memories and the past, the interior world that grows more and more dense, the older one gets, although you don\u2019t sound old at all. Plenty of novelists have reflected on this as they themselves grow old. Philip Roth and John Updike spring to mind, and in fact I\u2019d recommend Updike\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/17/julian-barnes-john-updike-rabbit\" title=\"\"><em>Rabbit </em>series</a>, taking us, as it does, through a man\u2019s life into his last years (though it\u2019s rather a shock to find the hero banging on about being ancient when he\u2019s only 65).</p> <p>Another book I\u2019d recommend is my favourite novel of all time, Arnold Bennett\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jan/01/the-old-wives-tale-by-arnold-bennett-an-extraordinary-story-of-ordinary-life\" title=\"\"><em>The Old Wives Tale</em></a>. This, too, leads us through the years, from the childhood of our heroines Sophia and Constance right up to their old age, a journey that begins and ends in the Potteries.

When all we have are our memories, this wonderful novel explores a traumatic event, seen from the viewpoint of great age, and is suffused with the elegiac glow of a long-lost summer. It\u2019s one of the few novels that was made into an equally successful film.</p> <p>For nonfiction, there\u2019s the invigorating Diana Athill, whose books give hope to us all, and the equally fabulous Nora Ephron, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/13/i-remember-nothing-nora-ephron-review\" title=\"\"><em>I Remember Nothing</em></a> hilariously explores how memories can in fact entirely disintegrate. Simon Gray\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/09/review-coda-simon-gray\" title=\"\"><em>Coda</em></a>, his diaries about the intemperate furies and frustrations of old age, will also reduce you to helpless laughter.</p> <p>Finally, Virginia Ironside has written some very funny and salty reflections on ageing in several books, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/no-i-don-t-want-to-join-a-bookclub.html\" title=\"\"><em>No!

      "bodyText": "Q: There are many books about young adulthood, but far fewer about ageing. I am searching for stories that can help me reflect on the state of my body and mind. Inna, aged 38, Berlin A: Deborah Moggach, author and screenwriter, writes: Your question made me think about novels and how richly they can explore ageing, dealing as they do with memories and the past, the interior world that grows more and more dense, the older one gets, although you don\u2019t sound old at all. Plenty of novelists have reflected on this as they themselves grow old. Philip Roth and John Updike spring to mind, and in fact I\u2019d recommend Updike\u2019s Rabbit series, taking us, as it does, through a man\u2019s life into his last years (though it\u2019s rather a shock to find the hero banging on about being ancient when he\u2019s only 65). Another book I\u2019d recommend is my favourite novel of all time, Arnold Bennett\u2019s The Old Wives Tale. This, too, leads us through the years, from the childhood of our heroines Sophia and Constance right up to their old age, a journey that begins and ends in the Potteries. Then there\u2019s Paul Scott\u2019s peerless Staying On, about an elderly couple stubbornly remaining in India, long after the Raj, simply because they have nowhere else to go. \u201cThe past is a foreign country; they do things differently there\u201d: we all know the famous opening line of LP Hartley\u2019s The Go-Between. When all we have are our memories, this wonderful novel explores a traumatic event, seen from the viewpoint of great age, and is suffused with the elegiac glow of a long-lost summer. It\u2019s one of the few novels that was made into an equally successful film. For nonfiction, there\u2019s the invigorating Diana Athill, whose books give hope to us all, and the equally fabulous Nora Ephron, whose I Remember Nothing hilariously explores how memories can in fact entirely disintegrate. Simon Gray\u2019s Coda, his diaries about the intemperate furies and frustrations of old age, will also reduce you to helpless laughter. Finally, Virginia Ironside has written some very funny and salty reflections on ageing in several books, No! I Don\u2019t Want to Join a Bookclub; No Thanks! I\u2019m Quite Happy Standing and No! I Don\u2019t Need Reading Glasses. The titles say it all. Happy reading \u2013 with or without glasses. Deborah Moggach\u2019s new novel, The Carer, is out on 8 July (Tinder, \u00a316.99).

Her first novel, <em>The Border of Paradise</em> (2016), explored mental illness, family and migration. Wang was named a best young American novelist by Granta (2017) and is the recipient of a Whiting award (2018). She was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder in 2013 and late-stage Lyme disease in 2015. Her <em>New York Times</em>-bestselling essay collection,<a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/collected-schizophrenias-9781555978273.html\" title=\"\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/collected-schizophrenias-9781555978273.html\" title=\"\">The Collected Schizophrenias</a></em>, which steps both inside and outside of her condition to bring it to light, has just been published. It won the Graywolf nonfiction prize.</p> <p><strong>Why did you decide to write </strong><em><strong>The Collected Schizophrenias</strong></em><strong>?</strong><br>I had never planned to write a nonfiction book \u2013 I have an MFA in fiction. I was waiting around to see if my first novel would ever sell and I was experiencing a severe episode of psychosis. As a way of coping, I was writing about it, which became the essay <a href=\"http://the-toast.net/2014/06/25/perdition-days-experiencing-psychosis/\" title=\"\">Perdition Days</a>. After that episode was over, I polished the essay and ended up finding a home for it on the Toast website [in 2014]. It became rather popular and I received a lot of emails and kind comments. I began to write more essays. That snowballed into what is now this book.</p> <p><strong>You write: \u201cI\u2019ve inherited a love of writing and a talent for the visual arts from my mother, as well as her long and tapered fingers; I\u2019ve also inherited a tendency for madness.\u201d Could you tell me more about that inheritance of mental illness?</strong><br>In the beginning, I didn\u2019t know that there was any mental illness in my family tree. I didn\u2019t know about my mother\u2019s mental illness. I didn\u2019t know about my great-aunt who had died in a mental institution. I didn\u2019t know about my mother\u2019s cousin who had killed himself. There was all this family secrecy around mental illness. A lot of that has to do with cultural stuff \u2013 this idea of saving face and not wanting to be open about these things that are not considered appropriate to talk about or that might bring shame upon the family. As I was getting diagnosed, I learned more about what was in my bloodline. </p> <p><strong>What are your memories of growing up in the midwest?</strong><br>I grew up in a small town that was mostly white and my parents were immigrants dealing with their own stuff, trying to live in this new country. I remember being called racial slurs by other little kids in elementary school, and being confused and embarrassed by my parents who had different accents. I feel so bad about that now. There were things about growing up in a mostly white community and the strain that put on my parents that affected my brother and me. One time in public, this woman was yelling at my mother to take us kids and go back to her own country. </p> <p><strong>In the book, you explore the relationship between creativity and mental health. Why do you feel </strong><strong>it\u2019s important not to glamorise it?</strong><br>I do want to be careful not to glamorise mental illness when it comes to creativity because more often than not it actually tends to inhibit creativity. I wrote Perdition Days when experiencing psychosis, but that was a fluke. It\u2019s more normal for me not to be able to function, let alone write, when I am very ill. I want to emphasise and never lose sight of how much suffering is involved.</p> <p><strong>The essays viscerally evoke your experiences, for example, your first hallucination\u2026</strong><br>I was in my senior year at Stanford. Hallucinations kidnap the senses. When I was in the shower and heard the voice saying: \u201cI hate you\u201d, I was so sure I heard it that I started coming up with all kinds of explanations; could it be coming from the pipes or drain or showerhead? That kicked off a whole period of hallucinations on and off for many years.</p> <p><strong>You write powerfully about Cotard\u2019s </strong><strong>syndrome</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>which makes people believe they have already died</strong><strong>\u2026</strong><br>It was incredibly difficult \u2013 there were times I felt I could pretend things were OK and I was in this afterlife, but for the most part it was awful.

      "bodyText": "Esm\u00e9 Weijun Wang, 36, was born in Michigan to Taiwanese parents, has an MFA from the University of Michigan and now lives in San Francisco. Her first novel, The Border of Paradise (2016), explored mental illness, family and migration. Wang was named a best young American novelist by Granta (2017) and is the recipient of a Whiting award (2018). She was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder in 2013 and late-stage Lyme disease in 2015. Her New York Times-bestselling essay collection, The Collected Schizophrenias, which steps both inside and outside of her condition to bring it to light, has just been published. It won the Graywolf nonfiction prize. Why did you decide to write The Collected Schizophrenias? I had never planned to write a nonfiction book \u2013 I have an MFA in fiction. I was waiting around to see if my first novel would ever sell and I was experiencing a severe episode of psychosis. As a way of coping, I was writing about it, which became the essay Perdition Days. After that episode was over, I polished the essay and ended up finding a home for it on the Toast website [in 2014]. It became rather popular and I received a lot of emails and kind comments. I began to write more essays. That snowballed into what is now this book. You write: \u201cI\u2019ve inherited a love of writing and a talent for the visual arts from my mother, as well as her long and tapered fingers; I\u2019ve also inherited a tendency for madness.\u201d Could you tell me more about that inheritance of mental illness? In the beginning, I didn\u2019t know that there was any mental illness in my family tree. I didn\u2019t know about my mother\u2019s mental illness. I didn\u2019t know about my great-aunt who had died in a mental institution. I didn\u2019t know about my mother\u2019s cousin who had killed himself. There was all this family secrecy around mental illness. A lot of that has to do with cultural stuff \u2013 this idea of saving face and not wanting to be open about these things that are not considered appropriate to talk about or that might bring shame upon the family. As I was getting diagnosed, I learned more about what was in my bloodline. What are your memories of growing up in the midwest? I grew up in a small town that was mostly white and my parents were immigrants dealing with their own stuff, trying to live in this new country. I remember being called racial slurs by other little kids in elementary school, and being confused and embarrassed by my parents who had different accents. I feel so bad about that now. There were things about growing up in a mostly white community and the strain that put on my parents that affected my brother and me. One time in public, this woman was yelling at my mother to take us kids and go back to her own country. In the book, you explore the relationship between creativity and mental health. Why do you feel it\u2019s important not to glamorise it? I do want to be careful not to glamorise mental illness when it comes to creativity because more often than not it actually tends to inhibit creativity. I wrote Perdition Days when experiencing psychosis, but that was a fluke. It\u2019s more normal for me not to be able to function, let alone write, when I am very ill. I want to emphasise and never lose sight of how much suffering is involved. The essays viscerally evoke your experiences, for example, your first hallucination\u2026 I was in my senior year at Stanford. Hallucinations kidnap the senses. When I was in the shower and heard the voice saying: \u201cI hate you\u201d, I was so sure I heard it that I started coming up with all kinds of explanations; could it be coming from the pipes or drain or showerhead? That kicked off a whole period of hallucinations on and off for many years. You write powerfully about Cotard\u2019s syndrome, which makes people believe they have already died\u2026 It was incredibly difficult \u2013 there were times I felt I could pretend things were OK and I was in this afterlife, but for the most part it was awful. There were times when I could not stand to be conscious. I would get through every five seconds \u2013 I\u2019d think five seconds, the next five\u2026 it was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve gotten through. Was it challenging to write the book? It was as traumatising as writing a memoir in many ways. I talked to friends who\u2019ve written memoirs, including Blair Braverman, who wrote Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube, because I was having such a hard time.

It was helpful to be reassured that it wasn\u2019t strange to find it so hard to write, that it was quite common to be retraumatised by writing about things that had happened. Is it true you listen to music while writing? I listened to Ultraviolence by Lana del Rey when writing The Collected Schizophrenias \u2013 I must confess that I was secretly hoping the book would get to her somehow and she might find out that I\u2019ve acknowledged her.

As Daphne Caruana Galizia, a renowned investigative journalist on the island state of Malta, rushed out of the family home to get to the bank, her son Matthew offered to make ravioli. They joked about his culinary skills, and then she was gone. Moments later, he heard an explosion.

      "body": "<p>I wanted to donate breast milk even before I had my now four-month-old daughter, Gallia, whose birth has made it possible. It is she, I suppose, who is performing the act of generosity, sharing her dinner with those not born so lucky. Gallia has recently acquired what I believe to be her fourth chin, and so she is in a position to be charitable. If that sounds smug, it isn\u2019t. I am grateful beyond measure that I have been able to feed her. It wasn\u2019t always thus.</p> <p>Gallia\u2019s older sisters, my identical twin girls, Raffaella and Celeste, now aged three, were born 10 weeks early. They needed oxygen to breathe, an incubator to regulate their temperature, intravenous nutritional support and a nasal-gastric tube that dripped breast milk directly into their unready stomachs to sustain them in place of their lost umbilical cord. They weighed just a shade over 2lb each and they would spend 56 days in hospital before they were well enough to come home.</p> <p>I lay in the aftermath of an emergency caesarean while a gentle midwife showed me the distinctly ungentle manoeuvres required to hand-express. She squeezed and squeezed, but the tears that slid down my face came more readily than colostrum. My breasts had expected two more months of pregnancy; they were as unready as the rest of me. In the end the midwife left with 0.4ml in a tiny syringe. In the days that followed, the babies\u2019 needs were so modest \u2013 1ml an hour between them \u2013 but it was still more than my body would yield.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the days that followed, the babies\u2019 needs were so modest, but it was still more than my body would yield</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For two days my scant production was supplemented with donor milk. In their first days the feeding tube went into their mouths, for their nostrils were too little even for the tiniest of lines. A syringe was screwed on to the top of the tube, the plunger depressed, the whole \u201cfeed\u201d over in moments \u2013 0.5ml is about five drops, less than you would feed a day-old kitten. But those scant droplets were keeping my daughters alive. I stood by, feeling useless, guilty, grateful. I had failed to keep them safe inside my body and now I was failing to provide the scant nourishment they needed.</p> <p>But somewhere out there I felt the presence of another mother \u2013 and I felt supported, nurtured by her care. Here, take this. I have, you need. I felt so close to her I could almost see her face. She was anonymous, yet there were things I knew about her: she had a new baby. Without doubt, she had her own worries. Yet her generosity made possible the miracles that were my daughters. She offered up her antibodies to newborns in a state of terrifying immune compromise. She held my hand and we shielded the babies as best we could from necrotising enterocolitis (death of the bowel) and from sepsis, from deadly bacteria and viruses. Because of her, I was granted space to heal, to catch up, to learn.</p> <p>I expressed and expressed. I Googled and cried, and then I expressed again. There was a surprisingly robust uniformity of opinion on the internet, and sources ranging from science to quackery. But it was generally agreed that the following are good for the production of breast milk: malt, porridge oats, dark beer, garlic, black sesame seeds, carrot juice, barley, asparagus, brown rice, almonds, alfalfa, fenugreek. As two-thirds of my meals came from a hospital vending machine I opted for supplements, ignoring \u201cdirections for use\u201d and swallowing fenugreek capsules until I began to smell like a chicken curry. Spice permeated my skin; my breath and sweat took on its tang. Who knows if it worked, but my milk soon came in \u2013 probably it always would have done.</p> <p>After a day or two we no longer needed donor milk. But those days were not an inconsiderable gift: research has shown that for the tiniest premature babies, born with immature guts and immune systems, formula milk increases the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), one of the most feared killers in neonatal intensive care. In 2016, a study in the <em>Journal of Pediatrics</em> found that formula-fed infants were at a higher risk of developing NEC compared with those who were breastfed, and an article the same year in <em>Pediatrics</em> found specifically that the increased availability of donor milk is associated with reduced incidence of NEC.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Donating breast milk is non\u2019t widely publicised and is woefully under-funded</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Donating breast milk isn\u2019t widely publicised and is woefully under-funded. It is a constant frustration to services that there are more than enough willing milk donors around the country, but the banks do not have the financial wherewithal to process, store and distribute sufficient stock. Despite the well-established proven health benefits of breast milk for both pre-term and full-term infants, there is not the funding to ensure equal distribution around the country. Access is patchwork, dependent upon local trusts and policies.</p> <p>Donating breast milk is not the same as milk sharing, a practice as ancient as wet nursing. The Facebook page <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HM4HBUK/\" title=\"\">Human Milk 4 Human Babies UK</a> has 23k likes, and steady traffic around the country offering and requesting milk. But while milk banks screen and pasteurise, milk sharing is informal and, crucially, unscreened for viruses and pathogens. Exclusive breastfeeding is what we are told, endlessly, is best, and an inevitable consequence of such educational campaigns is that mothers who struggle to nurse their babies are left feeling inadequate, without necessarily having access to the support that might enable them to overcome their early difficulties. </p> <p>But new models might permit safe provision to home and hospital. The <a href=\"http://heartsmilkbank.org/\" title=\"\">Hearts Milk Bank</a> provides milk to neonatal units and to mothers struggling to feed. Priority goes to women who cannot feed due to chemotherapy, mastectomy or illness; and to babies with bowel or terminal illnesses who cannot tolerate other food. With greater funding, they hope to be able to provide lactation support and safe donor milk to anyone who needs it. \u201cNinety per cent of mothers who want to breastfeed stop before they intended to,\u201d says Natalie Shenker, co-founder of Hearts. \u201cIf everyone had support with breastfeeding after giving birth, including access to a lactation consultant and donor milk where necessary, breastfeeding rates in the UK could be transformed.\u201d </p> <p>Thinking I was an old hand at the pumping game, I didn\u2019t register as a donor until I had the requisite two litres in the freezer. I was familiar with the hygiene protocols required from my own days expressing in a hospital, so I thought I knew what I was doing. I filled out a lifestyle questionnaire and had a chat with a nurse on the phone. It all looks good, she told me. They would send a courier for the milk and once they had received it I would go to my local hospital for a blood test: HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B and C. Just one more formality \u2013 what temperature was my freezer? It has to be -18C, she said, or colder. Still on the phone, I padded into the kitchen where -16C was illuminated in red. I peered sorrowfully into the bottom drawer in which 37 bags of milk were stacked between boxes of fish fingers and Soleros. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d Softly I closed the door, and took a breath. \u201cMinus 18. No problem at all. I\u2019ll start again.\u201d Yes, but just \u201cthink of the calories,\u201d said a friend.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Breast pumps have always been ludicrous items: \u2013 one part agricultural, two parts penis extender</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I write this, as I write much else, attached to a breast pump. They have come on light years: these days I have no ghastly ca-thunking locomotive soundtrack, no <em>Carry On </em>protuberances, no flanges. Breast pumps have always been ludicrous: one part agricultural, two parts penis extender. In the milking shed of the newborn intensive care unit, we sat in a circle, tits out, conversation punctuated by the obscene slurp and suck, and the wheeze of the motors. Occasionally someone would turn theirs up too high and yelp; other times we would get distracted, chatting, and someone else would begin to overflow, and make the inevitable spilled milk joke, even as the tears began to fall.</p> <p>Now that is behind me, as is the conical Madonna affair that used to so traumatise the Amazon man when I answered the door. Today I have a neat little <a href=\"https://www.elvie.com/\" title=\"\">Elvie pump</a> tucked into my bra, understated and ergonomic as a sex toy; wireless, USB-chargeable, Bluetooth enabled. If you didn\u2019t know it was there, you might think I was just busty.</p> <p>My twins are bonny and well. The trauma of their first months is behind us, but I will never forget it, nor would I want to. I pump after Gallia has had her morning feed, and then in the evenings once she\u2019s down and I have collapsed on the sofa; I wander around the house on the classic parents\u2019 nightly perambulation, picking up Duplo, recovering abandoned socks. It has so easily become part of my routine that I barely think about it; five minutes here, 10 minutes there, not enormous amounts, but a slow accretion in the freezer, until sooner than you\u2019d think it is time to call the courier. I am fulfilling a promise I made to myself, long ago.</p> <p><em>Mother Ship by Francesca Segal is published by Chatto &amp; Windus at \u00a314.99; or \u00a311.49 from <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/mother-ship-9781784742690.html\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com</a>.

They weighed just a shade over 2lb each and they would spend 56 days in hospital before they were well enough to come home. I lay in the aftermath of an emergency caesarean while a gentle midwife showed me the distinctly ungentle manoeuvres required to hand-express. She squeezed and squeezed, but the tears that slid down my face came more readily than colostrum. My breasts had expected two more months of pregnancy; they were as unready as the rest of me. In the end the midwife left with 0.4ml in a tiny syringe. In the days that followed, the babies\u2019 needs were so modest \u2013 1ml an hour between them \u2013 but it was still more than my body would yield. For two days my scant production was supplemented with donor milk. In their first days the feeding tube went into their mouths, for their nostrils were too little even for the tiniest of lines. A syringe was screwed on to the top of the tube, the plunger depressed, the whole \u201cfeed\u201d over in moments \u2013 0.5ml is about five drops, less than you would feed a day-old kitten. But those scant droplets were keeping my daughters alive. I stood by, feeling useless, guilty, grateful. I had failed to keep them safe inside my body and now I was failing to provide the scant nourishment they needed. But somewhere out there I felt the presence of another mother \u2013 and I felt supported, nurtured by her care. Here, take this. I have, you need. I felt so close to her I could almost see her face. She was anonymous, yet there were things I knew about her: she had a new baby. Without doubt, she had her own worries. Yet her generosity made possible the miracles that were my daughters. She offered up her antibodies to newborns in a state of terrifying immune compromise. She held my hand and we shielded the babies as best we could from necrotising enterocolitis (death of the bowel) and from sepsis, from deadly bacteria and viruses. Because of her, I was granted space to heal, to catch up, to learn. I expressed and expressed. I Googled and cried, and then I expressed again. There was a surprisingly robust uniformity of opinion on the internet, and sources ranging from science to quackery. But it was generally agreed that the following are good for the production of breast milk: malt, porridge oats, dark beer, garlic, black sesame seeds, carrot juice, barley, asparagus, brown rice, almonds, alfalfa, fenugreek. As two-thirds of my meals came from a hospital vending machine I opted for supplements, ignoring \u201cdirections for use\u201d and swallowing fenugreek capsules until I began to smell like a chicken curry. Spice permeated my skin; my breath and sweat took on its tang. Who knows if it worked, but my milk soon came in \u2013 probably it always would have done. After a day or two we no longer needed donor milk. But those days were not an inconsiderable gift: research has shown that for the tiniest premature babies, born with immature guts and immune systems, formula milk increases the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), one of the most feared killers in neonatal intensive care. In 2016, a study in the Journal of Pediatrics found that formula-fed infants were at a higher risk of developing NEC compared with those who were breastfed, and an article the same year in Pediatrics found specifically that the increased availability of donor milk is associated with reduced incidence of NEC. Donating breast milk isn\u2019t widely publicised and is woefully under-funded. It is a constant frustration to services that there are more than enough willing milk donors around the country, but the banks do not have the financial wherewithal to process, store and distribute sufficient stock. Despite the well-established proven health benefits of breast milk for both pre-term and full-term infants, there is not the funding to ensure equal distribution around the country. Access is patchwork, dependent upon local trusts and policies. Donating breast milk is not the same as milk sharing, a practice as ancient as wet nursing. The Facebook page Human Milk 4 Human Babies UK has 23k likes, and steady traffic around the country offering and requesting milk. But while milk banks screen and pasteurise, milk sharing is informal and, crucially, unscreened for viruses and pathogens. Exclusive breastfeeding is what we are told, endlessly, is best, and an inevitable consequence of such educational campaigns is that mothers who struggle to nurse their babies are left feeling inadequate, without necessarily having access to the support that might enable them to overcome their early difficulties. But new models might permit safe provision to home and hospital. The Hearts Milk Bank provides milk to neonatal units and to mothers struggling to feed. Priority goes to women who cannot feed due to chemotherapy, mastectomy or illness; and to babies with bowel or terminal illnesses who cannot tolerate other food. With greater funding, they hope to be able to provide lactation support and safe donor milk to anyone who needs it. \u201cNinety per cent of mothers who want to breastfeed stop before they intended to,\u201d says Natalie Shenker, co-founder of Hearts. \u201cIf everyone had support with breastfeeding after giving birth, including access to a lactation consultant and donor milk where necessary, breastfeeding rates in the UK could be transformed.\u201d Thinking I was an old hand at the pumping game, I didn\u2019t register as a donor until I had the requisite two litres in the freezer. I was familiar with the hygiene protocols required from my own days expressing in a hospital, so I thought I knew what I was doing. I filled out a lifestyle questionnaire and had a chat with a nurse on the phone. It all looks good, she told me. They would send a courier for the milk and once they had received it I would go to my local hospital for a blood test: HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B and C. Just one more formality \u2013 what temperature was my freezer? It has to be -18C, she said, or colder. Still on the phone, I padded into the kitchen where -16C was illuminated in red. I peered sorrowfully into the bottom drawer in which 37 bags of milk were stacked between boxes of fish fingers and Soleros. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d Softly I closed the door, and took a breath. \u201cMinus 18. No problem at all. I\u2019ll start again.\u201d Yes, but just \u201cthink of the calories,\u201d said a friend. I write this, as I write much else, attached to a breast pump. They have come on light years: these days I have no ghastly ca-thunking locomotive soundtrack, no Carry On protuberances, no flanges. Breast pumps have always been ludicrous: one part agricultural, two parts penis extender. In the milking shed of the newborn intensive care unit, we sat in a circle, tits out, conversation punctuated by the obscene slurp and suck, and the wheeze of the motors. Occasionally someone would turn theirs up too high and yelp; other times we would get distracted, chatting, and someone else would begin to overflow, and make the inevitable spilled milk joke, even as the tears began to fall. Now that is behind me, as is the conical Madonna affair that used to so traumatise the Amazon man when I answered the door. Today I have a neat little Elvie pump tucked into my bra, understated and ergonomic as a sex toy; wireless, USB-chargeable, Bluetooth enabled. If you didn\u2019t know it was there, you might think I was just busty. My twins are bonny and well. The trauma of their first months is behind us, but I will never forget it, nor would I want to. I pump after Gallia has had her morning feed, and then in the evenings once she\u2019s down and I have collapsed on the sofa; I wander around the house on the classic parents\u2019 nightly perambulation, picking up Duplo, recovering abandoned socks. It has so easily become part of my routine that I barely think about it; five minutes here, 10 minutes there, not enormous amounts, but a slow accretion in the freezer, until sooner than you\u2019d think it is time to call the courier. I am fulfilling a promise I made to myself, long ago. Mother Ship by Francesca Segal is published by Chatto &amp; Windus at \u00a314.99; or \u00a311.49 from guardianbookshop.com.

We\u2019re in talks about a second film and are working on a new Bros record. And incredible things are happening for my 10th anniversary year here in Vegas. I just want to continue representing my country and be a gentleman while doing it. Bros play Brixton Academy on Friday 5 July",

      "body": "<p>Glastonbury is another world. At least, that\u2019s what it feels like when you\u2019re there: it\u2019s so vast, so utterly overwhelming. The size of Colchester is the latest comparison (as though that means anything to anyone). At night, if you stand at the back of the Green Fields, you can see the festival stretching down, twinkling, filling the valley all the way to the lit-up cross.</p> \n<p>Our tent is small, and so are you. Teeny-tiny you is inside enormous Glastonbury, part of it at all times, whether you\u2019re being teased by drag queens in Block9, watching the sun come up in the Sacred Space, traipsing along the surprisingly quiet main drag in the heat or curled up on your coat in the foetal position somewhere between the Left Field and the Glade, wondering if you\u2019ll ever stop shaking. It\u2019s a Narnia of escapism, of living in the moment, a fantasy break away from the everyday. A bubble of joy \u2013 or at least a hiccup of concentrated sensation \u2013 in a world of never-ending routine. \u201cIn Glastonbury,\u201d tweeted a friend yesterday, \u201cmy life is perfect and unsustainable.\u201d</p> \n<p>The experience of Glastonbury is so intense and fleeting, in fact, that it seems obvious to think of it as separate from everyday life. Surely this once-in-the-year carnival is a magical world that disappears as soon as you turn your back? But Glastonbury doesn\u2019t float above the cow fields. It is plugged into our culture, deeply rooted. Not just in its locality \u2013 this is not about the ancient mysteries of Avalon, though some of us have time for that \u2013 but in our society. Glastonbury is born of the normality that we return to; its culture grows from its time.</p> \n<p>In the late 80s, when the posters for Glastonbury still made reference to1960s psychedelia and the main stage was a pyramid because a pyramid was deemed to have special powers; when the drugs on offer were mostly acid and mushrooms, and the lasers were green and seemed as though they came from the future; back then, Glastonbury had a DIY, anarcho feel. There was a Travellers\u2019 camping field and soap-dodgers (dogs on strings, road warriors): a big-booted, dreadlocked scary army. They drove through the festival in their Mad Max vehicles. Around that time, Archaos, the alternative French circus, performed on top of the Pyramid stage for three nights running, with a man walking the high wire and crashed cars plummeting down the sides. What can I say? It was of its time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3e10e7cf-0ade-4aca-aba9-b9f4bd924679\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Glastonbury is banning single use plastics. The world\u2019s largest greenfield festival wants to avoid scenes of the area in front of its legendary stages being strewn with plastic after the shows have ended. In 2017, visitors to the festival got through 1.3m plastic bottles.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>For 2019, festival co-organiser Emily Eavis said \u201cWe\u2019re asking people to bring a reusable bottle to the festival this year, which can be filled up from one of 37 WaterAid kiosks or 20 refill stations.\u201d<br></p>\n    <p>People are also being encouraged to take other steps to limit their impact on the environment, such as using public transport to get to the venue, avoiding the use of undegradable wet wipes, not leaving their tents behind to prevent them ending up in landfill, and opting for biodegradable glitter instead of the plastic kind.<br></p>\n    <p>This year the festival will also feature a procession held by climate crisis activists Extinction Rebellion.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As was the Madchester Glastonbury, some time in the early 90s, when hundreds of gatecrashers came in over the wall (easiest at the back of the festival), or under it and out through a conveniently positioned tent, popping through the flap one by one like a silent comedy sketch. That time when every crowd pressure point, the tight spaces where you crossed rivers or cut back along the train track, was full of Reni-hatted scallies, pushing pills.</p> \n<p>We could be here for ages. Each Glastonbury is different. Mostly, you recall them by the mad things that happened: that one where the hippy fell out of the tree and his friends called for an ambulance by whistling down the valley to each other; that one where the naked, middle-aged woman masturbated next to the bandstand; that one with the man with the duck. Sometimes, you remember the bands, but they tend to be the backdrop, rather than the action. It\u2019s the people who are the festival. Different people now, dressed differently, dancing to different music, doing different drugs. You could call this fashion, of course. Or you could call it society.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Sometimes you remember the bands, but they tend to be the backdrop...

      "bodyText": "Glastonbury is another world. At least, that\u2019s what it feels like when you\u2019re there: it\u2019s so vast, so utterly overwhelming. The size of Colchester is the latest comparison (as though that means anything to anyone). At night, if you stand at the back of the Green Fields, you can see the festival stretching down, twinkling, filling the valley all the way to the lit-up cross. Our tent is small, and so are you. Teeny-tiny you is inside enormous Glastonbury, part of it at all times, whether you\u2019re being teased by drag queens in Block9, watching the sun come up in the Sacred Space, traipsing along the surprisingly quiet main drag in the heat or curled up on your coat in the foetal position somewhere between the Left Field and the Glade, wondering if you\u2019ll ever stop shaking. It\u2019s a Narnia of escapism, of living in the moment, a fantasy break away from the everyday. A bubble of joy \u2013 or at least a hiccup of concentrated sensation \u2013 in a world of never-ending routine. \u201cIn Glastonbury,\u201d tweeted a friend yesterday, \u201cmy life is perfect and unsustainable.\u201d The experience of Glastonbury is so intense and fleeting, in fact, that it seems obvious to think of it as separate from everyday life. Surely this once-in-the-year carnival is a magical world that disappears as soon as you turn your back? But Glastonbury doesn\u2019t float above the cow fields. It is plugged into our culture, deeply rooted. Not just in its locality \u2013 this is not about the ancient mysteries of Avalon, though some of us have time for that \u2013 but in our society. Glastonbury is born of the normality that we return to; its culture grows from its time. In the late 80s, when the posters for Glastonbury still made reference to1960s psychedelia and the main stage was a pyramid because a pyramid was deemed to have special powers; when the drugs on offer were mostly acid and mushrooms, and the lasers were green and seemed as though they came from the future; back then, Glastonbury had a DIY, anarcho feel. There was a Travellers\u2019 camping field and soap-dodgers (dogs on strings, road warriors): a big-booted, dreadlocked scary army. They drove through the festival in their Mad Max vehicles. Around that time, Archaos, the alternative French circus, performed on top of the Pyramid stage for three nights running, with a man walking the high wire and crashed cars plummeting down the sides. What can I say? It was of its time. As was the Madchester Glastonbury, some time in the early 90s, when hundreds of gatecrashers came in over the wall (easiest at the back of the festival), or under it and out through a conveniently positioned tent, popping through the flap one by one like a silent comedy sketch. That time when every crowd pressure point, the tight spaces where you crossed rivers or cut back along the train track, was full of Reni-hatted scallies, pushing pills. We could be here for ages. Each Glastonbury is different. Mostly, you recall them by the mad things that happened: that one where the hippy fell out of the tree and his friends called for an ambulance by whistling down the valley to each other; that one where the naked, middle-aged woman masturbated next to the bandstand; that one with the man with the duck. Sometimes, you remember the bands, but they tend to be the backdrop, rather than the action. It\u2019s the people who are the festival. Different people now, dressed differently, dancing to different music, doing different drugs. You could call this fashion, of course. Or you could call it society. From the outside, Glastonbury appears to be a festival that has, as the dads say, its finger on the pulse. It generates news: minor royals getting down with the kids; \u201cWooh, Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. This year, that chant has gone, replaced by Stormzy\u2019s \u201cfuck the government, fuck Boris\u201d and the climate activism march through the ground by Extinction Rebellion and Greenpeace. There are more queer people at Glastonbury, drawn by Block9, and the fact that Pride is on a different weekend, for once. Glastonbury isn\u2019t the first with trends, but it adopts them and brings them to mainstream attention, sells them to those who would never dream of going to a festival, the sofa-bound, tweeting, Fomo\u2019d music lovers. There is an ebb and flow of influences, in and out of Glastonbury and everyday life. Health and safety culture, green activism, the fabulosity and kindness of drag queens, grime acts as pop stars.

      "bodyText": "Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, may have described the G20 summit as a success on Saturday afternoon, but the two days that the leaders of the world\u2019s 20 richest economies spent in the rainy-season humidity of Osaka also magnified deep and potentially unbridgeable divides on everything from climate change to the future of western liberalism. The G20 nations, Abe said, \u201chave a responsibility to squarely face global problems and to come up with solutions through frank dialogue\u201d. Their communique, which had looked in doubt 24 hours earlier as the EU and the US sparred over how to describe the climate crisis, went some way towards meeting his demands. Their compromise enabled 19 of the 20 leaders to reaffirm their commitment to the Paris agreement, but left enough room for Washington to attempt to justify its increasing isolation from the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a reference to the harm it would inflict on \u201cAmerican workers and taxpayers\u201d. The \u201cfrank dialogue\u201d Abe craved proved more problematic, however. The opening day of the summit was overshadowed by the China-US trade war, the presence of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, and for British audiences at least, Theresa May\u2019s confrontation with Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury novichok poisonings. Putin had already angered Donald Tusk, among others, by declaring in a Financial Times interview published at the start of the summit that liberalism was obsolete. It was a theme he returned to on Saturday evening, when he claimed that immigration had infringed on other people\u2019s rights, and attributed Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory to disenchantment with mainstream liberal ideals. \u201cThe liberal idea has started eating itself,\u201d Putin told reporters in Osaka. \u201cMillions of people live their lives, and those who propagate those ideas are separate from them. People live in their own country, according to their own traditions, why should it happen to them?\u201d But as the G20 leaders headed home, there was also cause for cautious optimism. Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, stepped back from the trade war precipice \u2013 at least for now \u2013 during their highly anticipated meeting, while all but one of the G20 leaders decided not to cross French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d on the climate crisis and included a reference to their \u201cirreversible\u201d obligations under the Paris agreement. There was also a commitment to stop adding to plastic waste pollution of the world\u2019s oceans by 2050. Inevitably, it was left to Donald Trump to take some of the sheen off Japan\u2019s first G20 summit with a Saturday morning tweet that set off speculation he was about to meet North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, along the heavily armed peninsula that has divided the Korean peninsula for 55 years. Trump proposed that he and Kim leader meet at the demilitarised zone [DMZ] to shake hands and \u201csay hello\u201d during his visit to South Korea on Sunday. North Korea described the offer as very interesting, but said it had yet to receive an official invitation. \u201cI am of the view that if the [North Korea-US] meetings take place on the division line, as is intended by President Trump, it would serve as another meaningful occasion in further deepening the personal relations between the two leaders and advancing the bilateral relations,\u201d North Korea\u2019s KCNA news agency quoted the country\u2019s first vice foreign minister, Choe Son-hui, as saying.

He said the US would not impose further tariffs in an ongoing trade war that other world leaders had said could threaten the global economy, and added that the world\u2019s two biggest economies would restart negotiations on a trade deal. The US president told a press conference that he and his Chinese counterpart had had a \u201cgreat meeting\u201d. \u201cWe will continue to negotiate, and I promise that at least for the time being we won\u2019t be adding additional [tariffs] \u2026 We\u2019re going to work with China to see if we can make a deal.

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Yee\" title=\"\">Chiang Yee</a> arrived in Britain in 1933, he was determined to study for a master\u2019s degree at the London School of Economics and then return to China, where he had left his wife and four children under the care of his brother. He was 30 years old and knew just a handful of English words.</p> <p>Yet Yee went on to become a popular artist, bestselling author, poet, designer, academic and hugely influential cultural ambassador of China to the west.</p> <p>Now, 40 years after his death, his contribution to British and Chinese life has been honoured with a blue plaque unveiled yesterday in Oxford. Organised by author Paul French, a specialist in modern Chinese history, and Anne Witchard from the University of Westminster, Yee\u2019s plaque comes in response to a campaign launched by English Heritage in 2016, calling for a more representative celebration of history.</p> <p>According to the charity, which oversees the blue plaque scheme in London, only 14% of the 900 plaques in the capital celebrate women and just 4% are dedicated to black and Asian figures.</p> <p>Yee is the third Chinese figure to be granted the honour; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_She\" title=\"\">writer Lao She\u2019s</a> blue plaque stands in Notting Hill, while <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen\" title=\"\">Sun Yat-sen</a>, the first president of the Republic of China in 1912, is remembered in the Hertfordshire village of Cottered.</p> <p>\u201cThe scarcity of blue plaques for ethnic minority people really piqued my interest,\u201d says French. \u201cI thought Chiang Yee was an excellent candidate; he made an important and creative impact on British society and his work should be remembered. But the blue plaque system is quite odd. There is no central database. Outside London it is run by local councils and volunteers at random.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the problems for black and Asian migrants is that the technical rules require the person to have been resident in the same place for 15 years for it to qualify as a place that can be commemorated. That\u2019s difficult for people from transient communities \u2013 if you come here with no money, you move a lot more. We were lucky with Yee because he lived on Southmoor Road in Oxford as a lodger after being bombed out of Hampstead on the first night of the Blitz.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3bc3a7b02bdc2438058c402d62576a75c13122ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bc3a7b02bdc2438058c402d62576a75c13122ab/0_0_225_261/225.jpg\" alt=\"Chiang Yee made his name with The Silent Traveller books and his artwork.\" width=\"225\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chiang Yee made his name with the Silent Traveller books and his artwork.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: no info</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yee wrote that he \u201carrived in London on a June day in 1933 and it was raining. I felt chilly and thought it must soon be autumn\u201d. His neighbours in Hampstead were artists and intellectuals, including Piet Mondrian, Ern\u0151 Goldfinger, Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore. According to Paul Bevan, a fellow in Chinese painting at Oxford\u2019s Ashmolean Museum, this community created \u201ca unique artistic ambience in London\u201d in which Yee was able to flourish.</p> <p>He wrote and illustrated a number of books, most notably the Silent Traveller series that made his name in the 1930s and 40s and sold across Europe and the US. In them, he describes his experience of the Lake District, Oxford and London and many of the great cities in the west with wry affection.</p> <p>Tessa Thorniley, a PhD student researching Chinese authors at the University of Westminster, suggests that travel writer Bill Bryson\u2019s work has echoes of what Yee achieved first in Britain and later in the US, where he settled in 1955.</p> <p>\u201cBoth were super popular, good at interpreting different cultures, used humour in their work and used a travel format \u2026 [Yee\u2019s] style was always amused rather than cynical or satirical, which drew readers in,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But he also collaborated on a Chinese cookbook, wrote a seminal text on Chinese calligraphy and designed sets and costumes for the Royal Ballet. He worked at the Wellcome Collection and taught Chinese at the School of Oriental and African Studies. His paintings \u2013 British landscapes rendered in the traditional Chinese <em>gu\u00f3hu\u00e0</em> style \u2013 were shown in galleries in Mayfair.</p> <p>Perhaps, most importantly, he charmed Britons into understanding China better and without hostility.

      "bodyText": "When Chiang Yee arrived in Britain in 1933, he was determined to study for a master\u2019s degree at the London School of Economics and then return to China, where he had left his wife and four children under the care of his brother. He was 30 years old and knew just a handful of English words. Yet Yee went on to become a popular artist, bestselling author, poet, designer, academic and hugely influential cultural ambassador of China to the west. Now, 40 years after his death, his contribution to British and Chinese life has been honoured with a blue plaque unveiled yesterday in Oxford. Organised by author Paul French, a specialist in modern Chinese history, and Anne Witchard from the University of Westminster, Yee\u2019s plaque comes in response to a campaign launched by English Heritage in 2016, calling for a more representative celebration of history. According to the charity, which oversees the blue plaque scheme in London, only 14% of the 900 plaques in the capital celebrate women and just 4% are dedicated to black and Asian figures. Yee is the third Chinese figure to be granted the honour; writer Lao She\u2019s blue plaque stands in Notting Hill, while Sun Yat-sen, the first president of the Republic of China in 1912, is remembered in the Hertfordshire village of Cottered. \u201cThe scarcity of blue plaques for ethnic minority people really piqued my interest,\u201d says French. \u201cI thought Chiang Yee was an excellent candidate; he made an important and creative impact on British society and his work should be remembered. But the blue plaque system is quite odd. There is no central database. Outside London it is run by local councils and volunteers at random. \u201cOne of the problems for black and Asian migrants is that the technical rules require the person to have been resident in the same place for 15 years for it to qualify as a place that can be commemorated. That\u2019s difficult for people from transient communities \u2013 if you come here with no money, you move a lot more. We were lucky with Yee because he lived on Southmoor Road in Oxford as a lodger after being bombed out of Hampstead on the first night of the Blitz.\u201d Yee wrote that he \u201carrived in London on a June day in 1933 and it was raining. I felt chilly and thought it must soon be autumn\u201d. His neighbours in Hampstead were artists and intellectuals, including Piet Mondrian, Ern\u0151 Goldfinger, Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore. According to Paul Bevan, a fellow in Chinese painting at Oxford\u2019s Ashmolean Museum, this community created \u201ca unique artistic ambience in London\u201d in which Yee was able to flourish. He wrote and illustrated a number of books, most notably the Silent Traveller series that made his name in the 1930s and 40s and sold across Europe and the US. In them, he describes his experience of the Lake District, Oxford and London and many of the great cities in the west with wry affection. Tessa Thorniley, a PhD student researching Chinese authors at the University of Westminster, suggests that travel writer Bill Bryson\u2019s work has echoes of what Yee achieved first in Britain and later in the US, where he settled in 1955. \u201cBoth were super popular, good at interpreting different cultures, used humour in their work and used a travel format \u2026 [Yee\u2019s] style was always amused rather than cynical or satirical, which drew readers in,\u201d she said. But he also collaborated on a Chinese cookbook, wrote a seminal text on Chinese calligraphy and designed sets and costumes for the Royal Ballet. He worked at the Wellcome Collection and taught Chinese at the School of Oriental and African Studies. His paintings \u2013 British landscapes rendered in the traditional Chinese gu\u00f3hu\u00e0 style \u2013 were shown in galleries in Mayfair. Perhaps, most importantly, he charmed Britons into understanding China better and without hostility. Even the popularity of the cartoon panda, say his supporters, was a notion introduced to the mainstream by Yee. \u201cWe think of them as lovely cuddly animals now and a symbol of friendly China, but it was Yee who wrote and illustrated pandas as characters in the books he wrote for children,\u201d says French. \u201cPandas are actually quite spiteful and mean but without Yee they wouldn\u2019t be the logo for the World Wide Fund for Nature.\u201d His biographer, Professor Da Zheng, wrote that Yee\u2019s \u201ctranscultural and transnational experiences were so extensive that reading the story of his life is like watching all of China change, transform, develop and interact with the west\u201d. Zheng, along with Rita Keene Lester, whose parents let out two rooms to Yee from 1940 to 1955, unveiled the plaque to the public at 28 Southmoor Road, Oxford. He said the honour was a fitting tribute to a figure long due reappraisal. \u201cHe has a unique style: humorous, innovative, and insightful \u2026 he is able to discover something extraordinary out of common phenomena,\u201d Zheng said. Extracts from The Silent Traveller in London Fur coats and fires persist month after month, and so do the identical vegetables and fruits, and this benefit of science, I find, makes life monotonous. I was often told that John Bull seldom went out without an umbrella, or its substitute, a stick, if it was fine. I do not see many Londoners carrying sticks in the street, but an umbrella they seem to have all the time. It is strange that, though London suffers an excess of rain most of the time, Londoners talk very anxiously of the need of it if there is a short drought. My friend was surprised and a little shocked to see so many pieces of land enclosed and marked \u201cprivate\u201d, protesting that in China we should never find the public forbidden a free enjoyment of scenery.",

      "bodyText": "Next up \u2026 Kieran Pender was in Valenciennes to watch the Dutch earn a quarter-final place courtesy of two headed second-half goals. Here\u2019s how he saw the match unfold ... The Dutch advance: Following a fairly evenly matched first half in which Italy squandered several good chances, the Netherlands completely outclassed their opponents in a second half in which Italy grew increasingly frustrated and gave away one free-kick after another. It was from two of these set-pieces that the winning goals came from, with Vivianne Miedema and Stefanie van der Gragt getting on the end of Sherida Spitse crosses to nod their country through to the last four. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeeep! It\u2019s all over and the Netherlands have qualified for a semi-final in Lyon, where they will play either Germany or Sweden. 90+5 min: Italy goalkeeper Giuliani finally gets an opportunity to launch the ball up the pitch, but despite the best attempts of Italy\u2019s outfield players, they can\u2019t make anything happen. 90+4 min: The Netherlands win a free-kick deep in Italy territory, down near the flag. To nobody\u2019s great surprise, they choose not to send in a cross, preferring to roll the ball even nearer the corner flag and try to keep it there. 90+2 min: Italy win a throw-in deep inside their own half, an area of the field in which their opponents are quite happy to keep them as the clock ticks down. 90 min: We\u2019ll have five additional minutes for Italy to try to save themselves. It\u2019s a tall order for a side who simply haven\u2019t been able to cope with the conspicuously increased tempo of their opponents since half-time. 87 min: Double-Dutch substitution: both goalscorers come off - Vivianne Miedema and Stefanie van der Gragt make way for Anouk Dekker and Jill Roord. 86 min: The TV camera cuts to the Italy bench, where one of the substitutes is sobbing uncontrollably. 84 min: Nothing comes from the Italy corner, lthough Van Veenendaal was less than convincing as the ball came her way after her defenders had cleared the initial danger. Moments later at the far end of the pitch, Netherlands striker Lieke Martens shoots over from a good position. 83 min: Italy corner after a decent save from the Dutch skipper, Van Veenendaal, who got down well to save at the feet of Giacinti. 82 min: Miedema blasts high over the bar after being put through and handed an opportunity to hammer another nail into Italy\u2019s World Cup coffin. The Netherlands double their lead. Another free-kick in a dangerous area, another goal for the Dutch. Spitse was the provider drom the right wing and Stefanie van der Gragt rose highest to send an unstoppable bullet header past Giuliani. 78 min: Play resumes with a Dutch corner. Spitse sends the ball into the mixer, but Italy half-clear. A throw-in for the Netherlands, deep in Italy territory. 75 min: Italy substitution: Annamari Serturini replaces Valentina Bergamaschi. It\u2019s time for another drinks break and in the case of the Italians \u2013 a much needed pep talk from their coach. 74 min: Valentina Cornoia becomes the third Italian to be booked as she fouls Beerensteyn to concede a free-kick in a dangerous position on the inside right channel. Sherida Spitse is unable to make it two assists in quick succession and overcooks her delivery on this occasion. 72 min: It had been coming for a while and seemed increasingly likely as an Italy team that is beginning to look very disjointed kept conceding free-kicks in dangerous areas. On that occasion, Spitse curled the ball across through the corridor of uncertainty and Miedema leapt highest to score with a very deft glancing header. Well colour me psychic, the Netherlands have the lead! From the free-kick, taken by, Sherida Spitse, Vivianne Miedema steers a lovely glancing header inside the far post to score her 61st goal for her country. 68 min: With just over 20 minutes of normal time remaining, it seems like only a matter of time before the Dutch score. They\u2019ve completely outplayed their Italian opponents since the start of the second half and now have a free-kick wide on the left. 65 min: Free-kick for the Netherlands on the right, between the edge of the Italy penalty area for a Guagni foul on Beerensteyn. The Italian full-back is booked, possibly for dissent. From a good position, Merel van Dongen curls the ball wide of the far post. 62 min: Manuela Giugliano gets a ticking-off for dissent after conceding a free-kick about 35 metres from her own goal. Sherida Spitse tries to have go and leathers the ball goalwards. It swerves wide of the left upright through a thicket of legs. 61 min: Beerensteyn, the substitute, shoots high over the bar as the ball bounces kindly for her on the right-hand side of the Italy penalty area. 60 min: Desiree van Luneteren wins a free-kick for the Dutch after being tripped by Valentina Bergamashi on the touchline, just by the halfway line. 58 min: From a corner, the Dutch go close again. A corner is only half-cleared, but drops kindly for Danielle van de Donk on the edge of the Italy penalty area. She tees the ball up for a shot, then attempts to curl a shot into the top right-hand corner. With the Italian goalkeeper beaten, the ball rattles the cross-bar. The Netherlands are bossing this game completely at this stage. 55 min: Lieke Martens dribbles at the Italian defence and unleashes a shot, bringing a smart save out of Laura Giulani. Italy substitution: Daniella Sabatino on for Barbara Bonansea. Netherlands substitution: Lineth Beerensteyn on for Shanice van de Sanden. 52 min: The Dutch are completely dominating this second half and miss another two good chances in quick succession. Jackie Groenen has a shot from inside the penalty area blocked by Gama, when she should have passed to the unmarked Miedema. Moments later, with the goal gaping, Miedema stretches but fails to get on the end of a low ball from Van Lunteren played square across the edge of the six-yard box. 51 min: Lieke Martins chests down a cross from the right and volleys the ball towards the bottom left-hand corner. She doesn\u2019t get quite enough welly on the ball and Laura Giulani gets down to make the save. 49 min: Unmarked in the Italy penalty area, Vivianne Miedema leaps to try to convert a Van de Sanden cross from the right. The ball\u2019s a little too high and she can\u2019t keep her header down. 49 min: Sherida Spitse tries a shot from distance and it\u2019s a decent effort. Linari blocks with her head. 47 min: Shanice van de Sanden squares the ball from the right flank, but Sara Gama is on hand to intercept and clear for Italy. She and Elena Linari have not put a foot wrong in the heart of the Italy defence so far in this match. 46 min: Giacinti attempts to geta cross into the Netherlands penalty area from the inside right channel, but her delivery is blocked by Bloodworth. 46 min: Italy get the ball rolling for the second half, with no changes in personnel on either side. Kieran Pender is in Valenciennes for the Guardian: \u201cThe Italians, as they have in every World Cup match so far, are playing patiently and exhibiting impressive defensive solidity,\u201d he says, donning his big hat o\u2019punditry. \u201cItaly has conceded just twice in France, both from the penalty spot, and this defence is posing a real test for the Netherlands\u2019 start-studded attack. It is really really hot in Valenciennes, and the decisive question may well be whether Italy\u2019s back-line can withstand the heat-induced fatigue later in the match.\u201d The deadlock remains unbroken as the players head in for their half-time refreshments. Perhaps understandably, because of the heat in Valenciennes, the game hasn\u2019t been much of a spectacle, but it\u2019s Italy who have had the three best scoring opportunities, with Valentina Bergamaschi missing the pick of them. 45+4 min: Galli tries to play Giacinti into the Dutch penalty area with a cleverly weighted pass, but the dtriker is not quick enough to get to it before Netherlands goalkeeper Van Veenendaal. 45+2 min: Good defending from Italy, who keep their shape well to prevent Barbara Bonansea getting on to a neat penalty area dink from Vivianne Miedema and slipping the ball past Laura Giulani from a few yards out. 45 min: We\u2019ll have five minutes of added time to make up for the drinks break. The Netherlands attack down the right flank, but their efforts are in vain as Shanice van de Sanden over-cooks yet another cross. Her end product today has been very poor. 44 min: There\u2019s a break in play as Danielle van de Donk gets treatment for some injury or other. She\u2019s passed fit to continue and the game follows suit. 42 min: With the free-kick, Sherida Spitse shoots low and hard, aiming for the bottom right-hand corner. Her effort is decidedly lacking in anything resembling venom and Laura Giulani saves comfortably. 40 min: Free-kick for the Netherlands on the edge of the Italy penalty area as Miedema ships a push in the back from Elena Linari as she tries to latch on to a long ball from deep. The blonde Italian gets a yellow card for her troubles. Possession stats: Italy 39%-61% Netherlands. The Netherlands may be dominating in that department, but it\u2019s Italy who have had three excellent scoring chances. 37 min: Another chance goes a begging for Italy, as Valentina Giacinti gets in behind the Dutch defence to pick up a pass from Bergamaschi and send a low diagonal shot across the face of goal but a couple of feet wide of the far upright. She\u2019d wrong-footed the goalkeeper and would definitely have scored if her effort had been on target. 34 min: Vivianne Miedema chases a looping pass up the centre, but Alia Guagni is on hand to prevent the Dutch forward getting to it. 34 min: Play resumes, with the players and match officials all sufficiently rehydrated. 30 min: Trebles all round! In sweltering conditions, the players of both teams adjourn to the touchline for their official Fifa-sanctioned drinks break. 29 min: For the Netherlands, Vivianne Miedema beats Sara Gama with a soft-shoe shuffle on the edge of the penalty area and attempts to chip the ball over Laura Giulani. Her attempt at a finish is poor and the goalkeeper saves easily. 27 min: Italy central defender Elena Linari is on hand to clear up for her side after a menacing Dutch attack prompted by good play down the right touchline from Shanice van de Sanden. Italy get forward on the counter, but Sari van Veenendaal is quick off her line to avert the danger with Valentina Giacinti threatening to latch on to a long ball. 25 min: Another attack from Italy ends with Aurora Gali trying her luck with a long range that sails hideously high and wide. 24 min: Just over a quarter of the game gone and after dominating the early stages, the Netherlands can consider themselves lucky to be on level terms. Italy have had two decent chances, but both fell to Bergamaschi, who appears to have put her boots on the wrong feet. 22 min: Italy win a corner after a free-kick driven into the penalty area from out wide is blocked by a Dutch defender and goes out of play. Nothing comes of it. 20 min: Another poor - nay, absolutely awful \u2013 finish from Bergamasci who completely scuffs a shot straight in front of goal from seven yards out after drifting in from the right with the ball at her feet. She had the goal at her mercy there, but her shot only travelled a foot or two. 18 min: Close from Italy, who perhaps should have scored. Stealing into a good position in the Netherlands penalty area, Valentina Bergamasci is on hand to chest down the ball as it arcs into the penalty from the left and is helped on its way by a Valentina Giacinit header. Bergascami\u2019s close control is not quite up to scratch and she has to stretch to try to flick the ball past Sari van Veenendaal from about nine yards out. The goalkeeper gathers comfortably. 15 min: Valentina Cernoia wins a free-kick for Italy halfway inside her own half. Gama plays it short to Elena Linari, who lumps it towards the Dutch right-back position. Desiree van Lunteren is on hand to clear. 13 min: Almost 15 minutes gone and no chances of note from either side so far. The Netherlands are dominating, but Italy seem content to let them ping crosses into their penalty area, confident in their own ability to deal with an aerial threat. 10 min: Desiree van Lunteren curls a cross from the right flank into the the Italy penalty area, but there\u2019s nobody on hand in an orange shirt to convert. 9 min: Italy skipper Sara Gama plays the ball long from halfway inside her own half and it\u2019s cleared for a throw-in by the Dutch. 7 min: The Netherlands attack through the centre with Sherida Spitse on the ball. She tries to do too much on her own and is dispossessed by Manuela Giugliano. 6 min: Desiree van Lunteren stretches to keep the ball from going out for an Italy goal-kick as she chases a through-ball up the inside right channel. She does well to keep it in play, but can only hook it along the byline into the arms of Italy goalkeeper Laura Giuliani. 4 min: For the Netherlands, Dominique Bloodworth plays the ball up the left touchline to Lieke Martins, who controls it beautifully on her chest in a tight space. The ball goes out for a throw-in off an Italian boot. 3 min: The Netherlands are dominating these very early stages as the teams size each other up. Shanice van de Sanden pulls a ball into the penalty area from the byline, but Elisa Bartoli is on hand to clear for Italy. 2 min: On the left of the Dutcvh front three, Lieke Martens jinks her way inside from the touchline but overhits her cross towards the far post. 1 min: Italy win an early throw-in, which is hurled down the pitch from inside her own half by right-back Alia Guagni. 1 min: The Netherlands kick off in front of a crowd of approximately 20,000 people, their players kitted out in orange shirts, shorts and socks. Italy\u2019s representatives wear blue shirts, shorts and socks. Game on! Not long now: The teams march out into the furnace led by referee Claudia Umpierrez and skippers Sara Gama and Sari van Veenendaal. We\u2019re just a couple of national anthems, several handshakes and a coin-toss from kick-off. Kieran Pender is at this match for the Guardian: \u201cFor all intents and purposes, Valenciennes has temporarily become a Dutch exclave,\u201d he says. \u201cThe orange-clad fans are here in force. It took me half an hour to walk the usual 15 minutes to the Stade du Hainaut - the roads are absolutely jammed with travelling support for the Netherlands. It should make for a special atmosphere, although the Italians might regret that they aren\u2019t playing this match further south, where it mightn\u2019t feel quite so much like a Dutch home game.\u201d Italy: Giuliani, Guagni, Gama, Linari, Bartoli, Bergamaschi, Galli, Giugliano, Cernoia, Giacinti, Bonansea. Subs: Marchitelli, Rosucci, Parisi, Sabatino, Girelli, Tarenzi, Serturini, Fusetti, Boattin, Mauro, Tucceri, Pipitone. Netherlands: Van Veenendaal, Van Lunteren, van der Gragt, Bloodworth, van Dongen, Groenen, van de Donk, Spitse, van de Sanden, Miedema, Martens.

Today\u2019s match officials Referee: Claudia Umpierrez (Uruguay) Assistant Referee 1: Luciana Mascarana (Uruguay) Assistant Referee 2: Monica Amboya (Ecuador) Fourth Official: Qin Liang (China) A 36-year-old from Uruguay, Claudia Umpierrez is clearly a real stickler for rules and regulations as she divides her professional life between refereeing and working as a lawyer. She has been on the Fifa list since 2010 and has been a first category ref in Uruguay since 2016, the same year she became the first woman in Uruguayan football history to referee a top flight men\u2019s match. Milena Bertolini speaks ... Italy\u2019s manager stressed the importance of keeping possession when she fronted up before the press yesterday. \u201cIf we both have good possession of the ball, we\u2019re going to have a great game out there,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course the Dutch play a characteristic style that reflects their footballing history. We\u2019re also working along those lines: good ball possession, the importance of dribbling \u2013 that\u2019s what the game is all about. Of course that all depends on the opponent, and how well we can deploy our flexibility.\u201d Sarina Wiegman speaks ... Attending to her pre-match press duties yesterday, the Netherlands gaffer was full of praise for her team\u2019s Italian opponents. \u201cI\u2019m surprised with how good the Italian team has been playing, both in qualification and during this World Cup,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have great players who like to play forward, and want to give that deciding pass. We\u2019ve been very impressed by them, but we also know what consequences their playing style has and where spaces open up on the pitch.\u201d Form guide Coming into this game on the back of seven straight wins, Italy are the favourites to prevail against an Italian side who have equalled their best ever record at a Women\u2019s World Cup with a place in the quarter-finals. The Italians enjoyed a seven-match winning streak of their own in the build-up to this tournament and won two of their three group games against Australia and Jamaica, before losing to Brazil. In Bertolini, they have a shrewd tactician as a manager and her astute mid-game switches against Australia and China have been praised for helping her team to victories that weren\u2019t entirely expected. Weather report With Europe engulfed in a heatwave it\u2019s going to be a hot one in Valenciennes this afternoon and according to the forecast players will be forced to endure temperatures of between 31 and 34 degrees celsius. The hot temperatures mean Fifa can allow drinks breaks for players, with three-minute pauses for water at the 30- and 75-minute marks, if temperatures reach 32C inside the stadium. The Netherlands did, in fact, ask if today\u2019s kick-off time could be changed to later in the day, after the Germany v Sweden quarter-final, which kicks off at 5.30pm (BST), but Fifa ignored their request. \u201cWe did ask the question, but it was impossible,\u201d said their coach Sarina Wiegman yesterday. \u201cSo there you are. But okay, I don\u2019t know why it is impossible [to move the kickoff time]. But I think it is remarkable and we\u2019ll just play football at 3 pm tomorrow. \u201cWe will make sure [the players] drink enough, they bring cool drinks and we have prepared for this.\u201d The Italian coach Milena Bertolini was also expressed her disappointment at the scheduling for today\u2019s game. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it will be tomorrow, but [we could have] a different intensity, a different rhythm, a better regularity in the rhythm of play,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what is most disappointing, because so far all the games from the round of 16 on have been really fantastic and of high quality.\u201d The Stade du Hainaut in Valenciennes, northern France is the venue for the third of the four quarter-finals in this summer\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup. Neither Italy nor the Netherlands have made it to the last four before, but one of the two nations will qualify for a semi-final against Germany or Sweden, who play later today. Kick-off is at 2pm (BST), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

The pattern-loving couple grew up in Yorkshire and all their designs spring from the \u201cwarmth\u201d of shared memories. \u201cWe never met as teenagers, but we did all the same things. We watched 1960s films on Channel 4.

Here, walls were removed to open up the boxy landing. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take much to make the place feel much sleeker,\u201d says Keith.

Initially, they painted everything white, but gradually the house has become a testing ground for their midcentury\u2013feel designs. \u201cIf we can live with them, then at least we know other people can, too,\u201d says Mark. The pattern-loving couple grew up in Yorkshire and all their designs spring from the \u201cwarmth\u201d of shared memories. \u201cWe never met as teenagers, but we did all the same things. We watched 1960s films on Channel 4. At weekends we went to junk shops and spent our pocket money on 1950s wire fruit bowls or painterly curtains which we\u2019d turn into shirts for Saturday nights out,\u201d reminisces Keith. The blue and white waves of their \u201cWhitby\u201d wallpaper evokes summer holidays on the Yorkshire coast (\u201cSpain hadn\u2019t been discovered then\u201d), while \u201cArt Room\u201d, adorned with oil lamps and African masks, pays homage to sixth-form still-life classes. In the hallway, graphic \u201cPluto\u201d (inspired by dazzle camouflage) clambers over the walls and ceiling, adding to the feel that you have tumbled into an Op Art painting. When they launched in the mid-1990s, some of the duo\u2019s earliest clients included the Southbank Centre, Radio 6 and John Lewis. Now their vibrant Paisley design, inspired by Hanif Kureishi\u2019s Buddha of Suburbia, hangs in the permanent collection at the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester. Wallpaper also brings colour to the staircase, which rises to the top floor. Like that yearned-for 1960s house, this is the main living area: kitchen, dining area and sitting room flow towards the long terrace. Here, walls were removed to open up the boxy landing. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take much to make the place feel much sleeker,\u201d says Keith. New doors, in a mix of plywood and paint, transformed the developer kitchen into their design ideal: \u201cFrank Guille\u2019s 1958 kitchen for the British manufacturer Kandya to be precise.\u201d The G-Plan sideboard belonged to Keith\u2019s mum (\u201cI was too late to save the rest, which went on the bonfire,\u201d he laments), the clunky 1970s Trimphone still rings \u201cvery loudly\u201d and the compact Danish dining table, bought at the annual Midcentury Modern Show in Dulwich, southeast London, flips open to seat eight: \u201cAnother example of good design.\u201d That teenage compulsion to rummage through market stalls for overlooked gems has never left them. Pocket-money finds \u2013 Susie Cooper cups, orange-spined Penguin books \u2013 have been joined by more sophisticated purchases, such as 1970s West German studio and sculptural crockery, designed by Susan Williams-Ellis for Portmeirion in the 1960s. \u201cWe only collect olive green.\u201d Their favourite pieces are displayed on the flat-pack \u201cString\u201d shelving which has travelled with them from previous, rented homes. \u201cThe system was designed in 1949 by husband-and-wife team Nils and Kajsa Strinning for a publisher who was looking for an affordable, easy-to-install way to display books,\u201d says Keith. \u201cIt\u2019s never been out of production since \u2013 which is just the kind of anecdote we like.\u201d Mid-Century Modern Living, by Keith Stephenson and Mark Hampshire, is published by Kyle Books (\u00a320).

Sharm el-Sheikh, however, once the most popular Red Sea resort, remains off limits to UK aircraft.</p> <p>Eurostar now believes that the memories of the Paris and London attacks are no longer deterring travel. Its chief executive, Mike Cooper, says: \u201cTerrorism in 2015-16 saw a significant dampening in demand, but it\u2019s come back.\u201d Industrial action by French border staff has had a worse effect on customer numbers, he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"139e2fe5b542d2ab082194489a57518418d58555\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/139e2fe5b542d2ab082194489a57518418d58555/0_183_3936_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tui\u2019s Boeing 737 Max aircraft remain grounded.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tui\u2019s Boeing 737 Max aircraft remain grounded.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Terrorism in north Africa and political turmoil in Turkey saw a number of carriers reallocate fleets to the western Mediterranean last year, further fuelling the holiday rush, but pushing up accommodation prices. Travellers are now looking at Turkey again, and Bulgaria \u2013 a growing destination outside the eurozone and significantly cheaper.</p> <h2>Green concerns</h2> <p>According to Abta research, a growing minority of holidaymakers claim that they would choose one travel company over another for its environmental credentials: 36% in 2018, from 23% in 2014. A series of announcements from companies \u2013 even ones as unlikely as Ryanair \u2013 have committed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jul/04/plastic-straw-pollution-travel-environmental-responsibilities\" title=\"\">phasing out single-use plastics</a>. Sustainable travel has become a mainstream concern, and the number of smaller companies pledging ethical tourism has grown.</p> <p>How deep the industry\u2019s commitment can be is moot, given that leisure travel accounts for 80% of all UK flights. But Tanzer of Abta argues: \u201cWe\u2019ve been aware of the environmental impacts for a while. But we think that travel is a good thing \u2013 not just for profits. Customers are more aware and questioning, which is right and good, and we have to help them travel sustainably.\u201d</p> <p>That could mean train travel, for those with the time. When Eurostar ran its first direct service to Amsterdam last year, says Cooper, it carried \u201c754 people who travelled point-to-point on a train using increasingly green electricity. It would have taken four to five planeloads.\u201d</p> <p>Yet travellers are easily put off. Ticket <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/04/eurostar-expands-london-amsterdam-service-to-three-trains-a-day\" title=\"\">sales are strong</a> \u2013 but far lower in the other direction, the return from Amsterdam to London, which include a forced stop in Brussels for border and immigration reasons. Long-distance rail prices can often exceed plane fares to Europe, and while plane refuseniks appear to be a growing minority, overall air passenger numbers keep growing. More fuel-efficient aircraft have also created long-haul mass market holidays to cheaper destinations. Fewer than 20,000 UK holidaymakers went to Mexico 25 years ago; last year, 677,000 went there.</p>",

Sharm el-Sheikh, however, once the most popular Red Sea resort, remains off limits to UK aircraft. Eurostar now believes that the memories of the Paris and London attacks are no longer deterring travel. Its chief executive, Mike Cooper, says: \u201cTerrorism in 2015-16 saw a significant dampening in demand, but it\u2019s come back.\u201d Industrial action by French border staff has had a worse effect on customer numbers, he says. Terrorism in north Africa and political turmoil in Turkey saw a number of carriers reallocate fleets to the western Mediterranean last year, further fuelling the holiday rush, but pushing up accommodation prices. Travellers are now looking at Turkey again, and Bulgaria \u2013 a growing destination outside the eurozone and significantly cheaper. Green concerns According to Abta research, a growing minority of holidaymakers claim that they would choose one travel company over another for its environmental credentials: 36% in 2018, from 23% in 2014. A series of announcements from companies \u2013 even ones as unlikely as Ryanair \u2013 have committed to phasing out single-use plastics. Sustainable travel has become a mainstream concern, and the number of smaller companies pledging ethical tourism has grown. How deep the industry\u2019s commitment can be is moot, given that leisure travel accounts for 80% of all UK flights. But Tanzer of Abta argues: \u201cWe\u2019ve been aware of the environmental impacts for a while. But we think that travel is a good thing \u2013 not just for profits. Customers are more aware and questioning, which is right and good, and we have to help them travel sustainably.\u201d That could mean train travel, for those with the time. When Eurostar ran its first direct service to Amsterdam last year, says Cooper, it carried \u201c754 people who travelled point-to-point on a train using increasingly green electricity. It would have taken four to five planeloads.\u201d Yet travellers are easily put off. Ticket sales are strong \u2013 but far lower in the other direction, the return from Amsterdam to London, which include a forced stop in Brussels for border and immigration reasons. Long-distance rail prices can often exceed plane fares to Europe, and while plane refuseniks appear to be a growing minority, overall air passenger numbers keep growing. More fuel-efficient aircraft have also created long-haul mass market holidays to cheaper destinations. Fewer than 20,000 UK holidaymakers went to Mexico 25 years ago; last year, 677,000 went there.",

      "body": "<p>England\u2019s most important white-ball cricket match for four years has come a little earlier than expected. The anticipation was that it would take place at Old Trafford or Edgbaston next week in one of the semi-finals. But three losses, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/21/england-sri-lanka-cricket-world-cup-report\" title=\"\">especially the wanton one to Sri Lanka</a>, during the qualification process have meant the crunch game has arrived a week ahead of schedule.</p> \n<p>To be certain of a semi-final slot England have to beat India at Edgbaston on Sunday and New Zealand at Chester-le-Street on Wednesday. They can lift the World Cup if they win four games in a row. That is the only way to look at it now.</p> \n<p>At Edgbaston they encounter the side that have been the best in the tournament by a considerable margin. India are unbeaten and perversely the only game in which they have been seriously threatened was against Afghanistan. Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul and the incredibly patient MS Dhoni have scored enough runs to allow a varied and disciplined bowling attack to prevail.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/29/virat-kohli-england-tournament-pressure-cricket-world-cup-india\">Virat Kohli says England are struggling to handle tournament pressure</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In some ways India have played an old-fashioned game. They are prepared to be patient at the start of their innings. Keeping wickets in hand is a high priority.</p> \n<p>They are not tempted to be greedy because they are so confident that their batsmen can cause sufficient mayhem in the final overs and that their bowlers possess the skill and resolution to defend relatively modest totals.</p> \n<p>The bowling attack at Kohli\u2019s disposal is an exciting one with two pacemen and two wrist-spinners backed up by a more journeyman seamer, Hardik Pandya. Opponents naturally try to attack him but he has remained undaunted and resourceful when under fire.</p> \n<p>At the start of an innings Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami, who has replaced Bhuvneshwar Kumar, are brisk and businesslike, offering no free runs. At the end they have been superb. Shami adheres to old-fashioned principles: he bowls fast and straight. Meanwhile, Bumrah is rivalled only by Mitchell Starc in his ability to propel yorkers. Against Afghanistan, when bowling the penultimate over with the match in the balance, Bumrah decided the outcome quite brilliantly with six perfect yorkers.</p> \n<p>Why doesn\u2019t every bowler do that? Because it is very difficult. Batsmen have innovated in the T20 era so that the margin of error for those attempting yorkers has been massively reduced. So some bowlers conclude that the risk is too great. Get it wrong and the ball disappears into the stands. But the perfect yorker remains the best delivery at the end of the innings and Bumrah, more than any other bowler in the tournament, is confident that he can hit that spot, not much bigger than a saucepan lid, on the popping crease. He is a huge asset for Kohli.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9edd9762fde1228d10a5e5601ec38759244b32c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9edd9762fde1228d10a5e5601ec38759244b32c/122_187_4428_2658/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jasprit Bumrah\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jasprit Bumrah\u2019s bowling was key for India against Afghanistan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aijaz Rahi/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So, too, are the wonderfully beguiling pair of wrist-spinners. My guess is that Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal do not score very well on the bleep test; they do not score many runs either and they are relatively pedestrian in a very good fielding side. But to have two contrasting wrist-spinners in the same side is bold and effective.</p> \n<p>Both are enjoying larger boundaries than the postage stamps used in the Indian Premier League. Kuldeep in particular has the bravado to toss the ball high in the air when he thinks it appropriate. A lot of batsmen are none too sure which way the ball is going to bounce on landing. Chahal has taken more wickets, partly because he tends to bowl later in the innings; neither has been collared yet.</p> \n<p>So England\u2019s challenge at Edgbaston is considerable. They are in \u201cdo-or-die\u201d territory and the odds of them failing to do the deal are more significant than one in a million. But they can do it. In these matches an individual can take charge of the game by sheer force of personality. So far we have seen Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler and Jason Roy offer glimpses of that.</p> \n<p>In all probability Roy, who struck that imperious century against Bangladesh in Cardiff, will have the chance to do something similar against India, albeit in more testing conditions. On the eve of this match he has batted in the nets and sprinted on the outfield without much discomfort. It will not take much for him to convince the hierarchy that he is ready to play since they are desperate to have him back.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28408866-315e-4b7f-8f08-84b98aaa5411\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/slOSqRUzxdk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He may not be 100% fit but England no longer have the luxury of playing safe. The biggest test for him will come, not when batting, but in the field where the need to twist and turn puts the body, in particular Roy\u2019s dodgy hamstring, under stress. Selecting him is a gamble England will probably take especially since James Vince has once again exasperated rather than excelled. The fitness of Jofra Archer will also be assessed in the morning. No doubt Liam Plunkett is eagerly standing by.</p> \n<p>The Edgbaston pitch is fresh, which will please the England camp given the threat of the two Indian spinners. Generally the surfaces have been more helpful to bowlers than anticipated in this tournament, but the ICC is keen to point out that this is not their policy: \u201cThe guidance we give any host of an ICC event is to prepare the best possible pitches \u2013 with even bounce and good carry. We do not instruct groundsmen to prepare pitches in a certain way to advantage or disadvantage any team.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On Sunday, with the forecast benign, both captains are likely to choose to bat first on winning the toss.

Eoin Morgan has often taken the default position of chasing but, after three defeats batting second in this World Cup, he is prepared to rethink.</p>",

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s most important white-ball cricket match for four years has come a little earlier than expected. The anticipation was that it would take place at Old Trafford or Edgbaston next week in one of the semi-finals. But three losses, especially the wanton one to Sri Lanka, during the qualification process have meant the crunch game has arrived a week ahead of schedule. To be certain of a semi-final slot England have to beat India at Edgbaston on Sunday and New Zealand at Chester-le-Street on Wednesday. They can lift the World Cup if they win four games in a row. That is the only way to look at it now. At Edgbaston they encounter the side that have been the best in the tournament by a considerable margin. India are unbeaten and perversely the only game in which they have been seriously threatened was against Afghanistan. Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul and the incredibly patient MS Dhoni have scored enough runs to allow a varied and disciplined bowling attack to prevail. In some ways India have played an old-fashioned game. They are prepared to be patient at the start of their innings. Keeping wickets in hand is a high priority. They are not tempted to be greedy because they are so confident that their batsmen can cause sufficient mayhem in the final overs and that their bowlers possess the skill and resolution to defend relatively modest totals. The bowling attack at Kohli\u2019s disposal is an exciting one with two pacemen and two wrist-spinners backed up by a more journeyman seamer, Hardik Pandya. Opponents naturally try to attack him but he has remained undaunted and resourceful when under fire. At the start of an innings Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami, who has replaced Bhuvneshwar Kumar, are brisk and businesslike, offering no free runs. At the end they have been superb. Shami adheres to old-fashioned principles: he bowls fast and straight. Meanwhile, Bumrah is rivalled only by Mitchell Starc in his ability to propel yorkers. Against Afghanistan, when bowling the penultimate over with the match in the balance, Bumrah decided the outcome quite brilliantly with six perfect yorkers. Why doesn\u2019t every bowler do that? Because it is very difficult. Batsmen have innovated in the T20 era so that the margin of error for those attempting yorkers has been massively reduced. So some bowlers conclude that the risk is too great. Get it wrong and the ball disappears into the stands. But the perfect yorker remains the best delivery at the end of the innings and Bumrah, more than any other bowler in the tournament, is confident that he can hit that spot, not much bigger than a saucepan lid, on the popping crease. He is a huge asset for Kohli. So, too, are the wonderfully beguiling pair of wrist-spinners. My guess is that Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal do not score very well on the bleep test; they do not score many runs either and they are relatively pedestrian in a very good fielding side. But to have two contrasting wrist-spinners in the same side is bold and effective. Both are enjoying larger boundaries than the postage stamps used in the Indian Premier League. Kuldeep in particular has the bravado to toss the ball high in the air when he thinks it appropriate. A lot of batsmen are none too sure which way the ball is going to bounce on landing. Chahal has taken more wickets, partly because he tends to bowl later in the innings; neither has been collared yet. So England\u2019s challenge at Edgbaston is considerable. They are in \u201cdo-or-die\u201d territory and the odds of them failing to do the deal are more significant than one in a million. But they can do it. In these matches an individual can take charge of the game by sheer force of personality. So far we have seen Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler and Jason Roy offer glimpses of that. In all probability Roy, who struck that imperious century against Bangladesh in Cardiff, will have the chance to do something similar against India, albeit in more testing conditions. On the eve of this match he has batted in the nets and sprinted on the outfield without much discomfort. It will not take much for him to convince the hierarchy that he is ready to play since they are desperate to have him back. He may not be 100% fit but England no longer have the luxury of playing safe. The biggest test for him will come, not when batting, but in the field where the need to twist and turn puts the body, in particular Roy\u2019s dodgy hamstring, under stress. Selecting him is a gamble England will probably take especially since James Vince has once again exasperated rather than excelled. The fitness of Jofra Archer will also be assessed in the morning. No doubt Liam Plunkett is eagerly standing by. The Edgbaston pitch is fresh, which will please the England camp given the threat of the two Indian spinners. Generally the surfaces have been more helpful to bowlers than anticipated in this tournament, but the ICC is keen to point out that this is not their policy: \u201cThe guidance we give any host of an ICC event is to prepare the best possible pitches \u2013 with even bounce and good carry. We do not instruct groundsmen to prepare pitches in a certain way to advantage or disadvantage any team.\u201d On Sunday, with the forecast benign, both captains are likely to choose to bat first on winning the toss. Kohli has long been content to adopt that policy in high-tension contests. Eoin Morgan has often taken the default position of chasing but, after three defeats batting second in this World Cup, he is prepared to rethink.",

Then, as time went on, these articles and headlines became less surprised, and they started to say, of course, the robots are racist because they\u2019re designed in a society with these biases.</p> <p><strong>The idea that software can have prejudice embedded in it is known as algorithmic bias \u2013 how does it amplify prejudice? </strong><br>Many of these automated systems are trying to identify and predict risk.

The decisions of the past are the input for how we teach software to make those decisions in the future. If we live in a society where police profile black and Latinx people, that affects the police data on who is likely to be a criminal.

But there are other areas too, such as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G\" title=\"\">Amazon\u2019s own hiring algorithms</a>, which discriminated against women applicants, even though gender wasn\u2019t listed on those r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. The training set used data about who already worked at Amazon. Sometimes, the more intelligent machine learning becomes, the more discriminatory it can be \u2013 so in that case, it was able to pick up gender cues based on other aspects of those r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, like their previous education or their experience.</p> <p><strong>In your book, you assert that the treatment of black communities</strong><strong> is an indication of what\u2019s to come for other communities more generally. How would you say this extends to technology? </strong><br>Thinking about how risk is racialised is one way into understanding how those systems can eventually be deployed against many more people, not just the initial target. This is one of the things we can see with these new digital scoring systems \u2013 these companies which don\u2019t just look at your personal riskiness, but also <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-the-life-insurance-industry-wants-to-creep-on-your-instagram\" title=\"\">your social media</a> and the people you\u2019re connected with. If someone you know has defaulted on a loan, that can affect you. So actually, incorporating and gathering more data can be even more harmful to people\u2019s lives.</p> <p><strong>What role can legislation or regulation play in changing this direction? </strong><br>I\u2019m personally a little sceptical \u2013 the passing of a law can be a placeholder for much more significant progress because people prematurely celebrate, even if not much changes. But I do increasingly think that legislation has a role to play. Even if a particular law is just a regulation in a state, or one country in Europe, it can be very effective because if these companies want to roll out technologies universally, and then they find they have to change something up for a certain jurisdiction, it can then be an obstacle. Other elements, like state-level protections for whistleblowers are vital, because there has been retaliation against workers at these tech companies. </p> <p><strong>Home DNA testing kits are increasingly popular, and genomics screening is more commonplace too. Are you concerned about how technologies are being used, and weaponised? </strong><br>We did an informal audit of three DNA testing companies when I was a postdoc at UCLA. The results we got back were completely different across the three companies, because of their own reference data. These companies have access to our data, which they can buy and sell to other companies, and there\u2019s really very few regulatory safeguards on how this is going to be used. The similarity between those technologies \u2013 the DNA testing kits, artificial intelligence, machine learning \u2013 is that the reference data shapes so much of the prediction. We have to question how it\u2019s put together, what individuals are being used as reference points.</p> <p><strong>You call these systems the new Jim Code, because of how they perpetuate inequality.

Many people look at high levels of segregation \u2013 which does still exist \u2013 and they rarely question how it was designed, but instead put it down to the stereotypes of lazy people who don\u2019t value education, and all kinds of narratives along those lines. When we think about the new Jim Code, I\u2019m referring to things like the investigation from ProPublica, where companies could tick boxes saying, you don\u2019t want black people to see <a href=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/20171121-facebook-retry-what-we-chose.jpg\" title=\"\">the real estate where you advertise</a>, on Facebook.

      "body": "<p>Mark Ronson\u2019s broken heart weighs 25kg. It says so on the outside of the wooden crate that takes this large, cracked mirrorball out to the club nights the DJ and producer has been holding sporadically since last year.</p> <p>It sits in front of Ronson\u2019s DJ console, jaggedly reflecting the tutti-frutti light scheme. We\u2019re in a long-serving King\u2019s Cross venue, rather than a place Ronson\u2019s usual clientele, the international jet set, might go to dance. The tinsel decor of his travelling Club Heartbreak is also a little makeshift. Ronson comes penultimate in a four-DJ lineup, most of whom spin a series of \u201csad bangers\u201d \u2013 the go-to phrase sums up Ronson\u2019s fifth studio album, <em>Late Night Feelings</em>, a record that finds the transatlantic super-producer dancing with tears in his eyes. Tonight he starts off wearing a leather jacket with the broken mirror ball motif on the back, but soon strips off to reveal a <em>Faith</em>-era George Michael T-shirt beneath as he does sweaty battle with a pair of headphones.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to imagine such a gilded, A-list Insta-life actually laid low by intimate pain \u2013 not least because the waters in which successful creatives swim supply all sorts of analgesic possibilities, and plenty more fish.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The problem with Late Night Feelings is small but significant. The hurt here is vague and the music not dramatic enough</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But there is something convincing in the notion that Ronson\u2019s 2017 divorce from Jos\u00e9phine de La Baume, his wife of five years created an internal blemish in an otherwise hunky-dory existence. Pain, Ronson\u2019s fifth album indirectly posits, is universal; a great leveller and, arguably, a far more fruitful space from which to draw creatively than the beautiful people\u2019s party music that has been Ronson\u2019s recent stock-in-trade.</p> <p>Ronson plays many of his own songs tonight, not least his \u201cfavourite\u201d from the new album, the Angel Olsen-powered True Blue, which imports Olsen\u2019s trademark reverberating sound wholesale into Ronson\u2019s ambit. (He allegedly first heard her music through the wall of a pilates studio.) But there\u2019s no room for Uptown Funk, the Bruno Mars-fronted monster that renewed Ronson\u2019s commercial cachet: too, well, \u201cup\u201d.</p> <p>Ronson doesn\u2019t sing at all on <em>Late Night Feelings</em>, but entrusts the vocals to an all-female cast. It\u2019s a list that makes a lot of sense: Los Angeles Swede Lykke Li \u2013 made famous by one of the most anguished bangers of recent times, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZYbEL06lEU\" title=\"\">I Follow Rivers</a> (2011) \u2013 and an even more recent bard of contemporary longing, Camila Cabello. It\u2019s really not a bad record: united in theme and varied enough in treatment not to outstay its welcome, <em>Late Night Feelings</em> is the latest in Ronson\u2019s attempts to steer pop away from ever more crass ear-grabbing tropes. On this count you believe him, up to a point. When he teamed up with fellow super-producer Diplo last year as Silk City, though, Ronson seems to have had few such scruples: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJLcwqgVOKM\" title=\"\">Electricity \u2013 their hit with Dua Lipa</a> \u2013 is no aural wallflower. But tonight Ronson is punting something a little more retro: this DJ set, like his album, eschews the latest sounds for a mashup of tried and tested glitter-as-medicine. This new overtly disco direction might have legs, too. He\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8517604/diana-ross-mark-ronson-next-album\" title=\"\">had meetings recently with Diana Ross</a>, the queen of disco, to discuss her next album.</p> <p>It\u2019s significant, though, that Ronson kicks off his hour-long set with I Can\u2019t Stand the Rain by Ann Peebles, famously sampled by Missy Elliott and Timbaland for Elliott\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHcyJPTTn9w\" title=\"\">1997 hit The Rain</a>. Long before Ronson was the producer winning Grammys for his work on Lady Gaga\u2019s career-rescuing Joanne, or Electricity, he spent the late 90s DJ-ing for the New York hip-hop crowd.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c838f54ed40e446e5f7c9b733929709cde1029a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c838f54ed40e446e5f7c9b733929709cde1029a/0_1547_3255_4069/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Ronson at Club Heartbreak.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Ronson at Club Heartbreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lorenzo Garrido</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201c\u2018What the fuck are you playing, white boy?\u2019\u201d was frequently \u201ca verbatim quote\u201d, remembers Ronson in <a href=\"https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/mark-ronson-tells-his-friend-rashida-jones-what-its-like-to-dance-and-be-sad-at-the-same-time\" title=\"\">a recent issue in <em>Interview</em> magazine</a>, where he was grilled (very gently) by Rashida Jones, who was his partner in those days. Ronson\u2019s understanding and respect for hip-hop\u2019s constituent parts \u2013 the soul samples, the grooves \u2013 endeared him to the rap scene. They ended up being the bedrock of his career.</p> <p>\u201cAmy taught me a lot about heartbreak,\u201d Ronson says, before spinning Winehouse\u2019s evergreen, ever-blue <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJAfLE39ZZ8\" title=\"\">Back to Black</a>. Before Ronson was in cahoots with the bling likes of Mars, he was a sensitive enabler in league with soul revivalists the Dap-Kings. He urged Winehouse \u2013 then a jazz singer who Island Records wanted to turn into a pop star \u2013 to write what she felt. The result was a one of the biggest albums of the 00s, and the making of Ronson\u2019s reputation, after his minor hit, 2003\u2019s Ooh Wee.</p> <p>Tonight\u2019s set comes five days after the release of <em>Late Night Feelings</em>; Ronson and a few of the album\u2019s vocalists will soon be bound for Glastonbury. Unspoken hopes exist that tonight\u2019s \u201cspecial guests\u201d might include some of the album\u2019s shinier stars: maybe Miley Cyrus, who sings the album\u2019s most ubiquitous cut, Nothing Breaks Like a Heart, and is expected at Worthy Farm.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-miley-cyrus-make-surprise-appearance-with-mark-ronson-in-london-2418238\" title=\"\">Cyrus did turn up</a> to the last London iteration of Club Heartbreak last December, but doesn\u2019t show tonight; Ronson makes the best of her absence. In an outbreak of cheesy brio, he plays Nothing Breaks Like a Heart, interrupting it with Lil Nas X\u2019s country trap hit, O<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptKqFafZgCk\" title=\"\">ld Town Road</a>, which showcases Miley\u2019s dad, Billy Ray Cyrus.

      "bodyText": "Mark Ronson\u2019s broken heart weighs 25kg. It says so on the outside of the wooden crate that takes this large, cracked mirrorball out to the club nights the DJ and producer has been holding sporadically since last year. It sits in front of Ronson\u2019s DJ console, jaggedly reflecting the tutti-frutti light scheme. We\u2019re in a long-serving King\u2019s Cross venue, rather than a place Ronson\u2019s usual clientele, the international jet set, might go to dance. The tinsel decor of his travelling Club Heartbreak is also a little makeshift. Ronson comes penultimate in a four-DJ lineup, most of whom spin a series of \u201csad bangers\u201d \u2013 the go-to phrase sums up Ronson\u2019s fifth studio album, Late Night Feelings, a record that finds the transatlantic super-producer dancing with tears in his eyes. Tonight he starts off wearing a leather jacket with the broken mirror ball motif on the back, but soon strips off to reveal a Faith-era George Michael T-shirt beneath as he does sweaty battle with a pair of headphones. It\u2019s hard to imagine such a gilded, A-list Insta-life actually laid low by intimate pain \u2013 not least because the waters in which successful creatives swim supply all sorts of analgesic possibilities, and plenty more fish. But there is something convincing in the notion that Ronson\u2019s 2017 divorce from Jos\u00e9phine de La Baume, his wife of five years created an internal blemish in an otherwise hunky-dory existence. Pain, Ronson\u2019s fifth album indirectly posits, is universal; a great leveller and, arguably, a far more fruitful space from which to draw creatively than the beautiful people\u2019s party music that has been Ronson\u2019s recent stock-in-trade. Ronson plays many of his own songs tonight, not least his \u201cfavourite\u201d from the new album, the Angel Olsen-powered True Blue, which imports Olsen\u2019s trademark reverberating sound wholesale into Ronson\u2019s ambit. (He allegedly first heard her music through the wall of a pilates studio.) But there\u2019s no room for Uptown Funk, the Bruno Mars-fronted monster that renewed Ronson\u2019s commercial cachet: too, well, \u201cup\u201d. Ronson doesn\u2019t sing at all on Late Night Feelings, but entrusts the vocals to an all-female cast. It\u2019s a list that makes a lot of sense: Los Angeles Swede Lykke Li \u2013 made famous by one of the most anguished bangers of recent times, I Follow Rivers (2011) \u2013 and an even more recent bard of contemporary longing, Camila Cabello. It\u2019s really not a bad record: united in theme and varied enough in treatment not to outstay its welcome, Late Night Feelings is the latest in Ronson\u2019s attempts to steer pop away from ever more crass ear-grabbing tropes. On this count you believe him, up to a point. When he teamed up with fellow super-producer Diplo last year as Silk City, though, Ronson seems to have had few such scruples: Electricity \u2013 their hit with Dua Lipa \u2013 is no aural wallflower. But tonight Ronson is punting something a little more retro: this DJ set, like his album, eschews the latest sounds for a mashup of tried and tested glitter-as-medicine. This new overtly disco direction might have legs, too. He\u2019s had meetings recently with Diana Ross, the queen of disco, to discuss her next album. It\u2019s significant, though, that Ronson kicks off his hour-long set with I Can\u2019t Stand the Rain by Ann Peebles, famously sampled by Missy Elliott and Timbaland for Elliott\u2019s 1997 hit The Rain. Long before Ronson was the producer winning Grammys for his work on Lady Gaga\u2019s career-rescuing Joanne, or Electricity, he spent the late 90s DJ-ing for the New York hip-hop crowd. \u201c\u2018What the fuck are you playing, white boy?\u2019\u201d was frequently \u201ca verbatim quote\u201d, remembers Ronson in a recent issue in Interview magazine, where he was grilled (very gently) by Rashida Jones, who was his partner in those days. Ronson\u2019s understanding and respect for hip-hop\u2019s constituent parts \u2013 the soul samples, the grooves \u2013 endeared him to the rap scene. They ended up being the bedrock of his career. \u201cAmy taught me a lot about heartbreak,\u201d Ronson says, before spinning Winehouse\u2019s evergreen, ever-blue Back to Black. Before Ronson was in cahoots with the bling likes of Mars, he was a sensitive enabler in league with soul revivalists the Dap-Kings. He urged Winehouse \u2013 then a jazz singer who Island Records wanted to turn into a pop star \u2013 to write what she felt. The result was a one of the biggest albums of the 00s, and the making of Ronson\u2019s reputation, after his minor hit, 2003\u2019s Ooh Wee. Tonight\u2019s set comes five days after the release of Late Night Feelings; Ronson and a few of the album\u2019s vocalists will soon be bound for Glastonbury. Unspoken hopes exist that tonight\u2019s \u201cspecial guests\u201d might include some of the album\u2019s shinier stars: maybe Miley Cyrus, who sings the album\u2019s most ubiquitous cut, Nothing Breaks Like a Heart, and is expected at Worthy Farm. Cyrus did turn up to the last London iteration of Club Heartbreak last December, but doesn\u2019t show tonight; Ronson makes the best of her absence. In an outbreak of cheesy brio, he plays Nothing Breaks Like a Heart, interrupting it with Lil Nas X\u2019s country trap hit, Old Town Road, which showcases Miley\u2019s dad, Billy Ray Cyrus. From there, Ronson segues into Jolene, the Dolly Parton standard that provided inspiration for Nothing Breaks Like a Heart. Nothing about this is particularly cutting edge. But it leaves you with a big grin on your face, where the mascara was previously running for Winehouse. Ronson\u2019s newer talent is in the house, however \u2013 starting with New York\u2019s King Princess, signed to Ronson\u2019s record label and about to release her own debut album. She bounces around while Ronson plays her catchy-enough Pieces of Us. Yebba, a previously unknown Arkansas soul singer, arrives with a pair of backing vocalists to sing Don\u2019t Leave Me Lonely, one of the record\u2019s standout tracks. A disco-soul anthem-in-waiting held up by an unexpected reggaeton shuffle, it supplies guts and grace to an album that doesn\u2019t disappoint, but somehow doesn\u2019t quite end up a classic. The problem with Late Night Feelings is revealed by the DJ set. It\u2019s small but significant. The hurt here is vague and the music not dramatic enough.

The preceding decade had brought growing demands for the restitution of artefacts taken from Africa by European colonists during the 19th century. If the case for the restitution of human remains to indigenous communities had been, by and large, acceded, the new frontier was works of art. The UN kickstarted the conversation in 2007 with article 11 of its <a href=\"https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2018/11/UNDRIP_E_web.pdf\" title=\"\">declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples</a>, which urged states to restore \u201ccultural, intellectual, religious and spiritual property\u201d taken from indigenous people without their \u201cfree, prior and informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs\u201d. With that aim in mind, the Benin Dialogue Group was established the same year as part of an effort to get European museum curators talking to key representatives in Nigeria.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8470ef9fbb0d994de949cddb7a9f5dd53cba3ae5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8470ef9fbb0d994de949cddb7a9f5dd53cba3ae5/196_72_1522_913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael B Jordan as Erik Killmonger in Black Panther\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael B Jordan as Erik Killmonger in Black Panther.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AF archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Action soon followed. In 2009, Egypt demanded that the Louvre return <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/14/france-louvre-returns-egypt-relics\" title=\"\">five fragments of a wall painting</a> from the tomb of Tetaki, an 18th-dynasty noble. In 2012, Nigeria <a href=\"http://www.elginism.com/similar-cases/nigeria-demands-return-of-disputed-artefacts-acquired-by-bostons-museum-of-fine-arts/20120725/4876/\" title=\"\">requested the return of 32 objects</a> from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston that had been looted by the British army during a raid on the Royal Palaces of Benin City in 1897. In 2017, a year after the president of Benin had made an official request to the French foreign ministry for the return of <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/benin-stolen-objects-repatriation-france-904217\">items taken during imperial occupation</a>, Nigeria made a further request, asking the British Museum in London to return the celebrated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/12/cambridge-benin-bronzes-loan-deal\" title=\"\">Benin bronzes</a>.</p> <p>A core objective of the Benin Dialogue Group was the creation of a permanent display in Benin City of objects once belonging to the former kingdom and now in continental hands. Last year, Hermann Parzinger, president of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, called for international guidelines akin to the Washington principles (which address the restitution of Nazi-confiscated art to descendants of dispossessed, predominantly Jewish families) to help museums handle provenance research and repatriation of illegally acquired artworks in public collections. It is no coincidence that much of this thinking coincided with growing calls for western European nations to apologise for various \u201ccrimes\u201d of empire, from the Germans in Namibia and the Dutch in Indonesia to the British in Kenya and India and the French in north Africa.</p> <p>However, it was Macron\u2019s intervention that signalled a step change. \u201cThis is a revolution,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/comment/the-restitution-revolution-begins\" title=\"\">declared</a> French art historian B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Savoy. \u201cIn two minutes and 33 seconds\u2026 Macron swept aside several decades of official French museum policy.\u201d Savoy was appointed, alongside the Senegalese economist and writer Felwine Sarr, to write a report on implementing the Macron vision. The <a href=\"http://restitutionreport2018.com/sarr_savoy_en.pdf\" title=\"\">resulting study</a>, published last November, recommended the restitution of \u201cany objects taken by force or presumed to be acquired through inequitable conditions\u201d by the army, scientific explorers or administrators during the French colonial period in Africa, which lasted from the late 19th century until 1960.</p> <p>In the report\u2019s aftermath, museums across Europe raced to develop new policies on restitution and repatriation \u2013 not least at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Having previously worked as an MP, I am used to politics. But since my appointment as director of the V&amp;A in February 2017, I have been taken aback by the intensity of the repatriation debate. As a museum born of the imperial moment, the question of provenance and ownership in a post-colonial age is particularly germane. The V&amp;A\u2019s collections expanded in line with the growth of the British empire, in its official and unofficial guise, across southern Asia, showcasing Indian textiles, Burmese lacquerware, Chinese porcelain, and Persian carpets \u2013 as well as a remarkable range of British industrial designs and European Renaissance treasures. In Britain\u2019s colonies and spheres of influence, the practice of collecting was intimately tied to the dominating psychology of colonialism. From the beginning of my directorship, I wanted to be open and transparent about that colonial past, and think carefully about how to manage its legacy today. So too did colleagues on the continent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"24d5f527130d010f9d5de6d017807a093d7a4a5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24d5f527130d010f9d5de6d017807a093d7a4a5d/977_248_3664_2198/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Victoria and Albert Museum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Victoria and Albert Museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace that the Netherlands is only now turning its attention to the return of the colonial heritage,\u201d Taco Dibbits, the Rijksmuseum\u2019s director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/13/rijksmuseum-laments-dutch-failure-to-return-stolen-colonial-art\" title=\"\">told the Dutch newspaper </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/13/rijksmuseum-laments-dutch-failure-to-return-stolen-colonial-art\" title=\"\">Trouw</a></em> as he opened talks on the restitution of colonial-era loot to Indonesia and Sri Lanka. \u201cWe should have done it earlier and there is no excuse.\u201d Similarly, the Netherlands\u2019 National Museum of World Cultures pledged proactively to return all artefacts within its collection identified as stolen during the colonial era \u2013 starting with 139 Benin bronzes, eligible for repatriation to Nigeria. Just outside Brussels, in Tervuren, the Royal Museum for Central Africa turned itself from an institution that celebrated the colonial history of Belgium in the Congo to one that consciously confronted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/09/belgium-addresses-postwar-apartheid-in-colonial-congo\" title=\"\">multiple crimes</a> of King Leopold\u2019s African empire. As parks in eastern Europe are dotted with the fallen statues of Stalin and Lenin, so the Brussels museum pulled down its highly racialised and offensive African statuary (placing them on show as a relic of European colonial thought). And in Berlin, Germany\u2019s 16 state cultural ministries, the foreign office, and urban municipalities agreed to work with museums on a set of guidelines for the return of objects taken from former colonies. \u201cAll people should have the opportunity to meet their rich material cultural heritage in their countries and communities of origin, to interact with it and pass it on to future generations,\u201d they concluded.</p> <p>At the same time, an exciting wave of new museums was announced across Africa. The <a href=\"http://www.mcn.sn/\" title=\"\">Museum of Black Civilisations</a> in Dakar, Senegal, was opened in 2018, with capacity for about 18,000 objects, alongside a clear demand for some of that space to be filled by items currently housed in European museums. New projects are also scheduled for the Javett Art Centre at the University of Pretoria, the Museum of National History in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the JK Randle Centre for Yoruba Culture and History in Lagos. The opening of the Benin Royal Museum in Benin City is scheduled for 2021.</p> <p>The Macron intervention and Savoy/Sarr report represent a philosophical disavowal of the bullish defence of western, encyclopaedic museums articulated in the 2002 <a href=\"http://archives.icom.museum/pdf/E_news2004/p4_2004-1.pdf\" title=\"\">\u201cdeclaration on the importance and value of universal museums\u201d</a>, signed by 18 prominent institutions including the Louvre and New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum. When it came to the troubled provenance of parts of their collection, the declaration decreed that \u201cover time, objects so acquired \u2013 whether by purchase, gift or portage \u2013 have become part of the museums that have cared for them, and by extension part of the heritage of the nations which house them\u201d. James Cuno, president of the J Paul Getty Trust, fleshed out the argument for world collections in his book <em>Museums Matter</em>, writing: \u201cWithout [encyclopaedic museums], one risks a hardening of views about one\u2019s own, particular culture as being pure, essential, and organic, something into which one is born\u2026 The collective, political risk of not having encyclopaedic museums\u2026 is that culture becomes fixed <em>national</em> culture.\u201d Cuno thought it highly reductive to condemn a collection solely because of an imperial connection, adducing Edward Said\u2019s argument that \u201cpartly because of empire, all cultures are involved in one another; none is single and pure, all are hybrid, heterogenous, extraordinarily differentiated, and unmonolithic.\u201d</p> <p>This nuanced account of the impact of empire represents an increasingly singular stance amid the increasingly vocal public and professional campaign to \u201cdecolonise the museum\u201d. In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyZAgG8--Xg\" title=\"\">2016 TedX talk</a> on the latter theme, Cinnamon Catlin-Legutko, president and CEO of the Abbe Museum in Maine, urged fellow museum professionals to give voice and power back to formerly colonised people in an effort to make colonial histories more present in western museums. Olga Viso, the director of Minnesota\u2019s Walker Art Center, concurred. \u201cIf museums want to continue to have a place, they must stop seeing activists as antagonists,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/opinion/decolonizing-art-museums.html\" title=\"\">she wrote</a>. \u201cThey must position themselves as learning communities, not impenetrable centres of self-validating authority. If they do not, museums run the risk of becoming culturally irrelevant artefacts.\u201d</p> <p>The debate was further energised in April 2018, when Brooklyn Museum hired a white scholar as consulting curator of African art.

But while the call to decolonise museums is at an earlier stage than in the US, it is gathering pace. Birkbeck, University of London historian Emma Lundin has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/repatriation-museum-colonial-art-parthenon-marbles-easter-island\" title=\"\">written of how</a> \u201cRhodes must go, along with objects brought to Britain by colonial-era travellers\u201d and urges the return of \u201cpurchased objects\u2026 acquired because of power imbalances between buyers and sellers\u201d.

Clearly to her, the museum as well as Rhodes must go.</p> <p>In 2016, a group of museum and heritage professionals formed <a href=\"https://museumdetox.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Museum Detox</a>, a network for people of black, Asian, Arabic or dual heritage. Led by Sara Wajid, head of engagement at the Museum of London, they aim to build awareness about diversity in cultural organisations, help members achieve leadership positions, and \u201ccreatively use radical approaches to dismantle unjust infrastructures in our national cultural institutions\u201d. While numerous museums have, over many decades, addressed uncomfortable colonial histories through their events, last year Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery went further. Its exhibition <a href=\"https://www.birminghammuseums.org.uk/bmag/whats-on/the-past-is-now-birmingham-and-the-british-empire\" title=\"\">The Past </a><a href=\"https://www.birminghammuseums.org.uk/bmag/whats-on/the-past-is-now-birmingham-and-the-british-empire\" title=\"\">Is Now: Birmingham and the British Empire</a>, which was <a href=\"https://www.birminghammuseums.org.uk/blog/posts/the-past-is-now-the-exhibition-is-open\" title=\"\">conceived as</a> \u201can experiment in how the story of the British empire may be told permanently\u201d, brought together six external co-curators of colour from outside the museum world. \u201cFor many people of colour, collections symbolise historic and ongoing trauma and theft,\u201d <a href=\"https://mediadiversified.org/2017/11/15/the-museum-will-not-be-decolonised/\" title=\"\">explained Sumaya Kassim</a>, one of the artists involved. \u201cThe craftsmanship, the display case, the beauty of the institution that collects and protects its imperial hoard: the way items are described, the way they are catalogued and what gets shown and what remains hidden; all work to deny, retreat and forget.\u201d</p> <p>Despite much outside praise, the exhibition also <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/maajid-nawaz/maajid-british-empire-was-brutal-not-unique-evil/\" title=\"\">drew criticism</a> for giving the impression that \u201cthe British empire was unfailingly dreadful and uniquely evil\u201d. More interestingly, those involved in its curation worried whether the exhibition had merely endorsed the status quo. \u201cI do not want to see decolonisation become part of Britain\u2019s national narrative as a pretty curio with no substance,\u201d wrote Kassim. The fear was that \u201cdecoloniality\u201d was already on its way to becoming a buzzword devoid of agency, like \u201cdiversity\u201d. The cultural critic Jason Farago <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/arts/design/germany-mobile-worlds-mkg-museum.html\" title=\"\">similarly urged</a> western, encyclopaedic museums to go beyond inclusion, diversity, and even \u201cdecolonisation\u201d, to rethink completely their approach. \u201cA 21st-century universal museum has to unsettle the very labels that the age of imperialism bequeathed to us: nations and races, east and west, art and craft. It\u2019s not enough just to call for \u2018decolonisation\u2019\u2026 the whole fiction of cultural purity has to go, too. Any serious museum can only be a museum of our entangled past and resent.\u201d</p> <p>How should an institution like the V&amp;A respond to this new cultural climate, and honour its responsibilities as a global museum? Last year, on the 150th anniversary of the British invasion of Abyssinia, we attempted to chart a pathway through with a small display highlighting our imperial, Ethiopian collections. At its heart sat the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/03/looted-ethiopian-treasures-in-uk-return-loan-victoria-albert-museum\" title=\"\">Maqdala</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/03/looted-ethiopian-treasures-in-uk-return-loan-victoria-albert-museum\" title=\"\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/03/looted-ethiopian-treasures-in-uk-return-loan-victoria-albert-museum\" title=\"\">crown</a>, an exquisite <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/museum-life/maqdala-1868\" title=\"\">work of African craftsmanship</a>, commissioned by the Ethiopian Empress Mentewab in the 1740s, alloyed with silver and copper with filigree work and glass beads. But, as the display made clear, the crown came into the V&amp;A\u2019s possession in less pretty circumstances.</p> <p>Its route to South Kensington originated with the mid-19th century Abyssinian ruler, Emperor Tewodros II, and his ambition to build a modern nation state in east Africa. As a great Christian emperor, Tewodros hoped to push back the power of the Egyptians and sought the assistance of Queen Victoria and the British state in his endeavours. When Lord Palmerston revealed he had no intention of supporting his ambitions (not least because it might entail alienating Egypt, a major supplier of cotton), Tewodros took hostage the British emissary and a handful of European nationals. In response, Sir Robert Napier <a href=\"http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O142528/abyssinia-expedition-1868-9-photograph-royal-engineers/\" title=\"\">gathered together</a> an expeditionary force of 13,000 men, stormed the Maqdala fortress, secured the release of the hostages, and then started to pillage. Sometime during the battle, Tewodros killed himself.</p> <p>Under the stewardship of accompanying curator Richard Holmes, the crown, chalice, and other regalia made their way back to the British Treasury, were auctioned for the army prize fund and then transferred to numerous national museums, including the V&amp;A. Many British politicians heralded the Abyssinian expedition as a textbook imperial intervention. But William Gladstone, the prime minister, told the House of Commons that he \u201cdeeply lamented, for the sake of the country, and for the sake of all concerned, that these articles\u2026 were thought fit to be brought away by a British army\u201d. He urged that they \u201cbe held only until they could be restored\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9fff8869638614445d06ad5767229b7819bfad99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fff8869638614445d06ad5767229b7819bfad99/0_0_687_412/500.jpg\" alt=\"A crown from the Maqdala 1868 exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A crown from the Maqdala 1868 exhibition at the V&amp;A Museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: V&amp;A</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the 20th century, a number of items held by the British government were returned to Ethiopia. Artefacts owned by the British Museum, British Library, National Army Museum and V&amp;A could not legally be part of that process of restitution, however. So in March 2008, Girma Wolde-Giorgis, the president of Ethiopia, sent a letter to Sir Mark Jones, the V&amp;A\u2019s director at the time, stating that Ethiopians had \u201clong grieved at the loss of this part of their national heritage\u201d and urging \u201cthe return of Ethiopia\u2019s looted treasures\u201d \u201cto cement the good relations between our two countries\u201d. Yet discussions over how to pursue such an accommodation soon petered out. In 2018 we were clear that even if the objects could not be returned <em>tout court</em>, we should nonetheless work on a display as well as being open and transparent about how the items entered the collection, engaging with the Ethiopian embassy and the broader diaspora community, and offering the items on a long-term loan. If not decolonising the museum, the display was cognisant of the colonial context of the collection and its meaning for African-heritage communities.</p> <p>Adamant that the restitution case remained outstanding, the Ethiopian government said they could not accede to a long-term loan, as that would signal a legal acceptance of UK ownership. \u201cEthiopia\u2019s demand has always been the restoration of those illegally looted treasures. Not to borrow them,\u201d <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-history-artefacts/ethiopia-says-british-museum-must-permanently-return-its-artifacts-idUKKBN1HU2M2\" title=\"\">responded</a> Ephrem Amare, the Ethiopian National Museum director. That position was reaffirmed in March 2019 when the Ethiopian culture minister, Dr Hirut Kassaw, visited the V&amp;A display. For the Ethiopian government, the collection was not simply an array of interesting design artefacts, but essential to the country rediscovering its history and charting a new way forward. Kassaw\u2019s trip to London included a successful visit to the National Army Museum, where she oversaw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/mar/04/uk-museum-agrees-to-return-ethiopian-emperors-hair\" title=\"\">the return of two lockets of hair</a> cut from the scalp of Tewodros in 1868 and now set to be reinterred with his remains.</p> <p>Alongside the understandable official position, the Ethiopian ambassador Hailemichael Aberra Afework expressed satisfaction \u201cwith the new partnership between Ethiopia and the V&amp;A\u201d, expressing optimism about \u201cfuture co-operation\u201d on \u201cthe care and maintenance of cultural heritage, in which the V&amp;A has extensive experience\u201d. Productive conversations have since been held about a framework for co-operation \u2013 together with the British Library and British Museum - and we are working towards having the Maqdala treasures on show in Addis Ababa.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jun/21/british-museum-head-in-sand-return-artefacts-colonial\">British Museum 'has head in sand' over return of artefacts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The V&amp;A\u2019s Maqdala experience highlighted the tensions facing national museums when it comes to restitution debates. Under the <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/47/contents\" title=\"\">National Heritage Act 1983</a>, the trustees of the V&amp;A are specifically prevented from de-accessioning objects that are the property of the museum, unless they are exact replicas or damaged beyond repair. This remit was specifically enjoined to prevent the dispersal of \u201cunfashionable\u201d items from the collections (or, indeed, fundraising through the sale of valuable works), which later generations might have lamented.</p> <p>But legislation is only part of the issue. I also feel we need to tread carefully along a path of total restitution, dictated by a political timetable. There remains something essentially valuable about the ability of museums to position objects beyond particular cultural or ethnic identities, curate them within a broader intellectual or aesthetic lineage, and situate them within a wider, richer framework of relationships while allowing free and open access, physically and digitally. </p> <p>For a museum like the V&amp;A, to decolonise is to decontextualise: the history of empire is embedded in its meaning and collections, and the question is how that is interpreted. A more nuanced understanding of empire is needed than the politically driven pathways of Good or Bad. For alongside colonial violence, empire was also a story of cosmopolitanism and hybridity: through trade, religion, war and force, peoples and cultures mixed and, in many cases, expressed that exchange and interaction through the type of material culture now found in museums. That was the case for the Roman, Ottoman, Ming, Ashanti, Habsburg and, yes, British empires. Today, power, wealth and art are being accumulated in the coming empires \u2013 informal and formal \u2013 of modern China and the Gulf states. Perhaps the real challenge is how we create more, rather than fewer, universal museums \u2013 not in Europe and the west, but across Africa, India and the global south. Our aim should be to detach the universal, encyclopaedic museum from its colonial preconditions and reimagine it as a new medium for multicultural understanding.</p> <p>Calls for \u201cdecolonisation\u201d, restitution and diversity look set to grow. Maqdala 1868 was a small step forward. So too our work on African heritage tours of the museum collections, research into the slave-owning wealth of early V&amp;A benefactors, programming and exhibitions consciously focused on promoting diversity, sustained attempts to widen the talent pool of curatorial and conservation staff. About 47% of schoolchildren who visited the V&amp;A in 2017-18 were from BAME backgrounds; clear progress has been made. However, the truth is that museum leaders must engage with this agenda and work on programmes of tangible change involving collections and curators, which can include the option of repatriation, in different forms, based on the history of each object. As Sabyasachi Mukherjee, director general of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya in Mumbai, says: \u201cMuseums must recognise that unresolved repatriation and restitution disputes can, in the absence of serious efforts at conciliation, paralyse the sharing of significant cultural objects\u2026 institutional narratives or legal doctrines [must] not come in the way of celebrating a world culture.\u201d If that is ignored, the momentum will pass into the hands of politicians \u2013 and in a two-minute-33-second speech, the complex, layered meaning of an object could be lost for ever to the reductive expediency of a passing agenda.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 July 2019 to correct the Brooklyn Museum title from chief curator of the African collection to consulting curator of African art.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cI am from a generation of the French people for whom the crimes of European colonialism are undeniable and make up part of our history,\u201d announced Emmanuel Macron to a crowded lecture theatre at Ouagadougou University, in Burkina Faso, in November 2017. \u201cI cannot accept that a large part of cultural heritage from several African countries is in France \u2026 In the next five years, I want the conditions to be created for the temporary or permanent restitution of African patrimony to Africa.\u201d In case anyone missed the significance of the French president\u2019s remarks, the Elys\u00e9e Palace was swift to spell out the new policy: \u201cAfrican heritage can no longer be the prisoner of European museums.\u201d The following year brought another notable intervention, this time from supervillain Erik Killmonger in the Marvel blockbuster Black Panther. Surveying the African collection at the \u201cMuseum of Great Britain\u201d, Killmonger corrects the exhibition\u2019s patronising white curator about the provenance of an axe: \u201cIt was taken by British soldiers in Benin, but it\u2019s from Wakanda. Don\u2019t trip \u2013 I\u2019m gonna take it off your hands for you.\u201d When the woman replies that the items are not for sale, Killmonger says: \u201cHow do you think your ancestors got these? Do you think they paid a fair price? Or did they take it, like they took everything else?\u201d As the poisoned curator collapses, Killmonger deaccessions the artefact. Black Panther took just 26 days to reach $1bn (\u00a3784,000) in worldwide box office sales and, in one compelling scene, highlighted all the current controversies over museum collections and colonial injustice. Macron\u2019s pledge and Killmonger\u2019s heist had context. The preceding decade had brought growing demands for the restitution of artefacts taken from Africa by European colonists during the 19th century. If the case for the restitution of human remains to indigenous communities had been, by and large, acceded, the new frontier was works of art. The UN kickstarted the conversation in 2007 with article 11 of its declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples, which urged states to restore \u201ccultural, intellectual, religious and spiritual property\u201d taken from indigenous people without their \u201cfree, prior and informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs\u201d. With that aim in mind, the Benin Dialogue Group was established the same year as part of an effort to get European museum curators talking to key representatives in Nigeria. Action soon followed. In 2009, Egypt demanded that the Louvre return five fragments of a wall painting from the tomb of Tetaki, an 18th-dynasty noble. In 2012, Nigeria requested the return of 32 objects from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston that had been looted by the British army during a raid on the Royal Palaces of Benin City in 1897. In 2017, a year after the president of Benin had made an official request to the French foreign ministry for the return of items taken during imperial occupation, Nigeria made a further request, asking the British Museum in London to return the celebrated Benin bronzes. A core objective of the Benin Dialogue Group was the creation of a permanent display in Benin City of objects once belonging to the former kingdom and now in continental hands. Last year, Hermann Parzinger, president of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, called for international guidelines akin to the Washington principles (which address the restitution of Nazi-confiscated art to descendants of dispossessed, predominantly Jewish families) to help museums handle provenance research and repatriation of illegally acquired artworks in public collections. It is no coincidence that much of this thinking coincided with growing calls for western European nations to apologise for various \u201ccrimes\u201d of empire, from the Germans in Namibia and the Dutch in Indonesia to the British in Kenya and India and the French in north Africa. However, it was Macron\u2019s intervention that signalled a step change. \u201cThis is a revolution,\u201d declared French art historian B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Savoy. \u201cIn two minutes and 33 seconds\u2026 Macron swept aside several decades of official French museum policy.\u201d Savoy was appointed, alongside the Senegalese economist and writer Felwine Sarr, to write a report on implementing the Macron vision. The resulting study, published last November, recommended the restitution of \u201cany objects taken by force or presumed to be acquired through inequitable conditions\u201d by the army, scientific explorers or administrators during the French colonial period in Africa, which lasted from the late 19th century until 1960. In the report\u2019s aftermath, museums across Europe raced to develop new policies on restitution and repatriation \u2013 not least at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Having previously worked as an MP, I am used to politics. But since my appointment as director of the V&amp;A in February 2017, I have been taken aback by the intensity of the repatriation debate. As a museum born of the imperial moment, the question of provenance and ownership in a post-colonial age is particularly germane. The V&amp;A\u2019s collections expanded in line with the growth of the British empire, in its official and unofficial guise, across southern Asia, showcasing Indian textiles, Burmese lacquerware, Chinese porcelain, and Persian carpets \u2013 as well as a remarkable range of British industrial designs and European Renaissance treasures. In Britain\u2019s colonies and spheres of influence, the practice of collecting was intimately tied to the dominating psychology of colonialism. From the beginning of my directorship, I wanted to be open and transparent about that colonial past, and think carefully about how to manage its legacy today. So too did colleagues on the continent. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace that the Netherlands is only now turning its attention to the return of the colonial heritage,\u201d Taco Dibbits, the Rijksmuseum\u2019s director, told the Dutch newspaper Trouw as he opened talks on the restitution of colonial-era loot to Indonesia and Sri Lanka. \u201cWe should have done it earlier and there is no excuse.\u201d Similarly, the Netherlands\u2019 National Museum of World Cultures pledged proactively to return all artefacts within its collection identified as stolen during the colonial era \u2013 starting with 139 Benin bronzes, eligible for repatriation to Nigeria. Just outside Brussels, in Tervuren, the Royal Museum for Central Africa turned itself from an institution that celebrated the colonial history of Belgium in the Congo to one that consciously confronted the multiple crimes of King Leopold\u2019s African empire. As parks in eastern Europe are dotted with the fallen statues of Stalin and Lenin, so the Brussels museum pulled down its highly racialised and offensive African statuary (placing them on show as a relic of European colonial thought). And in Berlin, Germany\u2019s 16 state cultural ministries, the foreign office, and urban municipalities agreed to work with museums on a set of guidelines for the return of objects taken from former colonies. \u201cAll people should have the opportunity to meet their rich material cultural heritage in their countries and communities of origin, to interact with it and pass it on to future generations,\u201d they concluded. At the same time, an exciting wave of new museums was announced across Africa. The Museum of Black Civilisations in Dakar, Senegal, was opened in 2018, with capacity for about 18,000 objects, alongside a clear demand for some of that space to be filled by items currently housed in European museums. New projects are also scheduled for the Javett Art Centre at the University of Pretoria, the Museum of National History in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the JK Randle Centre for Yoruba Culture and History in Lagos. The opening of the Benin Royal Museum in Benin City is scheduled for 2021. The Macron intervention and Savoy/Sarr report represent a philosophical disavowal of the bullish defence of western, encyclopaedic museums articulated in the 2002 \u201cdeclaration on the importance and value of universal museums\u201d, signed by 18 prominent institutions including the Louvre and New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum. When it came to the troubled provenance of parts of their collection, the declaration decreed that \u201cover time, objects so acquired \u2013 whether by purchase, gift or portage \u2013 have become part of the museums that have cared for them, and by extension part of the heritage of the nations which house them\u201d. James Cuno, president of the J Paul Getty Trust, fleshed out the argument for world collections in his book Museums Matter, writing: \u201cWithout [encyclopaedic museums], one risks a hardening of views about one\u2019s own, particular culture as being pure, essential, and organic, something into which one is born\u2026 The collective, political risk of not having encyclopaedic museums\u2026 is that culture becomes fixed national culture.\u201d Cuno thought it highly reductive to condemn a collection solely because of an imperial connection, adducing Edward Said\u2019s argument that \u201cpartly because of empire, all cultures are involved in one another; none is single and pure, all are hybrid, heterogenous, extraordinarily differentiated, and unmonolithic.\u201d This nuanced account of the impact of empire represents an increasingly singular stance amid the increasingly vocal public and professional campaign to \u201cdecolonise the museum\u201d. In a 2016 TedX talk on the latter theme, Cinnamon Catlin-Legutko, president and CEO of the Abbe Museum in Maine, urged fellow museum professionals to give voice and power back to formerly colonised people in an effort to make colonial histories more present in western museums. Olga Viso, the director of Minnesota\u2019s Walker Art Center, concurred. \u201cIf museums want to continue to have a place, they must stop seeing activists as antagonists,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey must position themselves as learning communities, not impenetrable centres of self-validating authority. If they do not, museums run the risk of becoming culturally irrelevant artefacts.\u201d The debate was further energised in April 2018, when Brooklyn Museum hired a white scholar as consulting curator of African art. An open letter from Decolonize This Place, a New York-based action group intent on an overhaul of the city\u2019s museums, described the decision as \u201ctone deaf\u201d, calling on the museum to \u201cparticipate in the creation of a Decolonization Commission\u2026 to account for their own role in the histories of colonialism and white supremacy\u201d. The group called for this commission to be tasked with diversifying the museum\u2019s staff and reviewing its inventory of colonial-era artefacts \u201cwith a view to settling the long-pursued claims of reparations and repatriation\u201d. Curiously, yet tellingly, Decolonize This Place also sought an end to \u201cpro-Israeli artwashing\u201d and \u201can institutional commitment to address the issues raised by the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement\u201d against Israel. What the establishment of the state of Israel had to do with the hiring of a white female curator in Brooklyn was unclear, but it exposed both the broader ideological (and racial) agenda of the movement and how the \u2018decolonisation\u2019 agenda can encompass so many differing strands. There have been debates around the imperial past and its legacies in Britain, one example being the Rhodes Must Fall campaign, which called for the removal of a statue of Cecil Rhodes from an Oxford college. But while the call to decolonise museums is at an earlier stage than in the US, it is gathering pace. Birkbeck, University of London historian Emma Lundin has written of how \u201cRhodes must go, along with objects brought to Britain by colonial-era travellers\u201d and urges the return of \u201cpurchased objects\u2026 acquired because of power imbalances between buyers and sellers\u201d. Alice Procter, a University of London student, runs \u201cuncomfortable art tours\u201d of British museums focusing on questions of disputed provenance. She dismisses \u201cthe whole concept of the Museum\u2026 [as] a colonialist, imperialist fantasy, born from the fallacy that somehow the whole world can be neatly catalogued, contained in a single building, mapped out for easy digestion\u201d. Clearly to her, the museum as well as Rhodes must go. In 2016, a group of museum and heritage professionals formed Museum Detox, a network for people of black, Asian, Arabic or dual heritage. Led by Sara Wajid, head of engagement at the Museum of London, they aim to build awareness about diversity in cultural organisations, help members achieve leadership positions, and \u201ccreatively use radical approaches to dismantle unjust infrastructures in our national cultural institutions\u201d. While numerous museums have, over many decades, addressed uncomfortable colonial histories through their events, last year Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery went further. Its exhibition The Past Is Now: Birmingham and the British Empire, which was conceived as \u201can experiment in how the story of the British empire may be told permanently\u201d, brought together six external co-curators of colour from outside the museum world. \u201cFor many people of colour, collections symbolise historic and ongoing trauma and theft,\u201d explained Sumaya Kassim, one of the artists involved. \u201cThe craftsmanship, the display case, the beauty of the institution that collects and protects its imperial hoard: the way items are described, the way they are catalogued and what gets shown and what remains hidden; all work to deny, retreat and forget.\u201d Despite much outside praise, the exhibition also drew criticism for giving the impression that \u201cthe British empire was unfailingly dreadful and uniquely evil\u201d. More interestingly, those involved in its curation worried whether the exhibition had merely endorsed the status quo. \u201cI do not want to see decolonisation become part of Britain\u2019s national narrative as a pretty curio with no substance,\u201d wrote Kassim. The fear was that \u201cdecoloniality\u201d was already on its way to becoming a buzzword devoid of agency, like \u201cdiversity\u201d. The cultural critic Jason Farago similarly urged western, encyclopaedic museums to go beyond inclusion, diversity, and even \u201cdecolonisation\u201d, to rethink completely their approach. \u201cA 21st-century universal museum has to unsettle the very labels that the age of imperialism bequeathed to us: nations and races, east and west, art and craft. It\u2019s not enough just to call for \u2018decolonisation\u2019\u2026 the whole fiction of cultural purity has to go, too. Any serious museum can only be a museum of our entangled past and resent.\u201d How should an institution like the V&amp;A respond to this new cultural climate, and honour its responsibilities as a global museum? Last year, on the 150th anniversary of the British invasion of Abyssinia, we attempted to chart a pathway through with a small display highlighting our imperial, Ethiopian collections. At its heart sat the Maqdala crown, an exquisite work of African craftsmanship, commissioned by the Ethiopian Empress Mentewab in the 1740s, alloyed with silver and copper with filigree work and glass beads. But, as the display made clear, the crown came into the V&amp;A\u2019s possession in less pretty circumstances. Its route to South Kensington originated with the mid-19th century Abyssinian ruler, Emperor Tewodros II, and his ambition to build a modern nation state in east Africa. As a great Christian emperor, Tewodros hoped to push back the power of the Egyptians and sought the assistance of Queen Victoria and the British state in his endeavours. When Lord Palmerston revealed he had no intention of supporting his ambitions (not least because it might entail alienating Egypt, a major supplier of cotton), Tewodros took hostage the British emissary and a handful of European nationals. In response, Sir Robert Napier gathered together an expeditionary force of 13,000 men, stormed the Maqdala fortress, secured the release of the hostages, and then started to pillage. Sometime during the battle, Tewodros killed himself. Under the stewardship of accompanying curator Richard Holmes, the crown, chalice, and other regalia made their way back to the British Treasury, were auctioned for the army prize fund and then transferred to numerous national museums, including the V&amp;A. Many British politicians heralded the Abyssinian expedition as a textbook imperial intervention. But William Gladstone, the prime minister, told the House of Commons that he \u201cdeeply lamented, for the sake of the country, and for the sake of all concerned, that these articles\u2026 were thought fit to be brought away by a British army\u201d. He urged that they \u201cbe held only until they could be restored\u201d. During the 20th century, a number of items held by the British government were returned to Ethiopia. Artefacts owned by the British Museum, British Library, National Army Museum and V&amp;A could not legally be part of that process of restitution, however. So in March 2008, Girma Wolde-Giorgis, the president of Ethiopia, sent a letter to Sir Mark Jones, the V&amp;A\u2019s director at the time, stating that Ethiopians had \u201clong grieved at the loss of this part of their national heritage\u201d and urging \u201cthe return of Ethiopia\u2019s looted treasures\u201d \u201cto cement the good relations between our two countries\u201d. Yet discussions over how to pursue such an accommodation soon petered out. In 2018 we were clear that even if the objects could not be returned tout court, we should nonetheless work on a display as well as being open and transparent about how the items entered the collection, engaging with the Ethiopian embassy and the broader diaspora community, and offering the items on a long-term loan. If not decolonising the museum, the display was cognisant of the colonial context of the collection and its meaning for African-heritage communities. Adamant that the restitution case remained outstanding, the Ethiopian government said they could not accede to a long-term loan, as that would signal a legal acceptance of UK ownership. \u201cEthiopia\u2019s demand has always been the restoration of those illegally looted treasures. Not to borrow them,\u201d responded Ephrem Amare, the Ethiopian National Museum director. That position was reaffirmed in March 2019 when the Ethiopian culture minister, Dr Hirut Kassaw, visited the V&amp;A display. For the Ethiopian government, the collection was not simply an array of interesting design artefacts, but essential to the country rediscovering its history and charting a new way forward. Kassaw\u2019s trip to London included a successful visit to the National Army Museum, where she oversaw the return of two lockets of hair cut from the scalp of Tewodros in 1868 and now set to be reinterred with his remains. Alongside the understandable official position, the Ethiopian ambassador Hailemichael Aberra Afework expressed satisfaction \u201cwith the new partnership between Ethiopia and the V&amp;A\u201d, expressing optimism about \u201cfuture co-operation\u201d on \u201cthe care and maintenance of cultural heritage, in which the V&amp;A has extensive experience\u201d. Productive conversations have since been held about a framework for co-operation \u2013 together with the British Library and British Museum - and we are working towards having the Maqdala treasures on show in Addis Ababa. The V&amp;A\u2019s Maqdala experience highlighted the tensions facing national museums when it comes to restitution debates. Under the National Heritage Act 1983, the trustees of the V&amp;A are specifically prevented from de-accessioning objects that are the property of the museum, unless they are exact replicas or damaged beyond repair. This remit was specifically enjoined to prevent the dispersal of \u201cunfashionable\u201d items from the collections (or, indeed, fundraising through the sale of valuable works), which later generations might have lamented. But legislation is only part of the issue. I also feel we need to tread carefully along a path of total restitution, dictated by a political timetable. There remains something essentially valuable about the ability of museums to position objects beyond particular cultural or ethnic identities, curate them within a broader intellectual or aesthetic lineage, and situate them within a wider, richer framework of relationships while allowing free and open access, physically and digitally. For a museum like the V&amp;A, to decolonise is to decontextualise: the history of empire is embedded in its meaning and collections, and the question is how that is interpreted. A more nuanced understanding of empire is needed than the politically driven pathways of Good or Bad. For alongside colonial violence, empire was also a story of cosmopolitanism and hybridity: through trade, religion, war and force, peoples and cultures mixed and, in many cases, expressed that exchange and interaction through the type of material culture now found in museums. That was the case for the Roman, Ottoman, Ming, Ashanti, Habsburg and, yes, British empires. Today, power, wealth and art are being accumulated in the coming empires \u2013 informal and formal \u2013 of modern China and the Gulf states. Perhaps the real challenge is how we create more, rather than fewer, universal museums \u2013 not in Europe and the west, but across Africa, India and the global south. Our aim should be to detach the universal, encyclopaedic museum from its colonial preconditions and reimagine it as a new medium for multicultural understanding. Calls for \u201cdecolonisation\u201d, restitution and diversity look set to grow. Maqdala 1868 was a small step forward. So too our work on African heritage tours of the museum collections, research into the slave-owning wealth of early V&amp;A benefactors, programming and exhibitions consciously focused on promoting diversity, sustained attempts to widen the talent pool of curatorial and conservation staff. About 47% of schoolchildren who visited the V&amp;A in 2017-18 were from BAME backgrounds; clear progress has been made. However, the truth is that museum leaders must engage with this agenda and work on programmes of tangible change involving collections and curators, which can include the option of repatriation, in different forms, based on the history of each object. As Sabyasachi Mukherjee, director general of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya in Mumbai, says: \u201cMuseums must recognise that unresolved repatriation and restitution disputes can, in the absence of serious efforts at conciliation, paralyse the sharing of significant cultural objects\u2026 institutional narratives or legal doctrines [must] not come in the way of celebrating a world culture.\u201d If that is ignored, the momentum will pass into the hands of politicians \u2013 and in a two-minute-33-second speech, the complex, layered meaning of an object could be lost for ever to the reductive expediency of a passing agenda. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 July 2019 to correct the Brooklyn Museum title from chief curator of the African collection to consulting curator of African art.",

      "bodyText": "Thank you all for your company this evening. It\u2019s time for me to log off for the night and savour another salvo of Mitchell Starc\u2019s missiles. Remember, you can follow all that action via the link below. I\u2019ll catch you again here soon. Women\u2019s World Cup 2019: If that wasn\u2019t enough live sport to digest of a Saturday evening, why not gorge yourself some more with a World Cup quarter-final liveblog? Yeah, it started raining again during the final quarter so that goal blitz of the third term pretty much settled the contest. For the Bulldogs it means only a second ever win at Adelaide Oval and lifts them one win outside the eight. For Port Adelaide it\u2019s a massive comedown after such a stirring victory over Geelong last time out. Credit to anyone who turned up and sat through two hours of relentless sheeting rain. Do you own this as well? Collingwood have finally been put out of their misery on a wretched night at Marvel Stadium. Beaten all over the ground by a resurgent North Melbourne, the Pies lost two players to first-half injuries and now face the prospect of a treacherous month of footy undermanned and out of form. The Kangaroos were not flattered by the scoreboard and the dramatic impact of Rhyce Shaw shows no sign of abating. The Roos are now just a game outside the eight. The worst sort is the best sort. Mr Stewart is always welcome at any party of mine. Cricket: Never mind the calamities befalling other nations, Australia are in action from 10.30pm in a top-of-the-table clash against New Zealand. Of course there\u2019s a live OBO to chart this trans-Tasman tete-a-tete and Geoff Lemon is already on deck setting the scene. Cricket: Afghanistan are now 134-5 against Pakistan, which in context means the prospect of England somehow outdoing themselves in terms of World Cup humiliations remains very much on. AFL: 3QT: Port Adelaide 5.8 (38) v 8.3 (51) Western Bulldogs - Conditions have improved somewhat since half-time which has led to improved ball movement and heavier scoring at Adelaide Oval. The Doggies still have their noses in front though despite Port Adelaide dominating the inside-50 count. Back to songs about footballers, this is a belter from 1970. Quite the turnaround up in Darwin and it ends with Parramatta sneaking into a playoff spot despite finding themselves down by 16 points after half-an-hour. Canberra looked destined for second spot on the ladder but were unable to respond to a four-try blitz in 29 minutes either side of half-time. It\u2019s the first time the Eels have won consecutive matches since round two. You can imagine the look on Ricky Stuart\u2019s face. AFL: 3QT: Collingwood 4.4 (28) v 8.14 (62) North Melbourne - This is turning into a filthy night for the Pies. They\u2019ve played listlessly, lost two starters to injury, and now they\u2019re finally being punished on the scoreboard. Geelong look set to end the round with their two-game buffer at the top of the ladder restored. Tennis: Before the footy forces me to stop getting distracted by Wimbledon, I want to share this entertaining listicle of All England Club curios. NRL: 64 mins: Eels 18-16 Raiders - Would you believe it? From 0-16 down after half-an-hour, Parramatta have stormed into the lead at TIO Stadium. Tennis: The women\u2019s singles has also thrown up an amazing draw with the youngest player in the field facing the oldest in the opening round. Tennis: Wimbledon begins in a matter of hours and it promises to be the most interesting in over a decade for Australian tennis fans with Ash Barty heading to SW19 the no.1 seed in the women\u2019s singles. The French Open champion sat down with Kevin Mitchell recently to share the story of her extraordinary rise to the top. \u201cThe most important thing is all the people around me I trust,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are genuine, real human beings. So, besides the tennis, we have relationships off the court first and foremost \u2013 and then the tennis comes second. Every single member of my team is like family to me.\u201d I clicked on that link and immediately made the of noise a satisfied house cat. This is exactly the content I logged on for. AFL: More bad news for the Pies. They\u2019re down to two on the bench for the second half. AFL: HT: Port Adelaide 2.5 (17) v 5.2 (32) Western Bulldogs - When I picture Adelaide Oval in my mind I see warm South Australian sunlight glinting off the lettering on the Chappell Stand, hazy wide shots of a sleepy cathedral spire, and a batsman - any batsman / all batsmen - accumulating runs in short sleeves. Tonight could not be further from that summertime fantasy. Somewhere amongst the deluge a game of footy is taking place, and the Bulldogs are winning it. Cricket: And if riffing on England\u2019s pain is your weekend pick-me-up, Barney Ronay is also in fine form. What system is being exemplified here? What message would it send out if England were to become world champions? Neglect the grassroots. Retreat from state schools and inner cities. Give up on the poor. Hurl the carved wooden chairs into the fire, gurgle down the last of the claret from the cellar. Enrich yourself, while making the one thing you have to give invisible. And yes, you still get to win the World Cup. Cricket: If you only do one thing this weekend set aside ten minutes in a comfy chair and luxuriate in this wonderful piece of writing by Geoff Lemon on the glory that is Mitchell Starc dismissing Ben Stokes in the Cricket World Cup. Starc is long and lean, a figure stretched out like a Quentin Blake drawing. He lopes to the crease before slinging his arm over with what seems complete ease. Often the ball curves through the air. It may not need to pitch, with plenty of Starc full tosses swerving past a groping shot to strike halfway up a stump. In the 2015 World Cup he bowled a dozen batsmen, including New Zealand\u2019s captain to seal the final. The summer afterwards he warmed up with half a dozen matches up in the 50-over domestic competition for 26 wickets, 17 of them bowled. AFL: HT: Collingwood 3.3 (21) v 4.8 (32) North Melbourne - The Pies still haven\u2019t got their heads properly in this contest but the Roos remain unable to put them to the sword. Despite almost 70% game time in attacking territory and dominating inside-50s 33-16, North Melbourne only have a modest lead at the main break. NRL: HT: Eels 12-16 Raiders - That was a half of two halves up in Darwin with Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad, Jack Wighton, and Sebastian Kris all crossing early to put Canberra on course for second spot on the NRL ladder but tries to Manu Ma\u2019u and Blake Ferguson in the shadow of half-time have set up the second term beautifully. AFL: Bad news for Collingwood. AFL: QT: Port Adelaide 1.2 (8) v 3.2 (20) Western Bulldogs To continue the theme, Port Adelaide could do with Noah stopping by the city of churches to round up a couple of pedigree Bulldogs because the visitors are building a handy lead in the first quarter. The extravagantly talented Marcus Bontempelli needs pairing up at the very least, he already has 12 disposals, ten of them contested, not to mention a game-high four tackles. Cricket World Cup: If you\u2019re in the Anyone But England camp you can raise a wry smile because Pakistan have just snagged two quick Afghanistan wickets at Headingley. Follow all that in detail here: AFL: QT: Collingwood 1.3 (9) v 2.7 (19) North Melbourne - Not the start Collingwood fans were hoping for against the Kangaroos but it could have been much worse had North kicked straight in that opening quarter. Ben Brown in particular was guilty of some poor finishing with a ten point margin scant reward for double the Pies\u2019 total of inside-50s. AFL: Q1: 15 mins remaining: Port Adelaide 1.1 (7) v 0.1 (1) Western Bulldogs - And while we\u2019re zipping around the grounds a quick check on the situation at Adelaide Oval where it is absolutely bucketing it down. The rain is so fat in the floodlights it looks like golf balls firing out of a driving range bucket-filling machine. Do not hold your breath for a skills clinic. NRL: 5 mins: Eels 0-6 Raiders - Our first stopover at TIO Stadium in Darwin is to report an early score for the Raiders. Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad has already crossed for the Canberrans as they search for the two points that will likely send them second on the NRL ladder. Netball: Australia\u2019s Diamonds were farewelled at a lunch in Sydney earlier this week before flying to the UK for the 2019 World Cup. Meanwhile, arch rivals New Zealand wound up their preparations with a loss to the New Zealand men\u2019s team in the final of a four-team tournament in Auckland. In netball\u2019s version of the battle of the sexes, the men pulled clear in the second half to prevail 66-54, two days after they\u2019d won their first meeting 54-50. The tournament gave coach Noeline Taurua\u2019s team the tough workout she was after, with the Silver Ferns having success in games against Fiji and a Kiwi All Stars side. The two men\u2019s matches were challenging, against opponents who were bigger and more athletic than the leading women. Maria Folau landed 40 from 43 shots in what was potentially her last big game on New Zealand soil. Veteran shooter Folau, captain Laura Langman and former skipper Casey Kopua are all likely to retire following next month\u2019s World Cup in Liverpool. New Zealand and Australia have contested the last five World Cup finals, with the Diamonds winning four of them. However, the Silver Ferns\u2019 recent struggles have dropped them to fourth in the world rankings, behind Australia, Commonwealth Games champions England and Jamaica. With AAP. Cricket World Cup: The first of the day\u2019s two matches is underway with Pakistan aiming to ramp up the pressure on England when they take on Afghanistan at what is sure to be a partisan Headingley. Follow all the action on the dedicated liveblog right here: AFL: Collingwood v North Melbourne is underway at Marvel Stadium with the Magpies bidding to keep pace with Geelong at the top of the ladder. The Cats\u2019 hard-fought victory over the Crows last night sent them two games clear in top spot but the Pies can bring that back to one with a result tonight. Collingwood begin the night level on points with West Coast after the Eagles secured a stunning late victory over Hawthorn at the MCG earlier in the day. The Hawks were ahead for a large chunk of the final quarter but a Jamie Cripps goal with just 69 seconds remaining sealed the deal for the premiers. The Crusaders have done it - again - holding off a spirited fightback from the Hurricanes in a superb exhibition of Super Rugby in Canterbury. The dominant force in Super Rugby are through to their 14th final and will be hot favourites to defend their title on home soil against the Jaguares. The scoreline looks comfortable for the hosts but Newcastle made heavy weather of seeing off Brisbane at McDonald Jones Stadium. An 18-point half-time lead looked to have the game sewn up but a James Gavet sin-binning and a couple of Broncos tries put the game in the balance late on before Mason Lino put the result beyond doubt. A few fisticuffs at the final siren livened up the home crowd as the Knights returned to fifth spot on the ladder. The Broncos remain two wins outside the playoffs. Sydney\u2019s slim finals hopes remain alive after they ground out a victory over Gold Coast at the SCG. After an even opening couple of quarters the Swans broke clear in the third and never looked like relinquishing control. Super Rugby: 70 mins: Crusaders 27-26 Hurricanes - The second semi-final in this year\u2019s Super Rugby is destined to go down as one of the all-time great club matches. The two Kiwi heavyweights have traded blows all night long in Christchurch, scoring some thrilling tries along the way - and it isn\u2019t over yet. Edge of the seat stuff for the right to host the Jaguares in the decider. Good evening everybody and welcome to Saturday sportwatch. It\u2019s a feast of footy tonight headlined by the AFL. We\u2019ll wrap up Sydney v Gold Coast shortly before Collingwood take on North Melbourne from 7.25pm and Port Adelaide host Western Bulldogs at 7.40pm. Over in the NRL we\u2019ll tick off the Knights v Broncos then switch our attention to a pair of finals contenders when the Raiders visit the Eels around 7.35pm. In amongst all that we\u2019ve got some scintillating Super Rugby semi-final action to get our heads around as well all the latest from the Cricket World Cup, including build-up to Australia v New Zealand at 10.30pm Then there\u2019s F1, Wimbledon, the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup and whatever else catches your eye over the course of the night.

Plenty of women are already being digitally inserted into <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ai-can-now-create-fake-porn-making-revenge-porn-even-more-complicated-92267\">porn photos or videos without their consent</a> \u2013 a problem we\u2019re not talking about nearly enough.</p> <p>\u201cThe harm done to women when it comes to this kind of sexual objectification is happening now,\u201d Mary Anne Franks, president of the <a href=\"https://www.cybercivilrights.org/\">Cyber Civil Rights Initiative</a>, told the Huffington Post <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/deepfake-porn-heres-what-its-like-to-see-yourself_n_5d0d0faee4b0a3941861fced\">earlier this year</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like people have forgotten that this is what this technology really started out as, and the conversation around women has fallen away.\u201d</p> <p>In recent months there\u2019s been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/23/what-do-we-do-about-deepfake-video-ai-facebook\">increasing concern about </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/23/what-do-we-do-about-deepfake-video-ai-facebook\">\u201cdeepfake</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/23/what-do-we-do-about-deepfake-video-ai-facebook\">\u201d technology</a>, which allows people to produce realistic-seeming photos or video content. But, as Franks noted, a lot of this discussion has revolved around the implications for politicians and powerful people. It ignores the fact that the motivation behind a lot of this tech is to control and humiliate women. DeepNude, for example, didn\u2019t let you undress dudes; the app was specifically focused on women. When Vice tried to use it on a man it apparently \u201creplaced his pants with a vulva\u201d.</p> <p>If you become the victim of a deepfake there\u2019s very little you can do; our laws simply haven\u2019t caught up to the technology. It\u2019s also basically impossible to protect yourself from becoming the subject of a deepfake. As Franks told the Huffington Post: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can really do to protect yourself except not exist online.\u201d</p> <p>The internet can be an incredibly toxic place for women. <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/03/online-violence-against-women-chapter-3/\">According to Amnesty International,</a> 29% of American women have experienced threats of physical or sexual violence online. <a href=\"https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/crowdsourced-twitter-study-reveals-shocking-scale-of-online-abuse-against-women/\">Amnesty International also found</a> that an abusive or problematic tweet is sent to a woman every 30 seconds, on average, with black women being 84% more likely than white women to be mentioned in abusive tweets. Social media platforms have done very little curb to their abuse problem \u2013 leading women to <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/03/online-violence-against-women-chapter-5/\">censor themselves online</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/ive-left-twitter-unusable-anyone-but-trolls-robots-dictators-lindy-west\">leave social media altogether</a>. The rise of deepfake technology is going to make the internet exponentially more difficult for women. Unless we start taking online misogyny seriously, we are going to face a future where women may not be able to exist online.</p> <h2>Alabama is waging a full on war against women</h2> <p>Marshae Jones, a 27-year-old Alabama woman, was shot in the stomach last year; she lost her five-month-old fetus as a result.

Or rather, there was an app for that: the creators of the horrifying program took it down on Thursday after a Vice article about DeepNude catalyzed widespread outrage. \u201cWe created this project for user\u2019s entertainment a few months ago,\u201d the app\u2019s creators tweeted. \u201cWe never thought it would become viral and we would not be able to control the traffic.

      "bodyText": "More than three months after New South Wales Labor\u2019s bruising state election defeat, the party has regrouped to appoint Jodi McKay its new opposition leader. State Labor MPs cast their secret votes for the contenders Chris Minns and Jodi McKay, both from the party\u2019s right faction, at a tense meeting on Saturday. McKay secured 29 votes in the caucus room to Minns\u2019 21 votes. She also won 63% of the vote of 11,000 rank-and-file members. Tensions boiled over as MPs cast their votes, amid reports of a row between two members at the count. It\u2019s the first time the NSW party has elected a leader using the rules former prime minister Kevin Rudd introduced at the federal level in 2013. The Liberal premier, Gladys Berejiklian, retained power at the NSW election in March, after which the opposition leader Michael Daley stood down. The state\u2019s Labor leadership contest was delayed because of the federal election in May, but had been slowly bubbling away for the past month. McKay, 49, is a former journalist and Newcastle MP, who served as a junior minister in the Rees and Keneally governments before losing at the landslide 2011 election that swept Labor from power after 16 years in government. She returned to parliament in 2015 as the MP for the Sydney suburb of Strathfield after an Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry into illegal donations found she had been the victim of a campaign to defeat her. McKay hopes that reputation will help restore trust in the Labor brand and that her upbringing in Gloucester in the Hunter Valley can help reconnect the party with regional voters. She had been serving as the opposition spokeswoman for transport. McKay is the third leader NSW Labor has had in a year, following Daley who took over after Luke Foley resigned last November over allegations that he had sexually harassed a journalist. Labor MPs are expected to meet again on Tuesday to vote on other leadership roles, including deputy leader. Jostling for front bench positions is also underway.",

For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/northern-hemispheres-extreme-heatwave-in-2018-impossible-without-climate-change\">could not have occurred without human-induced climate change</a>\u201d. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was <a href=\"https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/resources/angry-summer-report/\">made at least 50 times more likely by global heating</a>, linking it directly to climate change.</p>\n    <p>Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/27/climate-change-human-fingerprint-found-on-global-extreme-weather\">strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves</a> (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.</p>\n    <p>When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Most of the planet\u2019s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/another-unprecedented-tropical-cyclone-and-flooding-hits-mozambique\">Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique</a> in March and April. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/global-warming-made-hurricane-harvey-deadly-rains-three-times-more-likely-research-shows\">three times more likely by climate change</a>. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage.</p>\n    <p>Global heating does not influence all extreme weather \u2013 natural variability still exists. <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world\">Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies</a> and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. It is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Management at Lord\u2019s cricket ground were also encouraging attendees to turn up with suncream, a hat and a water bottle for the Cricket World Cup match between Australia and New Zealand.</p> \n<p>Western and north-western parts of the UK were forecast to be cooler and cloudier than in recent days \u2013 with temperatures likely to be around 22C on average.

Bertens had put together a strong run on clay and was fancied to go all the way.

      "bodyText": "Women Ashleigh Barty The popular Australian has not rested on her laurels after her major breakthrough triumph at the French Open. Barty has made a seamless switch from clay to grass, rising to No 1 in the rankings for the first time in her career after victory over Julia G\u00f6rges in the final of the Birmingham Classic. Wily and inventive, the 23-year-old has an intriguing game and has not allowed her lack of height to stop her developing one of the most dangerous serves around. She has the tools to do some damage on grass. Naomi Osaka The world No 2 has fallen behind Barty after a recent wobble. A hand injury disrupted her preparations for the French Open, where she survived a couple of scares before losing in the third round, and she says she is still unsure of her footing on grass. Osaka has never made it past the first week at Wimbledon and she struggled in Birmingham. Yet she has a big enough game to frighten the very best at SW19. Karolina Pliskova The Czech continues to frustrate. She was tipped to go far at the French Open but she went out in the third round after a limp defeat to Petra Martic. She has suffered more since then, losing to her twin Kristyna in the fourth round in Birmingham, and heads to Wimbledon carrying a few bruises. Her big serve commands respect, but otherwise there are few signs the world No 3 is rounded enough to end her wait for a first grand slam. Kiki Bertens The world No 4 experienced disappointment at the French Open when she was forced to retire from her second-round match because of illness. Bertens had put together a strong run on clay and was fancied to go all the way. Yet she got back on track in \u2019s-Hertogenbosch, falling just short against the awkward Alison Riske in the final, and is not to be underestimated at Wimbledon after reaching the quarter-finals in 2018. Angelique Kerber With Petra Kvitova struggling to recover from the arm injury that forced her to miss the French Open and Serena Williams short of fitness after a troubled year, the field looks as open as ever. But before assuming the unpredictability will play into Kerber\u2019s hands, it is worth remembering that the German sometimes struggles to handle pressure. All the same, the former world No 1 reached the final in 2016, losing to the American, and beat Williams in the final last year. Men Novak Djokovic The world No 1 went into the French Open bidding to become the first man to hold all four grand slams on two separate occasions, only to lose to Dominic Thiem in the semi-finals. Perhaps a few chinks are appearing in Djokovic\u2019s armour again. His form has been patchy since the Australian Open. But while the 32-year-old has not played any warm-up tournaments on grass, a fifth Wimbledon title beckons if he is physically and mentally ready. Rafael Nadal Fresh from winning his 12th French Open title, the Spaniard moves off his favoured clay and on to a more testing surface, hoping to move one behind Roger Federer\u2019s record of 20 majors. The stakes are high and although Nadal has not triumphed at Wimbledon since 2010, he was unfortunate to lose to Djokovic in the semis last year.

If lots of people really love something, then that\u2019s great. If really good things get missed, then readers will find them eventually, because readers are indefatigable when it comes to the good. The writers I tend to remind people about, because I know the pleasure they\u2019ll get if they haven\u2019t yet read them, are the great Paul Bailey, the 1930s German writer Irmgard Keun, the new young Scottish writer Helen McClory and the mighty Helen Oyeyemi.</p> <p><strong>The book that changed my mind</strong><br>It\u2019s not that it changed my mind, but that it freed my mind \u2013 Alasdair Gray\u2019s <em>1982, Janine</em>.

I bought it and read it and knew then that fiction could do anything.</p> <p><strong>The last book that made me cry</strong><br>Lorenza Mazzetti\u2019s <em>London Diaries</em>, her memoir of coming to London from Italy in the chaos and brokenness of the years after the second world war, how she met both casual cruelty and unexpected kindnesses, and how a smattering of luck, bravado and good friendship forged the film-maker and artist she became. It transmits the terrible fracture and surreality of aftermath as only a real admirer of Kafka could.</p> <p><strong>The last book that made me laugh</strong><br>Nicola Barker\u2019s <em>I Am Sovereign</em>, out next month. It\u2019s about someone selling a house, and it\u2019s about the human being as a home for the soul.

The writers I tend to remind people about, because I know the pleasure they\u2019ll get if they haven\u2019t yet read them, are the great Paul Bailey, the 1930s German writer Irmgard Keun, the new young Scottish writer Helen McClory and the mighty Helen Oyeyemi. The book that changed my mind It\u2019s not that it changed my mind, but that it freed my mind \u2013 Alasdair Gray\u2019s 1982, Janine. I was 19 or 20 when I heard him read from this. I bought it and read it and knew then that fiction could do anything. The last book that made me cry Lorenza Mazzetti\u2019s London Diaries, her memoir of coming to London from Italy in the chaos and brokenness of the years after the second world war, how she met both casual cruelty and unexpected kindnesses, and how a smattering of luck, bravado and good friendship forged the film-maker and artist she became. It transmits the terrible fracture and surreality of aftermath as only a real admirer of Kafka could. The last book that made me laugh Nicola Barker\u2019s I Am Sovereign, out next month. It\u2019s about someone selling a house, and it\u2019s about the human being as a home for the soul. It\u2019s one of the funniest, most finely achieved comic novels, even by her own standard, and I think it\u2019s a masterpiece. My earliest reading memory The Beatles\u2019 45 double A side \u201cShe\u2019s a Woman\u201d / \u201cI Feel Fine\u201d. I was quite small. I worked out the word \u201cBeatles\u201d, then \u201cthe\u201d, and then because I knew the songs I worked out which words were which. My comfort reading Anything/everything by Muriel Spark. She discomfits us with such pleasure, such merriment, then returns us, via this merry intelligence, to a place where we can take real comfort in things. The book I most often give as a gift Italo Calvino\u2019s Six Memos for the Next Millennium. I think it\u2019s one of the best books about writing ever written. The book I\u2019d most like to be remembered for I\u2019m quite happy to be forgotten, thank you. But the book I\u2019m happiest to have written so far is a novel called There But for The. \u2022 Spring by Ali Smith is published by Hamish Hamilton.

How has it come to this for the most successful club of the game\u2019s summer era?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/28/warrington-st-helens-super-league-match-report\">St Helens extend lead at top with comeback to win at Warrington</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The similarities between the Rhinos of today and that relegated United side are startling, and they begin at the top. After Matt Busby\u2019s 24-year reign as manager ended in 1969, United went through four managers in the years leading to relegation. Leeds, coached by only three men throughout their golden era, have had more head coaches than that in the past year alone, culminating in Agar\u2019s appointment following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/07/leeds-rhinos-sack-coach-david-furner-after-dismal-start-to-season-rugby-league\" title=\"\">the dismissal of Dave Furner earlier this year.</a></p> <p>A high turnover of players, coupled with below-par recruitment, has also contributed to Leeds\u2019 decline. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been good enough since Kevin Sinfield and Jamie Peacock left after the treble success of 2015,\u201d says Peter Smith, the <em>Yorkshire Evening Post</em>\u2019s rugby league correspondent for almost two decades. \u201cWhile their rivals have strengthened, Leeds have relied on project signings and youngsters with limited success. The 2017 Grand Final papered over the cracks.\u201d</p> <p>Sinfield now heads up Leeds\u2019s rugby operation, having returned last year, but it is the players who have left Leeds, as well as the ones who have arrived, that make their predicament all the more painful.</p> <p>The Rhinos dropped to the bottom of the table after Hull KR\u2019s victory against Hull FC. That winning Rovers team included three players who won the Grand Final with Leeds two years ago, including Matt Parcell, the hooker who scored the winning try on Thursday having been allowed to leave Leeds on loan 48 hours earlier. </p> <p>The Parcell move is part of a desperate attempt by Leeds to yet again refresh their squad. A cash\u2011plus-player deal has led to the arrival of Robert Lui from Salford, while Shaun Lunt, a Grand Final winner with Leeds in 2012, has swapped clubs with Parcell. Both will make their debuts on Sunday against Catalans. That Lui will wear the No 40 shirt underlines the lack of consistency at a once-dominant club. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job to do but I can\u2019t do it by myself: it\u2019s going to take the whole team,\u201d says Lui.</p> <p>Fortunately for Leeds, perhaps, the bottom seven teams are split by only six points, making any sort of upturn in form in the final 10 weeks enough to secure survival.</p> <p>Leeds\u2019 problems are, however, far more deep-rooted. The England coach, Wayne Bennett, an RFL employee, inexplicably turned up at a Rhinos training session last week to offer guidance. That has caused friction among the sides in the relegation dog fight.</p> <p>Of course, it was said in 1974 that relegation was the best thing to happen to United, a catalyst for brighter times.</p> <p>Nonetheless Rhinos supporters will certainly hope they are not wishing for the same outcome in 10 games\u2019 time.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1974 Manchester United \u2013 six years on from winning the European Cup \u2013 were said to be too good to go down, a statement of hubris that turned out to be wildly wrongheaded. Folk from Leeds and Manchester are not too fond of being compared but 45 years on, across the other side of the Pennines, another sporting dynasty is likewise in grave danger of enduring the unthinkable. Leeds Rhinos, Super League champions eight times in 14 seasons between 2004 and 2017, are bottom of the table with 10 games remaining and at serious risk of relegation. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a 10\u2011game shootout with a number of other teams,\u201d admits their interim coach, Richard Agar. How has it come to this for the most successful club of the game\u2019s summer era? The similarities between the Rhinos of today and that relegated United side are startling, and they begin at the top. After Matt Busby\u2019s 24-year reign as manager ended in 1969, United went through four managers in the years leading to relegation. Leeds, coached by only three men throughout their golden era, have had more head coaches than that in the past year alone, culminating in Agar\u2019s appointment following the dismissal of Dave Furner earlier this year. A high turnover of players, coupled with below-par recruitment, has also contributed to Leeds\u2019 decline. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been good enough since Kevin Sinfield and Jamie Peacock left after the treble success of 2015,\u201d says Peter Smith, the Yorkshire Evening Post\u2019s rugby league correspondent for almost two decades. \u201cWhile their rivals have strengthened, Leeds have relied on project signings and youngsters with limited success. The 2017 Grand Final papered over the cracks.\u201d Sinfield now heads up Leeds\u2019s rugby operation, having returned last year, but it is the players who have left Leeds, as well as the ones who have arrived, that make their predicament all the more painful. The Rhinos dropped to the bottom of the table after Hull KR\u2019s victory against Hull FC. That winning Rovers team included three players who won the Grand Final with Leeds two years ago, including Matt Parcell, the hooker who scored the winning try on Thursday having been allowed to leave Leeds on loan 48 hours earlier. The Parcell move is part of a desperate attempt by Leeds to yet again refresh their squad. A cash\u2011plus-player deal has led to the arrival of Robert Lui from Salford, while Shaun Lunt, a Grand Final winner with Leeds in 2012, has swapped clubs with Parcell. Both will make their debuts on Sunday against Catalans. That Lui will wear the No 40 shirt underlines the lack of consistency at a once-dominant club. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job to do but I can\u2019t do it by myself: it\u2019s going to take the whole team,\u201d says Lui. Fortunately for Leeds, perhaps, the bottom seven teams are split by only six points, making any sort of upturn in form in the final 10 weeks enough to secure survival. Leeds\u2019 problems are, however, far more deep-rooted. The England coach, Wayne Bennett, an RFL employee, inexplicably turned up at a Rhinos training session last week to offer guidance. That has caused friction among the sides in the relegation dog fight. Of course, it was said in 1974 that relegation was the best thing to happen to United, a catalyst for brighter times. Nonetheless Rhinos supporters will certainly hope they are not wishing for the same outcome in 10 games\u2019 time.",

A crowd of 10- to 18-year-olds, members of <a href=\"https://wno.org.uk/take-part/youth-opera\" title=\"\">WNO\u2019s terrific youth opera</a>, performed the short, exuberant work with two different casts in three performances. Directed by David Pountney, it is his last new production as artistic director of WNO, which he leaves at the end of August. Moreover, and poignantly, <em>Brundib\u00e1r</em> was the final piece written by the Jewish Czech composer Hans Kr\u00e1sa before his arrest by the Nazis.</p> <p>Kr\u00e1sa was sent to Theresienstadt (Terez\u00edn), the transit camp-ghetto north of Prague. Between 1943 and 1944 the opera was given some 55 performances there. Photos and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXvFKAtTa_k\">footage of the production</a>, used in a propaganda film, have survived. We know the faces of those children. Most of them, and Kr\u00e1sa too, were murdered in Auschwitz in 1944. Those are the bare facts. There are many stories within stories of friendships, farewells, miraculous escapes of those first performers.

In the Sunday matinee performance I attended, the assured soloists included Alfie Jones, Manon Thomas, Megan Jones, Gracie Jones and many more promising young stars. The adult ensemble of 14 musicians, a ramshackle mix (matching Kr\u00e1sa\u2019s players in Terezin) of strings, trumpet, flute, clarinet, accordion, guitar, piano and percussion, played with idiomatic charm: now jazzy, now with sweet-sour echoes of Kurt Weill and folk and klezmer.</p> <p>All this would be overwhelming enough.

After the performance, Hanus spoke briefly of his tears on opening the score of <em>Brundib\u00e1r</em>, acknowledging that but for a chance circumstance he would not be here.

      "bodyText": "In the winter of 1852 a man called Mr Crumpet returned to his modest home in Brixton, south London, after visiting a Marlborough House exhibition on the principles of good taste and found he had been shaken to his core. \u201cI was ashamed of the pattern of my own trowsers for I saw a piece of them hung up there as a horror,\u201d he exclaimed. Having then made a pot of tea to steady himself, Mr Crumpet noticed with pain the butterfly painted on the teacup he held to his lips. For he now knew that such embellishments, copied from the natural world, were also the height of bad taste. Mr Crumpet, of course, never actually existed. He was created by the writer Henry Morley in a piece commissioned by Charles Dickens to run in the December edition of the magazine Household Words. Dickens, the editor, was full of scorn for an exhibition which he felt sneered at the tastes of the common man. But for the cultural historian Sir Christopher Frayling, this provocative show about domestic tastes was a landmark in changing national attitudes \u2013 and especially the section of it the newspapers dubbed the \u201cchamber of horrors\u201d. Frayling is givinga talk about the show\u2019s curator, Henry Cole, and what he called his \u201cgallery of false principles\u201d.

Flocks of them often gather in the nearby fields, feeding among Jerseys and Holsteins. They look as if they are quite at home on this side of the Channel \u2013 which nowadays they are.</p> <p>These small white herons, adorned with their orange breeding-plumes, are just one of several species of waterbird to have colonised southern Britain in the past decade or so, as a result of the climate crisis. These include the little egret, which has bred here since the mid-90s, and the great white egret, which first nested on the Avalon Marshes less than a decade ago.</p> <p>Egrets are hard to ignore: even people who have little or no interest in birds are beginning to notice these elegant white birds in our midst. But meanwhile, a whole suite of wild creatures is colonising Britain by stealth; sometimes passing under the radar until they have established thriving populations here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d2f907f087cf2ae5a9889c868b599d414f83751\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d2f907f087cf2ae5a9889c868b599d414f83751/636_234_2696_1618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The beewolf, a wasp that hunts bees, is thriving in brownfield sites.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>The beewolf, a wasp that hunts bees, is thriving in brownfield sites.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Atkinson/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the past decade or so, many species of insect from continental Europe have gained a grip in southern Britain. Other species, which have been here for much longer, are now rapidly extending their ranges northwards \u2013 again driven by temperature rises. The latter group includes two species of cricket: Roesel\u2019s bush-cricket and the long-winged conehead cricket. Roesel\u2019s bush-cricket was once a rare and sought-after species, confined to salt marshes in the south and east, but is now spreading north and west into a whole range of new habitats.</p> <p>Another fascinating insect on the move is the beewolf. This solitary wasp is an ambush killer \u2013 the insect equivalent of a leopard. The female lies in wait, then pounces on a passing bee, which she drags down her metre-long nest-hole to feed her hungry young.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018If we fail to deal with the global climate emergency\u2026 only the most adaptable wild creatures will be able to survive\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many of these insects are flourishing in those marginal, temporary habitats we tend to ignore: what naturalist Richard Mabey dubbed the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/29/iain-sinclair-richard-mabey-rereading\" title=\"\">unofficial </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/29/iain-sinclair-richard-mabey-rereading\" title=\"\">countryside</a>\u201d, or, to give them their official name, brownfield sites.</p> <p>I\u2019m writing a book about these hidden havens for wildlife, and have spent the last couple of years travelling the country to discover what lives there, including three new damselfly species that have recently arrived in the UK.</p> <p>In a ditch alongside the salt marsh on Essex\u2019s Canvey Island, I watched scarce emerald damselflies, along with a mating pair of a larger and more obvious colonist, the southern migrant (or blue-eyed) hawker. This colourful dragonfly was unknown in the UK until the first decade of the 21st century, when it began to turn up at sites in Kent and Essex. My guide, dragonfly enthusiast Neil Phillips, was one of the first people to find the southern migrant hawker here, and has followed its progress ever since.</p> <p>Near the Thames at East Tilbury, we took a stroll along a public footpath next to a housing estate, where he spotted another recent arrival, the willow emerald. Later, I missed out on the third of this pioneering trio of damselflies, the southern emerald, which was reported from a small pool next to a landfill site near the M40 in Buckinghamshire.</p> <p>Had a sharp-eyed observer not found the southern emerald here, we would still not have realised that this bright green insect is spreading westwards so rapidly; until recently it had only been recorded in Essex and Kent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d0a3057dd244e8645843f06ccb185fecacac97d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d0a3057dd244e8645843f06ccb185fecacac97d/1883_1286_3338_2003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The small red-eyed damselfly was first seen in the UK in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>The small red-eyed damselfly was first seen <br> in the UK in 1999.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DenBoma/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Closer to home, on the Somerset Levels, I have recently seen two other dragons and damsels: the small red-eyed damselfly, and the scarce chaser dragonfly, whose females look like a giant, elongated wasp. The small red-eyed damselfly \u2013 with eyes like tiny cherry tomatoes \u2013 had not even been recorded in the UK until 1999. Yet since then, it has spread at a remarkable rate, and has reached Devon in the west and North Yorkshire in the north.</p> <p>Butterfly enthusiasts are also looking forward to some exciting new additions in the next few years. The strikingly attractive Queen of Spain fritillary has already bred on at least one occasion in Sussex, and may soon become a permanent addition to our butterfly fauna. Other potential colonists include the continental race of the swallowtail, our largest butterfly, and the smaller long-tailed blue, which, following a major influx in 2013, successfully bred at several sites in southern England.</p> <p>Many new kinds of moths are also crossing the Channel. During the past three decades, no fewer than 30 species have arrived, some managing to colonise. And one of my favourite creatures, the day-flying hummingbird hawk moth, is an increasingly regular sight in southern Britain, as it hovers by flowers to feed on nectar, just like its avian namesake.</p> <p>Naturalist and broadcaster Brett Westwood points out that for many species of insect the climate crisis provides a golden opportunity to expand their range northwards. \u201cJust look at it from their point of view: if you are mobile, and quick to respond to environmental change, you\u2019ll have the chance to do really well in the next few years.\u201d</p> <p>He cites butterflies such as the brown argus, whose caterpillars have adapted to feed on annual plants such as geraniums, as well as perennials, and have expanded their range as a result. And last year\u2019s long hot summer allowed common blue butterflies to produce a third brood in September, boosting their numbers; while the Duke of Burgundy \u2013 one of our rarest butterflies \u2013 is also managing to produce a second brood in warm summers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a82c2f3aea6bbf20d92aa338acbffcafdc33d77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a82c2f3aea6bbf20d92aa338acbffcafdc33d77/0_196_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mountain hares in some parts of the UK no longer have a white coat in winter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Mountain hares in some parts of the UK no longer have a white coat in winter.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: www.marekszczepanek.pl/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So ironically, the climate crisis may well benefit many insect species, at least in the short term. But we cannot afford to be complacent, for in the north of Britain, it\u2019s a very different story. One of our most specialised butterflies, the mountain ringlet, has over time adapted to life on the high peaks, in the Lake District and Scotland. But if the climate crisis permanently alters the nature of their specialist montane habitat, they will simply have nowhere to go.

      "bodyText": "Cattle egrets \u2013 birds once so exotic we rarely saw them north of the Mediterranean \u2013 are now nesting in a heronry near my home in Somerset. Flocks of them often gather in the nearby fields, feeding among Jerseys and Holsteins. They look as if they are quite at home on this side of the Channel \u2013 which nowadays they are. These small white herons, adorned with their orange breeding-plumes, are just one of several species of waterbird to have colonised southern Britain in the past decade or so, as a result of the climate crisis. These include the little egret, which has bred here since the mid-90s, and the great white egret, which first nested on the Avalon Marshes less than a decade ago. Egrets are hard to ignore: even people who have little or no interest in birds are beginning to notice these elegant white birds in our midst. But meanwhile, a whole suite of wild creatures is colonising Britain by stealth; sometimes passing under the radar until they have established thriving populations here. During the past decade or so, many species of insect from continental Europe have gained a grip in southern Britain. Other species, which have been here for much longer, are now rapidly extending their ranges northwards \u2013 again driven by temperature rises. The latter group includes two species of cricket: Roesel\u2019s bush-cricket and the long-winged conehead cricket. Roesel\u2019s bush-cricket was once a rare and sought-after species, confined to salt marshes in the south and east, but is now spreading north and west into a whole range of new habitats. Another fascinating insect on the move is the beewolf. This solitary wasp is an ambush killer \u2013 the insect equivalent of a leopard. The female lies in wait, then pounces on a passing bee, which she drags down her metre-long nest-hole to feed her hungry young. Many of these insects are flourishing in those marginal, temporary habitats we tend to ignore: what naturalist Richard Mabey dubbed the \u201cunofficial countryside\u201d, or, to give them their official name, brownfield sites. I\u2019m writing a book about these hidden havens for wildlife, and have spent the last couple of years travelling the country to discover what lives there, including three new damselfly species that have recently arrived in the UK. In a ditch alongside the salt marsh on Essex\u2019s Canvey Island, I watched scarce emerald damselflies, along with a mating pair of a larger and more obvious colonist, the southern migrant (or blue-eyed) hawker. This colourful dragonfly was unknown in the UK until the first decade of the 21st century, when it began to turn up at sites in Kent and Essex. My guide, dragonfly enthusiast Neil Phillips, was one of the first people to find the southern migrant hawker here, and has followed its progress ever since. Near the Thames at East Tilbury, we took a stroll along a public footpath next to a housing estate, where he spotted another recent arrival, the willow emerald. Later, I missed out on the third of this pioneering trio of damselflies, the southern emerald, which was reported from a small pool next to a landfill site near the M40 in Buckinghamshire. Had a sharp-eyed observer not found the southern emerald here, we would still not have realised that this bright green insect is spreading westwards so rapidly; until recently it had only been recorded in Essex and Kent. Closer to home, on the Somerset Levels, I have recently seen two other dragons and damsels: the small red-eyed damselfly, and the scarce chaser dragonfly, whose females look like a giant, elongated wasp. The small red-eyed damselfly \u2013 with eyes like tiny cherry tomatoes \u2013 had not even been recorded in the UK until 1999. Yet since then, it has spread at a remarkable rate, and has reached Devon in the west and North Yorkshire in the north. Butterfly enthusiasts are also looking forward to some exciting new additions in the next few years. The strikingly attractive Queen of Spain fritillary has already bred on at least one occasion in Sussex, and may soon become a permanent addition to our butterfly fauna. Other potential colonists include the continental race of the swallowtail, our largest butterfly, and the smaller long-tailed blue, which, following a major influx in 2013, successfully bred at several sites in southern England. Many new kinds of moths are also crossing the Channel. During the past three decades, no fewer than 30 species have arrived, some managing to colonise. And one of my favourite creatures, the day-flying hummingbird hawk moth, is an increasingly regular sight in southern Britain, as it hovers by flowers to feed on nectar, just like its avian namesake. Naturalist and broadcaster Brett Westwood points out that for many species of insect the climate crisis provides a golden opportunity to expand their range northwards. \u201cJust look at it from their point of view: if you are mobile, and quick to respond to environmental change, you\u2019ll have the chance to do really well in the next few years.\u201d He cites butterflies such as the brown argus, whose caterpillars have adapted to feed on annual plants such as geraniums, as well as perennials, and have expanded their range as a result. And last year\u2019s long hot summer allowed common blue butterflies to produce a third brood in September, boosting their numbers; while the Duke of Burgundy \u2013 one of our rarest butterflies \u2013 is also managing to produce a second brood in warm summers. So ironically, the climate crisis may well benefit many insect species, at least in the short term. But we cannot afford to be complacent, for in the north of Britain, it\u2019s a very different story. One of our most specialised butterflies, the mountain ringlet, has over time adapted to life on the high peaks, in the Lake District and Scotland. But if the climate crisis permanently alters the nature of their specialist montane habitat, they will simply have nowhere to go. The same is true of many species of Arctic-alpine plants, some of which are on the very southern edge of their range in the UK. Dwarf birch is a tundra specialist, which can be found on the high tops of the Scottish Highlands. Again, if encroaching vegetation changes its habitat, it will soon disappear, along with other montane species such as saxifrages. Some specialist creatures often associated with high altitudes may still be able to adapt. At first sight, the mountain hare appears to be a likely casualty of the climate crisis \u2013 yet in Ireland this species lives right down to sea level. However, in areas with little or no snow, such as the Peak District, mountain hares no longer turn white in winter. Could the same happen to the population in the Scottish Highlands? The irony is that, while many exciting new species of birds and insects are colonising southern Britain \u2013 where of course the majority of naturalists live \u2013 those under threat in the north are still just about managing to hang on. But unless we find ways to reduce temperature rises \u2013 and very soon \u2013 it may not be long before we reach a tipping point, when what scientist Peter Berthold called the honeymoon period will be over. If we fail to deal with the global climate emergency, and enter a world of runaway temperature rises, all bets will be off \u2013 and only the most adaptable wild creatures will be able to survive the devastating consequences.

      "body": "<p>With vegan food, fashion and makeup firmly established in the mainstream, more and more people are looking for ways to have an ethical, cruelty-free home, too. You may not have given much thought to what animal-based products crop up in your house, but there are many: fabrics, from silk to wool to sheepskin, are an obvious example \u2013 but is your mattress vegan? What goes into your cleaning products, or your energy provider? And is there such a thing as vegan loo roll?</p> <p>The fact is, you can take a vegan approach to choosing almost anything for your home \u2013 and it needn\u2019t be complicated or expensive. Next time you have to replace an item or redecorate a room, shop around for vegan options \u2013 you\u2019ll be surprised at what\u2019s available.</p> <p>Many people choose to go cruelty-free at home for compassionate reasons, but there\u2019s a compelling ecological argument, too. The environmental footprint of vegan products is dramatically smaller than that of those derived from animals; they also tend to use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/17/five-ways-to-make-your-home-less-toxic\">far fewer chemicals</a> in their production. (The leather used to make a sofa has to be heavily treated with resins and preservatives, for example. With a plant-based alternative, you\u2019ll avoid exposure to these types of substances.)</p> <p>Some big retailers stock vegan homewares, including John Lewis, Habitat and Ikea. Soft furnishings are an easy place to start. Manmade versions of animal-derived fabrics are often more affordable than the real thing, and perform well, too. There are vegan fabrics made from recycled bottles (try <a href=\"https://www.weavergreen.com/\" title=\"\">weavergreen.com</a>), leathers made from pineapple fibre (try <a href=\"https://www.parkinfabrics.co.uk/millinery/pineapple-fabric.html\" title=\"\">parkinfabrics.co.uk</a>), and acrylics or other synthetics, linen, PVC, satin and cotton (opt for organic cotton, though, as its production is far less damaging to the environment).</p> <p>A caution, though: when looking for vegan alternatives some options are more eco-friendly than others. Synthetic fabrics may be free of animal elements \u2013 but they shed countless microfibres into the water system, a factor that should be taken into consideration. [See footnote]</p> <p>Paints are tricky, too: they often include animal derivatives and most have been tested on animals, so you\u2019ll have to pay a little more for plant-based, vegan alternatives. The good news is that these are often VOC-free, giving off none of the unpleasant chemicals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/29/the-house-that-healed-my-migraines\" title=\"\">that can trigger health problems</a>. <a href=\"https://www.lakelandpaints.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Lakeland paints</a> are vegan, and Auro offers a vegan range, too.</p> <p>If you\u2019re choosing wooden furniture, think about how the timber is sourced. Trees provide habitats for thousands of different species and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/04/climate-change-deforestation-global-warming-report\" title=\"\">climate-altering effects of deforestation</a> are well known, but we don\u2019t always consider this when investing in a new chair or table. Look for FSC-certified items or those made from reclaimed wood. Or consider bamboo: it grows speedily and uses little water in its production. To make sure your new purchase hasn\u2019t been varnished or glued with animal-derived products, you\u2019ll need to look for certified vegan items: check out <a href=\"https://www.peta.org.uk/\" title=\"\">peta.org.uk</a>, <a href=\"https://www.treehugger.com/living/\" title=\"\">treehugger.com</a>, or online vegan department store <a href=\"https://www.wearthlondon.com/all-homewares?sort=sort_order_asc&amp;page=1\" title=\"\">wearthlondon.com</a> for ideas.</p> <p>Another sound eco option is to choose vintage pieces, that may otherwise be destined for landfill. An advantage of this is that you won\u2019t have to worry so much about \u201coff-gassing\u201d (new items are often treated with a heady cocktail of chemicals that leach out after production, and that you may prefer to avoid inhaling or sitting on). Stainless steel furniture is an alternative to wood: it\u2019s durable, recyclable and vegan in terms of materials; steel doesn\u2019t need to be coated with preservatives. It\u2019s eco-friendly, too: scrap metal is the industry\u2019s primary source of raw material, and most items will be composed of 60% to 80% recycled steel.</p> <p>Cleaning products are a bit of a minefield, with product-testing an issue and animal derivatives in many items; but there are plenty of options out there. If the thought of scrolling through lists of ingredients sounds as interesting as watching your plant-based paint dry, don\u2019t despair: look for products that carry the Vegan Society or Leaping Bunny logos, or visit <a href=\"https://veganwomble.co.uk/category/vegan-household-products/\" title=\"\">veganwomble.co.uk</a> for lists of homecare products.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/13/building-ideas-creatives-spaces-inspire-them\">'This building gives me so many ideas': creatives on the spaces that inspire them</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While you\u2019re rethinking everyday purchases, avoiding plastics is an obvious step that will have an impact on the wellbeing of countless species: how about investing in some good old-fashioned handkerchiefs instead of plastic-wrapped tissues? In fact, reconsidering your choice of personal care products (from condoms and razors to sanitary items) can make a huge difference, and there are vegan versions of all of these.</p> <p>What about other supplies we need? A major cost for most of us is our energy bill: is it possible to make a vegan choice when it comes to our provider? Surprisingly, yes. Green energy is a step in the right direction, but just because a supplier uses renewable energy, it doesn\u2019t make it vegan. One energy source used by many companies is anaerobic digestion (AD), an eco-friendly process in which micro-organisms are used to break down waste, including animal, and produce biogas. It\u2019s a green process that reduces our toll on landfill and the amount of methane released into the atmosphere, but it\u2019s not a vegan one (<a href=\"https://octopus.energy/blog/can-energy-be-vegan/\" title=\"\">octopus.energy</a> has a more detailed explanation). But this year, Ecotricity launched as <a href=\"https://www.ecotricity.co.uk/our-green-energy/vegan-energy-supply\" title=\"\">the UK\u2019s first certified vegan energy provider</a>, guaranteeing that there\u2019s no trace of animal by-products used in its production. </p> <p>Vegan living is simple. It\u2019s about making informed decisions every time we buy something, and about sending a message to producers at the same time: that we don\u2019t need animals to suffer so we can fill our pillows or clean our dishes. By making ethical and compassionate choices, we can still enjoy a beautiful home, while doing all we can to safeguard the place where we all live \u2013 our planet.</p> <h2>A vegan guide, room by room<br></h2> <h2><strong>Living room</strong></h2> <p>Visit <a href=\"https://www.peta.org.uk/\" title=\"\">peta.org.uk</a> for vegan sofas; or try <a href=\"https://www.anthropologie.com/en-gb/shop/angelina-dolly-sofa\" title=\"\">Anthropologie\u2019s Angelina sofa</a>, which is made from \u201cdolly wool\u201d, a hard-wearing vegan fabric (\u00a31,998, anthropologie.com).

      "bodyText": "With vegan food, fashion and makeup firmly established in the mainstream, more and more people are looking for ways to have an ethical, cruelty-free home, too. You may not have given much thought to what animal-based products crop up in your house, but there are many: fabrics, from silk to wool to sheepskin, are an obvious example \u2013 but is your mattress vegan? What goes into your cleaning products, or your energy provider? And is there such a thing as vegan loo roll? The fact is, you can take a vegan approach to choosing almost anything for your home \u2013 and it needn\u2019t be complicated or expensive. Next time you have to replace an item or redecorate a room, shop around for vegan options \u2013 you\u2019ll be surprised at what\u2019s available. Many people choose to go cruelty-free at home for compassionate reasons, but there\u2019s a compelling ecological argument, too. The environmental footprint of vegan products is dramatically smaller than that of those derived from animals; they also tend to use far fewer chemicals in their production. (The leather used to make a sofa has to be heavily treated with resins and preservatives, for example. With a plant-based alternative, you\u2019ll avoid exposure to these types of substances.) Some big retailers stock vegan homewares, including John Lewis, Habitat and Ikea. Soft furnishings are an easy place to start. Manmade versions of animal-derived fabrics are often more affordable than the real thing, and perform well, too. There are vegan fabrics made from recycled bottles (try weavergreen.com), leathers made from pineapple fibre (try parkinfabrics.co.uk), and acrylics or other synthetics, linen, PVC, satin and cotton (opt for organic cotton, though, as its production is far less damaging to the environment). A caution, though: when looking for vegan alternatives some options are more eco-friendly than others. Synthetic fabrics may be free of animal elements \u2013 but they shed countless microfibres into the water system, a factor that should be taken into consideration. [See footnote] Paints are tricky, too: they often include animal derivatives and most have been tested on animals, so you\u2019ll have to pay a little more for plant-based, vegan alternatives. The good news is that these are often VOC-free, giving off none of the unpleasant chemicals that can trigger health problems. Lakeland paints are vegan, and Auro offers a vegan range, too. If you\u2019re choosing wooden furniture, think about how the timber is sourced. Trees provide habitats for thousands of different species and the climate-altering effects of deforestation are well known, but we don\u2019t always consider this when investing in a new chair or table. Look for FSC-certified items or those made from reclaimed wood. Or consider bamboo: it grows speedily and uses little water in its production. To make sure your new purchase hasn\u2019t been varnished or glued with animal-derived products, you\u2019ll need to look for certified vegan items: check out peta.org.uk, treehugger.com, or online vegan department store wearthlondon.com for ideas. Another sound eco option is to choose vintage pieces, that may otherwise be destined for landfill. An advantage of this is that you won\u2019t have to worry so much about \u201coff-gassing\u201d (new items are often treated with a heady cocktail of chemicals that leach out after production, and that you may prefer to avoid inhaling or sitting on). Stainless steel furniture is an alternative to wood: it\u2019s durable, recyclable and vegan in terms of materials; steel doesn\u2019t need to be coated with preservatives. It\u2019s eco-friendly, too: scrap metal is the industry\u2019s primary source of raw material, and most items will be composed of 60% to 80% recycled steel. Cleaning products are a bit of a minefield, with product-testing an issue and animal derivatives in many items; but there are plenty of options out there. If the thought of scrolling through lists of ingredients sounds as interesting as watching your plant-based paint dry, don\u2019t despair: look for products that carry the Vegan Society or Leaping Bunny logos, or visit veganwomble.co.uk for lists of homecare products. While you\u2019re rethinking everyday purchases, avoiding plastics is an obvious step that will have an impact on the wellbeing of countless species: how about investing in some good old-fashioned handkerchiefs instead of plastic-wrapped tissues? In fact, reconsidering your choice of personal care products (from condoms and razors to sanitary items) can make a huge difference, and there are vegan versions of all of these. What about other supplies we need? A major cost for most of us is our energy bill: is it possible to make a vegan choice when it comes to our provider? Surprisingly, yes. Green energy is a step in the right direction, but just because a supplier uses renewable energy, it doesn\u2019t make it vegan. One energy source used by many companies is anaerobic digestion (AD), an eco-friendly process in which micro-organisms are used to break down waste, including animal, and produce biogas. It\u2019s a green process that reduces our toll on landfill and the amount of methane released into the atmosphere, but it\u2019s not a vegan one (octopus.energy has a more detailed explanation). But this year, Ecotricity launched as the UK\u2019s first certified vegan energy provider, guaranteeing that there\u2019s no trace of animal by-products used in its production. Vegan living is simple. It\u2019s about making informed decisions every time we buy something, and about sending a message to producers at the same time: that we don\u2019t need animals to suffer so we can fill our pillows or clean our dishes. By making ethical and compassionate choices, we can still enjoy a beautiful home, while doing all we can to safeguard the place where we all live \u2013 our planet. A vegan guide, room by room Living room Visit peta.org.uk for vegan sofas; or try Anthropologie\u2019s Angelina sofa, which is made from \u201cdolly wool\u201d, a hard-wearing vegan fabric (\u00a31,998, anthropologie.com). Choose acrylic carpets rather than woollen ones, and for vegan rugs, try jute, cotton, faux fur, faux sheepskin, or recycled materials: the Andalucia Paloma rug is made from recycled plastic bottles (from \u00a3130, weavergreen.com) or H&amp;M\u2019s patterned cotton rug (\u00a315, hm.com) has just won best wool-free rug at Peta\u2019s third vegan homeware awards (peta.org.uk). Try synthetic throws (Zara Home\u2019s multicoloured plain weave blanket is 100% acrylic, \u00a349.99, zarahome.com); burn soy rather than beeswax candles (try Le Labo\u2019s vegan soy wax candle, \u00a352, libertylondon.com); and use microfibre rather than down-filled cushions (dunelm.com stocks an affordable range, or try Yonder Living\u2019s \u201ccactus silk\u201d cushion, woven from a natural vegetable fibre found in the agave cacti; \u00a352, yonderliving.com). Visit vinterior.co, pamono.co.uk or newcomer ceraudo.com for stylish vintage furniture, or try charity shops, such as British Heart Foundation\u2019s ebay store.

[See footnote] Kitchen If you\u2019re revamping your flooring, go for sustainable cork (colourflooring.co.uk is launching a carbon negative cork floor in early July), lino tiles, or reclaimed wood (vegandesign.org and veganhaven.co.uk are great cruelty-free resources). Use recycled glass, stainless steel or bamboo storage jars, rather than plastic \u2013 these don\u2019t need to be high-end purchases: think Argos, Amazon and Robert Dyas.

      "body": "<h2>Winning tip: Attersee, Austria</h2> \n<p>The bluest and clearest of the lakes near Salzburg, you can jump into Attersee and enjoy a wonderful dip. Surrounded by the mountains there are numerous walks and hikes, pristine farms and countryside. Seemingly off the tourist route, there are few of the tour groups found at other lakes in the region. The many public bathing areas, such as the one at Unterach am Attersee, provide food, watersports, shade, slides and shallow areas for children.<br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://attersee-attergau.salzkammergut.at/en/activities/bathing.html\" title=\"\">attersee-attergau.salzkammergut.at</a></em><br><strong>Fran</strong></p> \n<h2>Marnemoende, Utrecht, The Netherlands</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s hard to imagine getting closer to nature than sleeping on a lake. We enjoyed a weekend staying in a basic but completely adequate camping raft for two. We were provided with a canoe, which is the only way to reach your bed for the night, and some basic camping equipment. Marnemoende lake is beautiful and is bursting with wildlife. There is a village about an hour away by foot, but otherwise there is just peace and quiet and the most stunning sunrises to wake up to. We stayed with <a href=\"https://www.camping-raft.com/de-locaties/marmemoende-utrecht\">camping-raft.com</a> and it cost less than \u00a3150 for the weekend.<br><strong>Sandra Anderson</strong></p> \n<h2>Peru\u0107a, Croatia</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"64cb227a682f276a5b1c48eb6e78215e9ff94af2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64cb227a682f276a5b1c48eb6e78215e9ff94af2/0_112_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peruca lake in Croatia near Vrlika\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Until last week I had never heard of Lake Peru\u0107a.

They come for the peace, fresh air, clean water, excellent cycling and biking, fishing, unspoilt countryside and local culture.

This site on Lake Titisee (50 scenic minutes on the train from Freiburg) gave us everything we needed for great water-based family camping. The kids spent hours on paddleboards messing around close to shore, and heading for pontoons where they could jump and dive in. The warm, calm water tempted me (a reluctant participant) into swimming across the lake.

At Llangorse Lake, in the Brecon Beacons, a viewing platform going out to a thatched roundhouse gives an impression of how these ancient people lived. The lake, surrounded by the Black Mountains, is south Wales\u2019s largest natural lake and known for its bird and fish populations. An easy walk takes you through a site of special scientific interest, past a bird hide.

West Highlands\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Remote and stunningly beautiful, part of the adventure of Kinloch Hourn is getting there. As you turn off the A87, 24 miles of single-track road lead to this outstanding sea loch, where you can see otters, seals and jellyfish in the crystal clear waters, as well as an abundance of water birds. The road in is not for the faint of heart, but take it slowly and you are likely to see deer by the roadside and soaring birds of prey. There is a little cafe and B&amp;B (doubles \u00a390, cottage \u00a3775pw, <a href=\"http://www.kinlochhourn.com/tea-room.html\" title=\"\">kinlochhourn.com</a>) serving fruitcake and coffee, which is a lovely place to linger. There is a path along the loch with views of the surrounding mountains. Orchids and other wildflowers keep you company.<br><strong>Emma Nicholson</strong></p> \n<h2>Llyn Geirionydd, Snowdonia, UK </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"51c329461e61a0a843040133eb3d28299c47e654\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51c329461e61a0a843040133eb3d28299c47e654/0_19_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Llyn Geirionydd in the Snowdonia national park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>We love <a href=\"http://www.snowdoniaguide.com/llyn_geirionydd.html\" title=\"\">Llyn Geirionydd</a> in north Wales, because you can swim, paddleboard, sail or walk around it. There\u2019s a lovely round-trip walk to the neighbouring lake, Crafnant, which has a cafe serving delicious sandwiches and offers fishing. Holiday cottages include <a href=\"https://greatescapeswales.co.uk/properties/Ty-Newydd/93782/\" title=\"\">Ty Newydd</a> (sleeps 7, from \u00a3118pn), right on the lake.

Llyn Idwal is a beautiful, isolated lake backed by the cliffs rising above to the Devil\u2019s Kitchen, a high fissure in the rocks above. Parking at a car park at Ogwen Cottage on the A5, between Snowdon and Capel Curig, follow a lower footpath around the lake and admire the rugged landscape above. In good weather there is a challenging walk up to the Devil\u2019s Kitchen, following a rocky path. You can then scramble up to Llyn y Cwm, a small tan on the top, which is more satisfying for the effort and view than the lake, to then return on a knee-aching descent with stunning views.<br><strong>Ian Spencer</strong></p> \n<h2>Chew Valley, Somerset, UK</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69c501fd55ef68259d8f94fff9a686152468bb30\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69c501fd55ef68259d8f94fff9a686152468bb30/0_138_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View of Chew Valley Lake\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Chew Valley Lake is an idyllic spot for walking, eating, fishing or sailing. Grab your boots (or wellies on wet days!) for a scenic walk along one of the lake\u2019s nature trails \u2013 Grebe trail or Bittern trail. If you are feeling peckish, a popular place for a bite is Salt &amp; Malt, which has award-winning food with spectacular views of the lake and rolling countryside. The fish and chips are fantastic! Chew Valley Lake is also a birdwatcher\u2019s paradise \u2013 there are six bird hides dotted around the lake and roughly 270 species in the area.

Nearby Buttermere draws the walkers to its perfect lake path, but <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/buttermere-valley/features/loweswater\" title=\"\">Loweswater</a> offers scenery that\u2019s just as stunning \u2013 and you may not spot another person as you stroll the <a href=\"http://golakedistrict.co.uk/walks/loweswater-circuit/\" title=\"\">four-mile circuit</a> around its shores. We enjoyed gazing at the distinctively shaped fell <a href=\"https://www.mountain-forecast.com/peaks/Melbreak\" title=\"\">Melbreak</a>, which looms over the lake, and listing what it reminded us of. We also loved swinging out over the water on rope swings and watching territorial swans defending their patch. The iconic <a href=\"https://kirkstile.com/\" title=\"\">Kirkstile Inn</a> and a pint of Loweswater Gold await at the top of the lake. <br><strong>Susie Lee-Kilgariff</strong></p> \n<h2>Bassenthwaite, Lake District, UK</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8696c0567e39a5548b9044b41b3beafbbcfde6e4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8696c0567e39a5548b9044b41b3beafbbcfde6e4/0_314_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bassenthwaite, Lake District.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Beside Bassenthwaite Lake, just outside Keswick on the A591 to Carlisle, sits the beautiful house and gardens at <a href=\"https://www.mirehouse.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Mirehouse</a> (\u00a34 garden admission, \u00a38.50 including house, children half price, under 4s free).

A naturally formed spring- and sea-fed lake, it\u2019s seen locally as a spa destination, with mineral-rich warm sulphurous waters that are thought to be therapeutic. It\u2019s equally attractive for those wanting to swim or snorkel in calm natural waters, the towering rock surroundings providing little alcoves to explore. Facilities include lockers, a playground, sunloungers and a cafe/restaurant. Located close to a beach, the lake can be reached by public transport (metro, tram or bus) or by taxi (around \u20ac20). <br><strong>David</strong></p> \n<h2>J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rl\u00f3n, Iceland</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"60785276892a6ef41a01160710065bf782d21857\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60785276892a6ef41a01160710065bf782d21857/0_8_4300_2581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jokulsarlon lagoon, Iceland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Probably not a great place to swim, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/gallery/2017/dec/25/iceland-photography-readers-travel-photo-competiton-2016-winners-trip\" title=\"\">J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rl\u00f3n glacial lagoon</a> in south-east Iceland offers boat tours among the icebergs floating in its waters.

      "bodyText": "Winning tip: Attersee, Austria The bluest and clearest of the lakes near Salzburg, you can jump into Attersee and enjoy a wonderful dip. Surrounded by the mountains there are numerous walks and hikes, pristine farms and countryside. Seemingly off the tourist route, there are few of the tour groups found at other lakes in the region. The many public bathing areas, such as the one at Unterach am Attersee, provide food, watersports, shade, slides and shallow areas for children. \u2022 attersee-attergau.salzkammergut.at Fran Marnemoende, Utrecht, The Netherlands It\u2019s hard to imagine getting closer to nature than sleeping on a lake. We enjoyed a weekend staying in a basic but completely adequate camping raft for two. We were provided with a canoe, which is the only way to reach your bed for the night, and some basic camping equipment. Marnemoende lake is beautiful and is bursting with wildlife. There is a village about an hour away by foot, but otherwise there is just peace and quiet and the most stunning sunrises to wake up to. We stayed with camping-raft.com and it cost less than \u00a3150 for the weekend. Sandra Anderson Peru\u0107a, Croatia Until last week I had never heard of Lake Peru\u0107a. It is formed by a dam on the Cetina river as it rushes through the karst landscape, its source forming an agate pool that attracts a small number of tourists. They come for the peace, fresh air, clean water, excellent cycling and biking, fishing, unspoilt countryside and local culture. A new campsite on the lakeshore has pitches at \u20ac15 a day . The closest town, Vrlika, is overlooked by a fortress. Nataly Anderson Saimaa, Finland The Lakeland in Finland isat its most beautiful when you can\u2019t tell where the lake ends and the sky begins. Saimaa is the country\u2019s largest lake, an intricate maze of channels and basins that are home to thousands of islands, a number of which make up Linnansaari national park, where if you\u2019re lucky you may spot one of the few ringed seals left in the wild. This part of the world is cottage country, where Finns retreat to relax. Eight of us rented a log cabin from Hugon Villas, complete with a wood-fired lakeside sauna \u2013 to us, that felt like extravagance, but we soon discovered that in Finland they\u2019re as common as an indoor toilet. Paul Titisee, Black Forest, Germany We camped right on the water\u2019s edge at Camping Sandbank after just turning up and finding a spot. This site on Lake Titisee (50 scenic minutes on the train from Freiburg) gave us everything we needed for great water-based family camping. The kids spent hours on paddleboards messing around close to shore, and heading for pontoons where they could jump and dive in. The warm, calm water tempted me (a reluctant participant) into swimming across the lake. My reward \u2013 an authentic slice of black forest gateau. \u2022 In high season, pitch including car \u20ac12, plus adult \u20ac9 and child \u20ac5.50, camping-sandbank.de Karen Llangorse, Brecon Beacons, UK Many centuries ago, crannogs \u2013 artificial islands built out into lakes as defensive homes \u2013 were found throughout Scotland, Ireland and Wales. At Llangorse Lake, in the Brecon Beacons, a viewing platform going out to a thatched roundhouse gives an impression of how these ancient people lived. The lake, surrounded by the Black Mountains, is south Wales\u2019s largest natural lake and known for its bird and fish populations. An easy walk takes you through a site of special scientific interest, past a bird hide. Boating on the lake is popular and boat hire readily available. \u2022 llangorselake.co.uk Maria Kinloch Hourn, West Highlands, UK Remote and stunningly beautiful, part of the adventure of Kinloch Hourn is getting there. As you turn off the A87, 24 miles of single-track road lead to this outstanding sea loch, where you can see otters, seals and jellyfish in the crystal clear waters, as well as an abundance of water birds. The road in is not for the faint of heart, but take it slowly and you are likely to see deer by the roadside and soaring birds of prey. There is a little cafe and B&amp;B (doubles \u00a390, cottage \u00a3775pw, kinlochhourn.com) serving fruitcake and coffee, which is a lovely place to linger. There is a path along the loch with views of the surrounding mountains. Orchids and other wildflowers keep you company. Emma Nicholson Llyn Geirionydd, Snowdonia, UK We love Llyn Geirionydd in north Wales, because you can swim, paddleboard, sail or walk around it. There\u2019s a lovely round-trip walk to the neighbouring lake, Crafnant, which has a cafe serving delicious sandwiches and offers fishing. Holiday cottages include Ty Newydd (sleeps 7, from \u00a3118pn), right on the lake. In fact, the whole of the Gwydir forest is dotted with lakes. Theresa Llyn Idwal, Snowdonia, UK Snowdonia is not just a land of mountains, but of wonderful lakes. Llyn Idwal is a beautiful, isolated lake backed by the cliffs rising above to the Devil\u2019s Kitchen, a high fissure in the rocks above. Parking at a car park at Ogwen Cottage on the A5, between Snowdon and Capel Curig, follow a lower footpath around the lake and admire the rugged landscape above. In good weather there is a challenging walk up to the Devil\u2019s Kitchen, following a rocky path. You can then scramble up to Llyn y Cwm, a small tan on the top, which is more satisfying for the effort and view than the lake, to then return on a knee-aching descent with stunning views. Ian Spencer Chew Valley, Somerset, UK Chew Valley Lake is an idyllic spot for walking, eating, fishing or sailing. Grab your boots (or wellies on wet days!) for a scenic walk along one of the lake\u2019s nature trails \u2013 Grebe trail or Bittern trail. If you are feeling peckish, a popular place for a bite is Salt &amp; Malt, which has award-winning food with spectacular views of the lake and rolling countryside. The fish and chips are fantastic! Chew Valley Lake is also a birdwatcher\u2019s paradise \u2013 there are six bird hides dotted around the lake and roughly 270 species in the area. For a more adrenaline-fuelled activity, sign up for a trial with Chew Valley Lake Sailing Club? Taylor Weeks Loweswater, Lake District, UK This is a lake few visitors to these parts seem to know about. Nearby Buttermere draws the walkers to its perfect lake path, but Loweswater offers scenery that\u2019s just as stunning \u2013 and you may not spot another person as you stroll the four-mile circuit around its shores. We enjoyed gazing at the distinctively shaped fell Melbreak, which looms over the lake, and listing what it reminded us of. We also loved swinging out over the water on rope swings and watching territorial swans defending their patch. The iconic Kirkstile Inn and a pint of Loweswater Gold await at the top of the lake. Susie Lee-Kilgariff Bassenthwaite, Lake District, UK Beside Bassenthwaite Lake, just outside Keswick on the A591 to Carlisle, sits the beautiful house and gardens at Mirehouse (\u00a34 garden admission, \u00a38.50 including house, children half price, under 4s free). The Lakeside Walk takes in woodland adventure playgrounds, an open-air theatre erected by The Tennyson Society, lambs in spring and a walled bee garden with an abundance of colourful and scented blooms. Take a little detour to pre-Norman St Bega\u2019s Church. Car parking is at Dodd Wood, where there is an excellent tea room (sticky ginger pudding!), toilets and osprey viewing platforms. Nicola Vouliagmeni, Athens On the southern outskirts of Athens, in the area known as the Athens Riviera, Vouliagmeni lake is a wholly unexpected find a short way away from the city buzz. A naturally formed spring- and sea-fed lake, it\u2019s seen locally as a spa destination, with mineral-rich warm sulphurous waters that are thought to be therapeutic. It\u2019s equally attractive for those wanting to swim or snorkel in calm natural waters, the towering rock surroundings providing little alcoves to explore. Facilities include lockers, a playground, sunloungers and a cafe/restaurant. Located close to a beach, the lake can be reached by public transport (metro, tram or bus) or by taxi (around \u20ac20). David J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rl\u00f3n, Iceland Probably not a great place to swim, but J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rl\u00f3n glacial lagoon in south-east Iceland offers boat tours among the icebergs floating in its waters. The best photo opportunities occur when the weather is bad \u2013 the murkier the skies, the bluer the icebergs appear. Boat tour over, visit the aptly named Diamond Beach, where the lagoon flows out to sea. The black sands are strewn with transparent chunks of ice which have been carved by nature into abstract shapes: an ever-changing outdoor sculpture gallery. \u2022 Boat tour adult \u00a336, child 6-12, \u00a313, icelagoon.is Claire Dopson Ohrid, North Macedonia This wonderful lake straddles the border between North Macedonia and Albania. Base yourself in Ohrid (on the North Macedonian side) to enjoy strolls round the old town with its interesting churches, and take a boat trip to the monastery of St Naum, set in beautiful grounds with peacocks wandering around. In the evening, sit by the lakeside in Ohrid with a drink or a meal (at a very reasonable price), taking in the scenery and watching the swans on the lake. It\u2019s easier to get to than you might think \u2013 Wizzair flies from Luton direct to the small resort city of Ohrid. Hilary Lakes of Limousin, France I love La Grange Fleurie, a renovated barn in Gourdon-Murat, an hour\u2019s drive south-east of Limoges. It has two small lakes on its doorstep: Viam, small and tranquil; and Lake Barriousses, larger, with activities for everyone \u2013 there\u2019s even an area for dogs. You can sit in the shade on the grassy bank or worship the sun on its immaculate white sand beach. For the more active, there are canoes, pedalos, petanque and badminton. A bouncy castle in the water keeps the kids busy. The lake itself has a sandy bottom and is a pristine deep blue surrounded by beech and pine trees. There are also restaurants, of course. \u2022 La Grange Fleurie sleeps four, from about \u00a3100pn, on Facebook Joanna Lac d\u2019Allos, Provence, France The lakes of France\u2019s Mercantour national park are truly wonderful. A stone\u2019s throw from Nice and accessible via breathtaking hikes through alpine pastures bursting with wildflowers, you\u2019re spoilt for choice in this plodder\u2019s paradise. However, my highlight has to be Lac d\u2019Allos (pictured above), the largest natural mountain lake in Europe and the jewel of the Haut Verdon. Nestled between the imposing Mont Pelat (3,052 metres) to the north and the trio of peaks known as Les Tours du Lac to the south, Lac d\u2019Allos\u2019s shimmering cerulean waters are a characteristic of all the spectacular glacial lakes in the park. Forget the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur and head for les lacs d\u2019azur. Stephen Brown Nedre Noren, Sweden We stayed in a large house on the shores of Lake Nedre Noren, in Norhyttan, Dalarna county in the centre of the country. The garden includes a wide sundeck with beautiful views across the water, to farms and forest. The gently shelving lake bed is safe for small children to swim. Clean water heats up fast in warm weather. Nearby is a secluded grassy bathing spot with a mini-beach. There\u2019s a boat for fishing, watching beavers, deer, elk, eagle owls, cranes, red squirrels and lynx. You can windsurf to two other linked lakes. There are numerous bathing spots on other nearby lakes. Windsurf or ski, skate and snow-cat in winter. Roy O\u2019Shea Caumasee, Switzerland Lake Caumasee is known as the Jewel of Flims\u2026 no filters are needed to capture its iridescent turquoise depths. Farmers used to take their cows to heal in these waters when my great-grandparents lived there, and I return from time to time for its cooling, healing properties and to breathe the clear Swiss mountain air. Walk through the pine forest from Haus Am Waldrand, a less-trodden path, to reach the lake and find a tranquil spot to sit and read, or swim around the island. Late August/early September is quieter. Entrance fee to the lake is around \u00a312 adults/\u00a36 children aged 6-16. Rhiannon Bohinj, Slovenia If you\u2019re hiking in the Julian Alps, make the last stop Komna Hut (\u20ac23-27 a night).

We\u2019re in a car hurtling towards the edge of a cliff, we\u2019ve got our foot on the accelerator, and we\u2019re just talking to each other, faffing about. If anything, some of us are even putting the foot further down. What we need to do is stop the car and get out. That has become increasingly clear to me in the last couple of years, which is why I\u2019ve made changes to my own lifestyle.</p> <p>These all come from the research we\u2019ve been doing at my work, and it\u2019s all based on climate science. The first \u2013 and the hardest for many people \u2013 is flying. The evidence is clear that, as far as the climate is concerned, we should keep to one return short-haul flight every two to three years. So it\u2019s not that I can\u2019t see the world \u2013 I could still go abroad at least another 10 times in my life \u2013 it\u2019s just that I can\u2019t go to Istanbul for the weekend.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been vegetarian since I was about 15, and pretty much vegan for a year. It\u2019s important that everybody goes close to vegetarian, and ideally vegan. Not just that: it\u2019s also important that we stop eating so much. The average European <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/food-per-person\" title=\"\">eats 3,500 calories a day</a>, which is too much. The planet has had to provide all those unnecessary calories.

This would take some of the heat out of our ever-expanding economies, reduce our capacity and urge to consume, and create space to live a more balanced life. I plan to do this in the near future.

In July 2018, I came across Prof Jem Bendell\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.lifeworth.com/deepadaptation.pdf\" title=\"\">Deep Adaptation paper</a>, which was going viral online.

It would give me some security; I don\u2019t feel secure where I live in Cambridge at the moment \u2013 I\u2019m concerned by thoughts like, \u201cWhat would happen if I turned the tap on and there was no water?\u201d.

Is it above sea level by a certain amount? Where\u2019s the slope facing, so I can grow food. I need to get solar panels up, and a friend has offered some help with a wind turbine. It\u2019s a way of life that\u2019s always appealed to me; now it seems really urgent.</p> <p>I\u2019m very aware that I\u2019m privileged in being able to do this.

I\u2019d studied sustainability and carbon management, but it was only when we were setting up a second factory, looking into the waste output that would come from the manufacturing process, that it hit home: all those shampoo bottles can\u2019t actually be recycled.

I switched to a bamboo toothbrush, which turned out to be a lot better and more durable than my plastic one.

We\u2019re in a car hurtling towards the edge of a cliff, we\u2019ve got our foot on the accelerator, and we\u2019re just talking to each other, faffing about. If anything, some of us are even putting the foot further down. What we need to do is stop the car and get out. That has become increasingly clear to me in the last couple of years, which is why I\u2019ve made changes to my own lifestyle. These all come from the research we\u2019ve been doing at my work, and it\u2019s all based on climate science. The first \u2013 and the hardest for many people \u2013 is flying. The evidence is clear that, as far as the climate is concerned, we should keep to one return short-haul flight every two to three years. So it\u2019s not that I can\u2019t see the world \u2013 I could still go abroad at least another 10 times in my life \u2013 it\u2019s just that I can\u2019t go to Istanbul for the weekend. I\u2019ve been vegetarian since I was about 15, and pretty much vegan for a year. It\u2019s important that everybody goes close to vegetarian, and ideally vegan. Not just that: it\u2019s also important that we stop eating so much. The average European eats 3,500 calories a day, which is too much. The planet has had to provide all those unnecessary calories. It\u2019s not just about climate change: if you look at land use change, biodiversity loss, fertilisers in the ocean creating dead zones, the massive extinction and loss of insects due to pesticides \u2013 these problems are all driven by food. I\u2019ve also reduced the volume of new clothing that I buy. The average European buys 24 new items every year. That needs to come down \u2013 based on my team\u2019s research, I\u2019m aiming for three. I can still keep my wardrobe alive through secondhand, recycled, upgraded, swapped or rented clothes. C40 is a network bringing together the world\u2019s biggest cities, helping them do the best they can on climate. About a year ago, we conducted some research looking at the impact of consumption. Our ever-growing economy in turn requires never-ending growth in consumption. One of the best things you can do to address climate change is go down to a four-day working week. This would take some of the heat out of our ever-expanding economies, reduce our capacity and urge to consume, and create space to live a more balanced life. I plan to do this in the near future. If it means I\u2019m earning a bit less and spending a bit less, but I\u2019ve got a bit more time on my hands, then that\u2019s great. The massive caveat is that many people in Britain and around the world don\u2019t have enough; but those of us with high consumption lifestyles need to balance it out. The main responsibility will always be with large business and governments to fix the mess we\u2019re in, but we\u2019re now at a point where it\u2019s so late that we need action from everyone.

Maybe they\u2019ll gripe at me when I\u2019m in my rocking chair, saying, \u201cDad, you never took us to Disney World, Florida and I\u2019m in counselling for it now\u201d, but I suspect they won\u2019t. My youngest, Molly, who is 12, has been involved in the school climate strikes. She was proud to go on the march. For a lot of kids these days, you stand out if you\u2019re not taking action. As a family, we\u2019ve been vegetarian for about six months. We\u2019d already been cutting down on meat, but Molly was the one who pushed it further \u2013 she\u2019s pretty much vegan. Of course, some vegetarian food has high food miles, but as a rule of thumb, a vegetarian meal is going to have a substantially lower carbon footprint than a meat one. I\u2019ve never said \u201cnever\u201d to flying. If I get an email from Donald Trump\u2019s office saying that if I fly over and talk to him, he\u2019ll be convinced to take action against climate change, then I\u2019ll be straight on that flight. So it\u2019s always about weighing up the cost-benefit. For me, nothing in the last 15 years has justified flying. \u2022 Prof Dave Reay, chair in carbon management and education at the University of Edinburgh The vice-chancellor who quit her job to live off-grid \u2018Societal collapse could happen quite quickly\u2019 I was a cognitive psychologist, an academic happily ascending the career ladder. I knew about climate change, and I knew that things were looking a bit gloomy, but I hadn\u2019t really acquainted myself with the facts. The alarm bells weren\u2019t ringing. People tend to have faith that those in high places know what they\u2019re doing when it comes to climate change. It\u2019s a trap I fell into myself. I moved into academic management and got what was effectively my dream job: pro-vice chancellor at Arden University, a campus and distance-learning university based in Coventry. In July 2018, I came across Prof Jem Bendell\u2019s Deep Adaptation paper, which was going viral online. Here was someone with credibility and a good track record who, having studied the science, was saying that we\u2019re no longer looking at mitigation, we\u2019re looking at adaptation; that societal collapse is inevitable. People are starting to talk about the kind of spiritual awakening you get in these situations: an \u201cecophany\u201d. I concluded that banging on about climate change on social media was not enough, and became involved with grassroots activism. Being a vice-chancellor no longer meant anything to me. I gave up my career, and I\u2019m so much happier as a result. Now I talk at conferences and events about the need for urgent action and I have taken part in direct actions with Extinction Rebellion, including the closing of five London bridges last November and speaking in Parliament Square during the April rebellion. The science shows that societal collapse could be triggered by any one of a number of things, and once triggered, it could happen quite quickly. I suppose I\u2019m being protective towards my four children, aged between 16 and 24, but in the event, I feel I need to be somewhere where I\u2019m growing my own food, living in an eco-house, trying to live off-grid. It would give me some security; I don\u2019t feel secure where I live in Cambridge at the moment \u2013 I\u2019m concerned by thoughts like, \u201cWhat would happen if I turned the tap on and there was no water?\u201d. On our current trajectory, cities will not necessarily be safe places in the future \u2013 possibly within my own lifetime, certainly within my children\u2019s. I am putting my house on the market. My aim is to move to north Wales or Scotland and get a smallholding. I\u2019ve had to think differently when house-hunting: is it energy-efficient? Does it have access to water? Is it above sea level by a certain amount? Where\u2019s the slope facing, so I can grow food. I need to get solar panels up, and a friend has offered some help with a wind turbine. It\u2019s a way of life that\u2019s always appealed to me; now it seems really urgent. I\u2019m very aware that I\u2019m privileged in being able to do this. It\u2019s frightening to think about homeless people, people who are in rented accommodation. Who will look out for them? \u2022 Dr Alison Green, national director (UK) at awareness charity Scientists Warning and former pro vice-chancellor, Arden University The sustainability expert who has gone plastic-free \u2018All those shampoo bottles can\u2019t be recycled\u2019 I am the carbon specialist on the HS2-enabling works from Euston to the M25, looking at ways to reduce the carbon impact of the project, but I used to work for Unilever in Dubai. I looked after environment and sustainability, and set the blueprint for waste reduction strategies for Unilever across the Middle East. I\u2019d studied sustainability and carbon management, but it was only when we were setting up a second factory, looking into the waste output that would come from the manufacturing process, that it hit home: all those shampoo bottles can\u2019t actually be recycled. And then you think about how long you\u2019ve been on this planet, how many bottles you\u2019ve used \u2013 it makes you step back and reflect. Your average soap bottle has about five different types of plastic, and unless each bit is dismantled, it\u2019s not completely recyclable. The little pump is made from one type of plastic, the pipe is made from another, and then you\u2019ve got the spring. We\u2019ve got so used to going into the supermarket, putting something into our baskets and coming home, but we haven\u2019t considered what happens at the end of its life. At the start of this year, I decided to go plastic-free in the bathroom. I switched to a bamboo toothbrush, which turned out to be a lot better and more durable than my plastic one. The handle is made from bamboo, and the bristles on the replaceable head are biodegradable. And, at the end of its life, I can use the handle as a garden marker. Growing up in India, from a very early age we were taught not to waste \u2013 it has always been part of how I was brought up. I bought some blocks of handmade eco-friendly soaps, and a chemical-free toothpaste in a glass jar that I can reuse when it\u2019s empty. There is an additional cost to many eco choices, which makes it an elitist thing. You\u2019re doing it because you can afford to. In an ideal world, I would like to see it being mainstream, rather than thinking, \u201cIf I buy this, do I have to compromise on something else on my shopping list?\u201d. I\u2019m a vegetarian, and I don\u2019t drive \u2013 I can frequently be seen walking the streets of Maidenhead carrying bags of recycling \u2013 but I do still fly. It weighs on my conscience; can you imagine studying carbon management and flying home to Dubai for Christmas? I can remember coming back in January and feeling 30 pairs of eyes turn on me when they found out. But I was like, \u201cI miss my mum!\u201d. I\u2019ve been recording all of my flights, and am saving up to offset the carbon footprint, through organisations like My Climate or WWF. Again, it just goes back to the financial cost of trying to do the right thing by the environment. We\u2019re on track for a global warming of three to four degrees. We\u2019re seeing whales being washed up with 40kg of plastic in their bellies. It\u2019s tempting to think, what difference is my plastic-free bathroom going to make? But several billion people thinking that way is what got us to where we are. \u2022 Siobh\u00e1n Pereira, carbon specialist at construction and engineering firm Costain Group The associate professor who cut her emissions in half \u2018It\u2019s all about the big three: flying, driving and eating meat\u2019 I grew up in the countryside and loved spending time outside, first in California and later Alaska. I now study ways to keep carbon out of the atmosphere; how to reduce our climate pollution quickly and fairly. Individual choices matter: 72% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from household decisions, including mobility (especially using cars and planes), diet (especially meat and dairy consumption), and housing (heating and cooling, and electricity consumption). The largest share of climate pollution comes from the 10% of the global population lucky enough to live on $23 (\u00a318) per day or more, a group that includes most people in rich countries like the UK. (The poor cause very little climate pollution, so there\u2019s not a lot of room for them to reduce their emissions.) To limit warming to 1.5C, our generation must stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. The next decade is critical; emissions need to start plummeting towards zero today. We can get started by very quickly cutting today\u2019s emissions in half. I\u2019ve already cut mine in half, based on how excessively I was polluting the climate before, by focusing on high-impact personal climate actions. When I was in graduate school in California, I had two cars. I was driving up to four hours a day. I now live a 15-minute walk from work and no longer own a car. I stopped flying within Europe in 2012, and cut my flying back by 80% \u2013 the only flights I take are back to North America, to see my family. I stopped eating meat and milk several years ago. The climate impact of bringing a child into the world is something my husband and I have talked about. Essentially, burning fossil fuels and eating meat are the things that are driving climate change \u2013 the more people we have doing those things, the higher those emissions are. That is one factor among many that will inform our decision over whether we start a family. A different but related question is: what kind of world would a child born today grow up in? What matters for climate change is how much greenhouse gases we emit to the atmosphere. A lot of people have started to use keep-cups and reusable water bottles. These choices reduce waste, but are not high-impact climate actions \u2013 they have a much smaller effect compared with the big three: flying, driving and eating meat. For example, eating a plant-based diet for one year saves over 150 times more greenhouse gases compared with a year of using a reusable shopping bag. And you would have to recycle everything in your household comprehensively for almost eight years to equal the greenhouse gas emissions saved by skipping just one round-trip flight from London to New York. Those of us who happen to be alive today are determining the future of humanity. We have to be serious about our responsibility. Individual actions reinforce and support politicians in making the bold choices necessary to tackle the problem on the scale that\u2019s needed. We\u2019ve got to act fast. \u2022 Dr Kimberly Nicholas, associate professor of sustainability science at Lund University, Sweden You can check your own carbon footprint using carbon calculators such as Berkeley\u2019s peer-reviewed CoolClimate and the WWF\u2019s tool.

If singing \u201cshade never made anybody less gay\u201d was meant to be Swift\u2019s idea of allyship, the bad execution and cynical timing with Pride month make this video feel more like empty virtue signalling \u2013 and it\u2019s not particularly virtuous, in my opinion, to caricature the homophobes in the video purely as \u201chillbillies\u201d, as if only those people can be bigoted.</p> <p>You Need to Calm Down is just one example of a pop-cultural moment that\u2019s been lambasted for queerbaiting recently. \u201cThis is still a new-ish term,\u201d explains queer sociologist Professor Amin Ghaziani. \u201cIt means using aspects of queer cultures or queer political support to signal hipness, coolness, political correctness, tolerance or open-mindedness; the performance of a liberal sensibility in a self-interested way, such as for selling a product.\u201d</p> <p>The reason that this creates such outrage, he says, is because it takes away the humanity of LGBTQ+ people and reduces us into pawns in a game of profitability and politics.</p> <p>Queerbaiting comes in many forms. There was the Dua Lipa and St Vincent performance at the 2019 Grammys that was criticised for playing up queer female desire. There was the Calvin Klein advert, released last month, which pictured supermodel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/21/bella-hadid-lil-miquela-terrifying-glimpse-calvin-klein\">Bella Hadid kissing computer-generated influencer Lil Miquela</a>. Then there was the BBC\u2019s advertising campaign for Killing Eve, which plastered London with billboards saying: \u201cHas anyone seen my girlfriend?\u201d, and saw Villanelle bombard Radio 1 with song requests for Eve. As a gay woman, and a fan of the show, I didn\u2019t give it much more than an eye-roll, until Sandra Oh, in an interview with Gay Times, denied that there were lesbian undertones: \u201cYou guys are tricky because you want to make it into something \u2026 but it just isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. It makes you wonder: then why are you marketing it as such?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tw2LMnxvW0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9tw2LMnxvW0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This queerbaiting is not a new phenomenon. Cast your mind back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/aug/29/artsfeatures.madonna\">Madonna and Britney kissing at the MTV </a>video music awards, Tatu\u2019s entire pop career, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJGUbwVMBeA\">Demi Lovato\u2019s Really Don\u2019t Care</a> video and Nick Jonas\u2019s album campaigns over the last few years, in which he has honed in on his gay fanbase, despite having high-profile relationships with women. Lately, queerbaiting seems to have reached its peak. Especially when you look at the number of brands getting on board with sponsoring Pride, or creating some kind of product that supposedly endorses Pride\u2019s values. Like Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s recent release of an LGBT sandwich (lettuce, guacamole, bacon and tomato, in case you were wondering) or Sainsburys\u2019 strange and superficial series of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LGBTQWandsworth/status/1133772324556201986\" title=\"\">instore posters</a> saying it supports LGBTQ+ rights, with very little context. Pride in London has lent itself to branded causes repeatedly: 2016\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/29/absolutely-fabulous-the-movie-review-absolutely-fatuous-thank-god\">Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie</a> float, or 2017\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/25/minions-review-boisterous-and-cheery-despicable-me-spin-off\">Minions</a>. It has basically become a parade of glorified adverts for things that are in no way queer.</p> <p>According to Forbes, a 2018 US survey by Community Marketing and Insights found that more than 75% of LGBT Americans will spend more with a company that supports equality, and one-third of consumers in the US feel more positive about a brand that supports Pride. \u201cBrands are always looking for ways to engage new audiences in order to grow revenue. That\u2019s marketing and that\u2019s business,\u201d says Stephen Lepitak, editor at ad industry publication The Drum. \u201cHowever when they decide to get on board \u2018a purpose\u2019 and align with an aspect of society, they must be careful not to do it tokenistically. There has to be a reason for them to align that makes sense, otherwise they risk alienating people as it will ring false.\u201d</p> <p>British Airways, for instance, has come under fire for sponsoring Pride when their planes deport LGBTQ+ migrants from the UK. Primark has also been accused of \u201cpinkwashing\u201d its brand by releasing Pride collections and not donating the proceeds to charity.</p> <p>It is easy to criticise faceless big brands for co-opting LGBTQ+ causes, but when it comes to specific celebrities, complications arise when we don\u2019t consider how someone might have felt the need quash their own desire due to social stigma or the entertainment industry\u2019s prejudice.</p> <p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/15/rita-ora-lgbt-criticism-of-song-girls\">Rita Ora\u2019s 2018 song Girls</a> was unanimously criticised for perpetuating stereotypes of drunken, faux-lesbian hookups, prompting the singer to come out as bisexual. Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz got similarly slammed for playing a lesbian in the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/09/desiree-akhavan-miseducation-of-cameron-post-review\">The Miseducation of Cameron Post</a> and was later pictured kissing a girl. There is a delicate line to tread between policing people\u2019s affiliation with certain labels and holding them accountable for earning the title of ally if they want to use it.</p> <p>So, what should we think about We Need to Calm Down? There is some authenticity, albeit borrowed: the fact that Ellen, Laverne and Billy Porter appear does lend the video some credibility. She also has a cause: the video promotes a petition for the US Senate to recognise the Equality Act; and Swift put her money where her mouth is, making a donation to the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (Glaad). However, unlike longstanding queer ally Lady Gaga, it could be said that Swift hadn\u2019t really nurtured her gay fanbase enough before the video dropped. You cannot just suddenly decide to be a queer ally and earn the title overnight.</p> <p>Buttering queer fans up with a Jonathan Van Ness collaboration or getting caught sniffing some poppers might have helped, but better yet, would have been using the last 10 years of her career to peddle the message that gay is OK. The real test will be how she uses the next 10.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The UK <a href=\"https://switchboard.lgbt/\">LGBT+ helpline</a> can be reached on 03003300630</em></p> <p><em>Queer Intentions: A (Personal) Journey Through LGBTQ+ Culture by Amelia Abraham is out now</em></p>",

As a gay woman, and a fan of the show, I didn\u2019t give it much more than an eye-roll, until Sandra Oh, in an interview with Gay Times, denied that there were lesbian undertones: \u201cYou guys are tricky because you want to make it into something \u2026 but it just isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. It makes you wonder: then why are you marketing it as such? This queerbaiting is not a new phenomenon. Cast your mind back to Madonna and Britney kissing at the MTV video music awards, Tatu\u2019s entire pop career, Demi Lovato\u2019s Really Don\u2019t Care video and Nick Jonas\u2019s album campaigns over the last few years, in which he has honed in on his gay fanbase, despite having high-profile relationships with women. Lately, queerbaiting seems to have reached its peak. Especially when you look at the number of brands getting on board with sponsoring Pride, or creating some kind of product that supposedly endorses Pride\u2019s values. Like Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s recent release of an LGBT sandwich (lettuce, guacamole, bacon and tomato, in case you were wondering) or Sainsburys\u2019 strange and superficial series of instore posters saying it supports LGBTQ+ rights, with very little context. Pride in London has lent itself to branded causes repeatedly: 2016\u2019s Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie float, or 2017\u2019s Minions. It has basically become a parade of glorified adverts for things that are in no way queer. According to Forbes, a 2018 US survey by Community Marketing and Insights found that more than 75% of LGBT Americans will spend more with a company that supports equality, and one-third of consumers in the US feel more positive about a brand that supports Pride. \u201cBrands are always looking for ways to engage new audiences in order to grow revenue. That\u2019s marketing and that\u2019s business,\u201d says Stephen Lepitak, editor at ad industry publication The Drum. \u201cHowever when they decide to get on board \u2018a purpose\u2019 and align with an aspect of society, they must be careful not to do it tokenistically. There has to be a reason for them to align that makes sense, otherwise they risk alienating people as it will ring false.\u201d British Airways, for instance, has come under fire for sponsoring Pride when their planes deport LGBTQ+ migrants from the UK. Primark has also been accused of \u201cpinkwashing\u201d its brand by releasing Pride collections and not donating the proceeds to charity. It is easy to criticise faceless big brands for co-opting LGBTQ+ causes, but when it comes to specific celebrities, complications arise when we don\u2019t consider how someone might have felt the need quash their own desire due to social stigma or the entertainment industry\u2019s prejudice. For example, Rita Ora\u2019s 2018 song Girls was unanimously criticised for perpetuating stereotypes of drunken, faux-lesbian hookups, prompting the singer to come out as bisexual. Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz got similarly slammed for playing a lesbian in the film The Miseducation of Cameron Post and was later pictured kissing a girl. There is a delicate line to tread between policing people\u2019s affiliation with certain labels and holding them accountable for earning the title of ally if they want to use it. So, what should we think about We Need to Calm Down? There is some authenticity, albeit borrowed: the fact that Ellen, Laverne and Billy Porter appear does lend the video some credibility. She also has a cause: the video promotes a petition for the US Senate to recognise the Equality Act; and Swift put her money where her mouth is, making a donation to the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (Glaad). However, unlike longstanding queer ally Lady Gaga, it could be said that Swift hadn\u2019t really nurtured her gay fanbase enough before the video dropped. You cannot just suddenly decide to be a queer ally and earn the title overnight. Buttering queer fans up with a Jonathan Van Ness collaboration or getting caught sniffing some poppers might have helped, but better yet, would have been using the last 10 years of her career to peddle the message that gay is OK. The real test will be how she uses the next 10. \u2022 The UK LGBT+ helpline can be reached on 03003300630 Queer Intentions: A (Personal) Journey Through LGBTQ+ Culture by Amelia Abraham is out now",

The prime minister led a session on the environment at the G20 summit in Osaka, which will be one of her final appearances on the world stage. In the G20 communique, which was agreed after many hours of wrangling among the \u201csherpas\u201d, who represent the group\u2019s member states, 19 of the 20 reiterated their commitment to the Paris accord. The final wording echoed a statement from the last G20 summit, in Buenos Aires, but government sources suggested some countries, including the US, India and China, had tried to water it down. The US president had sought to excise the reference to the Paris agreement from the communique altogether, with the help of several other countries, reportedly including Brazil and Turkey. May said she was pleased there was a communique at all. At her press conference at the end of the summit, the prime minister said: \u201cIn recent months we have heard hundreds of thousands of young people urge us \u2013 their leaders \u2013 to act on climate change before it\u2019s too late. \u201cI am proud that the UK has now enshrined in law our world-leading net zero commitment to reduce emissions. And I have called on other countries to raise their ambition and embrace this target,\u201d she said. The prime minister said the communique showed the 19 members\u2019 continued support for the Paris agreement and she stressed the importance of cooperation with other countries. \u201cI firmly believe in the importance of international cooperation and compromise. In Osaka this week we have worked hard to bridge differences between G20 countries on some of the biggest challenges our nations face. \u201cThat has not been easy but we have made progress. I continue to believe that we are stronger when we work together.\u201d May did not have a formal bilateral meeting with Trump at the summit, but said she had held discussions with him, and pointed out that he had visited the UK earlier this month. Earlier, a senior UK official said of the communique: \u201cI think it was a long night for the sherpas and I think it\u2019s definitely a challenging process but work is ongoing in relation to the communique so we\u2019ll have to see where we end up.\u201d He said the UK had pushed for \u201cthe strongest wording we can deliver\u201d. May has embraced the cause of tackling climate change as her three-year premiership draws to a close \u2013 telling journalists en route to Japan that she had been inspired on her walking holidays in Switzerland by seeing the rapid rate at which a glacier had receded over the past decade.",

      "body": "<p>The 2019 edition of La Course by the Tour de France turns the spotlight on the <em>puncheurs</em>, the explosive all-rounders who make the most of every attacking opportunity. Riders such as a resurgent Marianne Vos, or the Women\u2019s World Tour leader Annemiek van Vleuten, will be looking to cross the finishing line in Pau before their rivals from the 15 Women\u2019s World Tour teams who are slated to appear.</p> <p>This year\u2019s one-day race moves away from the pancake-flat cobbles of the first three editions and the high altitude theatrics of last year\u2019s duel in the Alps to a more dynamic circuit course with the climb of the 307m C\u00f4te d\u2019Esquillot likely to prove decisive. La Course will follow the route of the only time trial in the 2019 men\u2019s Tour de France, riding the same testing circuit through the rolling hills around Pau.

      "bodyText": "The 2019 edition of La Course by the Tour de France turns the spotlight on the puncheurs, the explosive all-rounders who make the most of every attacking opportunity. Riders such as a resurgent Marianne Vos, or the Women\u2019s World Tour leader Annemiek van Vleuten, will be looking to cross the finishing line in Pau before their rivals from the 15 Women\u2019s World Tour teams who are slated to appear. This year\u2019s one-day race moves away from the pancake-flat cobbles of the first three editions and the high altitude theatrics of last year\u2019s duel in the Alps to a more dynamic circuit course with the climb of the 307m C\u00f4te d\u2019Esquillot likely to prove decisive. La Course will follow the route of the only time trial in the 2019 men\u2019s Tour de France, riding the same testing circuit through the rolling hills around Pau. Shifting date to align with the men\u2019s race on 19 July, La Course narrowly avoids an overlap with the Giro Rosa, the biggest stage race in the women\u2019s cycling calendar.

      "body": "<p>During the day the Holbeck industrial zone looks pretty innocuous. Perched on the southern edge of Leeds city centre, it backs on to residential streets peppered with betting shops, newsagents and takeaways. </p> <p>Yet at night this industrial zone becomes something very different. It transforms into the UK\u2019s first designated red light zone where, between the hours of 8pm-6am, street prostitution operates openly with neither the women nor the sex buyers facing prosecution.</p> <p>Prostitution is not illegal in the UK but related activities, such as soliciting in a public place, pimping and kerb crawling, are unlawful. By suspending these laws and creating a wholly decriminalised market for prostitution, this radical approach \u2013 known as the \u201cmanaged zone\u201d \u2013 has transformed a banal square mile of industrial buildings and scrubland into an ideological battleground, revealing the bitter divisions over the response to prostitution in the UK.</p> <p>Five years on, as Leeds city council faces a firestorm of opposition and an inquiry is opened into the future of the zone, I went back to Leeds to see how the managed zone has affected the lives of those who live and work around Holbeck.</p> <p>For the women who work in the zone at night, the biggest change is that they no longer face the prospect of arrest. Sarah* worked the streets of Holbeck \u201cthree or four times a week\u201d until last December to fund her and her boyfriend\u2019s heroin and crack cocaine use.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ea6ad9dd0fccb9425edf9c144a16de28ca27031\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ea6ad9dd0fccb9425edf9c144a16de28ca27031/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The designated safe passageway through the Holbeck area\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The designated safe passageway through the Holbeck area.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She says that before the managed approach was introduced, things were awful. Now she doesn\u2019t have to worry about the police.</p> <p>\u201cI was constantly looking over my shoulder, worried about getting picked up by police,\u201d she says. \u201cI was arrested something like 20 times in the five years I was doing it, and I could never pay the fine, so they would come looking for me and I\u2019d sometimes get arrested again.\u201d</p> <p>The managed approach was launched by Leeds city council in 2014 after research found that efforts to reduce prostitution weren\u2019t working.</p> <p>Those who support the managed zone passionately believe that what is happening in Holbeck is an opportunity to make life safer for the women working there. Equally fierce opponents \u2013 of which I am one \u2013 believe it has created an open street market for sex buyers and promotes trafficking and exploitation in one of the UK\u2019s biggest cities.</p> <p>I ask Sarah if she feels safer working in the zone as opposed to outside of it.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about safe, but I hate being arrested. It makes me feel like dirt,\u201d she says. \u201cThe punters are just the same, they\u2019re pretty horrible, but I don\u2019t see any other way it can be done. I don\u2019t want to get arrested, and a lot of the girls say that the police used to pick on them because they just thought they were scum. To be honest, I don\u2019t think the zone can really do anything other than keep it contained for a while.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"024eaf4e161490e824a2206fd95baff77c2f14f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/024eaf4e161490e824a2206fd95baff77c2f14f4/0_0_6570_4380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Discarded condoms in Holbeck\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We see condoms and needles all over the place,\u2019 says one Holbeck businessman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Basis Sex Work, a pro-sex work NGO receiving funding from the city council to provide services to women on the zone, believes the approach has helped women report violent punters to the police. One <a href=\"https://www.swrh.co.uk/blog\">report</a> claims that since the launch of the zone, women are now six times more likely to report violent crime than they were in 2013.</p> <p>Its chief executive, Gemma Scir\u00e9, says that the zone has made a crucial difference to their work, helping them reach women who are in desperate need of essential services and support.</p> <p>\u201cWe give out alarms, we take crime reports and make sure when it\u2019s cold or hot that they have the basic human necessities of food, drink, warm clothes,\u201d she says. \u201cWe help them navigate the legal system.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8a1b0a4d889b1d0c22a1bb6b565498047ba16392\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a1b0a4d889b1d0c22a1bb6b565498047ba16392/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Independent Leeds city councillor Mark Dobson\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leeds city councillor Mark Dobson, who was one of the main champions of the zone when it launched.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scir\u00e9 and I fundamentally disagree on what is happening in the zone. She doesn\u2019t consider the work that the women are doing to be exploitation and insists that from their experience those in the zone are working freely and without coercion. Yet she demurs when I ask her whether the managed zone is working out the way she thought it would.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t give you a yes or no,\u201d she says. \u201cIt works in some ways, but it needs more work.\u201d</p> <p>Others who were involved in designing and launching the zone are less circumspect.</p> <p>Mark Dobson works for Leeds city council and was one of the main architects and champions of the zone when it launched.</p> <p>But now he\u2019s changed his mind. He was badly shaken by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/04/man-guilty-murder-sex-worker-leeds-daria-pionko-lewis-pierre\">murder of Daria Pionko</a>, a Polish woman working in the zone who was battered to death by a sex buyer just a few months after the zone became operational. He says he is dismayed by what he has seen unfold on the streets of Holbeck since, including reports of increased sexual assaults and <a href=\"https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest/rapist-jailed-jailed-for-brutal-attack-on-leeds-sex-worker-1-7567724\">rapes</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople told me that we were supporting the women, and moving away from a very draconian system where the women were being punished by the police,\u201d says Dobson. \u201cIn fact, what\u2019s happened is the amnesty has clearly been there for the men, but I can\u2019t see anything tangible that\u2019s been done on the other side of the equation to take women out of prostitution.\u201d</p> <p>Leeds city council has also failed to stem the rising tide of local anger towards the zone.</p> <p>Ian Staines set up a flooring business 1993, in the heart of what would become the managed zone. When I visit him at his place of work, he says that the impact of the zone on him and other residents has been traumatic. He says after a local woman was raped in 2018 on her way home from work by a group of men who assumed she was soliciting, many don\u2019t consider their community a safe place to live.</p> <p>\u201cMurder, serious assault, and rapes have all taken place on the zone. We see condoms and needles all over the place, and even human faeces,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7db509b8f76e69d92db10c9e85ca9f6803925359\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7db509b8f76e69d92db10c9e85ca9f6803925359/0_0_6570_4380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Discarded needles in Holbeck\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Discarded needles in Holbeck.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There have been no arrests or investigations for sex trafficking or pimping since the zone opened. Yet despite this, Staines says that he, like many other locals, are worried about what might be happening to the women working there at night. One woman who used to work in the zone told me that she saw busloads of Romanian women brought into the zone at night and picked up in the morning. Nigel Perry, another Holbeck resident who has lived in the community 50 years in a small terrace house a quarter of a mile from the zone, is also alarmed by what he is seeing.</p> <p>\u201cNext door to me there are two or three young Romanian women. I have only ever seen one of them leave the house in months, and she was accompanied by a man. I worry that they are trafficked. Men come to the house all hours of the day and night. I don\u2019t think the women can speak any English.\u201d</p> <p>Supporters of the zone point to the lack of arrests of pimps or traffickers as evidence that no criminality is occurring in the zone. But Kevin Hyland, the former anti-slavery commissioner who headed up the Metropolitan Police anti-trafficking unit, says this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not going on. According to an all-party parliamentary group on prostitution and the global sex trade in 2018, sex trafficking is happening on an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/21/sexual-exploitation-uk-women-pop-up-brothels-report\">industrial scale</a>\u201d across the UK, going undetected by police officers and ignored by punters.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence \u2013 I\u2019ve seen it firsthand myself \u2013 that taking a hands-off approach, and effectively removing law enforcement increases the flow of trafficking,\u201d he says. \u201cIf demand is not challenged, then sexual exploitation will continue and will increase.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"941db679a2a314c2f3f5eb0d928c9a36d64ef816\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/941db679a2a314c2f3f5eb0d928c9a36d64ef816/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A prostitute waits for a customer on the streets of Holbeck\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Basis, a pro-sex work organisation, says the zone means women are no longer arrested and stigmatised.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I ask Gemma Scir\u00e9 about rumours of trafficking. She calls it a \u201cvery difficult term\u201d and says that in their experience, the majority of women working in the zone are doing so of their own free will. Scir\u00e9 says there are \u201cmigrant sex workers\u201d in the zone who come from countries such as Romania and Poland and says they don\u2019t have much contact with them because \u201cclearly they are fearful of authorities because of previous experience in their own countries\u201d.</p> <p>For Basis, the benefits of the zone are that women are no longer being arrested and stigmatised, has better access to its services, and can be helped to find alternatives to prostitution. But what about the punters?</p> <p>On a street just outside of the zone, a lone man sits in his car, hazard lights on. I asked if he would be happy to talk to me about coming to the zone to pay for sex. I explained I was a journalist, and he agreed to talk.</p> <p>\u201cI get lonely,\u201d says Henry*, \u201cbut I\u2019m too selfish to put up with somebody 24-hours a day. I like female company so this is a good arrangement. They get money for their drugs or whatever, and I can release some frustration. Mind you, some of the girls don\u2019t make any effort at all.\u201d</p> <p>I asked Henry if any of the women have pimps. \u201cMost have a pimp or a boyfriend who\u2019s sending her out for his drugs,\u201d he says. He tells me that he has witnessed a lot of violence on the zone from \u201cangry, drunken blokes\u201d. I asked if he often sees police in the area, and he tells me \u201cno\u201d. \u201cThey ride around sometimes just so they are seen, but other than that, we can do what we like. That\u2019s how it should be, it\u2019s a free country.\u201d</p> <p>Does it work, I ask Henry? \u201cIt works for me,\u201d he says.</p> <p><em>*Names have been changed to protect identities</em></p>",

By suspending these laws and creating a wholly decriminalised market for prostitution, this radical approach \u2013 known as the \u201cmanaged zone\u201d \u2013 has transformed a banal square mile of industrial buildings and scrubland into an ideological battleground, revealing the bitter divisions over the response to prostitution in the UK. Five years on, as Leeds city council faces a firestorm of opposition and an inquiry is opened into the future of the zone, I went back to Leeds to see how the managed zone has affected the lives of those who live and work around Holbeck. For the women who work in the zone at night, the biggest change is that they no longer face the prospect of arrest. Sarah* worked the streets of Holbeck \u201cthree or four times a week\u201d until last December to fund her and her boyfriend\u2019s heroin and crack cocaine use. She says that before the managed approach was introduced, things were awful. Now she doesn\u2019t have to worry about the police. \u201cI was constantly looking over my shoulder, worried about getting picked up by police,\u201d she says. \u201cI was arrested something like 20 times in the five years I was doing it, and I could never pay the fine, so they would come looking for me and I\u2019d sometimes get arrested again.\u201d The managed approach was launched by Leeds city council in 2014 after research found that efforts to reduce prostitution weren\u2019t working. Those who support the managed zone passionately believe that what is happening in Holbeck is an opportunity to make life safer for the women working there. Equally fierce opponents \u2013 of which I am one \u2013 believe it has created an open street market for sex buyers and promotes trafficking and exploitation in one of the UK\u2019s biggest cities. I ask Sarah if she feels safer working in the zone as opposed to outside of it. \u201cI don\u2019t know about safe, but I hate being arrested. It makes me feel like dirt,\u201d she says. \u201cThe punters are just the same, they\u2019re pretty horrible, but I don\u2019t see any other way it can be done. I don\u2019t want to get arrested, and a lot of the girls say that the police used to pick on them because they just thought they were scum. To be honest, I don\u2019t think the zone can really do anything other than keep it contained for a while.\u201d Basis Sex Work, a pro-sex work NGO receiving funding from the city council to provide services to women on the zone, believes the approach has helped women report violent punters to the police. One report claims that since the launch of the zone, women are now six times more likely to report violent crime than they were in 2013. Its chief executive, Gemma Scir\u00e9, says that the zone has made a crucial difference to their work, helping them reach women who are in desperate need of essential services and support. \u201cWe give out alarms, we take crime reports and make sure when it\u2019s cold or hot that they have the basic human necessities of food, drink, warm clothes,\u201d she says. \u201cWe help them navigate the legal system.\u201d Scir\u00e9 and I fundamentally disagree on what is happening in the zone. She doesn\u2019t consider the work that the women are doing to be exploitation and insists that from their experience those in the zone are working freely and without coercion. Yet she demurs when I ask her whether the managed zone is working out the way she thought it would. \u201cI can\u2019t give you a yes or no,\u201d she says. \u201cIt works in some ways, but it needs more work.\u201d Others who were involved in designing and launching the zone are less circumspect. Mark Dobson works for Leeds city council and was one of the main architects and champions of the zone when it launched. But now he\u2019s changed his mind. He was badly shaken by the murder of Daria Pionko, a Polish woman working in the zone who was battered to death by a sex buyer just a few months after the zone became operational. He says he is dismayed by what he has seen unfold on the streets of Holbeck since, including reports of increased sexual assaults and rapes. \u201cPeople told me that we were supporting the women, and moving away from a very draconian system where the women were being punished by the police,\u201d says Dobson. \u201cIn fact, what\u2019s happened is the amnesty has clearly been there for the men, but I can\u2019t see anything tangible that\u2019s been done on the other side of the equation to take women out of prostitution.\u201d Leeds city council has also failed to stem the rising tide of local anger towards the zone. Ian Staines set up a flooring business 1993, in the heart of what would become the managed zone. When I visit him at his place of work, he says that the impact of the zone on him and other residents has been traumatic. He says after a local woman was raped in 2018 on her way home from work by a group of men who assumed she was soliciting, many don\u2019t consider their community a safe place to live. \u201cMurder, serious assault, and rapes have all taken place on the zone. We see condoms and needles all over the place, and even human faeces,\u201d he says. There have been no arrests or investigations for sex trafficking or pimping since the zone opened. Yet despite this, Staines says that he, like many other locals, are worried about what might be happening to the women working there at night. One woman who used to work in the zone told me that she saw busloads of Romanian women brought into the zone at night and picked up in the morning. Nigel Perry, another Holbeck resident who has lived in the community 50 years in a small terrace house a quarter of a mile from the zone, is also alarmed by what he is seeing. \u201cNext door to me there are two or three young Romanian women. I have only ever seen one of them leave the house in months, and she was accompanied by a man. I worry that they are trafficked. Men come to the house all hours of the day and night. I don\u2019t think the women can speak any English.\u201d Supporters of the zone point to the lack of arrests of pimps or traffickers as evidence that no criminality is occurring in the zone. But Kevin Hyland, the former anti-slavery commissioner who headed up the Metropolitan Police anti-trafficking unit, says this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not going on. According to an all-party parliamentary group on prostitution and the global sex trade in 2018, sex trafficking is happening on an \u201cindustrial scale\u201d across the UK, going undetected by police officers and ignored by punters. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence \u2013 I\u2019ve seen it firsthand myself \u2013 that taking a hands-off approach, and effectively removing law enforcement increases the flow of trafficking,\u201d he says. \u201cIf demand is not challenged, then sexual exploitation will continue and will increase.\u201d I ask Gemma Scir\u00e9 about rumours of trafficking. She calls it a \u201cvery difficult term\u201d and says that in their experience, the majority of women working in the zone are doing so of their own free will. Scir\u00e9 says there are \u201cmigrant sex workers\u201d in the zone who come from countries such as Romania and Poland and says they don\u2019t have much contact with them because \u201cclearly they are fearful of authorities because of previous experience in their own countries\u201d. For Basis, the benefits of the zone are that women are no longer being arrested and stigmatised, has better access to its services, and can be helped to find alternatives to prostitution. But what about the punters? On a street just outside of the zone, a lone man sits in his car, hazard lights on. I asked if he would be happy to talk to me about coming to the zone to pay for sex. I explained I was a journalist, and he agreed to talk. \u201cI get lonely,\u201d says Henry*, \u201cbut I\u2019m too selfish to put up with somebody 24-hours a day. I like female company so this is a good arrangement. They get money for their drugs or whatever, and I can release some frustration. Mind you, some of the girls don\u2019t make any effort at all.\u201d I asked Henry if any of the women have pimps. \u201cMost have a pimp or a boyfriend who\u2019s sending her out for his drugs,\u201d he says. He tells me that he has witnessed a lot of violence on the zone from \u201cangry, drunken blokes\u201d. I asked if he often sees police in the area, and he tells me \u201cno\u201d. \u201cThey ride around sometimes just so they are seen, but other than that, we can do what we like. That\u2019s how it should be, it\u2019s a free country.\u201d Does it work, I ask Henry? \u201cIt works for me,\u201d he says. *Names have been changed to protect identities",

So once the notion that God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit were all equal persons of the Trinity was established it became natural to seek confirmation of that doctrine in the Bible.</p> <p>The Epistles of St Paul were probably written not long after the death of Christ, in the AD40s or 50s.

And the Gospel of John was possibly written as late as the second century. It presents a Jesus who talks a great deal about his own status as God\u2019s son. This more likely reflects the beliefs of a later era than that of Jesus himself, and John\u2019s gospel may indeed be a biography of Christ written to suit the interests and beliefs of John\u2019s own particular branch of Christianity. The episode of the woman taken in adultery \u2013 \u201cHe that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her\u201d \u2013 which appears only in this gospel, is not found in the earliest manuscripts, and is likely to be an even later addition.</p> <p>Does this mean that Barton\u2019s history of the Bible provides an armoury of arguments for religious sceptics? Well, the sceptical will certainly find material here to deploy. But Barton \u2013 who is an Anglican with Lutheran leanings \u2013 believes that it\u2019s perfectly possible to see the Bible as a book with its own history and also to regard it as a repository of religious truths.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/14/what-is-the-historical-evidence-that-jesus-christ-lived-and-died\">What is the historical evidence that Jesus Christ lived and died?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He views the New Testament as a collection of records written by different people, probably for different religious communities, at different times. The gospels were preserved not in scrolls but in codices \u2013 bound volumes with separate leaves \u2013 and were \u201cnot fixed Scripture but simply the reminiscences of the Apostles\u201d. That explains why they can be internally inconsistent, but also how they can be thought of as texts that give a range of different angles on the life of Christ, even if they don\u2019t all relate (in that common phrase) the gospel truth.</p> <p>Barton opposes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/danbrown\" title=\"\">Dan Brown</a>-style conspiracy theorists who think that some time in the fourth century a powerful church suppressed a range of heterodox scriptures and created the New Testament as we now know it. He argues convincingly that by the second century there was a loose canon of holy books that were broadly similar to those included in the Bible today.</p> <p>Although Barton is a Christian he\u2019s also an excellent guide to the composition of what is usually called the \u201cOld Testament\u201d \u2013 though, as he reminds us, that name implies that the Hebrew Bible (as he prefers to call it) is no more than a precursor to the New Testament. Early Christian thinkers saw it this way. They regarded the life of Christ as the great truth towards which the Hebrew prophets and scriptures pointed, and which superseded the old faith and its laws. They read the Hebrew Bible as a story of disobedience and falling: Adam and Eve fell, and then Christ reversed the effects of that fall. That could go along with hostility to Jewish beliefs, and even antisemitism. For the majority of Jews, however, the Hebrew Bible was \u201cnot at all about fall and redemption, but about how to live a faithful life in the ups and downs of the ongoing history of the people of Israel\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Barton has little time for literalists who believe that the Bible's every word is\u00a0sacred</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Hebrew Bible itself developed over a long period, probably from about the eighth to the second century BC. Barton suggests that the Book of Proverbs may well have been produced by something like Israel\u2019s civil service. Job and Ecclesiastes are much later works, possibly written by individuals. The Psalter, a mixture of liturgy, national history and individual experience, which Barton describes as \u201ca mess\u201d, probably came together in about 300BC, although individual psalms may be much older than this.</p> <p>The historical method of analysing layers of composition in the Bible even casts a faint shadow over the Ten Commandments. They are delivered on tablets of stone to an early itinerant nation. But since they include the commandment \u201cThou shalt not covet thy neighbour\u2019s house ... nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass\u201d, they imply \u201ca settled agrarian community\u201d.</p> <p>If the tablets of stone of the decalogue seem to crumble at the edges when the Bible is subjected to historical analysis, then Barton\u2019s readers might wonder how religious faith can coexist with a Bible that is regarded as an internally contradictory text with a long history and diverse cultural origins.</p> <p>Sceptics, indeed, might find in his magisterial overview of the history of the Bible clear evidence that orthodox religions are grounded in the beliefs of communities rather than in a single authoritative text that records the word of God.</p> <p>Believers, on the other hand, might follow him in taking a flexible view of the Bible as a collection of texts that preserve reminiscences of the life of Jesus and about God and how to worship him. Barton says this history is \u201cthe story of the interplay between religion and the book \u2013 neither mapping exactly onto the other\u201d. Problems arise when interpreters try to impose orthodox religious beliefs on its text: \u201cThe extreme diversity of the material in the Bible is not to be reduced by extracting essential principles, but embraced as a celebration of variety.\u201d</p> <p>That might sound like wishy-washy Anglicanism. But there is a lot of argumentative muscle in Barton\u2019s book. He aims to \u201cdispel the image of the Bible as a sacred monolith between two black leather covers\u201d. So he has little time for fundamentalists and Biblical literalists who believe that its every word is sacred. He also doesn\u2019t have much patience with devotees of the Authorised Version. He quotes a billboard outside a Baptist church in North Carolina that says: \u201cAre you tired of hearing your pastor correct the preserved word of God (the Authorised King James Version) with the Greek or other translations?\u201d, which seems to suggest that the Authorised Version is the original and not a translation from Greek. And it is not always the best translation: the vigour of William Tyndale\u2019s description of Joseph (\u201cthe Lord was with Joseph and he was a lucky fellow\u201d) makes the Alternative Version seem stodgy and corporate: \u201cJoseph was a goodly person, and well-favoured.\u201d</p> <p>Two aspects of his account are particularly impressive. One is its phenomenal range of learning. The other is the moderation and quiet wisdom with which it conveys that learning. Barton knows he\u2019s tiptoeing through a minefield. His way through is to sift evidence carefully, and to be aware of ways in which his own religious position might influence his interpretation of this most complex and contentious of texts. He believes the Bible \u201cpresents a range of ideas about Jesus and about God that cannot be systematised\u201d. His belief in the plurality of the texts gathered together as <em>Ta Biblia</em> (Greek for \u201cthe books\u201d \u2013 so the very title of the Bible is plural) brings with it a respectful pluralism in his attitudes towards religious faiths. So this is a heavy book from which believers and non-believers can both learn.

To my mind, this meme celebrated the chagrin of millions, nay, billions of millennial and generation Y frontline service-industry workers, for whom the scourge of their lives was a 45-year-old woman who might have waited more than 17 minutes to return a faulty five-blade spiralizer because their shop was understaffed.</p> <p>When Karen doubts the sincerity of the server\u2019s apology, she goes into some sort of red-mist meltdown.

The altercation might also take place via a call centre, in a restaurant or at the gym. Basically, anywhere that people work doing jobs they don\u2019t enjoy, earning wages that won\u2019t buy homes, rubbing up against older women fighting spiralling oestrogen, a maze-like diary of thankless bloody chores and the underlying emotion that they\u2019re as mad as hell and not going to take this any more.</p> <p>I get this.

Oh, no. Not me, not Karen. All together now, clear throats, full hearts: \u201cCaaaaaaaaan I speak to the maaaaaanager?\u201d</p> <p>On the surface, the Karen meme may well be about clashing generations: the useless Ys, the grumpy Xs, the selfish boomers and, of course, the millennials, who are the go-to punchbag when it comes to workplace fecklessness (despite some now being 36 years old, with greying hair and teenage children). But for me, the more interesting underbelly points to the essential brokenness of modern life: the corporate greed that fostered an I-Want-It-Now culture, and a low-paid, uninspired, gig economy. Longer days, busier lives, more uncertainty, less joy, more fighting with Karen. The unstoppable force of global consumerism, which leads to 22-year-olds running around an Amazon fulfilment centre, and an immovable mass of knackered gen-X women dealing with three jobs, sick parents and now a missing Where\u2019s Wally? outfit on Amazon Prime one-hour specified delivery, the evening before World Book Day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/22/gwyneth-paltrow-happier-living-apart-from-partner-grace-dent\">Gwyneth Paltrow is right - living apart from my partner is like having my cake and eating it | Grace Dent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Karen, according to the meme, is ostensibly female and white \u2013 but is anyone these days above entering Deep Karen Mode?

      "bodyText": "A globally viral meme making my heart zing over recent years is the \u201cCan I speak to the manager?\u201d one, in which a generation X white woman called Karen escalates a minor consumer gripe to the highest level, from beneath a heaving two-tone choppy bob. The hair is an attempt to stay youthful, but appears to have been dyed and styled by ebullient badgers. More of Karen later. Memes were once just people \u201cdicking about on the internet\u201d, yet are now one of the Earth\u2019s most valuable forms of communication. They distil into a single image, or loop of video, an obscure yet still universally understood circumstance, often involving emotions that actual human words cannot quite nail. Thus a blinking blond man channels the incredulity on reading a credit card bill. Donald Glover brings pizza cheerfully back into a room that is now on fire. A dachshund with a large ugly shoe on its head tells people, \u201cIt\u2019s called fashion, Brenda, look it up.\u201d Gen X \u201cKaren\u201d appeared back in 2014, wanting to speak to the manager. To my mind, this meme celebrated the chagrin of millions, nay, billions of millennial and generation Y frontline service-industry workers, for whom the scourge of their lives was a 45-year-old woman who might have waited more than 17 minutes to return a faulty five-blade spiralizer because their shop was understaffed. When Karen doubts the sincerity of the server\u2019s apology, she goes into some sort of red-mist meltdown. Later, she will cry in her VW up! in the car park, listening to Michael Bubl\u00e9 \u2013 but right now, she\u2019s on fire. The altercation might also take place via a call centre, in a restaurant or at the gym. Basically, anywhere that people work doing jobs they don\u2019t enjoy, earning wages that won\u2019t buy homes, rubbing up against older women fighting spiralling oestrogen, a maze-like diary of thankless bloody chores and the underlying emotion that they\u2019re as mad as hell and not going to take this any more. I get this. On several occasions, Je suis Karen. And quickening like the quickening spring, you bright young thing will one day become Karen, too. Yes, you with your upright tits who, right now, would merely shrug meaningfully at, say, wasting 7am-6pm waiting for a refrigerator delivery (from a youth on \u00a37.67 per hour), only to have it cancelled on some trumped-up balderdash. Oh, no. Not me, not Karen. All together now, clear throats, full hearts: \u201cCaaaaaaaaan I speak to the maaaaaanager?\u201d On the surface, the Karen meme may well be about clashing generations: the useless Ys, the grumpy Xs, the selfish boomers and, of course, the millennials, who are the go-to punchbag when it comes to workplace fecklessness (despite some now being 36 years old, with greying hair and teenage children). But for me, the more interesting underbelly points to the essential brokenness of modern life: the corporate greed that fostered an I-Want-It-Now culture, and a low-paid, uninspired, gig economy. Longer days, busier lives, more uncertainty, less joy, more fighting with Karen. The unstoppable force of global consumerism, which leads to 22-year-olds running around an Amazon fulfilment centre, and an immovable mass of knackered gen-X women dealing with three jobs, sick parents and now a missing Where\u2019s Wally? outfit on Amazon Prime one-hour specified delivery, the evening before World Book Day. Karen, according to the meme, is ostensibly female and white \u2013 but is anyone these days above entering Deep Karen Mode? Has your Deliveroo dinner been left in a hedge? Did your Uber driver go awol then take his \u00a36 for the trouble? Has your wifi been playing up for a week, and do the helpline staff seem unbothered? Can you feel a storm a-brewing? Is it time to use that special, sharp-elbowed voice? That voice so many of us learned from our mothers, usually in Marks &amp; Spencer in 1983, watching them return substandard items, without a receipt, powered only by solid, weapons-grade older-lady ire. Is it time to speak to the manager? Of course, long after the matter has been settled, a refund or an apology issued, I\u2019m often reminded that nobody involved was a winner. We are all merely pawns in a bigger, complex game. Last week I did speak to the manager, who says my fridge is definitely coming next Tuesday and he will refund the cost of the previous non-delivery. I plan to stay in all day, channelling Zen-like empathy, listening to my Calm App, remembering that my item is being delivered at breakneck speed by a person who feasibly has a back injury from delivering fridges. Someone who may have worked till 10pm yesterday, and without holiday for months, and who may not arrive that day, if ever. Someone who is also a human being. My perishable goods may be wilting, but for now, I am staying chilled.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump is coming to the end of a wide-ranging press conference in which he has covered much of what he\u2019s discussed at the G20 summit in Japan. Here\u2019s a summary of what he\u2019s touched on. Trump says for the moment there will be no further tariffs imposed on China. You can read our full report on this here. The US president says that negotiations about telco giant Huawei will be left to the end of the negotiations with China. In the mean time he has allowed US companies to sell equipment to Huawei. Trump says he hopes to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, tomorrow when he visits the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea. He says it will be a short meeting and he would like to \u201cshake his hand\u201d. Trump said the North Koreans have \u201ccontacted us to say they\u2019d like to do something\u201d. On meeting the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, Trump says the Saudis have been a \u201cterrific ally\u201d of the US but that he was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d about the murder of the Saudi dissident, Jamal Khashoggi. Earlier Trump said the crown prince was doing a \u201cspectacular job\u201d. Asked about former US president Jimmy Carter\u2019s comments that Trump was an \u201cillegitimate president\u201d because of Russian interference in the election, he said he expected that kind of thing from a Democrat, but reiterated that he was in power \u201cnot because of Russia but because of myself\u201d. US-Iran Trump is being asked about calling off the strike on Iran, after ships were hit by mines in the Straights of Hormuz. \u201cWhen we chose certain areas (to strike) ... I asked how many people were going to die.\u201d Trump said he was told it could be 150 people and he said he thought the deaths that a strike might cause were \u201cdisproportionate\u201d, and as result the strike did not happen. Trump says he is leaving the full negotiation over Huawei until the end fo the negotiations with China, but he\u2019s not giving anything more away on that except to say that the negotiations are complex. Trump is now being asked about the deal he has done about Huawei. \u201cUS companies can sell their equipment to Huawei. I am talking about equipment where there is no great national emergency problem with it, but the US companies can sell their equipment, so we have a lot of the great companies in Silicon Valley based in different parts of the country that make extremely complex equipment,\u201d he says. One of the US-based reporters is now asking Trump about the US Democratic debates of potential frontrunners to challenge Trump. He\u2019s been asked if Kamala Harris might be a tough opponent: \u201cYou never know who will be tough. You never know.\u201d Now Trump is talking about Iran. He says he thinks they would like to \u201cdo a deal with the US\u201d. Will it be a bad sign if Kim doesn\u2019t show? Trump says Kim follows him on Twitter. \u201cThey\u2019ve contacted us to say they\u2019d like to do something\u201d Trump says. Trump reiterates that he has great relations with everyone. Trump is asked if he condemned the killing of Saudi dissent writer Jamal Khashoggi. Trump says he thinks what happened to the write was \u201chorrible\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m very unhappy about that whole event,\u201d he says, but adds that \u201cNo one has directly pointed a finger at the future king of Saudi Arabia.\u201d He also says the Kingdom has been a \u201cterrific ally\u201d of the US. He continued: \u201cI am extremely angry and unhappy about anything like that taking place, but as this moment, more than 13 people are being prosecuted and I hear the number is going to be going up but it is a good question.\u201d Trump also says he has a good relationship with President Putin. \u201cYou are going to have to take a look at the words, we had a discussion, we had a great discussion President Putin and myself, I thought it was a tremendous discussion, and he would like to trade with United States and they have great products, rangeland, very rich land and a lot of oil, a of minerals, the things that we like, and I can see trade going on with Russia, we could do fantastically well. We do very little trade with Russia, so I could see positive things happening.\u201d Trump has moved back to President Xi. He says he has a \u201ctremendous\u201d relationship with Xi, and also with Mohammed Bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince. Trump is now being asked about the election and Russia in relation to Jimmy Carter\u2019s comments that Trump was an \u201cillegitimate president\u201d. He was critical of Carter saying he expected that kind of thing from a Democrat. \u201cI won not because of Russia but because of myself. I campaigned harder,\u201d he said. Donald Trump says he did discuss Huawei with China but didn\u2019t talk directly about the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou detained in Canada. Trump goes back to the China trade tariffs. He says of Beijing: \u201cWe\u2019re going to hold on our tariffs. It doesn\u2019t mean that it is going to be a deal, but they would like to make a deal i can tell you that. It would be a very historic event. We\u2019ve never really had a deal with China.\u201d Trump says he may or may not be meeting Kim Jong-un tomorrow. He\u2019s about to start taking questions. The first question is about what China is demanding in return for further tariffs not being imposed and whether he will step across the border into North Korea. He says he would have no problem in doing that. On China, he doesn\u2019t answer the question and talks about the complexity of the trade talks. Trump says that China is going to start consulting with the US on spending money with America farmers: \u201cChina\u2019s going to be buying a tremendous amount of food and agricultural product, and they\u2019re going to start that very soon, of almost immediately,\u201d Trump says. Trump is now talking about China and his meeting with President Xi. \u201cWe had a great meeting. we\u2019ve known each other as long as I\u2019ve been president,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will be continuing to negotiate, and I promise that for at least the time being we\u2019re not going to be lifting tariffs on China. We won\u2019t be adding an additional - you know, tremendous amount of - we have, I guess $350bn left which could be taxed or could be tariffed, and we\u2019re not doing that. We\u2019re going to work with China on where we left off to see if we can make a deal.\u201d Trump says the US has a very close relationship with Japan. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been closer to Japan than now. Over the past two days leaders from the largest economy have convened here in Osaka, which is a tremendous city,\u201d he says. Trump is saying the G20 meeting has been \u201cfantastic\u201d and Japan\u2019s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe has done a great job organising it. Trump has just taken the podium. He\u2019s talking about the possibility of meeting Kim Jong-un. He said he is going to be at the demilitarised zone so asked the North Korean leader if he could meet him there. \u201cWhile I\u2019m there I\u2019ll shake his hand. There\u2019s been no nuclear tests, no long-range ballistic missile tests, gave us back our hostages -- hostages which was great and a lot of good thing sare happening over there. I said we\u2019ll be there and we\u2019ll see. I can\u2019t tell you exactly but they did respond very favourably,\u201d Trump said. British PM, Theresa May, also met Mohammed Bin Salman at the G20, in likely her last international meeting in the top job. World leaders have be holding multiple meetings in Japan this morning, including with Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman. President Trump held a media conference during their meeting in which he said the crown prince was doing a \u201cspectacular job\u201d . Trump called him a friend. The young royal has faced international pressure after the US-based dissident Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in the kingdom\u2019s consulate in Istanbul last year.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has raised concerns about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the humanitarian cost of the conflict in Yemen during a face-to-face meeting with the Saudi crown prince at the G20 summit in Osaka. The prime minister held a bilateral meeting with Mohammed bin Salman on Saturday at what will be May\u2019s final global summit before she steps down in July. A senior government official said May had called for an open and transparent legal process in the case of the Saudi journalist who was murdered in Istanbul \u2013 and underlined the importance of the relationship between the UK and Saudi Arabia. \u201cOn accountability for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the PM said the legal process needed to be open and transparent,\u201d the senior official said, adding that the pair had \u201cconcluded by agreeing on the importance of the relationship\u201d and of \u201cregional stability\u201d. Khashoggi was brutally murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October last year. Riyadh has claimed the attack was a \u201crogue operation,\u201d and has put several people on trial behind closed doors. But a report by a UN special rapporteur recently found that Khashoggi had been \u201cthe victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution, an extrajudicial killing for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible\u201d. On the conflict in Yemen, the official said: \u201cThe PM reiterated the need to keep working on finding a political solution to end the conflict, which is causing significant humanitarian suffering.\u201d UK arms exports to Saudi Arabia were ruled to be illegal by the court of appeal earlier this month because of the government\u2019s failure to assess the potential humanitarian impact of the weapons\u2019 use in Yemen. Delivering the judgment, Sir Terence Etherton, the master of the rolls, said ministers had \u201cmade no concluded assessments of whether the Saudi-led coalition had committed violations of international humanitarian law in the past, or during the Yemen conflict, and made no attempt to do so\u201d. The UN has called the conflict in Yemen the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, estimating in February that 17,700 civilians had died, and 3.3 million people remained displaced. The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, has said the government will appeal against the ruling. May\u2019s demeanour as she met the crown prince did not appear as frosty as it did when she met Vladimir Putin on Friday, when she upbraided him over the Salisbury poisoning, calling it a \u201ctruly despicable act\u201d. May also told the Russian president she would continue to defend liberal values, after he gave an interview to the Financial Times in which he claimed liberalism was \u201cobsolete\u201d and made light of the poisoning of the Russian former spy Sergei Skripal in the UK. Putin said: \u201cListen, all this fuss about spies and counterspies, it is not worth serious interstate relations. This [Skripal] spy story, as we say, it is not worth five kopeks. Or even \u00a35, for that matter.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez enters a boardroom at her constituency office in Queens, New York, after a short delay which, a political aide hopes, hasn\u2019t been caused by a constituent waylaying her in the corridor. (\u201cThey can get really excited to meet her.\u201d) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/greta-thunberg\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a> is in her home in Sweden, her father testing the technology for the video link while the teenager waits in the background. The activists have never met nor spoken but, as two of the most visible climate campaigners in the world, they are keenly aware of each other.</p> <p>Thunberg, now 16, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/greta-thunberg-schoolgirl-climate-change-warrior-some-people-can-let-things-go-i-cant\" title=\"\">catapulted to fame last year</a> for skipping school every Friday to stand outside the Swedish parliament, protesting against political inaction over the climate crisis and sparking an international movement, the school strike for climate, in which millions of other children followed suit. Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic Representative for New York\u2019s 14th congressional district is, at 29, the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress, whose election over a well-funded incumbent in 2018 was a huge upset to politics-as-usual. She has been in office for less than a year, which seems extraordinary given the amount of coverage she has generated. In February, Ocasio-Cortez submitted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/12/the-guardian-view-on-a-green-new-deal-we-need-it-now\" title=\"\">the Green New Deal</a> to the US House of Representatives, calling for, among other things, the achievement of \u201cnet-zero\u201d greenhouse gases within a decade and \u201ca full transition off fossil fuels\u201d, as well as retrofitting all buildings in the US to meet new energy efficient standards.</p> <p>The Green New Deal, while garnering support from Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, was mocked by speaker Nancy Pelosi (\u201cthe green dream or whatever they call it\u201d), and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/26/green-new-deal-senate-democrats-protest-republicans\" title=\"\">defeated in the Senate by Republicans</a>. Like Thunberg, however, Ocasio-Cortez gives every appearance of being galvanised by opposition, and has the kind of energy that has won her 4.41 million Twitter followers and makes establishment politicians in her path very nervous.</p> <p>In the course of their conversation, Ocasio-Cortez and Thunberg discuss what it is like to be dismissed for their age, how depressed we should be about the future, and what tactics, as an activist, really work. Ocasio-Cortez speaks with her customary snap and brilliance that, held up against the general waffle of political discourse, seems startlingly direct. Thunberg, meanwhile, is phenomenally articulate, well-informed and self-assured, holding her own in conversation with an elected official nearly twice her age and speaking in deliberate, thoughtful English. They are, in some ways, as different as two campaigners can get \u2013 the politician working the system with Washington polish, and the teenager in her socks and leggings, working from her bedroom to reach the rest of the world. There is something very moving about the conversation between these young women, a sense of generational rise that, as we know from every precedent from the Renaissance onwards, has the power to ignite movements and change history.</p> <p><strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</strong> It\u2019s such an honour to meet you!</p> <p><strong>Greta Thunberg</strong> You, too!</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People say, 'Don\u2019t politicise young people.' It\u2019s almost a taboo. I find it very condescending</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>AOC</strong> Thank you. I\u2019m so excited to be having this conversation. I remember first hearing your speech a few months ago \u2013 I was hanging out with a friend in Harlem, who said, \u201cHave you listened to this young woman?\u201d And I heard your speech and was thrilled, because here in the United States, even when I was running, people were saying there\u2019s no need to convey this kind of urgency [about the climate], and it\u2019s radical, and it\u2019s unnecessary. To hear you articulate the belief that I\u2019ve had as well is so exciting and validating. So I wanted to thank you for your work and your advocacy.</p> <p><strong>GT</strong> Thank you so much for standing up and offering hope to so many people, even here in Sweden.</p> <p><strong>AOC</strong> One of the things I\u2019m interested in hearing from you is that often people say, \u201cDon\u2019t politicise young people.\u201d It\u2019s almost a taboo. That to have someone as young as you coming out in favour of political positions is manipulative or wrong. I find it very condescending, as though, especially in this day and age with the access to information we have, you can\u2019t form your own opinions and advocate for yourself. I\u2019m interested in how you approach that \u2013 if anyone brings that up with you?</p> <p><strong>GT</strong> That happens all the time. That\u2019s basically all I hear. The most common criticism I get is that I\u2019m being manipulated and you shouldn\u2019t use children in political ways, because that is abuse, and I can\u2019t think for myself and so on. And I think that is so annoying! I\u2019m also allowed to have a say \u2013 why shouldn\u2019t I be able to form my own opinion and try to change people\u2019s minds?</p> <p>But I\u2019m sure you hear that a lot, too; that you\u2019re too young and too inexperienced. When I see all the hate you receive for that, I honestly can\u2019t believe how you manage to stay so strong.</p> <p><strong>AOC</strong> I think the thing that people sometimes don\u2019t realise is that here in the United States, because of the gap between the rich and the poor, people really identify Wall Street as a very potent political force. With our rules, politicians are allowed to accept campaign contributions on a level that is probably beyond what happens in other parts of the world.</p> <p>But what people don\u2019t recognise is how strong the fossil fuel lobby is. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/26/koch-brothers-americans-for-prosperity-rightwing-political-group\" title=\"\">The Koch brothers in the US have essentially purchased</a> the entire Republican party, but people forget they made their money off oil and gas. That is where their fortune comes from. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re up against. So the severity of the pushback indicates the power that we are challenging. You can look at that with despair, or you can look at it with hope. That\u2019s how strong we are: we\u2019re so strong that we\u2019re able to take this on credibly and actually build a movement against it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86f6b547d0bfb2dfeacca09a1c4002eaa0ad434f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86f6b547d0bfb2dfeacca09a1c4002eaa0ad434f/41_15_2901_3626/800.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Greta Thunberg.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Why should we argue about who or what needs to change first? Why not take the leading role?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Voss, Anna Schori/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>GT</strong> Yes, I mean, the oil lobby is huge in the US, and we also have that kind of lobby in Sweden. Not as much, but...</p> <p><strong>AOC</strong> What is the most effective tactic in gaining attention for the environmental movement? What have you done, or what have been the practices that have been most galvanising?</p> <p><strong>GT</strong> I think this whole movement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/greta-thunberg-schoolgirl-climate-change-warrior-some-people-can-let-things-go-i-cant\" title=\"\">in which I just sat down in front of the parliament, alone</a> \u2013 I think that had a huge impact, because people saw it and were moved, and became emotional. Millions of children around the world, striking and saying, \u201cWhy should we study for a future that may not exist any more?\u201d This is not only me, but everyone in the movement.</p> <p><strong>AOC</strong> Another question I have for you is that a lot of people talk about Sweden and other Nordic countries as an inspiration. People say that [advanced thinking around the climate crisis] could never happen in the US, because we\u2019re a multiracial democracy \u2013 the fact that Sweden and other places are more homogenous means they\u2019re able to get along better. That because of the racial diversity here, and issues with immigration and so on, there\u2019s no way we can come together in order to combat this. I\u2019m interested in what you say in response to that.</p> <p><strong>GT</strong> Many people, especially in the US, see countries like Sweden or Norway or Finland as role models \u2013 we have such a clean energy sector, and so on. That may be true, but we are not role models. Sweden is one of the top 10 countries in the world when it comes to the highest ecological footprints, <a href=\"https://wwf.panda.org/knowledge_hub/all_publications/living_planet_report_2018/\" title=\"\">according to the WWF</a> \u2013 if you count the consumer index, then we are among the worst per capita.</p> <p>In Sweden, the most common argument that we shouldn\u2019t act is that we are such a small country with only 10 million inhabitants \u2013 we should focus more on helping other countries. That is so incredibly frustrating, because why should we argue about who or what needs to change first? Why not take the leading role?</p> <p><strong>AOC</strong> We hear the same exact argument here. And this is the United States of America! People say, \u201cWell, we should wait for China to do something.\u201d There\u2019s this political culture of people trying to say America First \u2013 that the US is the best nation in the world, yet at the same time they\u2019re saying, \u201cWell, China\u2019s not doing it, why should we?\u201d</p> <p>And I think it\u2019s the same argument: are we going to choose to lead, or are we going to sit on our hands? It seems as if they take pride in leading on fracking, on being the number one in oil, in consumption, in single-use plastics. But they don\u2019t seem to want to take pride in leading on the environment and leading for our children.</p> <p><strong>GT</strong> Yes. I mean, countries like Sweden or the US, since we are rich countries, need to go first. Because people in poor countries need to be able to raise their standard of living. We have a duty to lead when we already have, basically, everything.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People think of leadership as this glamorous, powerful thing. But leadership is a responsibility. Leadership is not fun</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>AOC</strong> Yes. People think of leadership as this glamorous, powerful thing. To be a leader is to come first, to set the agenda. But what people don\u2019t realise is that leadership is also enormously difficult. Leadership is a responsibility. Leadership is not fun. Leadership is about doing things before anybody else does them. Leadership is about taking risks. Leadership is about taking decisions when you don\u2019t know 100% what the outcome is going to be.</p> <p>It\u2019s enormously easy to follow \u2013 it\u2019s the easiest thing in the world. And there are detriments to following. You are too late. You do not control your destiny. You are not in control, period. You are often under the thumb of someone else. But it is enormously easy because you don\u2019t have to determine the future. It seems as if, really, it\u2019s a decision on whether we\u2019re going to lead or not.</p> <p>I wonder what, to you, is encouraging, and what keeps you going? There\u2019s a school of thought \u2013 I personally disagree with it \u2013 that says if you educate people too much [about the climate] they\u2019re going to think it\u2019s too late and they\u2019re going to wallow in despair and not act at all. So I\u2019m curious, given how daunting the issue is, why aren\u2019t you so filled with despair that you\u2019re staying on your couch every day, and just waiting for the apocalypse? <em>[Laughs]</em></p> <p><strong>GT</strong> Before I started school striking, I was like that. I was so depressed and I didn\u2019t want to do anything, basically. But what I find encouraging is having all these people who are fighting on different sides in different ways, to create a better future and to make us avoid catastrophic climate breakdown.</p> <p>The school-striking children, when I see them \u2013 that is very hopeful. And also the fact that people are very unaware of the climate crisis. I mean, people aren\u2019t continuing like this and not doing anything because they are evil, or because they don\u2019t want to. We aren\u2019t destroying the biosphere because we are selfish. We are doing it simply because we are unaware. I think that is very hopeful, because once we know, once we realise, then we change, then we act.</p> <p><strong>AOC</strong> I had a similar tipping point, although it had more to do with income inequality. Many people know that several years ago I was working in a restaurant, and I had gone to college, and I had worked on so many things, but my family had fallen in to a lot of misfortune \u2013 my father had gotten sick and so on. And I was working in this restaurant and I would go, day in and day out, and I was so depressed. I felt so powerless, and as though there was nothing I could do that could effectively counter the enormous number of societal structures that are designed in the US to keep the working class poor, and to keep the rich, richer. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f25729d901dcb654068050e4a9fc68e12d184287\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f25729d901dcb654068050e4a9fc68e12d184287/0_926_2595_1557/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Greta Thunberg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Hope is not something that you have. Hope is something that you create, with your actions.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Voss, Anna Schori/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was really wallowing in despair for a while: what do I do? Is this my life? Just showing up, working, knowing that things are so difficult, then going home and doing it again. And I think what was profoundly liberating was engaging in my first action \u2013 when I went to Standing Rock, in the Dakotas, to fight against a fracking pipeline. It seemed impossible at the time. It was just normal people, showing up, just standing on the land to prevent this pipeline from going through. And it made me feel extremely powerful, even though we had nothing, materially \u2013 just the act of standing up to some of the most powerful corporations in the world.</p> <p>From there I learned that hope is not something that you have. Hope is something that you create, with your actions. Hope is something you have to manifest into the world, and once one person has hope, it can be contagious. Other people start acting in a way that has more hope.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I remember the first day I was school-striking outside the Swedish parliament, I felt so alone. But I was hopeful</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>GT</strong> Yeah. I know so many people who feel hopeless, and they ask me, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d And I say: \u201cAct. Do something.\u201d Because that is the best medicine against sadness and depression. I remember the first day I was school-striking outside the Swedish parliament, I felt so alone, because everyone went straight past, no one even looked at me. But at the same time I was hopeful.</p> <p><strong>AOC</strong> It\u2019s true that people don\u2019t know when those small actions can manifest into something. I\u2019ve seen it even in office. There\u2019s so much cynicism about, how powerful can this be? Just me showing up?</p> <p>I think sometimes we\u2019re so obsessed with measurement. What does me standing outside of parliament with a sign do? It doesn\u2019t lower any carbon emissions immediately. It doesn\u2019t change any laws directly. But what it does is make powerful people feel something, and people underestimate the power of that. It is becoming harder and harder for elected officials to look people in the eye.</p> <p>Just this morning I was sent a picture of an older gentleman from the midwest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/03/so-much-land-under-so-much-water-extreme-flooding-is-drowning-parts-of-the-midwest\" title=\"\">which has just seen some catastrophic flooding</a> \u2013 we\u2019re starting to see flooding in the US where there was never flooding before. In the midwest there\u2019s a disaster package that\u2019s not getting passed, and he was just there with a sign saying, \u201cDo you care about me?\u201d He stood outside the congressional building, knowing that members are going to have to pass him by, and it\u2019s very much inspired, I would say, by the actions that you\u2019ve taken.</p> <p>The biggest weapon people have is to try to make you think that you don\u2019t matter. It is to say, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d Because if you can convince people that it doesn\u2019t matter, then they won\u2019t do it and people can go on as though it\u2019s business as usual. We are no longer at the point of preventing [climate disaster] from happening entirely \u2013 we are now at the point of minimising the damage. And as these floods and storms are here, I think more and more people are going to be willing to stand up for themselves.</p> <p><strong>GT</strong> I have a question. I have heard about how bad the situation is in the US with climate denialism, but I find it very hard to believe. It\u2019s bad here in Sweden \u2013 but I have seen reports of how little the US media mentions the climate crisis and how it is treated. How bad is it really?</p> <p><strong>AOC</strong> I would say that it has historically been very, very bad. But it\u2019s actually getting much better.</p> <p>In the 1970s, <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/exxon-mobil-climate-doubt_n_5654d16de4b0d4093a599530\" title=\"\">Exxon</a><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/exxon-mobil-climate-doubt_n_5654d16de4b0d4093a599530\" title=\"\">Mobil</a><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/exxon-mobil-climate-doubt_n_5654d16de4b0d4093a599530\" title=\"\"> had internal science that not only definitively proved that climate change was real</a>, but they themselves, the oil company, invested in modelling to see how bad it was going to be. Some of their models were so sophisticated that, back in the 70s, they <a href=\"https://earther.gizmodo.com/exxon-predicted-2019-s-ominous-co2-milestone-in-1982-1834748763\">were predicting</a> our weather patterns as far out as 2012 \u2013 and many of them were accurate. They knew exactly what was happening.</p> <p>So what they did, starting the year I was born, around 1989, was to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/22/top-oil-firms-spending-millions-lobbying-to-block-climate-change-policies-says-report\" title=\"\">start funding a lot of media and lobbying campaigns</a>. They knew they couldn\u2019t fund campaigns outright saying climate change is not real. But they could fund campaigns sowing confusion. So they would run campaigns saying we need to see more science, to sow doubt around the consensus. For a very long time it worked, and it got very bad. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/01/magazine/climate-change-losing-earth.html\">We came very close to acting on the climate in 1989</a>, but the lobbying was so powerful that they effectively prevented action \u2013 we had almost 40% of Republican voters not believing that climate change was settled fact.</p> <p>But I think because of our advocacy and our movement, those numbers have been dropping precipitously in just the last few years. And in the last year especially, with our push for a Green New Deal, connecting everything that is happening to climate change. People who cover increasingly worse hurricanes as though they are accidents, or just things that happen \u2013 now, every time a storm comes, we talk about climate change. The other piece of it is not just acknowledging that it\u2019s real, but prioritising it as a top issue. We just received some very encouraging numbers yesterday \u2013 a year or two years ago, only 20% of Democratic voters, the more liberal voters in the country, saw climate change as a top issue. With our action, and the youth organising that\u2019s going on now, it has surged. We\u2019ve seen in very early voting states, something like 70% of Democratic voters think that a Green New Deal should be a top issue, and that they would support candidates who support it, and not supporting it is a red flag for many voters. I think we\u2019re moving, but it takes this radical action to move it.</p> <p>We have historically had an issue with media coverage of the climate crisis \u2013 I think they don\u2019t realise that not covering it is just as bad as denying it. We have issues because much of our media is profit-driven, and if it doesn\u2019t drive ratings they will not cover it as much. But we simply don\u2019t have a choice. We have to do this.</p> <p><strong>GT</strong> I saw very recent numbers, I think it was yesterday, that suggested about 2% of Sweden\u2019s population don\u2019t believe in the climate crisis. Here it\u2019s not as acceptable to not believe in it. Everyone accepts that it\u2019s a fact. But still we aren\u2019t talking about it, and it\u2019s not a priority. We are just treating it like any other issue.</p> <p><strong>AOC</strong> Why do you think young people have been more powerful and persuasive on this issue, in particular?</p> <p><strong>GT</strong> Many reasons, but I think the main one is that it is our future that is at risk. Most of us know that this is going to affect us in our lifetimes \u2013 it\u2019s not just something that might happen in the future. It\u2019s already here and it\u2019s going to get worse, and many of us understand that this is going to make our lives much worse. And also that as young people, we aren\u2019t as used to the system. We don\u2019t say, \u201cIt\u2019s always been like this, we can\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p> <p><strong>AOC</strong> I\u2019ve always said to people that youth is a mindset. And young people, we tend to come in and almost take that mindset for granted because as you said, we haven\u2019t seen the world before, this is our first path, and so we have a tendency to question all of the nonsensical things that have just gone on for reasons of outdated logic. I have three- and four-year-old nieces and nephews, and they\u2019re always asking, \u201cWhy, why, why, why?\u201d For a lot of people it can be somewhat irritating. But I think sometimes it\u2019s irritating because they don\u2019t have the answers.</p> <p>You can be much older and still part of a youth movement, if you refuse to do things just because that\u2019s the way they\u2019ve always been done. I believe that young people just have a natural distillation of the world that is so pure. I\u2019ve always felt that social movements, and youth movements in particular, should continue to be the moral compass that guides our vision.</p> <p><strong>GT</strong> Yes, it always reminds me a lot of the Emperor\u2019s New Clothes. Everyone believes in this lie, that only a child dares to question.</p> <p><strong>AOC</strong> Right. When I was first running [for office], people often mocked me as a child. I\u2019m much older than you! But I was still very young for someone who was running for such a powerful seat. People would say, \u201cBut don\u2019t you know this is how it\u2019s always been done? He has so much money, and power. There\u2019s no reason you should challenge someone in your own party \u2013 we should challenge people in other parties.\u201d And so on and so forth. And they were all veiled ways of saying I was too inexperienced, too naive, too young, and too powerless.</p> <p>I think the mere refusal to accept that can change our world. That\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ve done.</p> <p><strong>GT</strong> I think we\u2019ve both done that.</p> <p><em>Thunberg says that she is planning to </em><em>travel to the US in August, so </em><em>she can attend the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/\" title=\"\">UN Climate Action summit on 23 September</a>.</em></p> <p><strong>GT</strong> I don\u2019t fly for climate reasons so it\u2019s not 100% yet, but we are figuring it out.

I think one of the things that we need to start communicating is that this a global struggle, and it\u2019s not about what is Sweden doing, and what is the US doing \u2013 it\u2019s about what are all of us doing, as one movement?

      "bodyText": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez enters a boardroom at her constituency office in Queens, New York, after a short delay which, a political aide hopes, hasn\u2019t been caused by a constituent waylaying her in the corridor. (\u201cThey can get really excited to meet her.\u201d) Greta Thunberg is in her home in Sweden, her father testing the technology for the video link while the teenager waits in the background. The activists have never met nor spoken but, as two of the most visible climate campaigners in the world, they are keenly aware of each other. Thunberg, now 16, catapulted to fame last year for skipping school every Friday to stand outside the Swedish parliament, protesting against political inaction over the climate crisis and sparking an international movement, the school strike for climate, in which millions of other children followed suit. Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic Representative for New York\u2019s 14th congressional district is, at 29, the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress, whose election over a well-funded incumbent in 2018 was a huge upset to politics-as-usual. She has been in office for less than a year, which seems extraordinary given the amount of coverage she has generated. In February, Ocasio-Cortez submitted the Green New Deal to the US House of Representatives, calling for, among other things, the achievement of \u201cnet-zero\u201d greenhouse gases within a decade and \u201ca full transition off fossil fuels\u201d, as well as retrofitting all buildings in the US to meet new energy efficient standards. The Green New Deal, while garnering support from Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, was mocked by speaker Nancy Pelosi (\u201cthe green dream or whatever they call it\u201d), and defeated in the Senate by Republicans. Like Thunberg, however, Ocasio-Cortez gives every appearance of being galvanised by opposition, and has the kind of energy that has won her 4.41 million Twitter followers and makes establishment politicians in her path very nervous. In the course of their conversation, Ocasio-Cortez and Thunberg discuss what it is like to be dismissed for their age, how depressed we should be about the future, and what tactics, as an activist, really work. Ocasio-Cortez speaks with her customary snap and brilliance that, held up against the general waffle of political discourse, seems startlingly direct. Thunberg, meanwhile, is phenomenally articulate, well-informed and self-assured, holding her own in conversation with an elected official nearly twice her age and speaking in deliberate, thoughtful English. They are, in some ways, as different as two campaigners can get \u2013 the politician working the system with Washington polish, and the teenager in her socks and leggings, working from her bedroom to reach the rest of the world. There is something very moving about the conversation between these young women, a sense of generational rise that, as we know from every precedent from the Renaissance onwards, has the power to ignite movements and change history. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez It\u2019s such an honour to meet you! Greta Thunberg You, too! AOC Thank you. I\u2019m so excited to be having this conversation. I remember first hearing your speech a few months ago \u2013 I was hanging out with a friend in Harlem, who said, \u201cHave you listened to this young woman?\u201d And I heard your speech and was thrilled, because here in the United States, even when I was running, people were saying there\u2019s no need to convey this kind of urgency [about the climate], and it\u2019s radical, and it\u2019s unnecessary. To hear you articulate the belief that I\u2019ve had as well is so exciting and validating. So I wanted to thank you for your work and your advocacy. GT Thank you so much for standing up and offering hope to so many people, even here in Sweden. AOC One of the things I\u2019m interested in hearing from you is that often people say, \u201cDon\u2019t politicise young people.\u201d It\u2019s almost a taboo. That to have someone as young as you coming out in favour of political positions is manipulative or wrong. I find it very condescending, as though, especially in this day and age with the access to information we have, you can\u2019t form your own opinions and advocate for yourself. I\u2019m interested in how you approach that \u2013 if anyone brings that up with you? GT That happens all the time. That\u2019s basically all I hear. The most common criticism I get is that I\u2019m being manipulated and you shouldn\u2019t use children in political ways, because that is abuse, and I can\u2019t think for myself and so on. And I think that is so annoying! I\u2019m also allowed to have a say \u2013 why shouldn\u2019t I be able to form my own opinion and try to change people\u2019s minds? But I\u2019m sure you hear that a lot, too; that you\u2019re too young and too inexperienced. When I see all the hate you receive for that, I honestly can\u2019t believe how you manage to stay so strong. AOC I think the thing that people sometimes don\u2019t realise is that here in the United States, because of the gap between the rich and the poor, people really identify Wall Street as a very potent political force. With our rules, politicians are allowed to accept campaign contributions on a level that is probably beyond what happens in other parts of the world. But what people don\u2019t recognise is how strong the fossil fuel lobby is. The Koch brothers in the US have essentially purchased the entire Republican party, but people forget they made their money off oil and gas. That is where their fortune comes from. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re up against. So the severity of the pushback indicates the power that we are challenging. You can look at that with despair, or you can look at it with hope. That\u2019s how strong we are: we\u2019re so strong that we\u2019re able to take this on credibly and actually build a movement against it. GT Yes, I mean, the oil lobby is huge in the US, and we also have that kind of lobby in Sweden. Not as much, but... AOC What is the most effective tactic in gaining attention for the environmental movement? What have you done, or what have been the practices that have been most galvanising? GT I think this whole movement in which I just sat down in front of the parliament, alone \u2013 I think that had a huge impact, because people saw it and were moved, and became emotional. Millions of children around the world, striking and saying, \u201cWhy should we study for a future that may not exist any more?\u201d This is not only me, but everyone in the movement. AOC Another question I have for you is that a lot of people talk about Sweden and other Nordic countries as an inspiration. People say that [advanced thinking around the climate crisis] could never happen in the US, because we\u2019re a multiracial democracy \u2013 the fact that Sweden and other places are more homogenous means they\u2019re able to get along better. That because of the racial diversity here, and issues with immigration and so on, there\u2019s no way we can come together in order to combat this. I\u2019m interested in what you say in response to that. GT Many people, especially in the US, see countries like Sweden or Norway or Finland as role models \u2013 we have such a clean energy sector, and so on. That may be true, but we are not role models. Sweden is one of the top 10 countries in the world when it comes to the highest ecological footprints, according to the WWF \u2013 if you count the consumer index, then we are among the worst per capita. In Sweden, the most common argument that we shouldn\u2019t act is that we are such a small country with only 10 million inhabitants \u2013 we should focus more on helping other countries. That is so incredibly frustrating, because why should we argue about who or what needs to change first? Why not take the leading role? AOC We hear the same exact argument here. And this is the United States of America! People say, \u201cWell, we should wait for China to do something.\u201d There\u2019s this political culture of people trying to say America First \u2013 that the US is the best nation in the world, yet at the same time they\u2019re saying, \u201cWell, China\u2019s not doing it, why should we?\u201d And I think it\u2019s the same argument: are we going to choose to lead, or are we going to sit on our hands? It seems as if they take pride in leading on fracking, on being the number one in oil, in consumption, in single-use plastics. But they don\u2019t seem to want to take pride in leading on the environment and leading for our children. GT Yes. I mean, countries like Sweden or the US, since we are rich countries, need to go first. Because people in poor countries need to be able to raise their standard of living. We have a duty to lead when we already have, basically, everything. AOC Yes. People think of leadership as this glamorous, powerful thing. To be a leader is to come first, to set the agenda. But what people don\u2019t realise is that leadership is also enormously difficult. Leadership is a responsibility. Leadership is not fun. Leadership is about doing things before anybody else does them. Leadership is about taking risks. Leadership is about taking decisions when you don\u2019t know 100% what the outcome is going to be. It\u2019s enormously easy to follow \u2013 it\u2019s the easiest thing in the world. And there are detriments to following. You are too late. You do not control your destiny. You are not in control, period. You are often under the thumb of someone else. But it is enormously easy because you don\u2019t have to determine the future. It seems as if, really, it\u2019s a decision on whether we\u2019re going to lead or not. I wonder what, to you, is encouraging, and what keeps you going? There\u2019s a school of thought \u2013 I personally disagree with it \u2013 that says if you educate people too much [about the climate] they\u2019re going to think it\u2019s too late and they\u2019re going to wallow in despair and not act at all. So I\u2019m curious, given how daunting the issue is, why aren\u2019t you so filled with despair that you\u2019re staying on your couch every day, and just waiting for the apocalypse? [Laughs] GT Before I started school striking, I was like that. I was so depressed and I didn\u2019t want to do anything, basically. But what I find encouraging is having all these people who are fighting on different sides in different ways, to create a better future and to make us avoid catastrophic climate breakdown. The school-striking children, when I see them \u2013 that is very hopeful. And also the fact that people are very unaware of the climate crisis. I mean, people aren\u2019t continuing like this and not doing anything because they are evil, or because they don\u2019t want to. We aren\u2019t destroying the biosphere because we are selfish. We are doing it simply because we are unaware. I think that is very hopeful, because once we know, once we realise, then we change, then we act. AOC I had a similar tipping point, although it had more to do with income inequality. Many people know that several years ago I was working in a restaurant, and I had gone to college, and I had worked on so many things, but my family had fallen in to a lot of misfortune \u2013 my father had gotten sick and so on. And I was working in this restaurant and I would go, day in and day out, and I was so depressed. I felt so powerless, and as though there was nothing I could do that could effectively counter the enormous number of societal structures that are designed in the US to keep the working class poor, and to keep the rich, richer. I was really wallowing in despair for a while: what do I do? Is this my life? Just showing up, working, knowing that things are so difficult, then going home and doing it again. And I think what was profoundly liberating was engaging in my first action \u2013 when I went to Standing Rock, in the Dakotas, to fight against a fracking pipeline. It seemed impossible at the time. It was just normal people, showing up, just standing on the land to prevent this pipeline from going through. And it made me feel extremely powerful, even though we had nothing, materially \u2013 just the act of standing up to some of the most powerful corporations in the world. From there I learned that hope is not something that you have. Hope is something that you create, with your actions. Hope is something you have to manifest into the world, and once one person has hope, it can be contagious. Other people start acting in a way that has more hope. GT Yeah. I know so many people who feel hopeless, and they ask me, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d And I say: \u201cAct. Do something.\u201d Because that is the best medicine against sadness and depression. I remember the first day I was school-striking outside the Swedish parliament, I felt so alone, because everyone went straight past, no one even looked at me. But at the same time I was hopeful. AOC It\u2019s true that people don\u2019t know when those small actions can manifest into something. I\u2019ve seen it even in office. There\u2019s so much cynicism about, how powerful can this be? Just me showing up? I think sometimes we\u2019re so obsessed with measurement. What does me standing outside of parliament with a sign do? It doesn\u2019t lower any carbon emissions immediately. It doesn\u2019t change any laws directly. But what it does is make powerful people feel something, and people underestimate the power of that. It is becoming harder and harder for elected officials to look people in the eye. Just this morning I was sent a picture of an older gentleman from the midwest, which has just seen some catastrophic flooding \u2013 we\u2019re starting to see flooding in the US where there was never flooding before. In the midwest there\u2019s a disaster package that\u2019s not getting passed, and he was just there with a sign saying, \u201cDo you care about me?\u201d He stood outside the congressional building, knowing that members are going to have to pass him by, and it\u2019s very much inspired, I would say, by the actions that you\u2019ve taken. The biggest weapon people have is to try to make you think that you don\u2019t matter. It is to say, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d Because if you can convince people that it doesn\u2019t matter, then they won\u2019t do it and people can go on as though it\u2019s business as usual. We are no longer at the point of preventing [climate disaster] from happening entirely \u2013 we are now at the point of minimising the damage. And as these floods and storms are here, I think more and more people are going to be willing to stand up for themselves. GT I have a question. I have heard about how bad the situation is in the US with climate denialism, but I find it very hard to believe. It\u2019s bad here in Sweden \u2013 but I have seen reports of how little the US media mentions the climate crisis and how it is treated. How bad is it really? AOC I would say that it has historically been very, very bad. But it\u2019s actually getting much better. In the 1970s, ExxonMobil had internal science that not only definitively proved that climate change was real, but they themselves, the oil company, invested in modelling to see how bad it was going to be. Some of their models were so sophisticated that, back in the 70s, they were predicting our weather patterns as far out as 2012 \u2013 and many of them were accurate. They knew exactly what was happening. So what they did, starting the year I was born, around 1989, was to start funding a lot of media and lobbying campaigns. They knew they couldn\u2019t fund campaigns outright saying climate change is not real. But they could fund campaigns sowing confusion. So they would run campaigns saying we need to see more science, to sow doubt around the consensus. For a very long time it worked, and it got very bad. We came very close to acting on the climate in 1989, but the lobbying was so powerful that they effectively prevented action \u2013 we had almost 40% of Republican voters not believing that climate change was settled fact. But I think because of our advocacy and our movement, those numbers have been dropping precipitously in just the last few years. And in the last year especially, with our push for a Green New Deal, connecting everything that is happening to climate change. People who cover increasingly worse hurricanes as though they are accidents, or just things that happen \u2013 now, every time a storm comes, we talk about climate change. The other piece of it is not just acknowledging that it\u2019s real, but prioritising it as a top issue. We just received some very encouraging numbers yesterday \u2013 a year or two years ago, only 20% of Democratic voters, the more liberal voters in the country, saw climate change as a top issue. With our action, and the youth organising that\u2019s going on now, it has surged. We\u2019ve seen in very early voting states, something like 70% of Democratic voters think that a Green New Deal should be a top issue, and that they would support candidates who support it, and not supporting it is a red flag for many voters. I think we\u2019re moving, but it takes this radical action to move it. We have historically had an issue with media coverage of the climate crisis \u2013 I think they don\u2019t realise that not covering it is just as bad as denying it. We have issues because much of our media is profit-driven, and if it doesn\u2019t drive ratings they will not cover it as much. But we simply don\u2019t have a choice. We have to do this. GT I saw very recent numbers, I think it was yesterday, that suggested about 2% of Sweden\u2019s population don\u2019t believe in the climate crisis. Here it\u2019s not as acceptable to not believe in it. Everyone accepts that it\u2019s a fact. But still we aren\u2019t talking about it, and it\u2019s not a priority. We are just treating it like any other issue. AOC Why do you think young people have been more powerful and persuasive on this issue, in particular? GT Many reasons, but I think the main one is that it is our future that is at risk. Most of us know that this is going to affect us in our lifetimes \u2013 it\u2019s not just something that might happen in the future. It\u2019s already here and it\u2019s going to get worse, and many of us understand that this is going to make our lives much worse. And also that as young people, we aren\u2019t as used to the system. We don\u2019t say, \u201cIt\u2019s always been like this, we can\u2019t change anything.\u201d AOC I\u2019ve always said to people that youth is a mindset. And young people, we tend to come in and almost take that mindset for granted because as you said, we haven\u2019t seen the world before, this is our first path, and so we have a tendency to question all of the nonsensical things that have just gone on for reasons of outdated logic. I have three- and four-year-old nieces and nephews, and they\u2019re always asking, \u201cWhy, why, why, why?\u201d For a lot of people it can be somewhat irritating. But I think sometimes it\u2019s irritating because they don\u2019t have the answers. You can be much older and still part of a youth movement, if you refuse to do things just because that\u2019s the way they\u2019ve always been done. I believe that young people just have a natural distillation of the world that is so pure. I\u2019ve always felt that social movements, and youth movements in particular, should continue to be the moral compass that guides our vision. GT Yes, it always reminds me a lot of the Emperor\u2019s New Clothes. Everyone believes in this lie, that only a child dares to question. AOC Right. When I was first running [for office], people often mocked me as a child. I\u2019m much older than you! But I was still very young for someone who was running for such a powerful seat. People would say, \u201cBut don\u2019t you know this is how it\u2019s always been done? He has so much money, and power. There\u2019s no reason you should challenge someone in your own party \u2013 we should challenge people in other parties.\u201d And so on and so forth. And they were all veiled ways of saying I was too inexperienced, too naive, too young, and too powerless. I think the mere refusal to accept that can change our world. That\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ve done. GT I think we\u2019ve both done that. Thunberg says that she is planning to travel to the US in August, so she can attend the UN Climate Action summit on 23 September. GT I don\u2019t fly for climate reasons so it\u2019s not 100% yet, but we are figuring it out. It\u2019s very hard, but I think it should be possible. AOC That\u2019s incredible. I\u2019m so excited to follow that. Let us know how we can help from over here. I think one of the things that we need to start communicating is that this a global struggle, and it\u2019s not about what is Sweden doing, and what is the US doing \u2013 it\u2019s about what are all of us doing, as one movement? I think the power of that is very real. I wish you well, and I know many members of Congress who would be thrilled to meet you. GT Thank you so much. AOC Thank you so much, Greta. Be sure to let us know when you have an arrival date. If you land in New York, we will give you a Queens\u2019 welcome! \u2022 This conversation appears in the Guardian\u2019s Weekend magazine and has been abridged for length.

      "bodyText": "The shout-out was via a technicolour mural spray-painted onto a wall in Shoreditch, the hip district of east London, with tickets for the intimate gig released on the mobile ticketing app Dice. So on a muggy Tuesday night the Betsey Trotwood, a traditional boozer in the capital\u2019s fashionable Clerkenwell district, is filled with 150 millennials and gen Zers knocking back free pints before an evening of music billed to include the singer Rosie Lowe. But the event \u2013 which turned away another 700 music fans \u2013has an unlikely promoter: the vintage-style flyposters, beermats and pump clips bear the distinctive tree logo of luxury handbag maker Mulberry. The British brand is trying to make a new generation of women fall in love with a brand their mothers lusted after thanks to the patronage of noughties taste-makers such as Kate Moss and TV presenter Alexa Chung. Sipping wine outside the pub, 22-year-old Miriam Walters-Manneh has come along with her friend Joanna to hear some new music. \u201cI spend a bit of money on fashion but I\u2019m not religiously into it,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t bought a physical [fashion] magazine in years.\u201d If the law intern had cash to spare, she says, she\u2019d plump for a holiday rather than one of Mulberry\u2019s brightly coloured Millie totes, which cost about the same as a long-haul flight. She is confused though: \u201cDo we get to see the bags?\u201d Oddly, the answer, is no. Not tonight. At the moment times are tough for Mulberry: sales in the UK \u2013 its biggest market \u2013 fell 6% last year with the company slumping to a \u00a35m loss, dragged down by last year\u2019s collapse of the House of Fraser department store chain, an important sales outlet. The shares have lost two-thirds of their value in the past year, leaving Mulberry, founded by Roger Saul in 1971, valued at just \u00a3160m. With prices starting at about \u00a3500, Mulberry\u2019s handbags cost more than a monthly mortgage payment but are still deemed \u201caccessible\u201d in a \u00a31tn global luxury market. While its far larger rival Burberry is moving even further upmarket to insulate itself from the high street\u2019s woes, Mulberry \u2013 the largest manufacturer of luxury leather goods in the UK \u2013 continues to walk the tightrope of appealing to both the rich and to mid-market department shoppers who save up to buy its hard-wearing Bayswater bags. Inside the pub, Ranji Hyare, a City lawyer with a striking red Saint Laurent shoulder bag draped over her arm, looks a better prospect to get Mulberry\u2019s sales moving in the right direction. She is middle-aged with a handbag habit and has just ordered a Gucci bag embellished with crystals that costs an arm and a leg. She has never bought a Mulberry bag, though. \u201cI don\u2019t want to use the word boring but \u2026\u201d she tails off, before concluding: \u201cI see it as a good, practical brand.\u201d With older Britons battening down the hatches in the maelstrom unleashed by the Brexit vote, a recent analysis of spending habits by research firm Mintel revealed that under-25s were now the most prolific buyers of designer clothes and accessories in the UK and other major luxury markets such as the US, Italy and France. The most successful names were the likes of Gucci and Louis Vuitton, which have cleverly plugged into the well-heeled among the Instagram generation. But millennials and generation Z are a tough crowd to please as they want luxury brands to be accessible and exclusive at the same time, says the Mintel senior retail analyst Samantha Dover. \u201cThey want to buy brands that make them feel part of a community \u2026 but still want to feel like they are buying into something exclusive.\u201d The gig is one of several spread over the summer with the launch event attracting celebrities including Rafferty Law, the son of the actor Jude Law, and the model Kelvin Bueno. The tactic echoes the path trodden by Burberry, which worked with relatively unknown bands in its 2013 Burberry Acoustic sessions to build its credibility among the under-40s. Fergal Newton, a musician and model, out for the evening with his friend Alexander Adair, was reeled in by the free drinks. The 18-year-olds, wearing vintage suit jackets and Converse high tops, are heading on to another free event in Shoreditch afterwards. Adair, a fashion student, tried to borrow his mum\u2019s Mulberry messenger bag for the evening but \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t lend it to me\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Some moments in cricket you can watch forever. A delivery, a catch, a shot. Sport is mostly about context and story and character, the things that put an action in its place. But some rare actions transcend context. When Mitchell Starc bowled Ben Stokes in a World Cup match at Lord\u2019s, the physical fact of it was all that mattered. You can treat that moment as a poem, with a hundred readings each yielding some new discovery. You can have the comfort of sounding out familiar syllables. You can start that clip over and over and over again.</p> <p>Mitchell Starc hits stumps. That\u2019s what he does. This may seem reductive as a description: don\u2019t all bowlers do the same? But no. The principle of cricket may be guarding a target from missiles, but at a high enough skill level the transaction becomes too simple for the defender. Hence expanding to other modes of dismissal, primarily from the outside edge.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jun/28/england-win-world-cup-cricket-deserve-barney-ronay\">England can still win the World Cup, but does English cricket deserve to? | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With that, a game whose object is to hit the stumps developed into a game where most deliveries don\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t. The slip cordon dismissal always feels that bit less satisfying, a technicality rather than the viscera of stumps flying. But bowlers became acolytes of the nick, devoting lives to the pursuit of that sliver of timber.</p> <p>When someone gets bowled these days they\u2019ve usually swung big. The scoring demands of shorter cricket or frustration in longer games see players leave their stumps open, abandoning their guardsmen\u2019s post to let the besieger through. Towards the end of a failing run chase bowlers can get strings of these, like Wahab Riaz recently against South Africa or Mohammad Shami against Afghanistan.</p> <p>But even if you throw in leg before wicket, Wahab and Shami get a third of their victims to balls en route to the stumps. Starc gets half: 83 so far in his career to catches, 81 bowled or lbw.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f96ee01da918005da1fb2c443be17a00c66d0e59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f96ee01da918005da1fb2c443be17a00c66d0e59/0_0_4186_3092/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mitchell Starc\" width=\"1000\" height=\"739\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitchell Starc runs in to bowl against England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mitchell Gunn/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Starc is long and lean, a figure stretched out like a Quentin Blake drawing. He lopes to the crease before slinging his arm over with what seems complete ease. Often the ball curves through the air. It may not need to pitch, with plenty of Starc full tosses swerving past a groping shot to strike halfway up a stump. In the 2015 World Cup he bowled a dozen batsmen, including New Zealand\u2019s captain to seal the final. The summer afterwards he warmed up with half a dozen matches up in the 50-over domestic competition for 26 wickets, 17 of them bowled.</p> <p>Starc bowls full more often than just about anyone. In one-day cricket pitching up tends to be punished, but he counters with a mix of conventional swing with the new ball, reverse swing with the old, and extreme pace throughout. He bowls bouncers, he bowls length, but most often he aims at the stumps and sees what happens.</p> <p>So this isn\u2019t a case of bowling being reductive. It\u2019s that Starc has reduced the game back to its core principles. He has refined it, streamlined it, economically rationalised it. He has examined other deliveries to see if they spark joy. When they have not, he has thanked them for their service and let them go with love.</p> <p>The part that he has kept definitely sparks joy. It sparks celebration. It sparks delirium. It sparks those guttural roars when a crowd is so surprised that it stumbles over its own excitement, getting a reaction out before it has even fully formed in thousands of throats. He sparks Zing stumps and Zing bails, which are so reticent to part these days that they have even resisted Starc, once, when a delivery kissed the upright. He has smashed them more directly ever since.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a7e204cfaeee803cfd0b8ac4fdbd525b2ded1486\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7e204cfaeee803cfd0b8ac4fdbd525b2ded1486/0_0_2228_3174/702.jpg\" alt=\"Mitchell Starc celebrates\" width=\"702\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitchell Starc celebrates taking the wicket of Ben Stokes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Davy/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of the time Starc bowls someone before they settle. Of the 65 one-day batsmen he\u2019s castled, 19 of them made ducks, 42 made single figures and 51 made less than 20. But in the current World Cup, Starc has also bowled batsmen with scores. Tamim Iqbal was 62 when velocity forced him to drag on. Kusal Perera was 52 when a yorker beat his big shot.</p> <p>Then there was Stokes, who was set better than anyone. Stokes who had just batted through for 82 not out when the rest of England collapsed against Sri Lanka, and who was 88 not out when Starc started the 37th over for Australia.</p> <p>Stokes had been batting since the sixth over, taking a dozen balls to get off the mark and gradually building. In the 36th he twice advanced to smash Pat Cummins through the off side, first with a cut shot then a cover drive. England needed 113 from 84, a steep target but a fair chance with their deep lower order. On a true deck in sunshine they might have romped it, while a slower surface in the gloom made them look vulnerable. But someone still had to exploit that.</p> <p>Back came Starc for a new spell, first drawing a block from Stokes, then a single to midwicket. That\u2019s about all you can do sometimes, but he doesn\u2019t mind you coming across your front pad. If he misses his length then you might be able to hit straight like Kusal Mendis\u2019 audacious six when Australia played Sri Lanka, but you take your batting future in your hands with each attempt.</p> <p>Stokes was back on strike with one ball remaining. And here\u2019s where the story is shoved aside for the physical reality. A left-arm bowler, over the wicket, with a left-handed batsman waiting. That batsman has his bat raised as the bowler hits the crease, an action so practised that the bat dips and then rises again even as the ball travels through the air.</p> <p>Often when we talk about batting decisions, we really mean that a player\u2019s central nervous system and muscle fibres have used years of conditioning to respond instantly before the conscious mind they belong to has even registered what\u2019s happening. Whatever Ben Stokes is thinking, his cricket self thinks he\u2019s facing a full toss. His stance stays open and balanced, the bat cocked into a backlift as he winds up to hit straight through the ball.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/25/australia-england-cricket-world-cup\">Australia\u2019s hastily assembled chimera leaves England vulnerable to exit | Geoff Lemon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Basic reverse swing makes a ball veer off a straight line in the opposite direction to what a batsman might expect. But this is something else. Starc\u2019s left arm releases the ball with an angle <em>away </em>from the stumps. It\u2019s already outside an off-stump line when he lets go. His fingers roll the ball out like a left-arm orthodox spinner might. It rotates with the seam at 45 degrees, obtuse, a tiny planet with a new axis.</p> <p>It\u2019s from this path that reverse swing takes hold of the ball and drags it back. So rather than start straight and curve in, it starts away and bends back in a full Beckham curve. Suddenly it\u2019s heading for the stumps, and now what was a straight full toss dips on Stokes, sharply, savagely.</p> <p>His wrists are still cocked, the bat raised. Too late he\u2019s realised \u2013 or his conditioning has \u2013 that he needs to get down. His gloves are dropping but the ball has pitched on the turf beneath his bat\u2019s arc. In the close-up replay, with Stokes\u2019 pads visible to his knees, the bat isn\u2019t even in the frame. It comes down fast, really fast, but by then the ball has hit the outside of off stump and ricocheted flat towards point.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ICC/status/1143891738588790785\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Mitchell Starc&#39;s \ud83d\udc4c yorker to Stokes yesterday in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ENGvAUS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ENGvAUS</a> has been voted the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nissan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Nissan</a> Play of the Day!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CWC19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CWC19</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/QfkXCi5NZv\">pic.twitter.com/QfkXCi5NZv</a></p>&mdash; ICC (@ICC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ICC/status/1143891738588790785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 26, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>To bowl someone is one thing. To bowl one of the form batsmen in the tournament, on his way a century, when he\u2019s only trying to defend \u2013 that\u2019s something else. The enduring image is of Stokes holding his pose, momentarily hiding his off stump. He looks like the definition of solidity that has kept the ball out, but it has gone through him like a ghost through a wall.</p> <p>So here is the hypnotic sequence you can watch and rewatch. The well-meaning forward defence. The flash of bails and the flash of departing ball. The slow creak as the bat slips from its owner\u2019s hands. Him kicking it away in dejection. And all of that starting with one long, perfect arc, out and back and down and through, pitching to the millimetre.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jun/25/england-australia-cricket-world-cup-lords\">England\u2019s forward-thinking dies in stages when faced by Australian fire | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That ball is Waqar Younis in 1992. Flip the image to a right-arm bowler and a right-hand batsman and there he is. For the reverse-swing yorker, Waqar was the peak of the genre. There\u2019s a reason he has more five-wicket hauls than any bowler in one-day cricket. And there\u2019s a reason that Starc is tracking him, halfway there in less than a third as many matches.</p> <p>It\u2019s about that whip in their action, an extra flick from the wrist. Aaqib Javed had it, and Wahab at times. Any seamer can reverse a scuffed ball: Hansie Cronje used to, Mitchell Marsh can, Bhuvneshwar Kumar does. But that swing is early, giving time to pick it up. True reverse needs serious pace, and it needs whip. The difference then is in the lateness of swing, and the sharpness, and the dip.

      "bodyText": "Some moments in cricket you can watch forever. A delivery, a catch, a shot. Sport is mostly about context and story and character, the things that put an action in its place. But some rare actions transcend context. When Mitchell Starc bowled Ben Stokes in a World Cup match at Lord\u2019s, the physical fact of it was all that mattered. You can treat that moment as a poem, with a hundred readings each yielding some new discovery. You can have the comfort of sounding out familiar syllables. You can start that clip over and over and over again. Mitchell Starc hits stumps. That\u2019s what he does. This may seem reductive as a description: don\u2019t all bowlers do the same? But no. The principle of cricket may be guarding a target from missiles, but at a high enough skill level the transaction becomes too simple for the defender. Hence expanding to other modes of dismissal, primarily from the outside edge. With that, a game whose object is to hit the stumps developed into a game where most deliveries don\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t. The slip cordon dismissal always feels that bit less satisfying, a technicality rather than the viscera of stumps flying. But bowlers became acolytes of the nick, devoting lives to the pursuit of that sliver of timber. When someone gets bowled these days they\u2019ve usually swung big. The scoring demands of shorter cricket or frustration in longer games see players leave their stumps open, abandoning their guardsmen\u2019s post to let the besieger through. Towards the end of a failing run chase bowlers can get strings of these, like Wahab Riaz recently against South Africa or Mohammad Shami against Afghanistan. But even if you throw in leg before wicket, Wahab and Shami get a third of their victims to balls en route to the stumps. Starc gets half: 83 so far in his career to catches, 81 bowled or lbw. Starc is long and lean, a figure stretched out like a Quentin Blake drawing. He lopes to the crease before slinging his arm over with what seems complete ease. Often the ball curves through the air. It may not need to pitch, with plenty of Starc full tosses swerving past a groping shot to strike halfway up a stump. In the 2015 World Cup he bowled a dozen batsmen, including New Zealand\u2019s captain to seal the final. The summer afterwards he warmed up with half a dozen matches up in the 50-over domestic competition for 26 wickets, 17 of them bowled. Starc bowls full more often than just about anyone. In one-day cricket pitching up tends to be punished, but he counters with a mix of conventional swing with the new ball, reverse swing with the old, and extreme pace throughout. He bowls bouncers, he bowls length, but most often he aims at the stumps and sees what happens. So this isn\u2019t a case of bowling being reductive. It\u2019s that Starc has reduced the game back to its core principles. He has refined it, streamlined it, economically rationalised it. He has examined other deliveries to see if they spark joy. When they have not, he has thanked them for their service and let them go with love. The part that he has kept definitely sparks joy. It sparks celebration. It sparks delirium. It sparks those guttural roars when a crowd is so surprised that it stumbles over its own excitement, getting a reaction out before it has even fully formed in thousands of throats. He sparks Zing stumps and Zing bails, which are so reticent to part these days that they have even resisted Starc, once, when a delivery kissed the upright. He has smashed them more directly ever since. Most of the time Starc bowls someone before they settle. Of the 65 one-day batsmen he\u2019s castled, 19 of them made ducks, 42 made single figures and 51 made less than 20. But in the current World Cup, Starc has also bowled batsmen with scores. Tamim Iqbal was 62 when velocity forced him to drag on. Kusal Perera was 52 when a yorker beat his big shot. Then there was Stokes, who was set better than anyone. Stokes who had just batted through for 82 not out when the rest of England collapsed against Sri Lanka, and who was 88 not out when Starc started the 37th over for Australia. Stokes had been batting since the sixth over, taking a dozen balls to get off the mark and gradually building. In the 36th he twice advanced to smash Pat Cummins through the off side, first with a cut shot then a cover drive. England needed 113 from 84, a steep target but a fair chance with their deep lower order. On a true deck in sunshine they might have romped it, while a slower surface in the gloom made them look vulnerable. But someone still had to exploit that. Back came Starc for a new spell, first drawing a block from Stokes, then a single to midwicket. That\u2019s about all you can do sometimes, but he doesn\u2019t mind you coming across your front pad. If he misses his length then you might be able to hit straight like Kusal Mendis\u2019 audacious six when Australia played Sri Lanka, but you take your batting future in your hands with each attempt. Stokes was back on strike with one ball remaining. And here\u2019s where the story is shoved aside for the physical reality. A left-arm bowler, over the wicket, with a left-handed batsman waiting. That batsman has his bat raised as the bowler hits the crease, an action so practised that the bat dips and then rises again even as the ball travels through the air. Often when we talk about batting decisions, we really mean that a player\u2019s central nervous system and muscle fibres have used years of conditioning to respond instantly before the conscious mind they belong to has even registered what\u2019s happening. Whatever Ben Stokes is thinking, his cricket self thinks he\u2019s facing a full toss. His stance stays open and balanced, the bat cocked into a backlift as he winds up to hit straight through the ball. Basic reverse swing makes a ball veer off a straight line in the opposite direction to what a batsman might expect. But this is something else. Starc\u2019s left arm releases the ball with an angle away from the stumps. It\u2019s already outside an off-stump line when he lets go. His fingers roll the ball out like a left-arm orthodox spinner might. It rotates with the seam at 45 degrees, obtuse, a tiny planet with a new axis. It\u2019s from this path that reverse swing takes hold of the ball and drags it back. So rather than start straight and curve in, it starts away and bends back in a full Beckham curve. Suddenly it\u2019s heading for the stumps, and now what was a straight full toss dips on Stokes, sharply, savagely. His wrists are still cocked, the bat raised. Too late he\u2019s realised \u2013 or his conditioning has \u2013 that he needs to get down. His gloves are dropping but the ball has pitched on the turf beneath his bat\u2019s arc. In the close-up replay, with Stokes\u2019 pads visible to his knees, the bat isn\u2019t even in the frame. It comes down fast, really fast, but by then the ball has hit the outside of off stump and ricocheted flat towards point. To bowl someone is one thing. To bowl one of the form batsmen in the tournament, on his way a century, when he\u2019s only trying to defend \u2013 that\u2019s something else. The enduring image is of Stokes holding his pose, momentarily hiding his off stump. He looks like the definition of solidity that has kept the ball out, but it has gone through him like a ghost through a wall. So here is the hypnotic sequence you can watch and rewatch. The well-meaning forward defence. The flash of bails and the flash of departing ball. The slow creak as the bat slips from its owner\u2019s hands. Him kicking it away in dejection. And all of that starting with one long, perfect arc, out and back and down and through, pitching to the millimetre. That ball is Waqar Younis in 1992. Flip the image to a right-arm bowler and a right-hand batsman and there he is. For the reverse-swing yorker, Waqar was the peak of the genre. There\u2019s a reason he has more five-wicket hauls than any bowler in one-day cricket. And there\u2019s a reason that Starc is tracking him, halfway there in less than a third as many matches. It\u2019s about that whip in their action, an extra flick from the wrist. Aaqib Javed had it, and Wahab at times. Any seamer can reverse a scuffed ball: Hansie Cronje used to, Mitchell Marsh can, Bhuvneshwar Kumar does. But that swing is early, giving time to pick it up. True reverse needs serious pace, and it needs whip. The difference then is in the lateness of swing, and the sharpness, and the dip. That\u2019s when the ball turns homing missile. You can see Starc\u2019s example as many times as you like. The wrist so relaxed it could be opening a warm bread roll. The gentle placement of a ball into the air. That tilted trajectory, arcing out, swerving back. A quality batsman in the form of his life, racing gravity. Holding the pose in a tribute to fruitlessness. It doesn\u2019t need a how or a why or a when. No artwork really does. Load it up. Back to the start. Press play.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Name: </strong>Sarah Mills<br><strong>Age:</strong> 35<br><strong>Income:</strong> \u00a3300 a day, three days a week<br><strong>Occupation:</strong> Freelance TV producer/writer</p> <p>A year ago I was diagnosed with stage three bowel cancer. I\u2019d been passing blood so one day I called 111, who told me to immediately visit A&amp;E. A few tests showed I was anaemic. I was told more tests would be needed. Over the next few months I had to press for these tests as I knew something was wrong. Eventually a colonoscopy showed a malignant mass. They tell you in the room if you have a tumour, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re allowed to confirm cancer, though it was heavily implied. My best friend was with me, and we went straight to the pub because we were in shock. It was frightening but I knew the NHS would give me the best care possible.</p> <p>I had surgery to remove the tumour and part of the rectum and colon, was given a colostomy, and then underwent chemotherapy for about four months. Not only did it impact my health, but financially it was a struggle, as apart from two small contracts, I couldn\u2019t work for most of the year.</p> <p>Those contracts helped keep me afloat. I applied for employment and support allowance (ESA) as well as housing benefit for the rental part of my flat (which eventually rolled over into universal credit), which together came to about \u00a3700 a month and helped me pay my bills and make ends meet. Universal credit in itself was a really troubling process: the system is impenetrable. I wasn\u2019t paid until five months after I first tried to apply. It was dreadful.</p> <p>During the treatment I moved back in with my parents in Kent. I would have fallen into debt if I hadn\u2019t. When I was sick, a friend of mine recommended I speak to [cancer charity] Macmillan. They advised me not only what I should eat and drink, and what exercise I could do, but also financially, letting me know that I could contact my mortgage provider to reduce my payments, that my prescriptions were exempt, and that I could claim my travel to hospital. They also gave me a grant of \u00a3400, part of which I used to go to Center Parcs with my friends for a weekend.</p> <p>I returned to work earlier this year. I\u2019ve found a part-time senior development producer contract role for three days a week, which pays me \u00a3300 a day. I still have a bit of fatigue, so I\u2019m more limited in the sorts of roles I can look for.</p> <p>I live in a shared ownership flat in Dalston [in north-east London], which I bought two years ago. My mortgage is \u00a3450 a month, and rent \u00a3500. Service charge comes to \u00a3118. Other bills total about \u00a3300. I have a spare bedroom, and I sometimes rent it out to help alleviate the housing costs. I\u2019ve just had someone staying Monday to Friday, for which I received \u00a3670 a month in rent. I\u2019m currently looking for another part-time lodger.</p> <p>I spend about \u00a350 a week on food shopping. I used to go out loads and probably spent \u00a3200 a week socialising, but now it\u2019s more like \u00a350 a week.</p> <p>Fortunately, I don\u2019t have cancer at the moment, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m all clear as I have to wait five years until after diagnosis. I still go for regular scans. The cancer has meant I\u2019m definitely more tired than I used to be: I can\u2019t really exercise any more. To keep myself sane during the long hours of chemo, I started a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_DXNUSK07QN9nPa6K0aPug?view_as=subscriber.\" title=\"\">vlog</a> and got a load of funny and famous people to keep me company.</p> <p>When I was ill, I regretted not having any savings.

      "bodyText": "Name: Sarah Mills Age: 35 Income: \u00a3300 a day, three days a week Occupation: Freelance TV producer/writer A year ago I was diagnosed with stage three bowel cancer. I\u2019d been passing blood so one day I called 111, who told me to immediately visit A&amp;E. A few tests showed I was anaemic. I was told more tests would be needed. Over the next few months I had to press for these tests as I knew something was wrong. Eventually a colonoscopy showed a malignant mass. They tell you in the room if you have a tumour, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re allowed to confirm cancer, though it was heavily implied. My best friend was with me, and we went straight to the pub because we were in shock. It was frightening but I knew the NHS would give me the best care possible. I had surgery to remove the tumour and part of the rectum and colon, was given a colostomy, and then underwent chemotherapy for about four months. Not only did it impact my health, but financially it was a struggle, as apart from two small contracts, I couldn\u2019t work for most of the year. Those contracts helped keep me afloat. I applied for employment and support allowance (ESA) as well as housing benefit for the rental part of my flat (which eventually rolled over into universal credit), which together came to about \u00a3700 a month and helped me pay my bills and make ends meet. Universal credit in itself was a really troubling process: the system is impenetrable. I wasn\u2019t paid until five months after I first tried to apply. It was dreadful. During the treatment I moved back in with my parents in Kent. I would have fallen into debt if I hadn\u2019t. When I was sick, a friend of mine recommended I speak to [cancer charity] Macmillan. They advised me not only what I should eat and drink, and what exercise I could do, but also financially, letting me know that I could contact my mortgage provider to reduce my payments, that my prescriptions were exempt, and that I could claim my travel to hospital. They also gave me a grant of \u00a3400, part of which I used to go to Center Parcs with my friends for a weekend. I returned to work earlier this year. I\u2019ve found a part-time senior development producer contract role for three days a week, which pays me \u00a3300 a day. I still have a bit of fatigue, so I\u2019m more limited in the sorts of roles I can look for. I live in a shared ownership flat in Dalston [in north-east London], which I bought two years ago. My mortgage is \u00a3450 a month, and rent \u00a3500. Service charge comes to \u00a3118. Other bills total about \u00a3300. I have a spare bedroom, and I sometimes rent it out to help alleviate the housing costs. I\u2019ve just had someone staying Monday to Friday, for which I received \u00a3670 a month in rent. I\u2019m currently looking for another part-time lodger. I spend about \u00a350 a week on food shopping. I used to go out loads and probably spent \u00a3200 a week socialising, but now it\u2019s more like \u00a350 a week. Fortunately, I don\u2019t have cancer at the moment, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m all clear as I have to wait five years until after diagnosis. I still go for regular scans. The cancer has meant I\u2019m definitely more tired than I used to be: I can\u2019t really exercise any more. To keep myself sane during the long hours of chemo, I started a vlog and got a load of funny and famous people to keep me company. When I was ill, I regretted not having any savings. Now I plan to try to put away 20% of my earnings into a savings account. I know people say that when you have something like cancer, you should start living like there\u2019s no tomorrow, but actually, it\u2019s making me live like there is a tomorrow. It\u2019s made me feel like I actually need to be more grown up and become more of an adult.

      "body": "<p>Hiking over the rocks near Tujetsch, I was surprised to find a lighthouse. My surprise wasn\u2019t due to its appearance: the lighthouse was modest in size and rusty red, with the squat proportions of a wine cork, and barely visible through a jacket of mist. What made it extraordinary was its location: perched atop a mountain in Switzerland, more than 200 miles from the nearest coastline and 2,000 metres above sea level.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/travel_germany/giv-3902ggYnsXG6aAJa/\" data-alt=\"Rhine map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/travel_germany/giv-3902ggYnsXG6aAJa/\">Rhine map</a> </figure>  <p>The design looked familiar and, as I walked closer, I realised why. The lighthouse was (a sign explained) a near-replica of one I had seen a few months previously hundreds of miles away, on the Dutch coast at the Hook of Holland. The twin lighthouses were, in a sense, opposing poles: one near the source of the River Rhine in the Alps, the other where the same river ends at the North Sea. As such, this spot marked a natural end to my journey along the Rhine, all the way from river mouth to source, from one lighthouse to the other.</p> <p>Before setting out along the Rhine I\u2019d always thought of it as a thoroughly German river, in much the same way that the Thames is indisputably British and the Seine quintessentially French. In truth, the Rhine is multinational. Following the river, I\u2019d traversed not only Switzerland, the Netherlands and Germany, but also France, Austria and Liechtenstein, and through cities including Basel, Strasbourg, Bonn, D\u00fcsseldorf and Rotterdam. Along the way, the river itself had changed from a wide channel flanked by meadows and cathedrals to a tumbling mountain stream. Charging almost 800 miles across Europe, the Rhine changed its appearance as often as a pantomime dame.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b6f4fde85bca4f1e3e3f888be8ea6a64191a3f2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6f4fde85bca4f1e3e3f888be8ea6a64191a3f2b/0_95_4788_2874/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pont Couverts in Strasbourg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pont Couverts in Strasbourg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Givaga/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cycling, walking, swimming and boating my way along the river, I\u2019d found it littered with odd and interesting sights, from underground nuclear bunkers to thunderous waterfalls, nudist spas and glittering modern skyscrapers.</p> <p>I also learned how the Rhine has long been one of Europe\u2019s most important highways, moats and natural resources, and has played a pivotal role in the history of the places it passes.</p> <p>Two thousand years ago, the northern section of the river served as the outer boundary of the Roman Empire, a liquid frontier which kept out would-be migrants more effectively than any wall. Later, the river also served as an important highway for trade, generating enormous wealth for everyone from Frisians and Vikings to the merchants of the <a href=\"https://www.hanse.org/en/hanse-historic/the-history-of-the-hanseatic-league/\" title=\"\">Hanseatic League</a> and Golden Age Amsterdam.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"d0785fc8f7cf40bac964aab89757c30492f69325\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0785fc8f7cf40bac964aab89757c30492f69325/0_150_7132_4279/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The D\u00fcsseldorf waterfront, with Frank Gehry\u2019s white MedienHafen building.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The D\u00fcsseldorf waterfront, with Frank Gehry\u2019s white MedienHafen building.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Bischoff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later still, terrible wars were triggered partly by rivalry over the coal and steel of the Rhineland. The West German capital of Bonn found itself on the frontlines of the cold war, while the Franco-German border city of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/strasbourg\" title=\"\">Strasbourg</a> emerged as one of the headquarters of the European Union. </p> <p>More happily, the river has also played a central role in shaping Europe\u2019s culture. Perhaps the most famous example of this can be found along the \u201cRomantic Rhine\u201d in western Germany, which I\u2019d travelled along before arriving at the alpine lighthouse. This area is known for its beauty, and it didn\u2019t disappoint. Heading south from Koblenz on an open-topped boat, I passed through a seemingly endless series of pretty riverside towns, vineyards and forested peaks. Rocky islands were decorated with whitewashed chapels, and almost every hilltop had a crumbling castle. It looked like the kind of place where Shrek might live happily ever after.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0123bf2f48ba80118ae72efe16ebd7e4c858d7f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0123bf2f48ba80118ae72efe16ebd7e4c858d7f9/113_550_4919_2951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oberalp pass with Lighthouse replica, Switzerland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oberalp pass with Lighthouse replica, Switzerland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Loetscher Chlaus/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wasn\u2019t the first visitor to appreciate the Rhine\u2019s beauty, of course. In the 19th century, as German patriots searched for symbols around which their nascent country could unite, the middle Rhine emerged as a potent source of pride. Just as the British national identity was (and is) defined partly by the country\u2019s island geography, the emerging German national identity was, for many patriots, epitomised by Germany\u2019s wild spaces. In that context, the Rhine was a cleansing force in an era of industrialisation; a unifying belt which tied states together, and a symbol of an idealised past where heroism prevailed. \u201cMemories of what the Germans once were and could be in the future are evoked nowhere so clearly as on the Rhine,\u201d Friedrich Schlegel wrote in 1803.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dbcd9503b70163e6112f3a8436632de0e95ecc63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbcd9503b70163e6112f3a8436632de0e95ecc63/0_127_3800_2280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Koblenz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Koblenz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: bbsferrari/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Monuments, statues and castles were erected along the river, and plays and operas penned about it. Wagner, Goethe, Beethoven, Turner and Byron were all inspired by trips along it. Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein after a visit to a Rhine town where a local man was rumoured to be experimenting on dead bodies, and both the car and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Drais\" title=\"\">the bicycle</a> were invented on the river\u2019s banks.</p> <p>Brits on Grand Tours of the continent were also enthralled by the sight of attractions like the famous Lorelei rock. \u201cOh! This, to me, were earthly bliss,\u201d an ecstatic James Blake wrote after his visit in 1840. \u201cMy nature sure was made for this!\u201d</p> <p>Today, such enthusiasm for a river can be hard to imagine. In Europe, most of us now work in office buildings rather than in mills or factories powered by waterwheels, and we travel by plane, car or train rather than riverboat. Rivers themselves have been tamed, with islands removed and banks overlaid with stone. In that context, even mighty waterways like the Rhine, Thames or Elbe are seen as nice places to walk a dog or have a drink after work, but not as exciting, important things. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1fad70cdbcb5fb8840497e353e8693b9110fdd18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fad70cdbcb5fb8840497e353e8693b9110fdd18/0_218_6496_3898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"view of Duisburg Inner Harbour at dusk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duisburg inner harbour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nikada/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a shame, because in many ways rivers are still crucial. North of the Romantic Rhine, I spent a few weeks exploring the area around the German cities of Duisburg and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/feb/05/dusseldorf-germany-local-city-guide-rudi-esch-clubs-music\" title=\"\">D\u00fcsseldorf</a>, where the rivers Rhine and Ruhr merge. The Ruhrgebiet conurbation isn\u2019t always attractive \u2013 in many places factory chimneys outnumber trees, and the air tastes like burnt metal. The region has long been one of the engines of the German economy, thanks to the vast coal mines and steelworks clustered there. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, cities like Duisburg developed so fast that when soldiers came home on leave, they had trouble finding their homes. Today, the closure of mines and factories has destroyed thousands of jobs, and some former industrial sites are now tourist attractions, with skating rinks and climbing walls installed in place of furnaces and shipyards. However, the Rhine remains part of the lifeblood of the region\u2019s economy.</p> <p>Rotterdam, at the mouth of the river, is by far the biggest port in Europe, handling more than twice as much trade as the ports at Southampton and Felixstowe combined. </p> <p>Finally, I was also surprised to learn the extent to which the Rhine still shapes the identity of the people who live near it. This was perhaps most obvious at the start of my trip, travelling through the Dutch polders and to cities like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/28/10-of-the-most-bizarre-homemade-attractions\" title=\"\">Dordrecht</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jun/28/travel-tips-utrecht-holland-netherlands\" title=\"\">Utrecht</a>. Here in the Rhine delta, traces of water\u2019s influence are everywhere; from the windmills which were built to pump out water from boggy fields, to the cheese and tulips produced on the fertile land left behind.</p> <p>The omnipresent water even shaped the Netherlands\u2019 political system: with one town\u2019s safety dependent on others maintaining their flood defences, it\u2019s only natural that politics should be more like a business negotiation than a bloodsport.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"1eca5b6d2f796b66e4757f647a0adcc94be1ecdb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1eca5b6d2f796b66e4757f647a0adcc94be1ecdb/0_171_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henryk Sadura/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elsewhere, the Rhine also remains a powerful symbol. The river still forms part of the borders of five countries, and helps tie neighbouring countries together, giving them a shared interest in keeping trade free and the water clean.</p> <p>The modern Rhineland isn\u2019t without its challenges \u2013 last summer, rising temperatures meant the water levels in the river were so low that shipping ground to a halt, denting Germany\u2019s economy and causing fuel shortages in the Netherlands. Overall, though, the outlook remains good. Business is still booming and tourism thrives. After an international clean-up project, the Rhine\u2019s waters are the cleanest in decades. And after centuries of conflict across the river, war between France and Germany is almost certain never to happen.</p> <p>To a Brit in the age of Brexit, the places through which the Rhine flows often appear to represent modern Europe at its best: internationalist, industrious and interconnected; blending cultures and influences as seamlessly as the waters from its tributaries. Standing by one of the lighthouses and gazing up or downstream, it\u2019s hard not to feel awed by all the ways in which one river has shaped history. \u201cThe Rhine,\u201d Victor Hugo wrote, \u201cis unique; it combines the qualities of every river \u2026 Mysterious, like the Nile; spangled with gold, like an American river; and, like a river of Asia, abounding with phantoms and fables.\u201d</p> <p>A man I met on a boat near Arnhem was even more succinct. \u201cThe Rhine,\u201d he said, \u201cconnects us all.\u201d</p> <p><em>Ben Coates is</em><em> author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/rhine-9781473665095.html\" title=\"\">The Rhine: Following Europe\u2019s Greatest River from Amsterdam to the Alps</a>, available for \u00a38.79 from the <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/rhine-9781473665095.html\" title=\"\">Guardian Bookshop</a></em></p> <h2>Excursions and activities on the Rhine</h2> <p><strong>Cycle the</strong><strong> Green Heart</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5429215119ba04c558d0327b751eb5f2db9239d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5429215119ba04c558d0327b751eb5f2db9239d/0_250_5906_3545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"person on bicycle passes blooming flowers on country road between Utrecht and Houten in the Netherlands\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The \u201cGroene Hart\u201d (Green Heart) of the Netherlands is as Dutch as a landscape could be: flat green fields, ancient windmills, dairy cows and dozens of rivers which form part of the Rhine delta.

      "bodyText": "Hiking over the rocks near Tujetsch, I was surprised to find a lighthouse. My surprise wasn\u2019t due to its appearance: the lighthouse was modest in size and rusty red, with the squat proportions of a wine cork, and barely visible through a jacket of mist. What made it extraordinary was its location: perched atop a mountain in Switzerland, more than 200 miles from the nearest coastline and 2,000 metres above sea level. The design looked familiar and, as I walked closer, I realised why. The lighthouse was (a sign explained) a near-replica of one I had seen a few months previously hundreds of miles away, on the Dutch coast at the Hook of Holland. The twin lighthouses were, in a sense, opposing poles: one near the source of the River Rhine in the Alps, the other where the same river ends at the North Sea. As such, this spot marked a natural end to my journey along the Rhine, all the way from river mouth to source, from one lighthouse to the other. Before setting out along the Rhine I\u2019d always thought of it as a thoroughly German river, in much the same way that the Thames is indisputably British and the Seine quintessentially French. In truth, the Rhine is multinational. Following the river, I\u2019d traversed not only Switzerland, the Netherlands and Germany, but also France, Austria and Liechtenstein, and through cities including Basel, Strasbourg, Bonn, D\u00fcsseldorf and Rotterdam. Along the way, the river itself had changed from a wide channel flanked by meadows and cathedrals to a tumbling mountain stream. Charging almost 800 miles across Europe, the Rhine changed its appearance as often as a pantomime dame. Cycling, walking, swimming and boating my way along the river, I\u2019d found it littered with odd and interesting sights, from underground nuclear bunkers to thunderous waterfalls, nudist spas and glittering modern skyscrapers. I also learned how the Rhine has long been one of Europe\u2019s most important highways, moats and natural resources, and has played a pivotal role in the history of the places it passes. Two thousand years ago, the northern section of the river served as the outer boundary of the Roman Empire, a liquid frontier which kept out would-be migrants more effectively than any wall. Later, the river also served as an important highway for trade, generating enormous wealth for everyone from Frisians and Vikings to the merchants of the Hanseatic League and Golden Age Amsterdam. Later still, terrible wars were triggered partly by rivalry over the coal and steel of the Rhineland. The West German capital of Bonn found itself on the frontlines of the cold war, while the Franco-German border city of Strasbourg emerged as one of the headquarters of the European Union. More happily, the river has also played a central role in shaping Europe\u2019s culture. Perhaps the most famous example of this can be found along the \u201cRomantic Rhine\u201d in western Germany, which I\u2019d travelled along before arriving at the alpine lighthouse. This area is known for its beauty, and it didn\u2019t disappoint. Heading south from Koblenz on an open-topped boat, I passed through a seemingly endless series of pretty riverside towns, vineyards and forested peaks. Rocky islands were decorated with whitewashed chapels, and almost every hilltop had a crumbling castle. It looked like the kind of place where Shrek might live happily ever after. I wasn\u2019t the first visitor to appreciate the Rhine\u2019s beauty, of course. In the 19th century, as German patriots searched for symbols around which their nascent country could unite, the middle Rhine emerged as a potent source of pride. Just as the British national identity was (and is) defined partly by the country\u2019s island geography, the emerging German national identity was, for many patriots, epitomised by Germany\u2019s wild spaces. In that context, the Rhine was a cleansing force in an era of industrialisation; a unifying belt which tied states together, and a symbol of an idealised past where heroism prevailed. \u201cMemories of what the Germans once were and could be in the future are evoked nowhere so clearly as on the Rhine,\u201d Friedrich Schlegel wrote in 1803. Monuments, statues and castles were erected along the river, and plays and operas penned about it. Wagner, Goethe, Beethoven, Turner and Byron were all inspired by trips along it. Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein after a visit to a Rhine town where a local man was rumoured to be experimenting on dead bodies, and both the car and the bicycle were invented on the river\u2019s banks. Brits on Grand Tours of the continent were also enthralled by the sight of attractions like the famous Lorelei rock. \u201cOh! This, to me, were earthly bliss,\u201d an ecstatic James Blake wrote after his visit in 1840. \u201cMy nature sure was made for this!\u201d Today, such enthusiasm for a river can be hard to imagine. In Europe, most of us now work in office buildings rather than in mills or factories powered by waterwheels, and we travel by plane, car or train rather than riverboat. Rivers themselves have been tamed, with islands removed and banks overlaid with stone. In that context, even mighty waterways like the Rhine, Thames or Elbe are seen as nice places to walk a dog or have a drink after work, but not as exciting, important things. This is a shame, because in many ways rivers are still crucial. North of the Romantic Rhine, I spent a few weeks exploring the area around the German cities of Duisburg and D\u00fcsseldorf, where the rivers Rhine and Ruhr merge. The Ruhrgebiet conurbation isn\u2019t always attractive \u2013 in many places factory chimneys outnumber trees, and the air tastes like burnt metal. The region has long been one of the engines of the German economy, thanks to the vast coal mines and steelworks clustered there. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, cities like Duisburg developed so fast that when soldiers came home on leave, they had trouble finding their homes. Today, the closure of mines and factories has destroyed thousands of jobs, and some former industrial sites are now tourist attractions, with skating rinks and climbing walls installed in place of furnaces and shipyards. However, the Rhine remains part of the lifeblood of the region\u2019s economy. Rotterdam, at the mouth of the river, is by far the biggest port in Europe, handling more than twice as much trade as the ports at Southampton and Felixstowe combined. Finally, I was also surprised to learn the extent to which the Rhine still shapes the identity of the people who live near it. This was perhaps most obvious at the start of my trip, travelling through the Dutch polders and to cities like Dordrecht and Utrecht. Here in the Rhine delta, traces of water\u2019s influence are everywhere; from the windmills which were built to pump out water from boggy fields, to the cheese and tulips produced on the fertile land left behind. The omnipresent water even shaped the Netherlands\u2019 political system: with one town\u2019s safety dependent on others maintaining their flood defences, it\u2019s only natural that politics should be more like a business negotiation than a bloodsport. Elsewhere, the Rhine also remains a powerful symbol. The river still forms part of the borders of five countries, and helps tie neighbouring countries together, giving them a shared interest in keeping trade free and the water clean. The modern Rhineland isn\u2019t without its challenges \u2013 last summer, rising temperatures meant the water levels in the river were so low that shipping ground to a halt, denting Germany\u2019s economy and causing fuel shortages in the Netherlands. Overall, though, the outlook remains good. Business is still booming and tourism thrives. After an international clean-up project, the Rhine\u2019s waters are the cleanest in decades. And after centuries of conflict across the river, war between France and Germany is almost certain never to happen. To a Brit in the age of Brexit, the places through which the Rhine flows often appear to represent modern Europe at its best: internationalist, industrious and interconnected; blending cultures and influences as seamlessly as the waters from its tributaries. Standing by one of the lighthouses and gazing up or downstream, it\u2019s hard not to feel awed by all the ways in which one river has shaped history. \u201cThe Rhine,\u201d Victor Hugo wrote, \u201cis unique; it combines the qualities of every river \u2026 Mysterious, like the Nile; spangled with gold, like an American river; and, like a river of Asia, abounding with phantoms and fables.\u201d A man I met on a boat near Arnhem was even more succinct. \u201cThe Rhine,\u201d he said, \u201cconnects us all.\u201d Ben Coates is author of The Rhine: Following Europe\u2019s Greatest River from Amsterdam to the Alps, available for \u00a38.79 from the Guardian Bookshop Excursions and activities on the Rhine Cycle the Green Heart The \u201cGroene Hart\u201d (Green Heart) of the Netherlands is as Dutch as a landscape could be: flat green fields, ancient windmills, dairy cows and dozens of rivers which form part of the Rhine delta. To get a taste of it, rent a bicycle in Gouda or Dordrecht and cycle east, stopping in an ancient village like Oudewater for lunch, cheese tasting or a glass or three of Heineken. \u2022 holland-cycling.com Carnival in Cologne The Rhine isn\u2019t all pretty forests and castles \u2013 the cities of the German Rhineland are known for their raucous carnivals. Visit Cologne during Carnival (20-28 Feb 2020) or the Christopher Street Day parade (6-8 July 2019) for a wild day out \u2013 but don\u2019t expect much sleep. \u2022 cologne.de Cruise It\u2019s not exactly off the beaten track, but a \u201cRomantic Rhine\u201d boat cruise is still one of the best ways to explore the river at its most beautiful. Countless options are available, from weeks-long luxury cruises to one-hour ferry rides. The prettiest section is between Koblenz and Bingen, where there\u2019s an ancient castle on almost every hilltop. \u2022 kdrhine.com Swim the Rhine in Basel Basel is one of Europe\u2019s most picturesque cities, with the river carving right through its centre. The best way to see the old town is by swimming past it in the crystal clear river, either during the annual Basel Rhine Swim or at your own pace. \u2022 basel.com Lake Constance One of the largest lakes in Europe, Lake Constance (or Bodensee) bulges from the Rhine like a giant bead on a string. To explore it, go island-hopping by ferry from the southern German town of Konstanz east towards Austria, with a view of the Alps on the way. Or, if your budget allows, ride an airship high over the German part of the lake. \u2022 zeppelin-nt.de Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "body": "<p>On a recent sunny evening, residents of Chicago\u2019s 33rd ward packed a small office on the city\u2019s north-west side to meet their new alderman: democratic socialist Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez.</p> <p>She had narrowly defeated her opponent, an incumbent from one of Chicago\u2019s most prominent political families, to become one of six democratic socialists on the 50-member city council. It was a remarkable showing in America\u2019s third-largest city that paralleled the rise of socialist political figures nationally, such as the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/10/america-socialism-capitalism-poll-axios\">Four in 10 Americans prefer socialism to capitalism, poll finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now Rodriguez-Sanchez was opening her ward office to the community for the first time.</p> <p>She was looking to introduce herself, but also \u2013 it seemed \u2013 to set the tone for her tenure as alderman, to model the kind of systemic change she had promised in her campaign. And, now making up more than 10% of the incoming city council, the socialist bloc would also potentially wield considerable influence.</p> <p>The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) candidates ran on a vow to upend a Chicago political establishment they said had not served everyone equally and challenge the infamous machine-style politics that have dominated Chicago for generations. They promised a more representative, responsive government \u2013 one that acts as a \u201cpower line\u201d, Rodriguez-Sanchez likes to say \u2013 from the institutions of power to the grassroots movements in the neighborhoods. Now, it was time to show what that looked like in action.</p> <p>About a hundred people crowded into the office, a small space on a corner of busy Irving Park Road, where a nearby storefront still displayed a sign bearing the name of her incumbent opponent: Deb Mell. It was ostensibly a political event \u2013 one in which the new alderman would introduce herself and her staff, and attendees could bring issues to her attention \u2013 but it had the feel of a neighborhood barbecue or community gathering.</p> <p>Neighbors caught up over plates of homemade food while kids played and ate popsicles. Rodriguez-Sanchez had wanted the office to have the feel of a community oasis, a public forum where \u201cneighbors\u201d \u2013 she prefers the word over \u201cconstituents\u201d \u2013 can share their concerns. It had been a long road to get here \u2013 a close campaign and runoff and now learning to navigate the city\u2019s corridors of power.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot,\u201d she said. But it seemed it was all ready to pay off.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez,\u201d she said, standing on a chair, flanked by her young staff. \u201cAnd I\u2019m your new alderman.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really excited to serve you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"divider\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">divider</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Rodriguez-Sanchez\u2019s unlikely win here in April</strong> came as part of a broader reform election that lifted Lori Lightfoot to be Chicago\u2019s first black woman and gay mayor with a progressive message of change.</p> <p>But the wins by the DSA candidates seemed to represent an even more radical vision, one that reflected a constituency skeptical of even Lightfoot\u2019s progressive bona fides. Rodriguez-Sanchez, Daniel La Spata, Jeanette Taylor, Byron Sigcho-Lopez and Andre Vasquez all won seats on the 50-member city council. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, who had previously been the council\u2019s lone democratic socialist, won re-election to retain the 35th ward seat he has held since 2015.</p> <p>There are differences in philosophy and approach even among the small DSA caucus, but the candidates were united in calls for government transparency, progressive approaches to education, housing and labor, and social justice. That so many DSA candidates won, said Lucie Macias, co-chair of the Chicago DSA chapter, represented \u201csmall victories against the machine\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPeople were saying, \u2018We\u2019re done with the old way of Chicago politics and we\u2019re looking for a transformative change,\u2019\u201d said Macias. </p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to overstate the significance of those wins. The socialist label has long been used as a slur in mainstream US politics, an epithet that Republicans frequently leveled against Barack Obama. Donald Trump often invokes it to rile his base up against Democrats and appears likely to make it a mainstay of his 2020 campaign.</p> <p>\u201cAmerica will never be a socialist country, ever,\u201d Trump said at a Florida rally on 18 June that officially launched his re-election bid.</p> <p>But the ideology has gained traction in the Trump era, both in response to the president\u2019s push to the right and as a new political generation asserts itself; one that came of age in the shadow of recession, trapped under mountains of student debt, on the wrong end of rising income inequality and staring down a future less promising than that of the previous generation.</p> <p>Sanders tapped into those frustrations during his insurgent run for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016. He came up short to Hillary Clinton, but his movement bore fruit in 2018 as young, self-identified democratic socialists like Ocasio-Cortez won national office in the midterm elections and powered a Democratic takeover of the US House of Representatives.</p> <p>The mainstream success of Sanders, who is again running for president, and Ocasio-Cortez, who has become one of the most recognizable faces of the Democratic party, has seen the DSA recruit more than 60,000 members across the US, opening chapters in once unlikely places like North Dakota and Montana and Iowa.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an opening for these ideas now,\u201d said Rodriguez-Sanchez.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"divider\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">divider</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Rodriguez-Sanchez and the other DSA candidates who won</strong> in Chicago had an upwards climb to win their seats, facing off against more established, more connected, more monied opponents.</p> <p>\u201cWe really had a challenging battle to get here,\u201d said Vasquez, a community organizer and former rapper who defeated incumbent Patrick O\u2019Connor, who had served the 40th ward for close to 40 years. \u201cWe were taking on a giant of the council.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t even describe how much it meant [to win],\u201d Vasquez added.</p> <p>Rodriguez-Sanchez had a much narrower victory.</p> <p>The 40-year-old educator and organizer had grown up in Puerto Rico, spending her childhood attending protests with her activist father on issues such as water and public education that continue to inspire her activism.</p> <p>\u201cIt completely shaped my politics,\u201d she said. \u201cI have never stopped doing that work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fd8934fc0797229931f37e90c3965f92abf4583\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fd8934fc0797229931f37e90c3965f92abf4583/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez on her victory: \u2018It was exhausting.

She\u2019d make a great elected official.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI really went to bat for her at that point,\u201d Poulos said.</p> <p>Rodriguez-Sanchez and her staff of grassroots activists ran against Mell, a former Illinois state representative who had served the 33rd ward since 2013, when then mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed her to fill the vacant seat left by her retiring father, Richard Mell. </p> <p>Richard Mell had been one of the most powerful cogs in Chicago\u2019s political machine for almost four decades and whose son-in-law, Rod Blagojevich, had been the governor of the state until being impeached, removed from office and sent to prison on corruption charges.</p> <p>Rodriguez-Sanchez won more votes than Mell in the February election, forcing another vote in the April runoff. When the dust settled after election night in April, the race between Rodriguez-Sanchez and Mell was still too close to call, leading to a two-week recount that eventually saw the political newcomer edge out the incumbent by a mere 13 votes \u2013 50.1% to 49.9%.</p> <p>\u201cI cried a little bit,\u201d Rodriguez-Sanchez said of her reaction after Mell finally conceded. \u201cIt was exhausting. We had worked so hard. My heart just got swollen. I was really excited.\u201d</p> <p>Her narrow victory, like the DSA wins across the city, represented a fragile mandate, but also gave her and the other democratic socialists who won seats something most hadn\u2019t had access to before: institutional power. Most had been community activists, pushing for progressive ideals from the outside. Now, after being sworn in , they found themselves on the inside, with a chance to advocate for the causes they had spent years fighting for from within the city\u2019s power structure.</p> <p>\u201cI feel that we have a really big opportunity,\u201d Rodriguez-Sanchez said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"divider\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">divider</a> </figure>  <p><strong>But being on the inside comes with </strong> challenges.</p> <p>For one thing, while six DSA aldermen may be a notable minority, the group is a minority nonetheless. It will need to build alliances in order to enact their agenda and their even more ambitious stated goal of reforming city government. \u201cI think for us it\u2019s going to be a learning curve,\u201d Poulos said.</p> <p>In the case of democratic socialists, some of what they\u2019re advocating may run counter to the interests of the city establishment. \u201cThey\u2019re probably going to try to fight what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Macias said. \u201cIt\u2019s in their best interest to bring us down.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond the ideological battles, the new council members will also have to contend with more prosaic duties \u2013 unsexy mechanical matters such as ensuring the garbage is picked up \u2013 which will command a significant portion of their time. \u201cThat\u2019s going to take a lot of their efforts,\u201d said Dick Simpson, a professor of political science at University of Illinois Chicago and a former alderman.</p> <p>Finally, there\u2019s the baggage that the label democratic socialist still carries in mainstream politics.

      "bodyText": "On a recent sunny evening, residents of Chicago\u2019s 33rd ward packed a small office on the city\u2019s north-west side to meet their new alderman: democratic socialist Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez. She had narrowly defeated her opponent, an incumbent from one of Chicago\u2019s most prominent political families, to become one of six democratic socialists on the 50-member city council. It was a remarkable showing in America\u2019s third-largest city that paralleled the rise of socialist political figures nationally, such as the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Now Rodriguez-Sanchez was opening her ward office to the community for the first time. She was looking to introduce herself, but also \u2013 it seemed \u2013 to set the tone for her tenure as alderman, to model the kind of systemic change she had promised in her campaign. And, now making up more than 10% of the incoming city council, the socialist bloc would also potentially wield considerable influence. The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) candidates ran on a vow to upend a Chicago political establishment they said had not served everyone equally and challenge the infamous machine-style politics that have dominated Chicago for generations. They promised a more representative, responsive government \u2013 one that acts as a \u201cpower line\u201d, Rodriguez-Sanchez likes to say \u2013 from the institutions of power to the grassroots movements in the neighborhoods. Now, it was time to show what that looked like in action. About a hundred people crowded into the office, a small space on a corner of busy Irving Park Road, where a nearby storefront still displayed a sign bearing the name of her incumbent opponent: Deb Mell. It was ostensibly a political event \u2013 one in which the new alderman would introduce herself and her staff, and attendees could bring issues to her attention \u2013 but it had the feel of a neighborhood barbecue or community gathering. Neighbors caught up over plates of homemade food while kids played and ate popsicles. Rodriguez-Sanchez had wanted the office to have the feel of a community oasis, a public forum where \u201cneighbors\u201d \u2013 she prefers the word over \u201cconstituents\u201d \u2013 can share their concerns. It had been a long road to get here \u2013 a close campaign and runoff and now learning to navigate the city\u2019s corridors of power. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot,\u201d she said. But it seemed it was all ready to pay off. \u201cI\u2019m Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez,\u201d she said, standing on a chair, flanked by her young staff. \u201cAnd I\u2019m your new alderman. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited to serve you. Rodriguez-Sanchez\u2019s unlikely win here in April came as part of a broader reform election that lifted Lori Lightfoot to be Chicago\u2019s first black woman and gay mayor with a progressive message of change. But the wins by the DSA candidates seemed to represent an even more radical vision, one that reflected a constituency skeptical of even Lightfoot\u2019s progressive bona fides. Rodriguez-Sanchez, Daniel La Spata, Jeanette Taylor, Byron Sigcho-Lopez and Andre Vasquez all won seats on the 50-member city council. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, who had previously been the council\u2019s lone democratic socialist, won re-election to retain the 35th ward seat he has held since 2015. There are differences in philosophy and approach even among the small DSA caucus, but the candidates were united in calls for government transparency, progressive approaches to education, housing and labor, and social justice. That so many DSA candidates won, said Lucie Macias, co-chair of the Chicago DSA chapter, represented \u201csmall victories against the machine\u201d. \u201cPeople were saying, \u2018We\u2019re done with the old way of Chicago politics and we\u2019re looking for a transformative change,\u2019\u201d said Macias. It\u2019s difficult to overstate the significance of those wins. The socialist label has long been used as a slur in mainstream US politics, an epithet that Republicans frequently leveled against Barack Obama. Donald Trump often invokes it to rile his base up against Democrats and appears likely to make it a mainstay of his 2020 campaign. \u201cAmerica will never be a socialist country, ever,\u201d Trump said at a Florida rally on 18 June that officially launched his re-election bid. But the ideology has gained traction in the Trump era, both in response to the president\u2019s push to the right and as a new political generation asserts itself; one that came of age in the shadow of recession, trapped under mountains of student debt, on the wrong end of rising income inequality and staring down a future less promising than that of the previous generation. Sanders tapped into those frustrations during his insurgent run for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016. He came up short to Hillary Clinton, but his movement bore fruit in 2018 as young, self-identified democratic socialists like Ocasio-Cortez won national office in the midterm elections and powered a Democratic takeover of the US House of Representatives. The mainstream success of Sanders, who is again running for president, and Ocasio-Cortez, who has become one of the most recognizable faces of the Democratic party, has seen the DSA recruit more than 60,000 members across the US, opening chapters in once unlikely places like North Dakota and Montana and Iowa. \u201cThere\u2019s an opening for these ideas now,\u201d said Rodriguez-Sanchez. Rodriguez-Sanchez and the other DSA candidates who won in Chicago had an upwards climb to win their seats, facing off against more established, more connected, more monied opponents. \u201cWe really had a challenging battle to get here,\u201d said Vasquez, a community organizer and former rapper who defeated incumbent Patrick O\u2019Connor, who had served the 40th ward for close to 40 years. \u201cWe were taking on a giant of the council.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t even describe how much it meant [to win],\u201d Vasquez added. Rodriguez-Sanchez had a much narrower victory. The 40-year-old educator and organizer had grown up in Puerto Rico, spending her childhood attending protests with her activist father on issues such as water and public education that continue to inspire her activism. \u201cIt completely shaped my politics,\u201d she said. \u201cI have never stopped doing that work.\u201d She continued organizing upon moving to Chicago, advocating for social justice and local progressive causes with 33rd Ward Working Families, an independent political organization on the north-west side where she had worked alongside several activists who later joined her campaign and aldermanic teams, including Chris Poulos, her campaign manager and current chief of staff. \u201cWhen I heard her first pitch about what she was thinking and how she was framing [her potential run for office] it just clicked,\u201d Poulos said of Rodriguez-Sanchez. \u201cLike, \u2018Fuck yeah. She\u2019d make a great elected official.\u2019\u201d \u201cI really went to bat for her at that point,\u201d Poulos said. Rodriguez-Sanchez and her staff of grassroots activists ran against Mell, a former Illinois state representative who had served the 33rd ward since 2013, when then mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed her to fill the vacant seat left by her retiring father, Richard Mell. Richard Mell had been one of the most powerful cogs in Chicago\u2019s political machine for almost four decades and whose son-in-law, Rod Blagojevich, had been the governor of the state until being impeached, removed from office and sent to prison on corruption charges. Rodriguez-Sanchez won more votes than Mell in the February election, forcing another vote in the April runoff. When the dust settled after election night in April, the race between Rodriguez-Sanchez and Mell was still too close to call, leading to a two-week recount that eventually saw the political newcomer edge out the incumbent by a mere 13 votes \u2013 50.1% to 49.9%. \u201cI cried a little bit,\u201d Rodriguez-Sanchez said of her reaction after Mell finally conceded. \u201cIt was exhausting. We had worked so hard. My heart just got swollen. I was really excited.\u201d Her narrow victory, like the DSA wins across the city, represented a fragile mandate, but also gave her and the other democratic socialists who won seats something most hadn\u2019t had access to before: institutional power. Most had been community activists, pushing for progressive ideals from the outside. Now, after being sworn in , they found themselves on the inside, with a chance to advocate for the causes they had spent years fighting for from within the city\u2019s power structure. \u201cI feel that we have a really big opportunity,\u201d Rodriguez-Sanchez said. But being on the inside comes with challenges. For one thing, while six DSA aldermen may be a notable minority, the group is a minority nonetheless. It will need to build alliances in order to enact their agenda and their even more ambitious stated goal of reforming city government. \u201cI think for us it\u2019s going to be a learning curve,\u201d Poulos said. In the case of democratic socialists, some of what they\u2019re advocating may run counter to the interests of the city establishment. \u201cThey\u2019re probably going to try to fight what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Macias said. \u201cIt\u2019s in their best interest to bring us down.\u201d Beyond the ideological battles, the new council members will also have to contend with more prosaic duties \u2013 unsexy mechanical matters such as ensuring the garbage is picked up \u2013 which will command a significant portion of their time. \u201cThat\u2019s going to take a lot of their efforts,\u201d said Dick Simpson, a professor of political science at University of Illinois Chicago and a former alderman. Finally, there\u2019s the baggage that the label democratic socialist still carries in mainstream politics. Vazquez said he\u2019d already been asked about it by some of his new colleagues. \u201cInitially folks might\u2019ve had a little sticker shock,\u201d Vasquez said. \u201cEveryone knows the term, but not everyone knows what it means.\u201d But it didn\u2019t take long, Vasquez said, to get his peers to understand. And that \u2013 growing familiarity \u2013 could be the big impact of the DSA\u2019s success in Chicago\u2019s elections this year. \u201cDSA\u2019s newly developed interest in and skill at winning local seats is a very positive development for the organization, helping to attract new members and detoxify the label socialist,\u201d Maurice Isserman, a professor of history at Hamilton College who has written about the American left, said in an email. Chicago\u2019s socialists see their 2019 victories as the potential beginning of momentum for more change going forward \u2013 and a warning shot at the city establishment. \u201cThe culture of city council has been one of go along to play along, and we are trying to change that,\u201d Rodriguez-Sanchez said. \u201cSome people might feel threatened.\u201d Whether that translates into legislative victories remains to be seen. They have added additional weight to the city council\u2019s progressive caucus which, with a new mayor in Lightfoot who has promised reform, could push the city in a more leftward direction. But that will depend on Lightfoot\u2019s priorities and her ability to deliver on her own progressive campaign promises, which some activists and democratic socialists here view with skepticism. \u201cNo one\u2019s really sure what to expect,\u201d Macias said. It will also depend on how the DSA members interact with Lightfoot, others on the city council, and even one another. \u201cI think they can make some pretty significant strides, but they\u2019re still going to be a minority bloc,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cIt depends on how cohesive they are.\u201d \u201cChange is always going to be a challenge,\u201d Vasquez said. For the new aldermen and their supporters, though, the most important work won\u2019t take place on the city council \u2013 it will be in the neighborhoods, in the grassroots movements from which the candidates sprung. \u201cThese new aldermen, that\u2019s not where we\u2019re going to find our ultimate power,\u201d Macias said. \u201cThey need to feel the pressure from the community members. \u201cWithout people, you just have an office.\u201d As she opened her ward office in June, Rodriguez-Sanchez made the voices of her \u201cneighbors\u201d the focus, addressing the crowd only briefly before stepping down from her chair to meet with residents one-on-one and listen to their concerns.

      "bodyText": "Claire\u2019s Stores Inc, an international accessories and cosmetics retailer tailored to kids and teens, has a motto: \u201cWe make memories\u201d. But its customers may have been alarmed after asbestos, a cancer-causing material that can stay in the body for many years, was found in several of Claire\u2019s makeup products in the US. On 6 June, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety alert warning people to stop using a Claire\u2019s Jojo Siwa Makeup Set, as well as a contouring palette sold by Beauty Plus Global because the products had tested positive for asbestos. Both companies had issued a voluntary recall of the products at the end of May. The June warning came just two months after the FDA flagged three other Claire\u2019s products \u2013 an eye shadow, compact powder and contour palette \u2013 for asbestos. The agency issued a safety warning on 5 March for consumers after, it said, Claire\u2019s initially refused to recall the products in question. \u201cClaire\u2019s stands behind the safety of our products,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement to the Guardian on Friday. \u201cAll our cosmetic products are reviewed by two cosmetic safety assessors and undergo rigorous analysis and assessment before reaching consumers.\u201d The company also began replacing talc with a cosmetic-grade mica in all its products last year. Claire\u2019s isn\u2019t the only tween company with an asbestos problem on its hands. The FDA\u2019s March warning also confirmed a product called Just Shine Shimmer Powder, sold by youth-focused retailer Justice, also tested positive for asbestos. Justice had recalled the asbestos-tainted product, along with seven other suspect items, in 2017 after product testing commissioned by a North Carolina news outlet found asbestos and heavy metals. Why does asbestos keep turning up in kids\u2019 makeup? Asbestos is a group of six minerals that occur naturally in the earth. It is often in close proximity to deposits of talc, which is ground into talcum powder to make a range of cosmetics and personal care products, like baby powder, blush, eye shadow, foundation and more. During mining, talc can be contaminated with asbestos, which can then potentially end up in consumer products. Firms say they have strong quality controls to identify it. Environmental health advocates say a lack of stronger regulation in the cosmetics industry is the real issue. \u201cIt is appalling that it\u2019s perfectly legal to sell kids makeup in this country contaminated with asbestos \u2013 a known human carcinogen,\u201d Janet Nudelman, director of the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, said via email. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s worse \u2013 asbestos in kids\u2019 products or the fact that the FDA can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d There are no laws in the United States that require manufacturers to test the safety of cosmetics ingredients before going to market. The FDA oversees cosmetics and personal care products, but has limited authority over manufacturers. The agency cannot force companies to recall products found to be dangerous, and companies are not required to share safety information with the FDA. Asbestos is only banned for certain uses in the United States. The EPA is currently doing a risk evaluation on asbestos under the Toxic Substances Control Act. Cosmetics contamination is not an area the EPA is currently looking at under the TSCA evaluation. Health advocates and the FDA say the extent of asbestos contamination in cosmetics remains unknown. While recent reports have been focused on children\u2019s cosmetics, asbestos could potentially be present in any product with talc. \u201cWe have absolutely no idea how often asbestos is found in cosmetics containing talc,\u201d said Nudelman, who is also director of program and policy of Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, a science-based policy and advocacy group. She advised consumers to avoid using products with talc unless it is known to be asbestos-free, and warned that no talc products should be used in the pelvic area because of links to ovarian cancer. In 2009 the FDA sampled 38 cosmetics products and found no traces of asbestos. \u201cNonetheless, these results indicate that any talc-containing product could contain asbestos if not adequately sourced with quality controls to assure that the talc is asbestos-free,\u201d an FDA spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \u201cBecause FDA law is so outdated, it leaves it to the general public and NGOs and individual moms to be scrutinizing these products,\u201d said Liz Hitchcock, acting director of Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families, an advocacy group focused on toxic chemicals. The FDA said it does not have the capability to test for asbestos on its own and is reliant on outside labs. The agency was prompted to investigate products sold by Claire\u2019s and Justice after media reports on asbestos findings, including a lab analysis commissioned by the mother of a six year-old in Rhode Island. The rules for FDA\u2019s authority over cosmetics products, laid out in the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetics Act, have not been updated since 1938, a fact mentioned by FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and Susan Mayne, director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, in a statement on the March asbestos findings. \u201cTo significantly shift the safety paradigm of cosmetics in the US, we would need to work with stakeholders, including Congress, to modernize the outdated regulatory framework that the FDA has been operating under for more than 80 years when it comes to cosmetics,\u201d the statement read. Asked by the Guardian if US customers concerned about asbestos exposure should avoid products containing talc, the FDA said in a statement: \u201cThe FDA\u2019s findings are specific to the products tested and do not signify the presence of asbestos in any other products on the market. \u201cIn a 2009 survey, conducted for the FDA, 38 samples were tested and did not show any evidence of asbestos.

Six officers surrounded his car, guns pointed. They observed a firearm near McCoy\u2019s lap and one officer said, \u201cIf he reaches for it, you know what to do.\u201d The police cam video shows McCoy apparently waking up and lifting his arm to scratch his shoulder, and then the cops unloading their weapons. The 55 bullets were fired in fewer than four seconds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/17/race-policing-oakland-biased-jennifer-eberhardt\">To end racial disparities in policing, we must look beyond the data | Jennifer Eberhardt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There comes a point when you have to ask why. Why would any human being treat another human being in this way? The most persuasive explanation for these viral videos of US cops wilding out: they don\u2019t think of blacks as human beings. They think they are more like apes. It\u2019s a fact proven by social scientists, and the best way of understanding how the police could treat anybody with such disdain.</p> <p>Scholars have gathered considerable evidence that many people subconsciously associate black people with apes. The \u201cdehumanization thesis\u201d is supported by several studies in which people connect images of gorillas and monkeys to African Americans.</p> <p>The Stanford psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt received a MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d award for her work on this topic. In one experiment she found that people were more likely to identify blurry images of apes after they had been subliminally exposed to black faces rather than white faces. In another study, Eberhardt showed subjects a video of the police beating a man with a baton. The man was face down so you couldn\u2019t see his race. When the subjects were primed with words like \u201cgorilla\u201d and \u201cape\u201d they were more likely to say the force was justified when they learned the suspect was black.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Scholars have gathered considerable evidence that many people subconsciously associate black people with apes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The dehumanization thesis explains how cops could end up killing Willie McCoy, after they had been called to do a \u201cwelfare check\u201d on him by concerned bystanders who observed the young man sleeping in his car. The response by the Vallejo police seems more like an ambush than legitimate law enforcement activity. When officers believe that a suspect has a gun, they are taught to cover, conceal and communicate. This reduces the risk of harm to them, and the suspect. What police are not supposed to do is exactly what the Vallejo cops did: roll up on the suspect, knowingly expose themselves to possible fire, and then use that as an excuse to kill him.</p> <p>Eberhardt has also found patterns of dehumanization in the way that cops talk to black people. Studying videos of police traffic stops in Oakland, California, she found that cops were more likely to address white motorists as \u201csir\u201d and \u201cma\u2019am\u201d, and apologize to them, while blacks were more frequently called \u201cdude\u201d or \u201cbro\u201d and ordered to keep their hands off the wheel. This effect was consistent regardless of the reason for, or location of, the traffic stop.</p> <p>The Phoenix cops used much harsher language than \u201cbro\u201d. In addition to claiming the four-year-old girl had stolen the doll from the bargain store, cops accused her father, Dravon Ames, of stealing underwear, then throwing it out the window when he saw police following him. Ames denies he took the underwear \u2013 but even if he did, the police response was indefensibly over the top.</p> <p>Cops stopped his car and approached with guns drawn. One officer told Ames, \u201cI\u2019m going to fucking put a cap in your fucking head.\u201d The police pushed Ames to the ground and kicked in his leg. Ames and his fianc\u00e9e Iesha Harper were arrested, handcuffed in front of their children, driven to the police station, and eventually released without being charged with any crimes.</p> <p>None of these people \u2013 Willie McCoy in Vallejo, and Iesha Harper and Dravon Ames in Phoenix \u2013 posed any threat to the police. It turns out that doesn\u2019t matter. What happens when cops treat people in ways that are literally inhumane? Usually nothing. The police most often get away with it.</p> <p>An investigation of the killing of McCoy found that the 55 shots fired at McCoy \u2013 who had been sleeping when first accosted by the cops \u2013 was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d. In Phoenix, after the video of the arrest of Evans and Ames caused a public outcry, the city\u2019s mayor said the situation was \u201cbeyond upsetting\u201d. But Phoenix police chief Jeri Williams, who leads a force that has the highest rate of police shootings in the US, told a meeting of outraged citizens: \u201cReal change doesn\u2019t start with our police department. Real change starts with our community.\u201d This \u201cblame the victims\u201d mentality is typical of official reactions to police abuse of black and brown people.</p> <p>The Los Angeles police used to have an informal code \u2013 NHI \u2013 for calls to African American neighborhoods. NHI stood for \u201cNo Human Involved\u201d. Eberhardt\u2019s work suggests that this wasn\u2019t just a racist joke, but an actual reflection of these officers\u2019 perceptions of black people.</p> <p>If there\u2019s any good news, it\u2019s that police departments can be trained in techniques which, even if they don\u2019t remove bias from officers, at least reduce the impact of that bias on citizens.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI could have shot you in front of your fucking kids.\u201d That\u2019s what a Phoenix police officer told Iesha Harper, an African American woman arrested with her husband after their four-year-old daughter was accused of stealing a doll from a Family Dollar store. The cop tried to rip Harper\u2019s one-year-old toddler from her arms, after she refused his order to put the baby on the ground. The video of the incident depicts Harper begging the officer to stop pointing his gun at her children. In the San Francisco Bay area, the police pumped 55 bullets into the body of Willie McCoy, a 22-year-old aspiring rapper. McCoy had been sleeping in his car at a Vallejo, California, Taco Bell parking lot when the cops confronted him. Six officers surrounded his car, guns pointed. They observed a firearm near McCoy\u2019s lap and one officer said, \u201cIf he reaches for it, you know what to do.\u201d The police cam video shows McCoy apparently waking up and lifting his arm to scratch his shoulder, and then the cops unloading their weapons. The 55 bullets were fired in fewer than four seconds. There comes a point when you have to ask why. Why would any human being treat another human being in this way? The most persuasive explanation for these viral videos of US cops wilding out: they don\u2019t think of blacks as human beings. They think they are more like apes. It\u2019s a fact proven by social scientists, and the best way of understanding how the police could treat anybody with such disdain. Scholars have gathered considerable evidence that many people subconsciously associate black people with apes. The \u201cdehumanization thesis\u201d is supported by several studies in which people connect images of gorillas and monkeys to African Americans. The Stanford psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt received a MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d award for her work on this topic. In one experiment she found that people were more likely to identify blurry images of apes after they had been subliminally exposed to black faces rather than white faces. In another study, Eberhardt showed subjects a video of the police beating a man with a baton. The man was face down so you couldn\u2019t see his race. When the subjects were primed with words like \u201cgorilla\u201d and \u201cape\u201d they were more likely to say the force was justified when they learned the suspect was black. The dehumanization thesis explains how cops could end up killing Willie McCoy, after they had been called to do a \u201cwelfare check\u201d on him by concerned bystanders who observed the young man sleeping in his car. The response by the Vallejo police seems more like an ambush than legitimate law enforcement activity. When officers believe that a suspect has a gun, they are taught to cover, conceal and communicate. This reduces the risk of harm to them, and the suspect. What police are not supposed to do is exactly what the Vallejo cops did: roll up on the suspect, knowingly expose themselves to possible fire, and then use that as an excuse to kill him. Eberhardt has also found patterns of dehumanization in the way that cops talk to black people. Studying videos of police traffic stops in Oakland, California, she found that cops were more likely to address white motorists as \u201csir\u201d and \u201cma\u2019am\u201d, and apologize to them, while blacks were more frequently called \u201cdude\u201d or \u201cbro\u201d and ordered to keep their hands off the wheel. This effect was consistent regardless of the reason for, or location of, the traffic stop. The Phoenix cops used much harsher language than \u201cbro\u201d. In addition to claiming the four-year-old girl had stolen the doll from the bargain store, cops accused her father, Dravon Ames, of stealing underwear, then throwing it out the window when he saw police following him. Ames denies he took the underwear \u2013 but even if he did, the police response was indefensibly over the top. Cops stopped his car and approached with guns drawn. One officer told Ames, \u201cI\u2019m going to fucking put a cap in your fucking head.\u201d The police pushed Ames to the ground and kicked in his leg. Ames and his fianc\u00e9e Iesha Harper were arrested, handcuffed in front of their children, driven to the police station, and eventually released without being charged with any crimes. None of these people \u2013 Willie McCoy in Vallejo, and Iesha Harper and Dravon Ames in Phoenix \u2013 posed any threat to the police. It turns out that doesn\u2019t matter. What happens when cops treat people in ways that are literally inhumane? Usually nothing. The police most often get away with it. An investigation of the killing of McCoy found that the 55 shots fired at McCoy \u2013 who had been sleeping when first accosted by the cops \u2013 was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d. In Phoenix, after the video of the arrest of Evans and Ames caused a public outcry, the city\u2019s mayor said the situation was \u201cbeyond upsetting\u201d. But Phoenix police chief Jeri Williams, who leads a force that has the highest rate of police shootings in the US, told a meeting of outraged citizens: \u201cReal change doesn\u2019t start with our police department. Real change starts with our community.\u201d This \u201cblame the victims\u201d mentality is typical of official reactions to police abuse of black and brown people. The Los Angeles police used to have an informal code \u2013 NHI \u2013 for calls to African American neighborhoods. NHI stood for \u201cNo Human Involved\u201d. Eberhardt\u2019s work suggests that this wasn\u2019t just a racist joke, but an actual reflection of these officers\u2019 perceptions of black people. If there\u2019s any good news, it\u2019s that police departments can be trained in techniques which, even if they don\u2019t remove bias from officers, at least reduce the impact of that bias on citizens. Police are most likely to react rashly when they have to make quick decisions in stressful situations. Establishing protocols for those kinds of situations keeps community members safer. For example, Eberhardt, the Stanford psychologist, worked with police in Oakland to change their practices for chasing suspects. The number of officer-involved shootings decreased substantially. Of course, police aren\u2019t the only people who associate black folks with monkeys. The comedian Roseanne Barr lost her television show after tweeting that an African American woman looked like the offspring of \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d. But in the US, where cops are literally licensed to kill, this kind of bias in law enforcement officers threatens the lives and dignity of millions of African Americans. It is extremely depressing that in 2019 we still need to persuade people of the essential humanity of black Americans. But until the police learn that lesson, we should expect more cases of cops treating black people like subhumans. Paul Butler is the Albert Brick Professor in Law at Georgetown University.

      "bodyText": "My wife is worried about some dental work she faces later in the afternoon, and her apprehension is colouring the discussion we\u2019re having about the upcoming weekend. We\u2019re meant to be going to a big party in the country, and we will need to spend a night in our tent. \u201cI hate camping,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just sleep in the car?\u201d \u201cHave you ever slept in a car?\u201d I say. \u201cWe have a really nice tent.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll probably still be in pain,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s just massively overpack,\u201d I say. \u201cBring everything \u2013 duvet, pillows, rugs \u2013 and see how it goes.\u201d \u201cUgh,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen is your appointment?\u201d I say. \u201cTwo-thirty,\u201d she says. \u201cHa!\u201d I say. \u201cWhy are you laughing at me?\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not laughing at you, it\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d \u201cYou have a tooth pulled and see how funny it is,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a joke,\u201d I say. \u201cNot to me!\u201d she says, touching the side of her face. \u201cIt\u2019s famous,\u201d I say. \u201cTwo-thirty.\u201d \u201cShut up,\u201d she says. Two days later, I find myself in a field in Devon, standing over a pile of stuff \u2013 pillows, bags, an air mattress, a pump, the dog and the as-yet-unerected tent. \u201cDo you need help?\u201d my wife says. \u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cJust motivation.\u201d \u201cI need painkillers,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m off to find water.\u201d Our tent is not suitable for most forms of camping, because it\u2019s heavy and has the footprint of a bouncy castle. It\u2019s made of canvas, and will allegedly accommodate seven people. If you saw it standing among a load of other tents at a festival, you would probably think: I\u2019ll bet the person who owns that is an arsehole. But I am good at putting it up. I\u2019ve had a lot of practice over many years, and I can now manage it by myself, without fuss. When my wife returns 15 minutes later, I\u2019m basically done. \u201cWow,\u201d she says. \u201cSee?\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d I lose track of my wife at the party. Some time after midnight I go to check if she\u2019s in the tent, but when I get halfway there I realise I won\u2019t be coming back, either way: my limbs and eyelids are heavy, and my slightly damp duvet is calling. As I climb a small rise I catch sight of the pointed canvas peak silhouetted against the night sky, and I instinctively think: I\u2019ll bet the person who owns that is an arsehole. My wife is in the tent, snoring lightly. The air mattress is partially deflated. There is some residual buoyancy \u2013 enough to send an undulating wave beneath her as I sit, causing her to swear at me in her sleep \u2013 but when I lie down all my joints make contact with the ground. When I wake up the next morning, my wife is gone and the mattress is flat. I\u2019m so stiff I can\u2019t figure out how to sit up. Why, I think, did I even bother putting up the tent? I might as well have slept face down on the grass. That\u2019s when I hear the first drops hitting the canvas. It\u2019s raining steadily by the time my wife returns. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d she says. \u201cWe pack it up wet, shove it in the car, and deal with it later,\u201d I say. The traffic is terrible, and we don\u2019t arrive home until 5pm. \u201cLet\u2019s never camp again,\u201d I say, pulling the tent from its bag. \u201cYou\u2019re doing that now?\u201d my wife says. \u201cWhen else?\u201d I say. I drag the sodden tent into the garden and spread it out on the dry grass. As soon as I do, it starts raining. I decide to leave it where it is until summer comes. That evening the oldest one and his friend come round for a takeaway. My wife goes to bed early, leaving the three of us to watch the football. I ache all over, but I am tremendously grateful to be indoors. \u201cIs that a corner?\u201d the oldest one says. \u201cIt should have been,\u201d his friend says. \u201cAnd so I was like, \u2018When\u2019s your appointment?\u2019\u201d I say. \u201cAnd she said, \u2018Two-thirty.\u2019\u201d \u201cHa!\u201d the oldest one says. \u201cThat\u2019s hilarious,\u201d his friend says. \u201cI know, right?\u201d I say.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>How long until the climate </strong><strong>crisis causes irreversible damage?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Ewoenam Tetteh </strong><strong>and Faith Otasowie, both 15</strong><strong>, Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex</strong></p> <p>You are obviously both smart and thoughtful kids, so I will be blunt and tell you that climate change is already causing big changes in our world. You can see this in the melting of the ice sheets in the Arctic and Antarctica, in the rising temperatures in cities around the world, in the changes in how much rain we get, and, perhaps most importantly, in the extinction of many plants and animals that are not able to adapt.</p> <p>One of the most important ideas to grasp about climate change is that it is not a future event: it is happening now, in real time, and those changes will only accelerate in the coming years and decades unless we radically reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we release into the atmosphere (mostly from burning fossil fuels). That\u2019s why we must take action now.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When a particular kind of frog becomes extinct because it cannot adapt to our rapidly warming world, it is lost for ever</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Are the changes we are seeing irreversible? That depends on how you think about it. For example, scientists know that ice sheets have come and gone many times in our planet\u2019s history, driven mostly by slight wobbles in the Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of sunlight hitting the planet (other factors, such as the eruption of volcanoes, have also played a role). So the ice sheets we are losing today will, in all likelihood, grow back some time in the distant future. But we\u2019re talking millions of years.</p> <p>On the other hand, when a particular kind of frog becomes extinct because it cannot adapt to our rapidly warming world, it is lost for ever. We humans are pretty smart and capable creatures, so I don\u2019t worry that we\u2019ll figure out ways to adapt. And maybe we\u2019ll even figure out ways to make it a better world.</p> <p>But it will be a whole lot easier \u2013 for us and for every living thing on the planet \u2013 if we take action now to minimise those changes, both today and in the future. I really like the world we live in, and I\u2019m sure you do, too. It is a beautiful place. Let\u2019s fight to keep it that way.</p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 </strong>Jeff Goodell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/17/miami-hurricane-2037-climate-change\" title=\"\">author of The Water Will Come</a>: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, </em><em>And </em><em>The Remaking </em><em>Of </em><em>The Civilized World</em></p> <h2><strong>Which animal farts are the worst for the environment? Shark, cow, otter or something else?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Sasha Dutta, </strong><strong>eight, London</strong></p> <p>Scientists have published a surprising amount of work relating to animal farts and our climate. It has been hypothesised that large dinosaurs (the sauropods) may have changed the Earth\u2019s climate with their farts. Sharks are rarely seen farting. But like sheep and goats, cows are a type of ruminant \u2013 that is, they have four stomachs. This means a lot of methane, one of the gases that causes the worst warming. One cow can produce up to 200kg of methane a year. Most of it is released as burps, but some certainly escapes out of the rear end, too! Because humans eat so much beef and milk, there are an awful lot of cows in the world, and their burping and farting causes a sizable contribution to our greenhouse gas emissions, making up nearly a third of all emissions from agriculture, by some estimates. This certainly makes them a strong contender for the animal with the farts that do the most damage to the planet (even if their burps are worse).</p> <p><em>\u2022 Dani Rabaiotti</em><em>, environmental scientist and co-author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/true-or-poo.html\" title=\"\">True or Poo</a>?, Quercus, \u00a38.99</em></p> <h2><strong>Why don\u2019t many politicians address the climate </strong><strong>crisis and give us ways to help?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Georgia Robinson, 15, Poole</strong><strong>, Dorset</strong></p> <p>Well, the good news is that nearly all politicians in this country accept that climate change is happening and that it\u2019s caused by human activities; almost all political parties have now accepted that we face a climate emergency. This is an amazing change from just a few years ago, and it\u2019s happened because of people like the climate strikers.</p> <p>But declaring an emergency and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/theresa-may-commits-to-net-zero-uk-carbon-emissions-by-2050\" title=\"\">being prepared to take the necessary steps</a> to address it are not the same thing, and politicians \u2013 especially those in government \u2013 don\u2019t match their words with actions. For example, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, was championing the expansion of Heathrow airport at exactly the same time as apparently agreeing that there\u2019s a climate crisis \u2013 in spite of the fact that air travel is one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>One of the problems is that most politicians won\u2019t accept that we need a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/18/ending-climate-change-end-capitalism\" title=\"\">very different economic model</a>, one that recognises that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/25/capitalism-economic-system-survival-earth\" title=\"\">continuous growth isn\u2019t possible on a planet </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/25/capitalism-economic-system-survival-earth\" title=\"\">with limited resources</a>.

The role of young people in keeping up the pressure is vital \u2013 your generation is making a real difference. But we don\u2019t have much time.</p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 </strong>Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, was elected as the UK\u2019s first Green </em><em>MP in 2010</em></p> <h2>If someone doesn\u2019t believe in the climate crisis, what can I do to help them see it?</h2> <p><strong>Olivia Liddell, </strong><strong>14, </strong><strong>Hemel Hempstead, Herts</strong></p> <p>People who don\u2019t see climate change can be frustrating because the scientific facts are so clear. But, as you\u2019ve probably discovered, facts don\u2019t always help people see the reality. If anything, bombarding people with facts makes them more sceptical and argumentative. So, what else can you do? Here are three things.</p> <p>First, it\u2019s really important to acknowledge the other person\u2019s good nature, and to identify common ground and shared values \u2013 areas where you have agreement. Just because someone doesn\u2019t believe in climate change, it doesn\u2019t make them a bad person. You probably both care about things like family and other people. Affirming shared values reduces the feeling of being attacked; being argumentative rarely succeeds.</p> <p>Second, invite people to think about their legacy \u2013 how their grandchildren and future generations will react to their actions (or inactions). If they are willing to acknowledge even a small chance that climate change is real, don\u2019t they want to be on the right side of the argument?</p> <p>Finally, be really clear that climate change matters to you, that you are personally worried about it, and that you are asking them to help address it because you are scared. Friends, family and others are much more willing to help when they realise something is important to someone they love, even when they may disagree about the facts.</p> <h2><strong>How can we use technology to </strong><strong>stop the climate </strong><strong>crisis?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Daisy Furmston and Chloe Nolan,</strong><strong> both 14, </strong><strong> Hemel Hempstead</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"543cc48cd5badec0e7f1ca04e41d3902dbd912b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/543cc48cd5badec0e7f1ca04e41d3902dbd912b4/0_588_3346_4183/800.jpg\" alt=\"An overflowing bath\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Imagine the tub is the world\u2019s atmosphere, the water is carbon dioxide, and the tap is running.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ragnar Schmuck/Getty Images/fStop</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a great question. Think about your bathtub at home. Imagine the tub is the world\u2019s atmosphere, the water is carbon dioxide, and the tap is running. If we leave it on, eventually the tub will overflow and cause great damage to the house. The same is true of emissions. If we continue to emit CO<sub>2</sub> at the current rate, we are going to see catastrophic consequences.</p> <p>So, how do we solve this problem? The first and most obvious thing is to turn down the tap \u2013 ie reduce our emissions. The good news is, there are a number of great minds working on technological solutions \u2013 from renewable energy to electric vehicles \u2013 to do just that. </p> <p>However, the bathtub is still full of too much water \u2013 the air is already full of CO<sub>2</sub> at dangerous levels \u2013 and if we cannot turn the tap off completely, the tub is going to overflow. So, we are also going to need to pull the plug \u2013 and that means removing CO<sub>2</sub> directly from the atmosphere.</p> <p>This may sound impossible, but it isn\u2019t. My company has developed a technology called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/17/carbon-capture-technology-climate-change-solutions\" title=\"\">direct </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/17/carbon-capture-technology-climate-change-solutions\" title=\"\">air </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/17/carbon-capture-technology-climate-change-solutions\" title=\"\">capture </a>that removes CO<sub>2</sub> using large fans to pull air through a filter that has a liquid capture chemical flowing over it. That chemical binds to the CO<sub>2</sub>, removing it from the air, and then we purify and compress it.</p> <p>After that, we can bury it permanently, injecting CO<sub>2</sub> into rock formations deep underground. This means we create something called \u201cnegative emissions\u201d; by doing this, we will be able to bring our global emissions down to zero at a much faster rate. Eventually, these facilities will be key to reducing the level of CO<sub>2</sub> in the air back to safe levels.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Steve Oldham, CEO of Carbon Engineering, a Canadian-based clean energy company</em></p> <h2><strong>Is it possible to completely reverse the effects of global warming? If </strong><strong>it is, how long would it take?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Dorian Kopij, 15, </strong><strong>Rochester, Kent</strong></p> <p>Good question. We always thought that the answer is that it would take many centuries, because climate science has generally assumed that levels of CO<sub>2</sub> will remain in the atmosphere for a very long time: that global heating is essentially locked in. We are now seeing a real awakening, by scientists, organisations and activists about how to draw carbon down from the atmosphere. We can do this by using both natural techniques, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/15/tree-planting-double-uk-climate-change\" title=\"\">planting more trees</a>, and newer technologies that can filter CO<sub>2</sub> from the air. So then the question is: can we reduce greenhouse gas emissions to very small and manageable levels, and remove significant amounts of carbon in time to avoid runaway climate change, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\" title=\"\">could occur within 10-12 years</a>?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We must do everything we possibly can sooner than we think we can, and more brilliantly than we think possible</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Whatever the answer to that is, we must do everything we possibly can sooner than we think we can, and more brilliantly and imaginatively than we think possible. \u201cDrawdown\u201d is the name for the point when emissions peak and then begin to go down on a year-to-year basis. But even if we achieve this aim, most people think that there would be at least a 20-year lag time before temperatures start to measurably go down.</p> <p>There\u2019s always the danger that if we take too long, warming will have increased to the point where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/08/when-the-ice-melts-the-catastrophe-of-vanishing-glaciers\" title=\"\">melting ice emits methane</a>, creating yet more temperature rises.

      "bodyText": "How long until the climate crisis causes irreversible damage? Ewoenam Tetteh and Faith Otasowie, both 15, Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex You are obviously both smart and thoughtful kids, so I will be blunt and tell you that climate change is already causing big changes in our world. You can see this in the melting of the ice sheets in the Arctic and Antarctica, in the rising temperatures in cities around the world, in the changes in how much rain we get, and, perhaps most importantly, in the extinction of many plants and animals that are not able to adapt. One of the most important ideas to grasp about climate change is that it is not a future event: it is happening now, in real time, and those changes will only accelerate in the coming years and decades unless we radically reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we release into the atmosphere (mostly from burning fossil fuels). That\u2019s why we must take action now. Are the changes we are seeing irreversible? That depends on how you think about it. For example, scientists know that ice sheets have come and gone many times in our planet\u2019s history, driven mostly by slight wobbles in the Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of sunlight hitting the planet (other factors, such as the eruption of volcanoes, have also played a role). So the ice sheets we are losing today will, in all likelihood, grow back some time in the distant future. But we\u2019re talking millions of years. On the other hand, when a particular kind of frog becomes extinct because it cannot adapt to our rapidly warming world, it is lost for ever. We humans are pretty smart and capable creatures, so I don\u2019t worry that we\u2019ll figure out ways to adapt. And maybe we\u2019ll even figure out ways to make it a better world. But it will be a whole lot easier \u2013 for us and for every living thing on the planet \u2013 if we take action now to minimise those changes, both today and in the future. I really like the world we live in, and I\u2019m sure you do, too. It is a beautiful place. Let\u2019s fight to keep it that way. \u2022 Jeff Goodell, author of The Water Will Come: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, And The Remaking Of The Civilized World Which animal farts are the worst for the environment? Shark, cow, otter or something else? Sasha Dutta, eight, London Scientists have published a surprising amount of work relating to animal farts and our climate. It has been hypothesised that large dinosaurs (the sauropods) may have changed the Earth\u2019s climate with their farts. Sharks are rarely seen farting. But like sheep and goats, cows are a type of ruminant \u2013 that is, they have four stomachs. This means a lot of methane, one of the gases that causes the worst warming. One cow can produce up to 200kg of methane a year. Most of it is released as burps, but some certainly escapes out of the rear end, too! Because humans eat so much beef and milk, there are an awful lot of cows in the world, and their burping and farting causes a sizable contribution to our greenhouse gas emissions, making up nearly a third of all emissions from agriculture, by some estimates. This certainly makes them a strong contender for the animal with the farts that do the most damage to the planet (even if their burps are worse). \u2022 Dani Rabaiotti, environmental scientist and co-author of True or Poo?, Quercus, \u00a38.99 Why don\u2019t many politicians address the climate crisis and give us ways to help? Georgia Robinson, 15, Poole, Dorset Well, the good news is that nearly all politicians in this country accept that climate change is happening and that it\u2019s caused by human activities; almost all political parties have now accepted that we face a climate emergency. This is an amazing change from just a few years ago, and it\u2019s happened because of people like the climate strikers. But declaring an emergency and being prepared to take the necessary steps to address it are not the same thing, and politicians \u2013 especially those in government \u2013 don\u2019t match their words with actions. For example, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, was championing the expansion of Heathrow airport at exactly the same time as apparently agreeing that there\u2019s a climate crisis \u2013 in spite of the fact that air travel is one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions. One of the problems is that most politicians won\u2019t accept that we need a very different economic model, one that recognises that continuous growth isn\u2019t possible on a planet with limited resources. We need to change our idea of what success looks like, so that instead of being obsessed by money, we measure human wellbeing and the health of our natural environment. There are also vested interests in maintaining the status quo. Too many powerful corporations benefit from the way things are now, and many give large donations to political parties, asking politicians to resist taking action. The good news is that ideas such as the Green New Deal are getting more support, as people recognise that investment in a green economy provides decent jobs and a better quality of life, as well as a more secure future. The role of young people in keeping up the pressure is vital \u2013 your generation is making a real difference. But we don\u2019t have much time. \u2022 Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, was elected as the UK\u2019s first Green MP in 2010 If someone doesn\u2019t believe in the climate crisis, what can I do to help them see it? Olivia Liddell, 14, Hemel Hempstead, Herts People who don\u2019t see climate change can be frustrating because the scientific facts are so clear. But, as you\u2019ve probably discovered, facts don\u2019t always help people see the reality. If anything, bombarding people with facts makes them more sceptical and argumentative. So, what else can you do? Here are three things. First, it\u2019s really important to acknowledge the other person\u2019s good nature, and to identify common ground and shared values \u2013 areas where you have agreement. Just because someone doesn\u2019t believe in climate change, it doesn\u2019t make them a bad person. You probably both care about things like family and other people. Affirming shared values reduces the feeling of being attacked; being argumentative rarely succeeds. Second, invite people to think about their legacy \u2013 how their grandchildren and future generations will react to their actions (or inactions). If they are willing to acknowledge even a small chance that climate change is real, don\u2019t they want to be on the right side of the argument? Finally, be really clear that climate change matters to you, that you are personally worried about it, and that you are asking them to help address it because you are scared. Friends, family and others are much more willing to help when they realise something is important to someone they love, even when they may disagree about the facts. How can we use technology to stop the climate crisis? Daisy Furmston and Chloe Nolan, both 14, Hemel Hempstead This is a great question. Think about your bathtub at home. Imagine the tub is the world\u2019s atmosphere, the water is carbon dioxide, and the tap is running. If we leave it on, eventually the tub will overflow and cause great damage to the house. The same is true of emissions. If we continue to emit CO2 at the current rate, we are going to see catastrophic consequences. So, how do we solve this problem? The first and most obvious thing is to turn down the tap \u2013 ie reduce our emissions. The good news is, there are a number of great minds working on technological solutions \u2013 from renewable energy to electric vehicles \u2013 to do just that. However, the bathtub is still full of too much water \u2013 the air is already full of CO2 at dangerous levels \u2013 and if we cannot turn the tap off completely, the tub is going to overflow. So, we are also going to need to pull the plug \u2013 and that means removing CO2 directly from the atmosphere. This may sound impossible, but it isn\u2019t. My company has developed a technology called direct air capture that removes CO2 using large fans to pull air through a filter that has a liquid capture chemical flowing over it. That chemical binds to the CO2, removing it from the air, and then we purify and compress it. After that, we can bury it permanently, injecting CO2 into rock formations deep underground. This means we create something called \u201cnegative emissions\u201d; by doing this, we will be able to bring our global emissions down to zero at a much faster rate. Eventually, these facilities will be key to reducing the level of CO2 in the air back to safe levels. \u2022 Steve Oldham, CEO of Carbon Engineering, a Canadian-based clean energy company Is it possible to completely reverse the effects of global warming? If it is, how long would it take? Dorian Kopij, 15, Rochester, Kent Good question. We always thought that the answer is that it would take many centuries, because climate science has generally assumed that levels of CO2 will remain in the atmosphere for a very long time: that global heating is essentially locked in. We are now seeing a real awakening, by scientists, organisations and activists about how to draw carbon down from the atmosphere. We can do this by using both natural techniques, such as planting more trees, and newer technologies that can filter CO2 from the air. So then the question is: can we reduce greenhouse gas emissions to very small and manageable levels, and remove significant amounts of carbon in time to avoid runaway climate change, which could occur within 10-12 years? Whatever the answer to that is, we must do everything we possibly can sooner than we think we can, and more brilliantly and imaginatively than we think possible. \u201cDrawdown\u201d is the name for the point when emissions peak and then begin to go down on a year-to-year basis. But even if we achieve this aim, most people think that there would be at least a 20-year lag time before temperatures start to measurably go down. There\u2019s always the danger that if we take too long, warming will have increased to the point where melting ice emits methane, creating yet more temperature rises. The planet is then warming itself without humans doing anything to make it happen. In that case, all bets are off. \u2022 Paul Hawken is editor of Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed To Reverse Global Warming What can ordinary schoolchildren like me do to help?

      "body": "<p>Really good-quality, organic produce can be expensive, but when a vegetable is in season and abundant, naturally, its price drops. This brings higher-quality, seasonal produce, such as beetroot, say, to a similar price point as imported ones such as peppers. Which is why you may be lucky enough to come across a seasonal bargain at the market, such as a bag of super-juicy, ripe tomatoes.</p> <p>Imported, conventionally grown tomatoes are picked under-ripe and refrigerated, then ripened via a chemical process before going on sale. This process helps reduce waste, true \u2013 but it does take its toll on flavour.</p> <p>Seasonal tomatoes grown in the sun, in healthy soil and picked at the right time taste so much better and don\u2019t need any special treatment, because of the shorter food chain.</p> <p>So if you find cheap, ripe ones, snap them up and make this soup; you just won\u2019t get the same flavour with supermarket tomatoes.</p> <h2>Tomato and bread soup</h2> <p>About 45,000 tonnes of tomatoes are wasted in our homes every year, most of them perfectly ripe and delicious, which is a sin greater than many. It\u2019s common practice to deseed, blanch and peel tomatoes for soup, but I think that\u2019s an unnecessary waste of time, effort and money. Choose the ripest tomatoes you can find \u2013 they\u2019ll have the most flavour and should be cheaper, too (if they aren\u2019t, it\u2019s always worth a haggle).</p> <p><strong>1 good glug extra-virgin olive oil</strong>, plus extra for serving<br><strong>1 garlic clove</strong>, peeled and roughly chopped<br><strong>600g very ripe tomatoes</strong>, cut into large pieces, plus a few tomato vines (if available)<br><strong>80g stale bread crusts</strong>, torn into pieces<br><strong>2 sprigs basil</strong>, stalks finely cut, leaves left whole</p> <p>Put a glug of oil in a medium saucepan over a medium heat, add the chopped garlic and let it bubble for a few seconds. Stir in the tomatoes, and their vines, if you have them, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to a simmer and leave to cook slowly for 30 minutes. Add enough boiling water to create a soup-like consistency and remove and discard the vines.

      "bodyText": "Really good-quality, organic produce can be expensive, but when a vegetable is in season and abundant, naturally, its price drops. This brings higher-quality, seasonal produce, such as beetroot, say, to a similar price point as imported ones such as peppers. Which is why you may be lucky enough to come across a seasonal bargain at the market, such as a bag of super-juicy, ripe tomatoes. Imported, conventionally grown tomatoes are picked under-ripe and refrigerated, then ripened via a chemical process before going on sale. This process helps reduce waste, true \u2013 but it does take its toll on flavour. Seasonal tomatoes grown in the sun, in healthy soil and picked at the right time taste so much better and don\u2019t need any special treatment, because of the shorter food chain. So if you find cheap, ripe ones, snap them up and make this soup; you just won\u2019t get the same flavour with supermarket tomatoes. Tomato and bread soup About 45,000 tonnes of tomatoes are wasted in our homes every year, most of them perfectly ripe and delicious, which is a sin greater than many. It\u2019s common practice to deseed, blanch and peel tomatoes for soup, but I think that\u2019s an unnecessary waste of time, effort and money. Choose the ripest tomatoes you can find \u2013 they\u2019ll have the most flavour and should be cheaper, too (if they aren\u2019t, it\u2019s always worth a haggle). 1 good glug extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for serving 1 garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped 600g very ripe tomatoes, cut into large pieces, plus a few tomato vines (if available) 80g stale bread crusts, torn into pieces 2 sprigs basil, stalks finely cut, leaves left whole Put a glug of oil in a medium saucepan over a medium heat, add the chopped garlic and let it bubble for a few seconds. Stir in the tomatoes, and their vines, if you have them, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to a simmer and leave to cook slowly for 30 minutes. Add enough boiling water to create a soup-like consistency and remove and discard the vines. Add the bread, stir and season to taste \u2013 the soup will turn wondrously thick. To serve, stir in a good glug of extra-virgin olive oil, a few basil leaves and their chopped stalks, and reserve a few leaves to place on top.",

As drownings have increased in the treacherous river amid the Trump administration trying to block all undocumented people from crossing into the US, even to seek asylum, Piedras Negras has had to bury unidentifiable bodies after they were hauled out of the water by first responders. It is another stark reminder that while images earlier this week of a father and his toddler daughter \u2013 \u00d3scar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez and Valeria \u2013 who had drowned further east, shocked the world, they are far from the only victims of the chaos and desperation Trump has precipitated at the border with his hardline policies.

Obviously there is nobody to charge for their services. The city of Piedras Negras pays the costs of burying the unknowns in the cemetery,\u201d \u00c1vila Mart\u00ednez said. Drowned bodies are often in an advanced state of decomposition when they get to the graveyard and the diggers never open the coffins. When the original words on the wooden crosses fade, cemetery workers paint the tip of the cross black so they can identify that the grave has an unidentified body, in case they ever need to be disinterred. On the horizontal piece of wood, they paint on the Spanish word desconocido Some of the crosses in the cemetery had keeled over with time and lay on the ground, grass starting to cover them. The cemetery is filling up and its graves date to the early 20th century. But the authorities squeeze the unidentified bodies in, digging graves, wherever they can. Although there is little room left there is also little doubt that there will be more pauper\u2019s graves that need to be dug in the months to come.",

But luckily for him \u2013 perhaps because of him? \u2013 the crowd was indeed firmly \u201cunderneath the hot sun\u201d for his set. As the Guardian\u2019s Laura Snapes said: \u201cIn this miserable day and age, only a churl would resist Ezra\u2019s sunbeam blast of charisma.\u201d Bastille played a blinder, leaning into their set like headliners and making one of the clearest political statements of the day: singer Dan Smith draping himself in an EU flag. And there\u2019s still two more days to go! Follow all the action live on the Guardian when the bands get back on stage around lunchtime.",

      "bodyText": "The Victorian government is setting up a new road safety office amid a spiralling number of fatalities this year but there are doubts about whether lawmakers have the political courage to cut speed limits. The state\u2019s road fatality tally stands at 153 this year, compared with 100 at this time last year. It had a record low number of road deaths in 2018. In August, officials from VicRoads and the Department of Transport will merge under the new Road Safety Victoria office. VicRoads chief executive Robyn Seymour will head the new body. The state\u2019s road safety minister, Jaala Pulford, said Victoria had a proud history of being a world leader in road safety. \u201cMs Seymour began her career counselling those affected by road trauma, so she knows firsthand the devastating impact it has and why we need to do everything we can to make our roads safer,\u201d she said. The problem of road deaths on country roads is likely to be a big focus of the new organisation. Figures from the Transport Accident Commission show there have been 93 deaths on rural Victorian roads this year, compared with 52 at this time last year. Centre for Accident Research and Safety expert Narelle Haworth said rural roads should ideally have 80km/h speed limits unless they were built with specific safety features to merit a higher limit. \u201cRealistically there isn\u2019t enough money to upgrade them to a good level quickly. If your road infrastructure isn\u2019t good, you\u2019ve got to bring down the speed limit,\u201d she said. The chance of dying on a rural road in Australia was three times more than on urban roads, and law enforcement was more difficult because of low volumes and resources, she said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t look at [100km/h] as the default. 100 should only be if the road is good enough,\u201d Haworth said. She said high speed limits were safe only if the roads had centre and side barriers, a good surface and alignment. \u201cBut if you have got roads with one lane in each direction, with nothing to prevent a head-on crash, nothing to prevent running into a tree \u2026 100km/h is way beyond what a vehicle can protect us in a crash.\u201d Haworth acknowledged that cutting speed limits would upset rural residents and could prove unpopular, but said drivers were failing to understand the extent to which speed increased safety risks. \u201cImproving the roads costs money, bringing speed limits down costs votes, and that is fundamentally why it isn\u2019t being done,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe the first step is perhaps bringing the limits down on roads that aren\u2019t sealed. That one\u2019s probably less politically problematic.\u201d The Victorian government launched a campaign to highlight the dangers of drivers being distracted by mobile phone use, after a summit in May. Haworth said that while driver education measures were important, there was a limit to their effectiveness. \u201cRealistically whatever you\u2019re doing, whatever is going wrong that leads to a crash occurring, the slower you are travelling at the time \u2013 the less hurt you\u2019re going to be,\u201d she said.",

John Beatty, my friend of 40 years, with whom I\u2019ve shared adventures from Welsh cliffs and wintry Derbyshire moors to Canada\u2019s high Arctic, eased his 31-foot Pacific sailboat out of its berth. It was 30 years since we\u2019d been on this water together.</p> <p>On a falling tide we puttered between buoys, heading for auk colonies on the south coast of the <a href=\"https://www.visitsnowdonia.info/llyn-peninsula\">Ll\u0177n</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.visitsnowdonia.info/llyn-peninsula\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.visitsnowdonia.info/llyn-peninsula\">peninsula</a>.

      "bodyText": "At lunch time, Mia* and her friends talk to each other. The year 11 student at the Newtown High School of Performing Arts uses her phone mostly to message friends. She has a tracker on her device to monitor her time on social media, which she limits to 30 minutes a day. Sometimes in class, she will use her phone to take a picture of notes or instructions on the board. But during lunch at school, she chats with her friends. \u201cNo one\u2019s really on their phones,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ll see people on their phones at lunch, but usually in a group of people, they\u2019re talking to each other.\u201d Her father, Peter*, describes Mia\u2019s phone use as \u201cquite frequent\u201d. But he is sanguine about its impact on her generally. \u201cThey do interact a lot through the phone, but I don\u2019t see it as taking away from other interactions,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think her social skills suffer from using phones or social media. It\u2019s just a tool, and not necessarily a worse tool than other ways of communicating.\u201d Peter\u2019s confidence, however, is not widely shared. Following this week\u2019s announcement of a ban on mobile phones in Victorian state schools, effective 2020, the federal education minister, Dan Tehan, met his state counterparts in Melbourne on Friday to push for a nationwide block. A study by Monash University has found that 80% of Australians support a ban. \u201cWhen I talk to parents and teachers, the overwhelming majority want action on banning mobile phones in the classroom,\u201d the minister said in a statement. \u201cThey see mobile phones as a distraction from learning and are also worried about cyberbullying and other inappropriate uses.\u201d The picture painted by Tehan is one echoed by educators around the country. The Australian Education Union\u2019s Victorian branch, which provided tentative support for the state ban, describes smartphones as a facilitator of cyberbullying and a \u201cmajor distraction\u201d, affecting academic performance. The Australian Secondary Principals Association (ASPA) president, Andrew Pierpoint, says principals constantly report that students are sitting in playgrounds busy on their phones and not speaking to one another. Newington College, a private boys school in Sydney\u2019s inner west, banned phones last year. Its headmaster, Michael Parker, says he has had frequent conversations with teachers in previous schools who were concerned about the ubiquity of smartphones and the impossibility of monitoring their use. After instituting the ban at Newington, he says, staff noticed an immediate increase in students\u2019 engagement with each other. A decade ago, says Parker, the noise around smartphones was very positive. But things have changed following more research into the dopamine surges released by social media activity, and greater understanding about the development of adolescent brains. Parker says it is important that teenagers spend their formative years engaging in discussion, kicking a ball around, free from the constraints and distraction of phones and social media. He acknowledges that the problem of smartphone misuse is not limited to young people, but says adults have a duty of care to limit their potential misuse. Pasi Sahlberg, a professor of education policy at Sydney\u2019s University of New South Wales, has attributed the decline in academic performance of students globally to rise in smartphone usage. While there is no research yet to substantiate that claim, he says there is a wealth of evidence to show that smartphones have a significant negative impact on wellbeing. Adults \u2018suffer the same disease\u2019 However, he is not in favour of a blanket ban. \u201cWe have a broader problem in society,\u201d he says. \u201cWe adults are patronising kids when we suffer the same disease \u2026 It\u2019s almost like an alcoholic saying: \u2018Everyone else has to stop drinking, but not me\u2019.\u201d This hypocrisy doesn\u2019t wash with students, he says. He wants a more collaborative approach in setting the parameters on phone use in schools. \u201cI trust young people much more than adults on this issue,\u201d he says. Neil Selwyn, an education professor at Monash University, says that while bans are in place in France and Ontario, Canada, there is no way of knowing at this stage whether a state or country-wide ban will have any impact on cyberbullying, academic performance or students\u2019 wellbeing. A study from mental health non-profit organisation Headspace found this week that 53% of teenagers had experienced some form of cyberbullying. \u201cThere are lots of concerns about cyberbullying, about students not paying attention. These are genuine problems. But phones are a kind of easy fix. It\u2019s much easier to ban devices rather than tackle the root causes of a behaviour like bullying,\u201d Selwyn says. \u201cClearly, taking a device out of the classroom is not going to stop cyberbullying, because most cyberbullying takes place outside school hours and off school premises anyway.

Morgan afterward called her \u201cthe heart of the team.\u201d</p> <p>France by comparison looked tense and stern coming into Friday\u2019s clash.

Morgan afterward called her \u201cthe heart of the team.\u201d France by comparison looked tense and stern coming into Friday\u2019s clash. Later, as the game drifted away from them, they looked flustered and desperate. In the 78th minute, Henry fired a slow, skipping shot that USA goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher did well to smother, and the French captain winced. What makes Henry so exceptional as a captain is her intensity and physicality. She can do it all \u2013 score from distance, spray passes around the field or break up play with crunching tackles. But she and her teammates could never quite throw a poised US team off their game. Even though France eventually pulled a goal back, it never felt as if France were about to stage a complete comeback. \u201cWe have had quarter-final defeats haunting us for a while,\u201d French coach Corrine Diacre said afterward. For the hosts, who now have failed to qualify for the 2020 Olympics because of the Friday\u2019s loss, the narrative continues. The pressure, the moment was too big for them. \u201cWe had never seen a full stadium,\u201d Henry admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s a path for the women\u2019s sport and we have to continue to work.\u201d For the US and Rapinoe though, it\u2019s on to the semi-final round, and they too are aware of the stage they are on. \u201cEveryone understands the gravity of the moment,\u201d Rapinoe said. On Tuesday, we will see which one of England and the US handle that gravity best.",

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women represent 2% of Australia\u2019s female population but make up 34% of all women in prison, June Oscar told the Human Rights Council on Friday. \u201cThe root cause is that Indigenous women continue to experience disproportionate levels of trauma and intersecting forms of discrimination which cut across lines of race, gender and socioeconomic status,\u201d Oscar said. \u201cThere is a direct connection between the fact that 80% of Indigenous women in prison are mothers and the rapidly increasing rates of the removal of Indigenous children from families into out-of-home care,\u201d she said. Oscar called on the government to fully implement the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission report Pathways to Justice. The report was commissioned in 2016 by the former attorney general George Brandis, who said the prison rates for Aboriginal people were a \u201cnational tragedy\u201d. But the government has made no formal response to the report, which was tabled in parliament almost 18 months ago, despite consistent calls for action. A coalition of more than 35 human rights, justice and community organisations wrote to the government in September last year. \u201cWe cannot let another generation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people lose their futures, their dignity and \u2013 for some \u2013 their lives because of inaction by Australian governments,\u201d said the letter signed by Amnesty, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Law Council of Australia, Unicef, national Aboriginal legal and social services, legal academics and others. The ALRC report recommended a national justice reinvestment body, support for justice reinvestment trials around the country, and national criminal justice targets. Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt said he is aware this report has been sitting with the government \u201cfor some time\u201d and will be giving it his consideration. \u201cI am also acutely aware of the increasing imprisonment rate of Indigenous women and the need for all governments to do more to address the issues that are driving this,\u201d the minister told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe need to ensure these strategies are community driven and reflect the needs and lived experiences of Indigenous women, their families and communities,\u201d he said. Speaking in Geneva, June Oscar said: \u201cWe must invest in prevention through provision of wrap-around supports to our families, and we must ensure that real alternatives to incarceration become viable options.\u201d Earlier this week, Oscar launched an exhibition of photographs, Hear Us, See Us, of the many women she has spoken to for the Wiyi Yani U Thangani (Women\u2019s Voices, in Oscar\u2019s Bunuba language) project. The project is the first time in more than 30 years that a formal inquiry into the status of Indigenous women has been held.

First soloist Margarita Shrayner is lovely in this role, projecting a pliant openness and yearning in divine pas de deux (not surprisingly, she and Tsvirko are a real-life couple). The planes and shapes of the lifts are artistically beautiful with a technical wow-factor \u2013 especially the famous single-arm overhead press.</p> <p>Played by principals Alexander Volchkov and Olga Smirnova, Roman leader Crassus and his courtesan Aegina are a diabolical double.

Staged as the inside of a jewellery box, the patterns of the corps de ballet represent the shapes of its contents \u2013 and for those new to ballet, or preferring abstract dance, the performance should provide a striking overview of the artform.</p> <p>Emeralds is famous for evoking the essence of French romantic ballet, delicate and demure in Degas greens echoing Faure\u2019s dreamy concert suites. In Rubies, the dancers represent the notes and rhythms of Stravinsky\u2019s jazz-age<em> </em>Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra; it\u2019s an expression of New York razzamatazz: sassy, showy, playful and lightning-fast. With a symphonic Tchaikovsky score, Diamonds pays homage to imperial Russian heritage with regal elegance and dazzling purity and precision, culminating in a stunning display of unison by its 34 dancers.</p> <p>Whatever you take away from the works themselves, the calibre of the artists in conjunction with the collective weight of the company\u2019s illustrious history are what make the Bolshoi worth seeing. It\u2019s a synergetic experience, bigger (yet again) than the mere instruments allowing them to shine.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Bolshoi Ballet is at the Lyric Theatre, Queensland Performing Arts Centre, Brisbane, until 7 July; the season includes a free Queensland regional simulcast of Spartacus on 6 July</em></p>",

First soloist Margarita Shrayner is lovely in this role, projecting a pliant openness and yearning in divine pas de deux (not surprisingly, she and Tsvirko are a real-life couple). The planes and shapes of the lifts are artistically beautiful with a technical wow-factor \u2013 especially the famous single-arm overhead press. Played by principals Alexander Volchkov and Olga Smirnova, Roman leader Crassus and his courtesan Aegina are a diabolical double. It is the even more scheming Aegina who emerges as Spartacus\u2019 dramatic match, in a mesmerising performance by Smirnova. Her nuanced interpretation is as exquisite as her perfect ballerina physique, her imperious bearing, flickering facial expressions and utter physical command oozing ruthless calculated sensuality. Jewels, which opens on Saturday, was inspired by the gemstones glittering from the windows of New York designers Van Cleef and Arpels, and represents them in three distinct acts: Emeralds, Rubies and Diamonds. Staged as the inside of a jewellery box, the patterns of the corps de ballet represent the shapes of its contents \u2013 and for those new to ballet, or preferring abstract dance, the performance should provide a striking overview of the artform. Emeralds is famous for evoking the essence of French romantic ballet, delicate and demure in Degas greens echoing Faure\u2019s dreamy concert suites. In Rubies, the dancers represent the notes and rhythms of Stravinsky\u2019s jazz-age Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra; it\u2019s an expression of New York razzamatazz: sassy, showy, playful and lightning-fast. With a symphonic Tchaikovsky score, Diamonds pays homage to imperial Russian heritage with regal elegance and dazzling purity and precision, culminating in a stunning display of unison by its 34 dancers. Whatever you take away from the works themselves, the calibre of the artists in conjunction with the collective weight of the company\u2019s illustrious history are what make the Bolshoi worth seeing. It\u2019s a synergetic experience, bigger (yet again) than the mere instruments allowing them to shine. \u2022 The Bolshoi Ballet is at the Lyric Theatre, Queensland Performing Arts Centre, Brisbane, until 7 July; the season includes a free Queensland regional simulcast of Spartacus on 6 July",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining us for another day of US politics. Here\u2019s a rundown of the day\u2019s biggest stories: Donald Trump tweeted an unexpected invitation to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, asking him to meet for a handshake in the demilitarized zone dividing the Korean peninsula. A major LGBTQ political group gave Pete Buttigieg his first major endorsement. Massachusetts representative Joe Kennedy declared his support for impeaching Trump, bringing the number of House Democrats who back impeachment to 81, according to the Hill. Elizabeth Warren pledged not to give diplomatic posts to wealthy donors if she becomes president. \u201cTrump has perfected the act of selling swanky diplomatic posts to rich buffoons,\u201d Warren wrote. The acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary, Kevin McAleenan, said border crossings are on track to drop 25% from May to June, at a press conference this afternoon. This drop was expected because border crossings usually drop in the warmer summer months. Joe Biden addressed his exchange at the debate with Kamala Harris about his past comments about segregationist senators. \u201c30 seconds to 60 seconds on a campaign debate exchange can\u2019t do justice to a lifetime committed to civil rights,\u201d Biden said. Trump\u2019s latest attempt at Twitter diplomacy with Kim was issued just about three hours after the White House released a much more formal statement regarding his visit to South Korea. In that statement, the White House stressed that the visit to the Republic of Korea (ROK) was designed to \u201creaffirm a vital partnership that is essential to our economic and security interests\u201d and discussed the negotiations with North Korea. President Trump is working closely with President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea to achieve the final and fully verified denuclearization of North Korea and to establish a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula ... The United States and ROK coordination and cooperation regarding the denuclearization of North Korea is the strongest it has ever been ... Both President Trump and President Moon have repeatedly called on Chairman Kim to follow through on his commitment to completely denuclearize. The statement makes no mention of an attempt to hold a meeting in the DMZ during Trump\u2019s visit. President Trump just proposed a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that divides the Korean peninsula between north and south. Trump will be in South Korea meeting with that country\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in. The bizarre missive suggests that Trump is leaving the planning of such a high stakes meeting to the whims of chance, and that the only agenda would be to shake hands and say \u201cHello(?)!\u201d Trump and Kim have met twice, first in Singapore last June and again in Hanoi in February. Neither summit has produced any agreement about North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program. A federal judge has ordered the US government into mediation over concerns about the treatment of children being held in border patrol facilities, Reuters reports. The judge\u2019s order follows a request by lawyers representing detained children for an emergency order to send doctors and health experts into the facilities. The treatment of migrant children held in detention is governed by a decades-old agreement known as the Flores agreement. The parties will have to report back to the judge by 12 July on the status of conditions in the detention facilities. Another report out today, by Bloomberg, states that children and their mothers are complaining of hunger in one federal detention center center in Texas. Bloomberg reviewed procurement data for the facility and found that the menu was unhealthy, lacking nutritional value and fresh ingredients. Rafael Perez-Escamilla, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health, called the menu \u201cappalling\u201d. Toby Elizabeth Gialluca, a lawyer with the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, visited the facility in early June and said mothers alleged they were mostly provided with formula and potato chips to feed their toddlers. Other staples include cereal bars, ramen noodles, bologna sandwiches and microwaveable burritos. Margo Wootan, vice president for nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, called the menu \u201ca monotonous, unhealthy and disrespectful diet\u201d. Victory Fund, the largest LGBTQ political action committee in the US, just endorsed Pete Buttigieg for president. The announcement comes on the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riot that galvanized the fight for civil rights for LGBTQ people in the US. The group\u2019s core mission is to increase the representation of LGBTQ people in American politics by supporting the campaigns of openly LGBTQ candidates. This is the first time the group has endorsed a presidential candidate. \u201cEvery day that Pete is in the race, from the standpoint of an LGBT activist, he transforms American politics,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Annise Parker, told the Daily Beast. \u201cAs long as he is on that debate stage, LGBTQ issues can never be put on the backburner.\u201d Hello everyone, this is Julia Carrie Wong in San Francisco taking over the live blog to see you through to the weekend. It\u2019s not exactly your standard political live blog fare, but since everything is political now (nb the discount furniture site whose employees walked out over sales to immigrant detention centers), it\u2019s probably worth mentioning that the US women\u2019s national team just dispatched France 2-1. The victory comes thanks to two goals by star midfielder Megan Rapinoe, whose outspoken politics and promise not to go to the \u201cfucking White House\u201d have drawn the ire of Trump. Another House Democrat, Massachusetts representative Joe Kennedy, is backing impeachment. That brings the amount of House Democrats who back impeachment to 81, according to the Hill. Elizabeth Warren has pledged that if she were to become president, she would not follow the traditional practice of giving diplomatic posts to wealthy donors. \u201cTrump has perfected the act of selling swanky diplomatic posts to rich buffoons,\u201d Warren wrote. The acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary, Kevin McAleenan, said border crossings are on track to drop 25% from May to June, at a press conference this afternoon. This drop was expected because border crossings usually drop in the warmer summer months. Joe Biden just spoke at an event in Chicago, addressing his exchange at the debate with Kamala Harris about his past comments about segregationist senators. \u201c30 seconds to 60 seconds on a campaign debate exchange can\u2019t do justice to a lifetime committed to civil rights,\u201d Biden said. In a 50 to 40 vote, the Senate voted in favor of an amendment to a Defense bill that would require congressional support before Trump acts. The vote was still short of the 60 needed for passage. But with four Republicans backing the amendment, members of Congress said it reflected skepticism about Trump\u2019s possible intervention in the Middle East. At the moment, Trump is only beholden to war authorizations Congress approved in the aftermath of September 11th. The House is expected to take up the issue next month. \u201cA congressional vote is a pretty good signal of what our constituents are telling us that another war in the Middle East would be a disaster right now, we don\u2019t want the president to just do it on a whim,\u201d said senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, who co-authored the measure with Tom Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico. Kaine continued: \u201cMy gut tells me that the White House is realizing this is deeply unpopular with the American public.\u201d Even though the measure failed to reach the 60 votes needed, the House will likely try to attach its own limits on military action in Iran with its Defense bill next month. Of the ten candidates on stage last night, entrepreneur Andrew Yang clocked the least amount of speaking time at two minutes and 56 seconds. \u201cI really would have loved more questions and more air time, but I\u2019ve got three more bites at the apple,\u201d Yang said after the debate. \u201cThe American people just found out a little more about me tonight.\u201d He did manage to advocate for a plan that would give $1,000 per month to all citizens over 18, but because of the stunted debate format, he didn\u2019t have time to explain it. Yang told the Miami Herald that the stipend would cost the government about $3.2 trillion per year, would be paid for by consolidating some welfare programs and implementing a value-added tax of 10%. \u201cWhile it seems like a lot of money, it\u2019s actually more affordable than you\u2019d think,\u201d he said. Yang also claimed his microphone was \u201cnot on\u201d a few times when he attempted to speak, but the debate host, NBC, denied that assertion. \u201cAt no point during the debate was any candidate\u2019s microphone turned off or muted,\u201d an NBC spokesperson said in a statement to reporters. It\u2019s Sarah Huckabee Sanders last day as White House press secretary, which means it\u2019s a good time to read this piece by our Washington bureau chief, David Smith, about how the role of press secretary diminished under Trump. During Sanders\u2019 tenure, the once daily ritual of the press briefing \u2013 must-watch television in the chaotic era of Sean Spicer \u2013 was essentially supplanted by the president holding court with reporters in the Oval Office, the cabinet room and, above all, on the White House South Lawn, competing with the roar of his Marine One helicopter. The more he talked, the more pointless Sanders\u2019 briefings became, since she merely parroted his tweets, evaded serious policy questions and channeled her boss\u2019s anti-media barbs. It was perhaps inevitable that the briefings would get shorter and finally wither away, symbolised by a recent photo that showed dust literally gathering on the lectern. This morning, 2020 Democratic candidates visited the Homestead children\u2019s detention shelter in Florida. Juli\u00e1n Castro, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, John Hickenlooper, Kirsten Gillibrand and Marianne Williamson were denied entry to the facility, but made remarks while standing outside. Juli\u00e1n Castro, speaking in Spanish and English, said: \u201cHe should have immediately reached out to Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, to partner with them so more people could find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to come to the United States. Instead of that, he has wasted two and a half years.\u201d Joe Biden just spoke at an event in Chicago, addressing his exchange at the debate with Kamala Harris about his past comments about segregationist senators. \u201c30 seconds to 60 seconds on a campaign debate exchange can\u2019t do justice to a lifetime committed to civil rights,\u201d Biden said. At the debate Thursday night, in response to a question about race and policing, Harris interjected and said that she had a right to respond as the only black candidate on stage. She directed her comments to Biden, denouncing his record on race. \u201cI do not believe you are a racist,\u201d Harris said, looking directly at the former vice-president. \u201cBut,\u201d she continued, \u201cit is personal. And it was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.\u201d Speaking at a labor luncheon on Friday, Biden said: \u201cFolks, the discussion in this race today shouldn\u2019t be about the past. We should be talking about how we can do better, how we can move forward, how we can give every child in America an opportunity for success stories.\u201d Another House Democrat, Massachusetts representative Joe Kennedy, is backing impeachment. \u201cThis is not a decision I made lightly, nor is it one to celebrate,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dark day for our country when its Commander-in-Chief is accussed of high crimes. But after reading the Mueller report in full, reviewing the facts and consulting with legal experts, I believe Congress has a responsibility to act decisively.\u201d That brings the amount of House Democrats who back impeachment to 81, according to the Hill. The Guardian\u2019s Emily Holden, an environment reporter, said the Democratic debate last night demonstrated just how far the the US is from contemplating the climate crisis as a threat that will touch almost all areas of American life and policymaking: The discussion largely pigeonholed the climate crisis as a single issue and an environmental problem. And the crisis was not what most candidates \u2013 including ones with better climate credentials \u2013 listed as their top priority. Asked what first issue they would pursue from the White House, only Hickenlooper and the Colorado senator Michael Bennet, neither of whom have been polling strongly, responded with climate change. Sanders, who is considered a heavyweight in the field, refused to pick one or two issues. \u201cWe need a political revolution,\u201d he said. The acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary, Kevin McAleenan, said border crossings are on track to drop 25% from May to June, at a press conference this afternoon. This drop was expected, border crossings usually drop in the warmer summer months. Watch for Donald Trump and DHS attempting to connect this to their policies. When a reporter asked if the drop was related to seasonal changes, McAleenan said the change was not just seasonal. If you would like to watch the full 21 minute press conference, it\u2019s here. Here\u2019s a look at what was an unfortunately fairly routine morning in US politics, circa 2019. Former US president Jimmy Carter ignored the unwritten rule for former presidents of not attacking the current president by saying he didn\u2019t think Donald Trump was a legitimate president. \u201cHe lost the election and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf,\u201d Carter said. The acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), an agency that deals with the administrative aspects of immigration, has blamed a migrant father for the drowning deaths captured in a widely circulated photo. The acting USCIS head, Ken Cuccinelli, is not popular with Republicans, Democrats or USCIS employees and will face a difficult confirmation process. One thing missing from the Democratic debates? Puerto Rico. It was mentioned exactly once in the four cumulative hours of debating. Donald Trump joked with Russian president Vladimir Putin about both getting rid of journalists and Russian meddling in US elections. Also: Elizabeth Warren has challenged her fellow Democrats running for president to commit to not giving ambassador posts to political donors, a common practice. She said diplomatic posts must not be sold to \u201crich buffoons.\u201d Her campaign posted a proposal of this and other changes to the State department on Medium on Friday, including doubling the size of the foreign service by growing programs to train people for jobs in that field and improving diversity in the pool of people going for those jobs. \u201cThe Pentagon is nearly 40 times bigger than the State department \u2014 we employ more people to work in military grocery stores than we do foreign service officers,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThat has real consequences.\u201d It\u2019s not super flashy, though Warren\u2019s argument for making diplomatic positions more professional is a direct hit at Trump. Trump has perfected the act of selling swanky diplomatic posts to rich buffoons... His South Africa nominee is a handbag designer. In all, Donald Trump has appointed political cronies to nearly half the available ambassadorial positions \u2014 far more than any president in recent memory. As a result, opportunities for career professionals are severely limited. The practice of auctioning off American diplomacy to the highest bidder must end. At the event where former president Jimmy Carter questioned the legitimacy of Donald Trump\u2019s election, Walter Mondale, who served as vice president under Carter, also criticized Trump, saying \u201che\u2019s got something deep in him that is detestable.\u201d It is unusual - very unusual - for a former president to criticize a sitting president. Carter has even praised some of Trump\u2019s decisions before and in April they spoke by phone. Carter is the oldest living president at 94. We might not hear Trump\u2019s reaction until tomorrow because he\u2019s at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, where it is 1:30am. In two, two-hour debates featuring 20 presidential hopefuls, Puerto Rico was mentioned exactly once. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, mentioned Puerto Rico in response to a question about the climate crisis. Hurricane Maria devastated the island, a US territory, in September and October 2017. The US response to the hurricane was severely criticized as Puerto Ricans faced weeks without electricity and were stranded without access to food, water or medical care. The official death toll is 2,975 people, a number Donald Trump has repeatedly denied. He also continues to complain about providing aid to Puerto Rico while simultaneously lying about how much money the island has received from the US. The New York Times Miami bureau chief, Patricia Mazzei, on last night\u2019s debate: Jared Rizzi, a political podcaster, said: It would be an egregious error not to spotlight the debate performance of author and lifestyle guru, Marianne Williamson, who very fortunately/unfortunately will probably never be in a position to debate Donald Trump. He\u2019s talking about Trump (for reference: battery, windmill, cereal). Former US president Jimmy Carter said Trump is an \u201cillegitimate president\u201d at a conference for his Carter Center. Carter said a full investigation \u201cwould show that Trump didn\u2019t actually win the election in 2016,\u201d in comments first reported by USA Today Washington bureau chief, Susan Page. \u201cHe lost the election and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf,\u201d Carter continued. The event moderator, Jon Meacham, asked if that meant Carter thought that Trump was an illegitimate president. \u201cBased on what I said, which I can\u2019t retract,\u201d Carter said. Ahead of its summer break, the US supreme court has announced what it plans to consider in its next term, according to Reuters: It will hear an appeal concerning the criminal convictions of two former associates of former New Jersey governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal that hindered his 2016 presidential candidacy. The associates were convicted in 2016 of fraud and civil rights violations for realigning the lanes to the George Washington Bridge without telling local officials. It won\u2019t revive Alabama\u2019s ban on the most commonly used procedure in second-trimester abortions. Courts have blocked similar laws in Kansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas. It will will consider reviving a Montana program that gives tax credits to people who donate to private-school scholarships. The state\u2019s highest court had struck down the program because it violated the Montana constitution\u2019s ban on state aid to religious organizations. It agreed to hear a case about billions of dollars awarded by a court to victims of the 1998 bombing of the US embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. More than 200 people died in the attacks and more than 1,000 were injured. 2020 hopeful Elizabeth Warren and George Conway, husband of Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway, are among the first to criticize Donald Trump for joking with Russian president Vladimir Putin about both getting rid of journalists and Russian meddling in US elections. Twenty-six journalists have been murdered in Russia since Putin first became president, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). And it is a year to the day since five Capital Gazette employees were killed in their newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland. In June, the appointment of Ken Cuccinelli, the Trump immigration official who has blamed a migrant father for the drowning death of him and his child, was immediately challenged by senior House committee leaders in a letter to the acting Homeland security secretary concerned about Cuccinelli\u2019s appointment in June. The House leaders said they had \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the appointment, which they said circumvents rules about federal vacancies. Immigration groups immediately raised concerns about Cuccinelli\u2019s appointment because of his history of homophobic remarks and claim that \u201cwar powers\u201d could be used against immigrants. He also has ties to the anti-Muslim campaigner, Brigitte Gabriel. Earlier this month, Cuccinelli appeared to push USCIS staffers to lower how many people are approved in the first stage of the asylum process, a credible fear interview, according to a leaked letter published by Buzzfeed. The supreme court just announced it will review the constitutionality of an Obama-era program that allows undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children get temporary deportation relief and work permits. Trump ended the program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), but the decision was challenged in several lawsuits. The program protected about 700,000 people known as \u201cDreamers.\u201d The Washington Post reports: The judges who have blocked ending the program have said the administration could remedy the legal impasse by providing a detailed reasoning of why the program should be abolished. Instead, it has continued to combat the orders in court. The fight over the young people protected by the program \u2014 the average age is around 24 \u2014 has been a fierce battle between Trump and Democrats, who largely defend the initiative. Trump at times has said he would like to find a way to protect those in the program, but attempts to work out a political compromise over DACA have foundered amid the larger partisan debate over immigration and border security. The acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), an agency that deals with the administrative aspects of immigration, has blamed a migrant father for the drowning deaths captured in a widely circulated photo. USCIS acting director, Ken Cuccinelli, blamed \u00d3scar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez, 25, for the deaths of himself and his 23-month-old daughter, Valeria \u2013 as the Trump administration faces criticism for failing to respond to the influx of families approaching the border. The Trump administration has favored policies meant to deter people from traveling north, which advocates say has in turn driven people to make more dangerous border crossings such as crossing the Rio Grande. CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett asked Cuccinelli if the photo would become a symbol of the Trump administration\u2019s policies on the border? Cuccinelli said no, \u201cin fact the opposite.\u201d The reason we have tragedies like that on the border is because that father didn\u2019t wait to go through the asylum process in the legal fashion and decided to cross the river and not only died but his daughter died tragically as well. Until we fix the attractions in our asylum system, people like that father and that child are going to continue to come through a dangerous trip. Cuccinelli has not yet been confirmed as head of USCIS, an agency that under Trump has become less about processing documents and more about immigration enforcement. Some details about Cuccinelli, the former attorney general of Virginia: He has said \u201cwar powers\u201d could be used against immigrants. \u201cYou just point them back across the river and let them swim for it,\u201d he said in 2018. In a 2012 interview, he made comments that some saw as comparing rats to immigrants. He has backed ending birthright citizenship. He has backed denying unemployment benefits to non-English speakers. In 2009, Cuccinelli said homosexual acts are \u201cintrinisically wrong\u201d and that LGBTQ people \u201cdon\u2019t comport with natural law.\u201d The president of the union that represents about 13,000 USCIS employees, Danielle Spooner, said appointing Cuccinelli \u201cspells the end of legal immigration as we know it.\u201d *This post was updated at 12:03pm to reflect that Cuccinelli said homosexual acts are \u201cintrinsically wrong,\u201d not that he thinks homosexuality is \u201cintrinsically wrong.\u201d While Kamala Harris is being praised for her performance in the debate last night, she is under pressure to clarify a muddled response to a question on health insurance from last night\u2019s debate. In the debate, Harris seemed to support abolishing private insurance in favor of government-run health insurance. This morning, she says she misunderstood the question and thought it was about whether she would give up her own private insurance plan for a government-run plan under Medicare for All. She said she doesn\u2019t support eliminating private insurance. Political journalists aren\u2019t convinced this is her end-all answer on Medicare for All. Hello, happy Friday and welcome to our daily live politics coverage. The first round of Democratic debates concluded last night after a two-day, 20-candidate extravaganza. California senator Kamala Harris was last night\u2019s definitive winner and today she\u2019ll be looking to maintain that momentum while others fight for attention. The president has also weighed-in, from Osaka, Japan: In Florida today, several 2020 candidates plan to visit the Homestead child detention facility, including Pete Buttigieg, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, John Hickenlooper and Marianne Williamson. At the G20 summit, Trump just spoke to Russian president Vladimir Putin and made light of Russian election meddling. They also shared a laugh about \u201cgetting rid\u201d of journalists. More on that in a bit and rolling updates from the G20 by the Guardian\u2019s business team here. We\u2019ll have some analysis and reviews of last night\u2019s debate in the blog. If you\u2019re looking for a summary to start, do read Guardian political correspondent Lauren Gambino\u2019s excellent review:",
