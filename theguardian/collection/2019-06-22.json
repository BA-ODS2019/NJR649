      "bodyText": "Victoria\u2019s first taskforce on young Indigenous people in the criminal justice system has begun, with the commissioner for Aboriginal children touring the state to investigate community-based solutions that work at keeping young Aboriginal people out of contact with police and the criminal justice system. The Aboriginal youth justice taskforce, announced in 2018 by the premier, Daniel Andrews, will examine the cases of about 250 Aboriginal young people in the youth justice system. Sixteen per cent of children in the youth justice system are Indigenous, even though they make up only 0.7% of the state\u2019s population, and 1.6% of 10 to 19-year-olds. A 2017 Victorian government review found that over-representation is caused by intergenerational trauma, broken connection to country and community, over-policing, not enough focus on diversion and exclusion from mainstream culture. Parallel to the taskforce, the commissioner for Aboriginal children and young people, Justin Mohamed, is conducting the \u201cOur youth, our way\u201d inquiry. \u201cIt\u2019s broader than justice,\u201d Mohamed, a Gooreng Gooreng man originally from Bundaberg in Queensland, said. \u201cWe are looking at the things that make our young people resilient.\u201d Mohamed will have four months to hold 13 regional forums in Victoria, \u201cpulling together local service providers, police, courts, Aboriginal organisations \u2026 We\u2019ll present a picture of what that region looks like, in terms of the cycle of offending, and we\u2019ll start building a plan for that region, to have a focus on Aboriginal young people. \u201cOur team will [look at] the two bookends of this: how do we reduce young people coming into contact with the youth justice in the first place, and how do we stop the reoffending numbers?\u201d Around 65% of young people with a youth justice order are reoffenders, Mohamed said. \u201cThe idea is to get to the communities, because we know the answers lie within community and we want those communities to be heard,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need to hear the voices of those young people.\u201d The first hearings were held in Warrnambool and Framlingham last week. \u201cWarrnambool has one of lowest rates of young Aboriginal people offending,\u201d Mohamed said, citing cultural engagement of children from an early age as a protective factor against offending. \u201cCultural engagement is the stabiliser within a lot of the programs being run. It\u2019s the reason why the region\u2019s [offending] numbers are so low. The commissioner will travel to Ballarat next, with other regions to follow. \u201cWe\u2019ll be hearing from young people what they think is working, about a lot of services that are supposed to be there to protect our young people,\u201d Mohamed said. \u201cHow are young people valued and supported, what are the social norms of those communities, how is racism working? It may not just because young people in that region want to do bad things. \u201cWe want to create a safe space for them to have their views, and not something that makes their lives more difficult. Like most things around youth engagement, having young people as part of the planning process hasn\u2019t always been done in the best way.\u201d The report will be tabled in March 2020.",

However the goalkeeper kept her backline organised and stood up during the penalty shootout. The only blot on her copybook was to concede the goal from the corner. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Kristine Minde</strong></p> <p>The full-back was able to push high up the park, however as the game wore on became increasingly more exposed on the quick transition. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Maria Thorisdottir</strong></p> <p>Was strong in keeping the line, put in timely challenges and made interceptions while being pivotal to Norway keeping their defensive shape. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Moren Mjelde (Captain)</strong></p> <p>The centre-back did a massive job both commanding the defence and keeping Kerr at bay. Able to nip at the heels of Kerr all match, she forced the Australian forward to drop deep for any opportunity. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Ingrid Moe Wold</strong></p> <p>Really solid in one-on-one situations, whilst keeping the noise of Australia\u2019s attack on her flank to a minimum. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Gura Reiten</strong></p> <p>Was really busy and a huge part in Norway winning the ball in midfield. She was also able to move forward well while linking up play between the attack and defence. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Ingrid Engen</strong></p> <p>The midfielder used her body really well as always. She was essential in suffocating the space in front of her defence, while her quick simple passing kick started many of Norway\u2019s transitions. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Vilde Risa</strong></p> <p>Saw a lot of the ball and did some tidy work in finding the pockets of space to pass into. The Norwegian also produced a handful of stunning strikes from a distance. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Karina Saevik</strong></p> <p>Caused some absolute havoc down the right side in the first half and went on to produce an excellent assist for the opening goal. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Caroline Graham Hansen</strong></p> <p>The forward was absolutely magic with the ball at her feet and runs at defence. She stamped her authority on the match early, continued to dazzle and was jaw-droppingly good throughout. <strong>9</strong></p> <p><strong>Isabell Herlovsen</strong></p> <p>Her goal demonstrated incredible composure but, while she was patient and hardworking, she was often isolated upfront. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Subs</strong>: <strong>Frida</strong> <strong>Maanum 6 </strong>(for Saevik 72); <strong>Lisa-Marie</strong> <strong>Utland</strong> 7 (for Herlovsen); <strong>Synne Hansen 6</strong> (for Wolde 102)</p>",

Got caught napping while marking Herlovsen in the build up to Norway\u2019s goal. 6 Elise Kellond-Knight Important in defence but a game-changer in attack with a sickeningly sweet corner turned goal to bring the Matildas back into the contest. 7 Tameka Yallop Found some exciting pockets of spaces and combined well to create opportunities. Did need to show some more patience in the build up. 6 Emily van Egmond A solid game but not brilliant. She was able to produce some key passes but needed to do more to track the players Norway had in those spaces, particularly in defensive midfield positions. 6 Chloe Logarzo Did a lot of recovery work throughout the match. Pressed well and put in some challenges to win the ball, but failed to get in the areas further up the park Australia hoped to find her. 6 Hayley Raso Australia\u2019s key producer of opportunities for large spells. Was a real spark when able to pick up the ball and create something out of midfield and turn into attack. 7 Sam Kerr (captain) Handled being man-marked for the majority of the match smartly, dropping deep in moments to create space and opportunities for others. Created some opportunities in the area, but unable to find the necessary composure. 7 Caitlin Foord Was equally as important in tracking back as she was creating opportunities in attack. Some of her turns were magic in opening up play but just couldn\u2019t be clinical when it counted. 6 Subs: Emily Gielnik 6 (for Raso 74); Claire Polkinghorne 7 (for Kellond-Knight 94); Karly Roestbakken 5 (for Van Egmond 116); Amy Harrison 5 (for Carpenter 122) Norway Ingrid Hjelmseth Didn\u2019t have a busy day in terms of shots on target to deal with. However the goalkeeper kept her backline organised and stood up during the penalty shootout. The only blot on her copybook was to concede the goal from the corner. 7 Kristine Minde The full-back was able to push high up the park, however as the game wore on became increasingly more exposed on the quick transition. 5 Maria Thorisdottir Was strong in keeping the line, put in timely challenges and made interceptions while being pivotal to Norway keeping their defensive shape. 6 Moren Mjelde (Captain) The centre-back did a massive job both commanding the defence and keeping Kerr at bay. Able to nip at the heels of Kerr all match, she forced the Australian forward to drop deep for any opportunity. 8 Ingrid Moe Wold Really solid in one-on-one situations, whilst keeping the noise of Australia\u2019s attack on her flank to a minimum. 7 Gura Reiten Was really busy and a huge part in Norway winning the ball in midfield. She was also able to move forward well while linking up play between the attack and defence. 6 Ingrid Engen The midfielder used her body really well as always. She was essential in suffocating the space in front of her defence, while her quick simple passing kick started many of Norway\u2019s transitions. 6 Vilde Risa Saw a lot of the ball and did some tidy work in finding the pockets of space to pass into. The Norwegian also produced a handful of stunning strikes from a distance. 7 Karina Saevik Caused some absolute havoc down the right side in the first half and went on to produce an excellent assist for the opening goal. 7 Caroline Graham Hansen The forward was absolutely magic with the ball at her feet and runs at defence. She stamped her authority on the match early, continued to dazzle and was jaw-droppingly good throughout. 9 Isabell Herlovsen Her goal demonstrated incredible composure but, while she was patient and hardworking, she was often isolated upfront. 7 Subs: Frida Maanum 6 (for Saevik 72); Lisa-Marie Utland 7 (for Herlovsen); Synne Hansen 6 (for Wolde 102)",

      "bodyText": "Standing at the lectern of his evangelical church in Sydney\u2019s north-western suburbs last Sunday, Israel Folau was unbound and unbowed. Australia\u2019s top footballer had already lost his job with Rugby Australia after paraphrasing the Bible in a tweet warning that unrepentant gays, adulterers, drunkards and idolaters were destined for hell. Now he was preaching that the devil had influenced governments to allow primary school children to change their gender. Folau is challenging his dismissal in the Fair Work Commission, arguing Rugby Australia violated his religious freedom. The commission\u2019s decision will reverberate through workplaces and institutions where religious people fear discrimination \u2013 and where others believe religious authorities might discriminate against them. At stake are two core democratic principles. The first is the right to believe in a religion, to manifest these beliefs in private and public, and to educate one\u2019s children according to these beliefs. They are rights enshrined in section 18 of the international covenant on civil and political rights, to which Australia was an original signatory. But within article 18, there is also a tension. Governments can limit religious freedom if it is \u201cnecessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others\u201d.

More than a third of Australian students are educated in private schools, the overwhelming number of them religious, at least to some extent.

Alliteration aside, the Matildas\u2019 2019 Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup clash with the Norwegians is perhaps the most significant match in Australian football in a decade or more. Australia have only won one World Cup knock-out match (male or female) in history, when the Matildas beat Brazil in 2015. With a highly-rated squad and the best striker in the world in captain Sam Kerr, expectations are high \u2013 as they have been since before the tournament. </p> <p>For the first-time ever, the Australians are favourites in a World Cup knock-out clash. A win in Nice will be a huge boost for Australian football. A loss will lead to inquests, recriminations and questions about what might have been. </p> <p>But the favourite tag is debatable. Former world champions Norway have performed admirably in a tough Group A, losing only to hosts France. They have several world class players and play a compact, organised style. Guru Reiten and Caroline Graham Hansen will test Australia\u2019s shaky defence, while defensive stalwart Maren Mjelde will be seeking to keep Kerr at bay. </p> <p>We\u2019re in for a big 90 minutes (and possibly more). I will keep you updated live from Stade de Nice - where the sun is shining and Fifa\u2019s hype music is cranking.<br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "The highly-fancied Matildas are out of the Women\u2019s World Cup, after losing to 1995 tournament winners Norway in the penalty shoot-out after an exhilarating 120 minutes. There is plenty of analysis and insight to come from my Guardian colleagues, but I\u2019ll leave you for now. Thanks for joining me, wherever you are in the world. That was some football match. Much analysis from tonight will concern the refereeing and VAR. Should Australia have been awarded that early penalty? Should Kennedy have been send off? Why was the constant physicality against Kerr allowed to go unchecked? The Matildas are beginning to filter through the mixed zone. They look shattered, not unsurprisingly. From the miracle in Montpellier to the nightmare in Nice, it\u2019s been a rollercoaster World Cup for the Australians. Now it is all over. They get a warm send-off from the Australian fans at the Stade de Nice, who are still in full voice. For Norway, their resilience in seeing off Australia will give them confidence ahead of a likely quarter-final clash with England in Le Havre. But the physical battle they\u2019ve just endured, not to mention the 120 minutes plus penalties, might leave them as the walking wounded. A Norwegian reader offers a riposte to Sam Kerr: \u201cSuge p\u00e5 det! (suck on that!)\u201d Whatever you think of the legitimacy of the question, it is certain that the \u2018what if\u2019 query will be asked long and hard - what if Football Federation had not sacked coach Alen Stajcic just months before the World Cup? Well. There will be plenty of analysis and insight in the minutes, hours and days that follow. But as a starting point, that Sam Kerr opening penalty miss will long be remembered. She skied the ball high and got the Matildas\u2019 spot-kicks off to the worst possible start, after Caroline Graham Hansen had calmly opened the Norwegian account. Norway are through to the round of 16. A penalty horror show from the Matildas has ended their World Cup aspirations. Norway 4-1 Australia: Engen hits it clear and true. Australia have been knocked out of the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup. This next penalty could win the match for Norway. Norway 3-1 Australia: Catley scores Australia\u2019s first. The Matildas are still in it - just. Norway 3-0 Australia: Captain Mjelde takes a big run up and hammers it home. Do or die now for Australia. Norway 2-0 Australia: Gielnik the second taker for Australia. She places it, steps back, then re-places it. Hjelmseth saves. All over for Australia? Norway 2-0 Australia: Reiten steps up, and buries it. Advantage Norway. Norway 1-0 Australia: Up walks Sam Kerr. Australia\u2019s hero from the Jamaica game. She skies it. That was a very poor attempt from Kerr - did the pressure get to her? Norway 1-0 Australia: Graham Hansen, perhaps the player of the match, faces Williams, another contender for that gong. She places it perfectly. Norway to shoot first. Up steps Graham Hansen. Referee Hussein is doing the coin toss to decide who shoots first. The Aussies are ready, lined up on the halfway line, while the Norwegians remain huddled. In response to my colleague Richard\u2019s observation about England (or Cameroon) being the true victor tonight, a reader writers in: \u201cYou might remind Mr. Parkin that England\u2019s supporters probably thought the same when the men\u2019s team came up against Croatia last summer.\u201d Tonight\u2019s regular correspondent offers his tip: \u201cIf it goes to penalties, I call 4-3 Australia. Williams has been Schwarzer like and is well prepared. I fear a Viduka from Kerr but hope not.\u201d 120+2 min: And it\u2019s time for penalties!!! Despite going down to 10 women after Kennedy\u2019s red card, the Matildas fought on and kept out the dangerous Norwegians. Now for the lottery of spot-kicks. How good is football?! 120 min: Last gasp stuff from the Aussies in the face of yet another Norway attack, but it works - and the Matildas win the goal-kick. Carpenter is replaced by Harrison for Australia. 119 min: Australia intercept and break forward, but then turn-over the ball. Norway break back and find Graham Hunter, who hits it straight to Williams. Two minutes added time before we go to penalties. 118 min: Norway with a corner, but it doesn\u2019t trouble anyone and is bundled out for a goal-kick. 117 min: My colleague Richard Parkin with the press box banter: \u201cyou know who\u2019s won this match? England. Their qarter-final opponent is going to be knackered.\u201d 116 min: Composed defending from the Matildas as Norway pepper the Australian pepper the area. 115 min: Roestbakken - who is of Norwegian descent - is brought on for Australia, replacing van Egmond. 114 min: van Egmond is on the ground for Australia and not looking in any hurry to get up. She is attended to by medical staff. 113 min: Norway break forward with an overlap. Reiten - who has been unusually quiet tonight - collects and shoots, but Williams gets a hand to it. That woke up the Norwegian fans, who begin a loud chant. 112 min: Australia hold the ball to give themselves an opportunity to breathe, but an errant pass forward sees Norway regather. Hansen almost collects a dangerous cross on the far right, but she slips it into touch. 110 min: Minde puts in a dangerous cross from the left (side note - how many times have I used the word dangerous tonight? Indicative of how fluid Norway have been in the final third, or perhaps that I need a thesaurus...). Nothing comes of it, but Graham Hunter unleashes on the rebound - just wide of Williams for a goal-kick. 109 min: Graham Hunter - who has been a weapon all match - marauds forward. Australia clear, only to face another barrage. How much more of this can they withstand? 106 min: Plenty of differing views on Twitter about the Kennedy red card and then Hussein\u2019s decision not to give Utland a second yellow, but I think we can all relate to this. 105 min: We\u2019re straight back into it, with the Norwegians immediately rushing forward. Maanum has a hit but it goes well-wide. 105+4 min: Hussein brings some reprieve for the embattled Matildas. That red card to Kennedy - which to my eye looked a little harsh - has swung the match in Norway\u2019s favour. But Australia only need to hold on for 15 minutes plus change to determine this match via penalties. 105+3 min: Williams is off her line and B\u00f8e Risa has a speculative shot which hits the crossbar and bounces behind. The Australians are living dangerously. 105+2 min: Cards are flying here. B\u00f8e Risa the latest to collect a yellow, for a tug on her Matildas\u2019 counterpart. Tensions are beginning to flare. 105+1 min: The free-kick is drilled straight at Williams by Mjelde, and it doesn\u2019t trouble the Australian goalkeeper. Three minutes of added time for the first-half of extra-time. 105 min: VAR doesn\u2019t overturn the red, and Kennedy marches off despondent. Dangerous free-kick for Norway about 25 metres from the Australia goal. 103 min: Kennedy pulls on Utland\u2019s shirt as the two tussle on the run and it is a straight red! Wow! But again, VAR is checking. 102 min: Our Russian friend writes in again: \u2018Maybe I have been cruel to Sam Kerr. She has been very womanhandled by the Norwegian defence and has been unlucky not to receive some more friendship from the referees and VAR.\u2019 100 min: Some errant defending sees Graham Hansen again running at the Australians on the edge of the area. She\u2019s the danger woman for Norway right now, as she has been all night. Norway then make another change: Moe Wold off for Hansen. 99 min: Corner Norway, but it comes to nothing. The Norwegians regather around the centre-circle and spray the ball out wide, but the Matildas then counter via Sam Kerr. 97 min: Both teams still have subs up their sleeves, and I suspect changes are imminent - each side is looking leggy. Norway charge at Australia through the middle, but an intercept sends the Matildas on the counter-attack. The Norwegians then regather and Graham Hansen fires straight at Williams, who again pulls off a remarkable save. END TO END STUFF. 96 min: Williams is getting some medical attention after appearing to hurt her leg on a corner. That will cause nerves for the Australians if this heads towards penalties. 94 min: Graham Hansen tries to run at Carpenter but the 19-year-old sends the ball out for a throw. B\u00f8e Risa ends up on the ball from the resulting move and THUNDERS the ball at Williams, who tips over with a remarkable save. 93 min: Norway corner. Some remonstrating in the box by the referee. Australia make a sub: Polkinghorne on for KK. The corner is cleared. 91 min: Sam Kerr is through on goal after a beautiful lofted pass, but can\u2019t find her way around Hjelmseth. Some suspicion of a penalty from that last gasp Norwegian defending by Thorisdottir, but no VAR review. Kerr then has another opportunity a minute later, but again nothing. 90 min: We\u2019re underway, again. Norway immediately unpick the Australian defense, but some last gasp defending prevents the move from threatening. I am not opposed... Australia have thus far only made one sub, while the Norwegians have twice made changes. Don\u2019t forget that teams get an extra sub in extra-time, so three possible changes for the Aussies and two for Norway. 90+4 min: FREE FOOTBALL! Another 30 minutes of this - how good! 90+4 min: Australia with an attacking throw, but it amounts to nothing. Extra-time imminent. 90+3 min: Us too, Jen, except there are sadly no dogs in the press box. 90+2 min: Graham Hansen goes so close! The Norwegian star hits the woodwork. SO CLOSE. The ball only just avoids bouncing into the goal. Heart in mouth stuff her in Nice. 90 min: Norway launch forward. Minde collects the ball on the edge of the Matildas\u2019 area, but the ball is bundled out for a corner. 89 min: No pen and Kellond-Knight steps up for another corner. She then single-handedly stops a Norwegian counter-attack. Is there anything this woman can\u2019t do?! Four minutes of added time are announced. 88 min: Another Australian corner. And VAR is checking for a possible penalty after Yallop is brought down in the box. 86 min: Gielnik breaks down the right after Australia shut down a dangerous Norwegian foray. Her cross is deflected out for a corner. Just before that goal Mary Fowler appeared set to make her debut (maybe Ante is reading this blog...) but that substitution has now been recalled. 83 min: THEY\u2019RE NOT OVER NOW! Kellond-Knight scores from the corner - it misses everyone and loops in. It appeared Gielnik had touched it, but her movement actually threw off the Norwegians and the ball swung into the goal. KK!! 81 min: Australia with a lion\u2019s share of possession at the momentum and the occasional foray into the Norway area, but are struggling to create any real chances. Are the Matildas\u2019 World Cup hopes about to be over before they really began? 80 min: Peter writes in with this witty take: \u201cRe Australian supporters chanting in French - unless Australia score soon, I reckon that Sam Kerr will also be speaking some French after the final whistle.\" 79 min: The clock is ticking and the Matildas are in desperate need of a goal. Might creative dynamo Mary Fowler, just 16, be brought on for her tournament debut as a final roll of the dice by Milicic? 76 min: Goalscorer Herlovsen is replaced, by Utland. The Matildas prepare another attacking sortie, switching from side to side before launching down the right via a throw-in. 75 min: Attendance tonight announced at just 12,229 - one third of total capacity. That is a great shame for the people of Nice, many of whom have missed out on an epic game of football - and there\u2019s still 15 minutes to go! 74 min: Norway\u2019s Graham Hansen runs, runs and runs some more at the Australians, before firing a dangerous pass into the penalty area. Carpenter is first to the ball, though, for the Matildas. 73 min: Norway beginning to tire in the face of relentless Australian pressure. But they did enjoy an extra-days rest, so might have the legs to outrun the Matildas as the game heads towards its finale. Milicic makes his first sub: Raso off for Gielnik. 71 min: While we take a short break for a substitute - Saevik off for Maanum - Terje can enlighten us on the Norwegian team nickname: \u201cIt actually hails from 1995, after the famous World Cup win in Sweden. At this point in history, the men\u2019s national team were riding high, and had earned the widespread nickname \u201cDrillos\u201d, after the legendary coach Egil \u201cDrillo\u201d Olsen. A national newspaper decided that the women\u2019s team should have a nickname too, and invited the readers to come up with suggestions, for which the public should vote. The winner was \u201cGresshoppene\u201d (probably inspired by the centipede-like celebration), but as you would expect of a constructed nickname, it never caught on, and I cannot really remember it being used at all during those halcyon days, let alone in the 25 years to follow.\u201d 69 min: Herlovsen receives the ball in space on the left and breaks forward dangerously, but Carpenter - one of the players of the tournament for Australia - sprints back and dispossesses. 67 min: Australia break into space, but ultimately hold the ball up and try to pass their way through the Norwegians. Right, left, right - and Sam Kerr\u2019s head just misses the well-placed cross that eventually comes in. 65 min: I\u2019m not the only one with heart palpitations from this enthralling encounter, as the Norwegians launch yet another counter-attack. 64 min: Australia counter from a Norwegian half-chance. Raso miscontrols a switch ball onto the right, but wins a corner after regaining composure. 63 min: Our Russian refereeing friend is in touch again: \u201cThe longer that this game goes on this way, the more I am reminded of the Australian men\u2019s Footballing Kangaroos game against Japan in Germany in 2006, despite the lack of two clear hand balls in that game. As a neutral I hope that it doesn\u2019t take until the 86th minute for there to be an evening of the scores. I would like to see penalties decide this game due to the Australians being denied two penalties on my book.\u201d 61 min: Yallop collects the ball on the right and fires a shot towards Hjelmseth, but it goes wide. End to end stuff at the moment - entertaining football. 60 min: Last-ditch defending from Catley prevents a certain Norwegian goal, as her out-stretched leg pokes the ball away from an on-rushing forward. 59 min: Goalllllllllll..... or not. Sam Kerr collects a nice pass and fires past Hjelmseth, but the celebrations are quickly ended when the goal is ruled out for offside. 58 min: Kerr\u2019s head connects to the corner but the ball spirals straight into the arms of Hjelmseth. 57 min: Australia regain control and move the ball around the centre of the Stade de Nice. They try going left, then switch central, before Kennedy launches a long ball forward. Foord finds herself in space and fires a shot, but it is deflected for a corner. 56 min: Kate on Twitter reflecting the collective mood of Australian fans, as Norway have a double opportunity in attack. 54 min: Kellond-Knight\u2019s free-kick slams into the wall and eventually the Norwegians clear. Norway are looking compact and organised defensively, just as expected. Can Australia break them down in the remaining 35-odd minutes? 52 min: Australia win a free-kick on the edge of the area after Raso is brought down by Minde - who receives a yellow card for her efforts. Great run, that, by Raso. 51 min: Carpenter is keen to make up for her error and she sends a long throw forward for Logarzo, but Foord can\u2019t quite send the resulting cross goal-bound. 49 min: A poor pass from Ellie Carpenter is intercepted and Norway maraud forward, before the Australians counter and find themselves in the Norwegian box. But Raso mishits. 48 min: I covered the Norwegians for their opening match against Nigeria, and said the below in my match report. If my prohecy comes true, I apologise to our Australian readers. The last time Norway beat Nigeria in a Women\u2019s World Cup match, they went on to win the tournament. The Norwegians\u2019 rout of the African champions on Saturday evening may not have quite matched that 1995 result \u2013 8-0, the fourth-worst defeat in World Cup history \u2013 but after more than a decade in the doldrums, Norway sent a powerful statement in Reims: even without their star striker Ada Hegerberg, the Grasshoppers are back. ... Reims was once the site where France crowned its kings. Norway have a long way to go before they may be crowned queens of the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup. But if they reach the final in Lyon, they will look back on their visit to regal Reims as an auspicious, history-repeating triumph over Nigeria. 47 min: Not a statistic our Australian readers will appreciate. 46 min: Peepp! We\u2019re back underway. Norway begin proceedings. H\u00e5kon with a bold claim: \u201cHow can you say that\u2019s a penalty? You can clearly see the upper arm tucking in behind the shoulder/chest just before the ball hits the player. Some serious anti-Norwegian bias going on in The Guardian tower.\u201d On the other hand, a Russian (and therefore presumably neutral) reader, chimes in with this: \u201cAs a ref, albeit an over 35s ref, there is no way I would have reversed my initial call if I were Hussein. Thorisdottir has clearly dropped the shoulder, making her body \u2018unnaturally bigger' thus gaining an advantage when the ball made contact with the arm. She knew what she was doing, or in danger of doing because she tried to pull her arm back as soon as she realised it was going to hit it. It was an clear case of misconduct.\u201d Fifa\u2019s resident DJ at the Stade de Nice is clearly an Australian fan - Waltzing Matilda is blasting at half-time. Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong Under the shade of a coolibah tree, He sang as he watched and waited \u2018til his billy boiled You\u2019ll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me My inbox is full of VAR takes. Keld: \u201cA good VAR call again. Yes, there was doubt whether it hit her shoulder, breast or top of the arm. But even if hit the arm, it really didn\u2019t look like punishable handball. The arm\u2019s position did not make her \u2018body unnaturally bigger\u2019 as is the relevant criteria in the new rule.\u201d Hugo writes in with a long missive, but I think the crucial point is this: \u2018Get rid of VAR.\u2019 I need to briefly dash to make use of the facilities before returning for the second half. In the interim, here\u2019s my colleague Louise Taylor\u2019s musings from her past week on the move around France. Bryn on the VAR controversy. \u201cI don\u2019t like that it would be a penalty, but under the rules of the game currently can\u2019t see how it isn\u2019t? VAR slowly destroying the game of football. How does it take nearly 5 mins to make that decision?\u201d Some VAR thoughts from readers. Scott: \u201cWhy not just let a fifth official make the call without having the ref jog around? It\u2019s silly to make everyone wait for that, ain\u2019t it?\u201d Mark: \u201cHuh, I\u2019m convinced that was not a penalty, yet each replay suggests the ball hit her arm. But it didn\u2019t, did it.\u201d Any thoughts? Email or tweet @KieranPender 45+4 min: Hussein blows her whistle to end the first half. A fairly even initial 45, Norway are ahead after a sustained period of attacking pressure led to a goal. The Matildas will be aggrieved not to have won a penalty for a hand-ball in the box; it was initially given but then overturned by VAR. 1-0 Norway, but still everything to play for. 45+3 min: The Matildas build pressure, keeping the ball deep in Norway\u2019s half with three consecutive throw-ins. But it amounts to nothing as a wasted shot goes out for a goal-kick. 45+2 min: Australia are creating space and movement out wide, but are being let down by the final ball into the middle. It\u2019s no Sam Kerr header-fest against Jamaica... 45 min: After all that VAR-ing around, there are four minutes of added time. Australia win a free-kick in a dangerous area, but the quick-take proves ill-advised and bobbles out for a goal-kick. 43 min: VAR-cical. After a long wait, Hussein reverses her initial decision. Looked like a fairly clear handball to me, but the question is one of height - it was well above the elbow. 43 min: After a long wait and some crowd booing, the clock is stopped as referee Hussein goes off to consult the replays and confer with her VAR colleagues. 41 min: A cross is bounced down by Thorisdottir\u2019s arm/shoulder and referee Hussein calls a penalty. VAR is checking... 39 min: Norway with consecutive dangerous corners. Australia are under the pump here. Can they hit back before half-time? 37 min: And then Norway break back! Graham Hansen with a searching run before firing at Williams, but the short is deflected out for a corner. 36 min: Saevik is having some game on the wing for Norway. She tries to go through Logarzo near the Australian area, but the Washington Spirit player is having nothing off it. The resulting corner is cleared and Australia break. 35 min: Either the Australian travelling support have learned French, or the Matildas are the local favourites here - chants of \u201cAustralie, Australie\u201d are ringing out across Stade de Nice. 33 min: The Matildas are suddenly playing with more vigour, but their forays into the Norwegian half are unsuccessful - a lofted ball for Kerr in the box doesn\u2019t connect. 31 min: After Sam Kerr almost scored for the Matildas, Norway respond by going straight up the other end. Saevik finds Herlovsen with a perfectly-weighted ball in transition, and the number nine outsprints her opposite number before firing home past Williams. Goallllll! Advantage Norway. 29 min: Raso causing havoc in the Norwegian box, falling to the ground and then rebounding to stay on the ball. But her effort ultimately amounts to nothing. The Portland Thorns\u2019 forward has been Australia\u2019s best attacking player thus far tonight. 27 min: Engen begins a delightful move through the midfield and looks to get the ball back near the Matildas\u2019 area, but it goes out for a throw. The Norwegians are looking very dangerous when running at the Australians - they have some serious pace. 26 min: The stadium here in Nice is not even half-full. Disappointing effort from the locals and Fifa deserve serious criticism - their on-ground marketing efforts have been very lacklustre. 24 min: Graham Hansen with another shot in space, this one goes wide. Australia were the better side for the first 10 or 15 minutes, but Norway now with the run of play. 22 min: Excellent defending from the Australians, who block two consecutive dangerous balls into the box. Reader Adam has some tactical musings: \u201cWondering if Norway\u2019s fullbacks ought to drop just a liiiiittle bit deeper to provide outlets either side? Mjelde and Thorisdottir are looking a bit isolated against a narrow Australian front three.\u201d 21 min: This time it\u2019s Graham Hansen on the right-hand side for Norway - and her cross-cum-shot finds its way straight to Williams. The Matildas need to improve their defensive efforts out wide. 20 min: It may only be 5.20am in eastern Australia, but that isn\u2019t going to stop Australia\u2019s political class from waking up for the game - and tweeting about it. 19 min: Norway are beginning to create opportunities in attack. Some nice movement sees Saevik on the run with space down the right flank. Her cross is dangerous but ultimately clear. 18 min: Australia get out of jail after a mis-pass from Foord in the penalty area is collected by Herlovsen. The resulting shot runs across an open goalmouth and out for a goal-kick. 16 min: A lull in proceedings. Saevik tries to get things going by speeding past Kellond-Knight, who pulls her down. Free-kick Norway. Don\u2019t forget that you can write in with your thoughts on the match (or whatever else you fancy discussing): email or tweet @KieranPender. 15 min: First corner of the match goes to Australia. van Egmond fires it in, and Hjelmseth collects awkwardly - the ball bounces skyward, but the keeper is able to regather. 14 min: Minde powers a header straight at the Matildas\u2019 custodian Williams, but the Norwegian ace is called back for offside. 13 min: More from Fifa\u2019s statistical boffins: \u201822 June is the same date on which Norway contested the Round of 16 four years ago in Canada, when they were defeated 2-1 by England.\u2019 Australian fans will be hoping this omen bodes well for the Matildas. 11 min: Kerr into the action once more, getting a touch onto a cross, her the ball goes well wide. After her four goal heroics against Jamaica, are we going to see more celebrations from the Aussie captain? 10 min: Moe Wold takes the ball down the right flank for Norway, before passing it into the centre. It pops out again for the wider player, whose cross looks dangerous but is cleared. 9 min: How\u2019s this for a double stat attack, via Fifa: \u201cNorway have not won back-to-back Women\u2019s World Cup fixtures since 2007, when they beat Ghana followed by China PR. Australia enter this match on the back of two consecutive victories, but have never won three Women\u2019s World Cup games in succession.\u201d History about to be made/broken... 7 min: Australia are looking the better team in the early stages, finding some nice fluid movement in attack and are as yet untested defensively. Just as I write that Norway have the ball uncontested in a dangerous area above the Australian penalty area, but the opportunity ultimately amounts to nothing. 5 min: Raso again causing danger, cutting in from the right and finding space in the Norwegian box. But a shot goes straight into the arms of Hjelmseth. 4 min: Raso with a delightful run right through the Norwegian midfield but her final pass is intercepted. Norway look to launch a counter, but the ball goes out for a goal-kick. 2 min: Norway look to create a chance on the left flank but Carpenter is composed in defence and regathers. This is the seventh meeting between Norway and Australia. Norway have the overall advantage, just, with three wins to two, plus one draw. But the Matildas are unbeaten in the past three. 1 min: Sam Kerr into the action immediately, picking up a Foord pass after just 26 seconds and finding herself alone in the Norwegian box. Her shot goes just wide. 1 min: Peepppp! We\u2019re underway at the Stade de Nice. The crowd is underwhelming but I suspect there will be nothing underwhelming about the 90+ minutes of football we are about to enjoy. Anthems have been belted and we\u2019re about to get underway. Regular reader Keith, an Australian in Italy, writes in: \u201cThe channel controllers are nothing but consistent - can\u2019t obtain live TV of this match either! It seems Aussies in Italy are banned from viewing!\u201d As is my tradition, I have crowd-sourced some tips from the great and good of the press box (read: those seated immediately adjacent to me). Positive vibes for the Matildas... Richard Parkin (the Guardian): 0-0 (Australia on penalties) Ben McKay (AAP): 1-2 Australia Ella Reilly (the Guardian): 1-2 Australia Kieran Pender (the Guardian): 2-3 Australia (after extra-time) Ezra writes in: \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of the Matildas. They can show the Socceroos a thing or two about success in major competitions.\u201d Agreed, but let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves... A (presumably) Norwegian reader, Torbj\u00f8rn, writes in: \u201cNot too sure about the origin of \u2018Gresshoppene\u2019, but it has a double meaning in Norwegian. It can mean grasshoppers, but can also mean female horses on grass (a \u2018hoppe\u2019 is a female horse in Norwegian).\u201d I approve of this excellent pun action from the Aussie fans. And here\u2019s the Norwegian starting XI: 4-4-2: Hjelmseth; Moe Wold; Thorisdottir; Mjelde (C); B\u00f8e Risa; Herlovsen; Graham Hansen; Engen; Reiten; Minde; Saevik Ante Milicic has swung the changes for tonight\u2019s match, making four changes. Elise Kellond-Knight returns, replacing youngster Karly Roestbakken at left-back. In the midfield, Tameka Yallop has overcome a corked calf to start ahead of Katrina Gorry. As the manager foreshadowed at the pre-match press conference yesterday, Milicic is making two amendments to the forward line: Caitlin Foord and Hayley Raso in for Lisa De Vanna and Emily Gielnik. These changes revert the team towards the side that faced Brazil - 10 or the 11 starters for the miracle in Montpellier begin tonight. The line-ups are in. First-up, here\u2019s Australia: 4-3-3: Williams; Carpenter; Kennedy; Catley; Kellond-Knight; van Egmond; Yallop; Logarzo; Raso; Kerr (c); Foord I want to commend the excellent musical stylings of Fifa\u2019s resident DJ, who has been blasting AC/DC all afternoon from the stadium\u2019s PA system. My only complaint is that, during the men\u2019s World Cup in Russia, each team had a \u2018national\u2019 song played before kick-off. The Socceroos enjoyed \u2018Down Under\u2019 by Men at Work. But for whatever reason, Fifa have abandoned this excellent tradition in France. While we are on this slightly esoteric tangent, let me commend Fifa\u2019s pre-match hype song to you - Halfway There by Ti\u00ebsto &amp; Dzeko. I\u2019ve been trying to find out why the Norwegians are nicknamed the Gresshoppene (Grasshoppers). My intel to date suggests that it stems back to their gold medal win at the 2000 Sydney, when (I\u2019m told) the players crawled on the turf following the win. Apparently the nickname is no longer commonly used in Norway, but it is included in Fifa\u2019s official materials. Norwegian readers with insight are most welcome to write in, via email or Twitter: @KieranPender. And here\u2019s more Parkin. I particularly enjoyed this opening line: \u201cLike any metric Fifa rankings are a crude measure best taken with a sack of salt. \u201c My favourite colleague Richard Parkin is with me in Nice, and he\u2019s been writing up a storm ahead of the game. Check out this on the threat Norway pose to the Matildas. If you\u2019ve been living under a rock and not yet read our comprehensive team previews, or want to refresh your knowledge ahead of the match, see below. Norway in Nice at nine (local time). Alliteration aside, the Matildas\u2019 2019 Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup clash with the Norwegians is perhaps the most significant match in Australian football in a decade or more. Australia have only won one World Cup knock-out match (male or female) in history, when the Matildas beat Brazil in 2015. With a highly-rated squad and the best striker in the world in captain Sam Kerr, expectations are high \u2013 as they have been since before the tournament. For the first-time ever, the Australians are favourites in a World Cup knock-out clash. A win in Nice will be a huge boost for Australian football. A loss will lead to inquests, recriminations and questions about what might have been. But the favourite tag is debatable. Former world champions Norway have performed admirably in a tough Group A, losing only to hosts France. They have several world class players and play a compact, organised style. Guru Reiten and Caroline Graham Hansen will test Australia\u2019s shaky defence, while defensive stalwart Maren Mjelde will be seeking to keep Kerr at bay. We\u2019re in for a big 90 minutes (and possibly more). I will keep you updated live from Stade de Nice - where the sun is shining and Fifa\u2019s hype music is cranking.",

      "body": "<p>Some games of football need only a single error, a single moment of brilliance to decide them. Others can feast on a cornucopia of chances yet never be sated. In Nice, Australia and Norway were two teams whose refusal to lose was only matched by an equally fervent reluctance to win.</p> <p>It was fitting perhaps that a winner was found via the lottery of penalties \u2013 Norway\u2019s were taken with aplomb while Australia\u2019s were erratic and anxious. In the decisive moment, up strode Ingrid Engen and the team that has featured in the final four of one in every two World Cups claimed its birthright.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/jun/22/norway-australia-womens-world-cup-last-16-live\">Norway beat Australia on penalties in Women's World Cup last 16 \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if there are any words to describe how I\u2019m feeling, more importantly how the girls are feeling\u201d, a deflated Ante Milicic said post-match. \u201cUnfortunately, we can talk about a lot of decisions, the referee, coming back, the spirit the girls had to come back, the send-off, the shootout, there is a lot to comment on. But in the end, I am extremely disappointed. We\u2019re eliminated. We go home.\u201d</p> <p>The game grew bolder as it progressed, refused to let controversy steal the headlines and preferred the efforts of its protagonists to take centre stage. It was Norway\u2019s game for the taking as Isabell Herlovsen\u2019s calmly-executed goal on the counter-attack put the Scandinavians in the box seat. VAR momentarily threatened to be the headline act, but the Matildas refused to let it steal the limelight.</p> <p>The Australians swarmed forward time and again \u2013 but were the architects of their own downfall; final execution refused to reward the good work it rested upon. As a mere 90 minutes of drama appeared likely, the Matildas\u2019 sheer will to compete was rewarded in bizarre fashion with a goal simultaneously as beautiful as Nice\u2019s gentle Mediterranean sunlight, and as ugly as a Chagall first sketch.</p> <p>A corner from Elise Kellond-Knight narrowly evaded teammate Emily Gielnik, a Norwegian defender stretched in vain and Sam Kerr almost bustled it home \u2013 yet it flew through the throng of bodies, miraculously untouched, and nestled inside the far post.</p> <p>For all that, in time added-on it was Caroline Graham Hansen who so very nearly etched her name in the stars with a sumptuous curling effort that cannoned off the upright and rolled agonisingly across the goalface.</p> <p>In extra-time, Alanna Kennedy was handed her marching orders, and again it was all Norway \u2013 defying themselves by squandering chance after chance. The Australian central defender had hardly put a foot wrong all game, and could not believe the referee deemed her coming together with Lisa-Marie Utland a straight red card offence. It was a dramatic finish, entirely out of keeping with a ponderous beginning.</p> <p>With the pre-match focus on the respective star power of Barcelona-bound Graham Hansen and four-goal hero Kerr, it was a surprisingly subdued atmosphere inside the Stade de Nice with empty white seats far outnumbering fans resplendent in gold or red.</p> <p>Those that stayed away would have been kicking themselves just 26 seconds in as Kerr was played through by Caitlin Foord, jinking inside rival skipper Maren Mjelde and firing an early warning shot across the bows of veteran Ingrid Hjelmseth\u2019s goal.</p> <p>At the knockout stage of tournaments the two sides of the same coin \u2013 caution and restraint on ambition \u2013 often sneak onboard like unwanted passengers. And while Australia looked to attack with tempo and purpose, Norway appeared content to settle for thrust and counter-parry.</p> <p>Hayley Raso burst through lines of would-be tacklers, the flying winger combining brilliantly with captain Kerr for a strike that could have broken the deadlock.

      "bodyText": "Some games of football need only a single error, a single moment of brilliance to decide them. Others can feast on a cornucopia of chances yet never be sated. In Nice, Australia and Norway were two teams whose refusal to lose was only matched by an equally fervent reluctance to win. It was fitting perhaps that a winner was found via the lottery of penalties \u2013 Norway\u2019s were taken with aplomb while Australia\u2019s were erratic and anxious. In the decisive moment, up strode Ingrid Engen and the team that has featured in the final four of one in every two World Cups claimed its birthright. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there are any words to describe how I\u2019m feeling, more importantly how the girls are feeling\u201d, a deflated Ante Milicic said post-match. \u201cUnfortunately, we can talk about a lot of decisions, the referee, coming back, the spirit the girls had to come back, the send-off, the shootout, there is a lot to comment on. But in the end, I am extremely disappointed. We\u2019re eliminated. We go home.\u201d The game grew bolder as it progressed, refused to let controversy steal the headlines and preferred the efforts of its protagonists to take centre stage. It was Norway\u2019s game for the taking as Isabell Herlovsen\u2019s calmly-executed goal on the counter-attack put the Scandinavians in the box seat. VAR momentarily threatened to be the headline act, but the Matildas refused to let it steal the limelight. The Australians swarmed forward time and again \u2013 but were the architects of their own downfall; final execution refused to reward the good work it rested upon. As a mere 90 minutes of drama appeared likely, the Matildas\u2019 sheer will to compete was rewarded in bizarre fashion with a goal simultaneously as beautiful as Nice\u2019s gentle Mediterranean sunlight, and as ugly as a Chagall first sketch. A corner from Elise Kellond-Knight narrowly evaded teammate Emily Gielnik, a Norwegian defender stretched in vain and Sam Kerr almost bustled it home \u2013 yet it flew through the throng of bodies, miraculously untouched, and nestled inside the far post. For all that, in time added-on it was Caroline Graham Hansen who so very nearly etched her name in the stars with a sumptuous curling effort that cannoned off the upright and rolled agonisingly across the goalface. In extra-time, Alanna Kennedy was handed her marching orders, and again it was all Norway \u2013 defying themselves by squandering chance after chance. The Australian central defender had hardly put a foot wrong all game, and could not believe the referee deemed her coming together with Lisa-Marie Utland a straight red card offence. It was a dramatic finish, entirely out of keeping with a ponderous beginning. With the pre-match focus on the respective star power of Barcelona-bound Graham Hansen and four-goal hero Kerr, it was a surprisingly subdued atmosphere inside the Stade de Nice with empty white seats far outnumbering fans resplendent in gold or red. Those that stayed away would have been kicking themselves just 26 seconds in as Kerr was played through by Caitlin Foord, jinking inside rival skipper Maren Mjelde and firing an early warning shot across the bows of veteran Ingrid Hjelmseth\u2019s goal. At the knockout stage of tournaments the two sides of the same coin \u2013 caution and restraint on ambition \u2013 often sneak onboard like unwanted passengers. And while Australia looked to attack with tempo and purpose, Norway appeared content to settle for thrust and counter-parry. Hayley Raso burst through lines of would-be tacklers, the flying winger combining brilliantly with captain Kerr for a strike that could have broken the deadlock. But handed the start for her proactive, bustling energy, Raso has too often lacked in finishing \u2013 and did so here again. All across the park battles sprang up \u2013 the individual contests within the collective that pepper a game with tension. Mjelde and Kerr. Raso and Minde. Graham Hansen versus the world. And as Norway grew into the game, a decisive moment arrived. From the touchline Karina Saevik saw half a chance. Her curling ball found Herlovsen and Norway\u2019s third all-time top goalscorer drew one closer to the great Marianne Pettersen. Martin Sj\u00f6gren came with a game plan against France and felt aggrieved that a VAR-inspired intervention prevented his team. Here the fates were on his side. A seemingly cast-iron penalty for handball was awarded by the referee, but an interminable wait followed. Kerr juggled on the spot as all awaited. Players gathered in huddles like bored gossipers at the crossroads before the decision was reversed on review and Norway celebrated. But after 120 minutes and just seven penalties, Norway\u2019s smiles had returned. An exhilarating rollercoaster of a match, in which the perhaps deserved result eventually came \u2013 via the most tortuous route imaginable.",

Not that Neville is in holiday mode. His side have won three games out of three and, having topped their group, face Cameroon in Sunday\u2019s last-16 match at the other end of France in Valenciennes, but nagging doubts linger. The Lionesses are a little goal-shy while passages of convincing play are sometimes tempered by prolonged slapdash interludes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/21/women-world-cup-2019-power-rankings-usa-england\">Women\u2019s World Cup 2019 power rankings: USA top and England third | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYes, it does frustrate me,\u201d acknowledges Neville, who preaches a slick passing, possession game. \u201cI\u2019m looking for something that may take a long time to achieve, that total domination for 90 minutes. I sometimes expect more of them \u2026 but maybe no team can do it for 90 minutes.</p> <p>\u201cMy expectation levels are probably higher than what\u2019s achievable. But I have to keep pushing the standards. And so far I\u2019ve seen nothing in this tournament that gives me fear. I\u2019ve seen nothing that makes me go: \u2018Oh dear me, if we play them we\u2019re going to struggle.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Not that he is underestimating Cameroon. \u201cOur biggest tests are going to be against teams like that, the teams that we\u2019re expected to beat but will sit low and really try to stifle us,\u201d he says. \u201cMy players are looking forward to the games where teams will come out at us, give us more spaces to play and to counterattack. But it\u2019s been a fantastic tournament in terms of the quality. \u201cThe goalkeeping has been unbelievable. We\u2019ve played against three goalkeepers who have produced saves I\u2019ve never seen in women\u2019s football.\u201d</p> <p>The heightened calibre of competition has partly informed Neville\u2019s penchant for rotation. No coach in France has refreshed his side more than England\u2019s. He explains the eight changes he made in the defeat of Japan stemmed from a decision to profile tactically each squad member.</p> <p>\u201cWe pick players on their profiles,\u201d he says. \u201cOver the years I\u2019ve learned that, if you have one cog that\u2019s not quite right in the system, that flow of how you want to play can\u2019t work.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a centre-back that can\u2019t dribble the ball out in a certain game, you can\u2019t have tactics to play from the back. It\u2019s why we change our goalkeeper sometimes. The profiles of Karen Bardsley and Carly Telford are really different.

      "bodyText": "The hotel\u2019s breakfast buffet is still doing brisk trade when Phil Neville takes a seat in a quiet corner and reflects on the night before. England\u2019s coach reveals that his reward for choreographing the 2-0 victory against Japan in Nice last week was a rare exemption from a daily 6am run. \u201cI went for a swim instead,\u201d says the now deeply tanned Lionesses coach. \u201cIt was great.\u201d It is not yet 10am in the wooded hills above Antibes but already a searingly hot sun warms the circular pool visible through the plate glass doors behind him. Not that Neville is in holiday mode. His side have won three games out of three and, having topped their group, face Cameroon in Sunday\u2019s last-16 match at the other end of France in Valenciennes, but nagging doubts linger. The Lionesses are a little goal-shy while passages of convincing play are sometimes tempered by prolonged slapdash interludes. \u201cYes, it does frustrate me,\u201d acknowledges Neville, who preaches a slick passing, possession game. \u201cI\u2019m looking for something that may take a long time to achieve, that total domination for 90 minutes. I sometimes expect more of them \u2026 but maybe no team can do it for 90 minutes. \u201cMy expectation levels are probably higher than what\u2019s achievable. But I have to keep pushing the standards. And so far I\u2019ve seen nothing in this tournament that gives me fear. I\u2019ve seen nothing that makes me go: \u2018Oh dear me, if we play them we\u2019re going to struggle.\u2019\u201d Not that he is underestimating Cameroon. \u201cOur biggest tests are going to be against teams like that, the teams that we\u2019re expected to beat but will sit low and really try to stifle us,\u201d he says. \u201cMy players are looking forward to the games where teams will come out at us, give us more spaces to play and to counterattack. But it\u2019s been a fantastic tournament in terms of the quality. \u201cThe goalkeeping has been unbelievable. We\u2019ve played against three goalkeepers who have produced saves I\u2019ve never seen in women\u2019s football.\u201d The heightened calibre of competition has partly informed Neville\u2019s penchant for rotation. No coach in France has refreshed his side more than England\u2019s. He explains the eight changes he made in the defeat of Japan stemmed from a decision to profile tactically each squad member. \u201cWe pick players on their profiles,\u201d he says. \u201cOver the years I\u2019ve learned that, if you have one cog that\u2019s not quite right in the system, that flow of how you want to play can\u2019t work. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a centre-back that can\u2019t dribble the ball out in a certain game, you can\u2019t have tactics to play from the back. It\u2019s why we change our goalkeeper sometimes. The profiles of Karen Bardsley and Carly Telford are really different. It\u2019s not science, it\u2019s common sense, it\u2019s playing the right players in the right positions for the style of football you want to implement in a specific game.\u201d It is an ideology provoked by conversations with Louis van Gaal at Manchester United. \u201cI remember him talking about the importance of playing a left-footed centre-back,\u201d says Neville. \u201cIf you have a right-footed one on the left the movement isn\u2019t as quick or as smooth. I thought long and hard about Van Gaal\u2019s analysis and it\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s why I pick players for certain reasons.\u201d Indeed form does not necessarily inform team sheets. \u201cForm helps,\u201d says Neville. \u201cBut I go on the basis that I trust the player in a particular game, more than saying: \u2018You\u2019re not in form, so you\u2019re not playing.\u2019 The players think it helps them to perform if you put the right people around them.

      "body": "<p>England were among the favourites to win a first European Under\u201121 Championship since 1984 but are out with a game to spare after error-strewn losses to France and Romania. Aidy Boothroyd vowed not to quit following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/21/england-romania-european-under-21-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">team\u2019s elimination on Friday</a>, insisting he needed to reflect on a campaign that has seen England \u2013 unbeaten in 10 qualifiers \u2013 concede six goals, give away three penalties and receive a damaging red card, with Monday\u2019s dead game against Croatia to come. On Saturday the head coach faced up to England\u2019s latest disappointment on the international stage. Here, in his own words, Boothroyd defends his strategy, his record \u2013 and his players.</p> <p><strong>What was going through your mind last night?</strong></p> <p>I didn\u2019t sleep. You always think to yourself: \u201cWhat could I have done differently? What could I have done better?\u201d Any half-decent coach asks themselves those questions when they are picking the bones out of something like that.</p> <p><strong>And what conclusions did you draw?</strong></p> <p>Well the questions straight after the game were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/17/england-france-under-21-euros-boothroyd\" title=\"\">about Phil [Foden]</a>. \u201cWhy did you leave your best player out?\u201d I still think, sitting here, that it was the right thing to do. When he came off the pitch against the French, he was absolutely spent. Physically he was dead on his feet. It was the same with Ryan Sessegnon. The plan was to introduce them gradually because we were planning on being here for five games, not three. We introduced him at a point where he could weave his magic \u2013 which he did. So we got that right. Unfortunately in Ryan\u2019s case, he pulls his hamstring and we didn\u2019t get that with him. It\u2019s a balancing act.</p> <p><strong>But it was a must-win game. Surely you start your best player?</strong></p> <p>Well, you do, but if your best player has a really strong chance of getting injured because of the work that he has done then no, you don\u2019t. I think the fact that Sess pulled his hamstring is a testament to the fine line you walk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/21/england-romania-european-under-21-championship-match-report\">\u2018They will have to carry me out\u2019: Boothroyd defiant after U-21 exit</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Were you over-confident? Even after the Romania defeat you had players claiming England were still the best team in the tournament. Do they need to learn a bit of humility?</strong></p> <p>They are young, fit guys and I think that was just a reaction. I don\u2019t think we took anybody lightly. Maybe you guys did. Ultimately we made mistakes. We planned for months in advance, we knew what we were doing and we were really happy with everything around it. We have not been clinical. We have made individual errors towards the end of games. We were just not as good as we should have been.</p> <p><strong>England\u2019s under-17s, -19s, -20s and now -21s have all performed badly this season, whether in European Championships or World Cup qualifying. Was 2017 [when England won the Under-17 and Under-20 World Cups] an anomaly rather than the foundation for future success?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m not sure it was an anomaly. I look at it like a club \u2013 the senior team is the most important. The reserve-team coach \u2013 me \u2013 his job is to get players into that team and to try to win football matches. Because the under-20s, under-19s and under-18s have done well their players have been hoiked up to me. Gareth has obviously taken the best players that he wants and needs.

      "bodyText": "England were among the favourites to win a first European Under\u201121 Championship since 1984 but are out with a game to spare after error-strewn losses to France and Romania. Aidy Boothroyd vowed not to quit following the team\u2019s elimination on Friday, insisting he needed to reflect on a campaign that has seen England \u2013 unbeaten in 10 qualifiers \u2013 concede six goals, give away three penalties and receive a damaging red card, with Monday\u2019s dead game against Croatia to come. On Saturday the head coach faced up to England\u2019s latest disappointment on the international stage. Here, in his own words, Boothroyd defends his strategy, his record \u2013 and his players. What was going through your mind last night? I didn\u2019t sleep. You always think to yourself: \u201cWhat could I have done differently? What could I have done better?\u201d Any half-decent coach asks themselves those questions when they are picking the bones out of something like that. And what conclusions did you draw? Well the questions straight after the game were about Phil [Foden]. \u201cWhy did you leave your best player out?\u201d I still think, sitting here, that it was the right thing to do. When he came off the pitch against the French, he was absolutely spent. Physically he was dead on his feet. It was the same with Ryan Sessegnon. The plan was to introduce them gradually because we were planning on being here for five games, not three. We introduced him at a point where he could weave his magic \u2013 which he did. So we got that right. Unfortunately in Ryan\u2019s case, he pulls his hamstring and we didn\u2019t get that with him. It\u2019s a balancing act. But it was a must-win game. Surely you start your best player? Well, you do, but if your best player has a really strong chance of getting injured because of the work that he has done then no, you don\u2019t. I think the fact that Sess pulled his hamstring is a testament to the fine line you walk. Were you over-confident? Even after the Romania defeat you had players claiming England were still the best team in the tournament. Do they need to learn a bit of humility? They are young, fit guys and I think that was just a reaction. I don\u2019t think we took anybody lightly. Maybe you guys did. Ultimately we made mistakes. We planned for months in advance, we knew what we were doing and we were really happy with everything around it. We have not been clinical. We have made individual errors towards the end of games. We were just not as good as we should have been. England\u2019s under-17s, -19s, -20s and now -21s have all performed badly this season, whether in European Championships or World Cup qualifying. Was 2017 [when England won the Under-17 and Under-20 World Cups] an anomaly rather than the foundation for future success? I\u2019m not sure it was an anomaly. I look at it like a club \u2013 the senior team is the most important. The reserve-team coach \u2013 me \u2013 his job is to get players into that team and to try to win football matches. Because the under-20s, under-19s and under-18s have done well their players have been hoiked up to me. Gareth has obviously taken the best players that he wants and needs. A lot of thought goes into it. We have to push people and stretch them and think about the longer\u2011term pressure. What I think has happened, to answer your question, is Gareth has taken players into the senior team, which is brilliant. I have taken players into the under-21s, and because of that everyone is a little bit weaker but the system is stronger. Do we need to be more realistic about these tournaments? It seems that you might have been hemmed in by the playing style and Romania\u2019s superior ring-craft. Ring-craft is a great phrase and I\u2019m going to steal it because it\u2019s right. We get into positions where we think: \u201cWe\u2019ve played some really good stuff.\u201d But we\u2019re scratching our heads on the way home after getting beaten. It\u2019s a key thing for us \u2013 managing momentum, match management, ring-craft. These are areas that we should be aware of, because we\u2019ve got a younger group, and be better at it. This line about \u201cthe best team here\u201d is a recurring theme among your players. Is there a problem that, because of having great contracts with famous football clubs, many of them are suffering delusions of grandeur? That might be a bit of bravado. The boys are not daft. They will hurt and they do hurt. They will reflect and that will start today. We think we\u2019re the best team but we\u2019re going home, why? The important thing is we don\u2019t brush anything under the carpet. We front it up. I honestly don\u2019t think we have got delusions of grandeur. We know what we are.

The GRU hacked and leaked Democratic Party emails, special counsel Robert Mueller said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s guys whose job is secrecy trying to do social media. They were trying so hard to hide their identities they effectively hid their content as well,\u201d Nimmo said. The operation was a classic influence campaign, known as \u201cactive measures\u201d.</p> <p>One high-profile victim of the Russian operation was the Republican senator Marco Rubio. A <a href=\"http://archive.is/FI9Uk\" title=\"\">photoshopped \u201ctweet\u201d from Rubio</a> claimed that Britain\u2019s GCHQ, which \u201cspied\u201d on Donald Trump in 2016, was \u201cback in the game\u201d. The agency was now using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/12/deep-fakes-fake-news-truth\" title=\"\">deep </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/12/deep-fakes-fake-news-truth\" title=\"\">fakes</a> to support the Democrats in the US midterm elections.</p> <p>\u201cNo-one \u2013 especially our closest ally \u2013 has the right to threaten our democracy &amp; national security,\u201d the fake August 2018 tweet said.

It was unclear if RT was aware the content was fake.</p> <p>Moscow\u2019s aim is to inflame tensions between the US and UK, as part of a \u201cdivide and conquer strategy\u201d, the study concludes. Trump has claimed on Twitter that he is the victim of a \u201cdeep state\u201d plot carried out by his own spy agencies, with GCHQ\u2019s assistance. GCHQ has described this as ridiculous.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1141468656603455488\" title=\"\">genuine tweet</a> last week, Rubio called out Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cdisinformation campaign\u201d, and said that Moscow would carry on churning out \u201crealistic looking\u201d fakes.</p> <p>The Russians pretended to be an unnamed senior Labour party figure at Westminster. They created a fake Facebook page, using the person\u2019s genuine photo and bio, and shared real articles from the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn. Two similar fake Facebook parliament-linked pages were set up \u2013 one in the UK, and another in Spain.</p> <p>It was unclear if the goal was to plant false stories only \u2013 or if Facebook was being used to attract genuine followers who might then be entrapped or recruited, the study says.</p> <p>A particularly vicious fake claimed that migrants in Germany were plotting to molest German women. It was spread via a now suspended Twitter account \u2013 @KPrydius \u2013 supposedly belonging to a Ukrainian woman, Katja Prydius, living in Germany. Her tweets achieved \u201csignificant pick-up\u201d and still circulate on German far-right websites, the study says.</p>",

In terms of bang for your buck I have never seen so little bang for buck,\u201d Ben Nimmo of the Atlantic Council said. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre.\u201d Nimmo said that this appeared to be the work of an intelligence agency, rather than the notorious \u201ctroll factory\u201d based in St Petersburg that interfered in the 2016 American presidential election. The most likely culprit was the GRU, the Russian military intelligence outfit. The GRU hacked and leaked Democratic Party emails, special counsel Robert Mueller said. \u201cIt\u2019s guys whose job is secrecy trying to do social media. They were trying so hard to hide their identities they effectively hid their content as well,\u201d Nimmo said. The operation was a classic influence campaign, known as \u201cactive measures\u201d. One high-profile victim of the Russian operation was the Republican senator Marco Rubio. A photoshopped \u201ctweet\u201d from Rubio claimed that Britain\u2019s GCHQ, which \u201cspied\u201d on Donald Trump in 2016, was \u201cback in the game\u201d. The agency was now using deep fakes to support the Democrats in the US midterm elections. \u201cNo-one \u2013 especially our closest ally \u2013 has the right to threaten our democracy &amp; national security,\u201d the fake August 2018 tweet said. It was coupled with a picture of the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants. The \u201ctweet\u201d was picked up by the state media channel RT, formerly known as Russia Today. It was unclear if RT was aware the content was fake. Moscow\u2019s aim is to inflame tensions between the US and UK, as part of a \u201cdivide and conquer strategy\u201d, the study concludes. Trump has claimed on Twitter that he is the victim of a \u201cdeep state\u201d plot carried out by his own spy agencies, with GCHQ\u2019s assistance. GCHQ has described this as ridiculous. In a genuine tweet last week, Rubio called out Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cdisinformation campaign\u201d, and said that Moscow would carry on churning out \u201crealistic looking\u201d fakes. The Russians pretended to be an unnamed senior Labour party figure at Westminster. They created a fake Facebook page, using the person\u2019s genuine photo and bio, and shared real articles from the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn. Two similar fake Facebook parliament-linked pages were set up \u2013 one in the UK, and another in Spain. It was unclear if the goal was to plant false stories only \u2013 or if Facebook was being used to attract genuine followers who might then be entrapped or recruited, the study says. A particularly vicious fake claimed that migrants in Germany were plotting to molest German women. It was spread via a now suspended Twitter account \u2013 @KPrydius \u2013 supposedly belonging to a Ukrainian woman, Katja Prydius, living in Germany. Her tweets achieved \u201csignificant pick-up\u201d and still circulate on German far-right websites, the study says.",

In this election cycle, reproductive rights has emerged as a top issue as Republican statehouses across the US have attacked abortion rights.</p> <p>Biden told his audience in Columbia he would codify the right to an abortion, granted in Roe v Wade, into law \u201cas defined by Casey\u201d \u2013 a stance more conservative than those of many other Democratic candidates present.</p> <p>Casey is the 1992 supreme court decision which allowed states to severely restrict abortion access, including imposing waiting periods and medically unnecessary administrative burdens.</p> <p>Later in the forum, a woman who said she was sexually assaulted by her abusive husband but could not cover an abortion through her military health benefits, asked Biden how he would expand access to abortion.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of you women, maybe a lot of men out here, maybe don\u2019t realize what incredible courage it took to stand up and say that,\u201d Biden said.</p> <p>Other candidates went further.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been on defense for 47 years, and it\u2019s not working,\u201d said the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren. \u201cAn inch at a time, a piece at a time, they\u2019ve chipped away, hacked away at the ground under our feet, so access becomes narrower, becomes more limited.</p> <p>She went on: \u201cThis is a democracy. In a democracy, the laws should reflect the values of the people. So I say it is time to go on offense with Roe v Wade. It\u2019s not enough to say we\u2019re going to rely on the courts. We need to pass a federal law to make Roe v Wade the rule of the land.\u201d</p> <p>That prompted huge cheers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12d7e0ac4118cb63f4c0bcd82ec9afa86aeb51cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12d7e0ac4118cb63f4c0bcd82ec9afa86aeb51cb/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Warren on stage in Columbia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Warren on stage in Columbia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Logan Cyrus/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She continued: \u201cWe can add and say: no more of this semi-repeal of Roe, another bite out of Roe, an undercut of Roe. We\u2019re going to make it the law. Let\u2019s make it the law for real again.\u201d</p> <p>But the loudest cheers of the day went to Cory Booker, who called bans passed by states like Alabama a violation of human rights. </p> <p>\u201cIf they come for you in the morning, they come for me at night. This election is about winning,\u201d said Booker, as he stepped off the stage, the only candidate to do so.</p> <p>\u201cThis election is about women! This election is about minorities! This election is about all of us and that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to fight. This election is about liberty and justice for all and we will win!\u201d</p> <p>The audience presented a sea of pink Planned Parenthood shirts. Some were moved to tears. In a bathroom, a woman cried as she said she had \u201cnever been to an event like this, and it is so powerful. I want to travel the country.\u201d</p> <p>The woman said she had an abortion at a Planned Parenthood facility in 1974, when she was 16. Her mother had been with her.</p> <p>\u201cI was able to have an abortion,\u201d she said, \u201cgo to college, meet my soon-to-be husband, and have a life of my choice.\u201d She did not say her name, because her family did not know her story.</p> <p>On stage, each candidate was given about 10 minutes to answer questions from Planned Parenthood leaders and an audience member. Shocking stories came forth.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have a beautiful child I love and adore. That does not mean I am grateful for the trauma I was put through</p> <footer> <cite>Laurie Bertram Roberts</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One audience member told the New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand that she threw herself down the stairs, drank until she vomited, took hot baths and even rode every ride at a county fair to try to induce an abortion. She was forced to carry the unwanted pregnancy to term, she said, because she lacked the roughly $600 in cash needed to pay for an abortion.</p> <p>\u201cI have a beautiful child I love and adore,\u201d said Laurie Bertram Roberts, now a doula. \u201cThat does not mean I am grateful for the trauma I was put through for the fact the Hyde amendment exists.\u201d</p> <p>That was a reference to a provision of federal law that prevents the government from paying for abortion and primarily affects 17 million poor and disabled women who rely on Medicaid.</p> <p>Gillibrand became tearful herself. She told the audience not to vote for her but to \u201cpick your top five\u201d candidates, and donate.</p> <p>\u201cIf women and candidates of color are not included on that debate stage in September, October, you will not be represented,\u201d said Gillibrand.</p> <p>Over the past few months, Republicans and conservative Christians have worked to severely limit abortions rights. Bans have passed in states including Ohio and Kentucky. The laws are patently unconstitutional and abortion remains safe and legal in all 50 states. But supporters hope the bans will be challenged all the way to the supreme court, where the conservative-leaning majority could reconsider Roe v Wade.</p> <p>Social conservatives have also attempted to make abortion inaccessible through administrative means. This week, political appointees in Missouri attempted to shut down the state\u2019s last abortion clinic and a federal court decided in favor of the Trump administration allowing federal funding to go to clinics which do not offer comprehensive family planning services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/18/us-anti-abortion-bans-backlash-gerrymandering\">How gerrymandering paved the way for the US's anti-abortion movement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The South Carolina event was organized in response to such Republican moves.

Biden told his audience in Columbia he would codify the right to an abortion, granted in Roe v Wade, into law \u201cas defined by Casey\u201d \u2013 a stance more conservative than those of many other Democratic candidates present. Casey is the 1992 supreme court decision which allowed states to severely restrict abortion access, including imposing waiting periods and medically unnecessary administrative burdens. Later in the forum, a woman who said she was sexually assaulted by her abusive husband but could not cover an abortion through her military health benefits, asked Biden how he would expand access to abortion. \u201cA lot of you women, maybe a lot of men out here, maybe don\u2019t realize what incredible courage it took to stand up and say that,\u201d Biden said. Other candidates went further. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on defense for 47 years, and it\u2019s not working,\u201d said the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren. \u201cAn inch at a time, a piece at a time, they\u2019ve chipped away, hacked away at the ground under our feet, so access becomes narrower, becomes more limited. She went on: \u201cThis is a democracy. In a democracy, the laws should reflect the values of the people. So I say it is time to go on offense with Roe v Wade. It\u2019s not enough to say we\u2019re going to rely on the courts. We need to pass a federal law to make Roe v Wade the rule of the land.\u201d That prompted huge cheers. She continued: \u201cWe can add and say: no more of this semi-repeal of Roe, another bite out of Roe, an undercut of Roe. We\u2019re going to make it the law. Let\u2019s make it the law for real again.\u201d But the loudest cheers of the day went to Cory Booker, who called bans passed by states like Alabama a violation of human rights. \u201cIf they come for you in the morning, they come for me at night. This election is about winning,\u201d said Booker, as he stepped off the stage, the only candidate to do so. \u201cThis election is about women! This election is about minorities! This election is about all of us and that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to fight. This election is about liberty and justice for all and we will win!\u201d The audience presented a sea of pink Planned Parenthood shirts. Some were moved to tears. In a bathroom, a woman cried as she said she had \u201cnever been to an event like this, and it is so powerful. I want to travel the country.\u201d The woman said she had an abortion at a Planned Parenthood facility in 1974, when she was 16. Her mother had been with her. \u201cI was able to have an abortion,\u201d she said, \u201cgo to college, meet my soon-to-be husband, and have a life of my choice.\u201d She did not say her name, because her family did not know her story. On stage, each candidate was given about 10 minutes to answer questions from Planned Parenthood leaders and an audience member. Shocking stories came forth. One audience member told the New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand that she threw herself down the stairs, drank until she vomited, took hot baths and even rode every ride at a county fair to try to induce an abortion. She was forced to carry the unwanted pregnancy to term, she said, because she lacked the roughly $600 in cash needed to pay for an abortion. \u201cI have a beautiful child I love and adore,\u201d said Laurie Bertram Roberts, now a doula. \u201cThat does not mean I am grateful for the trauma I was put through for the fact the Hyde amendment exists.\u201d That was a reference to a provision of federal law that prevents the government from paying for abortion and primarily affects 17 million poor and disabled women who rely on Medicaid. Gillibrand became tearful herself. She told the audience not to vote for her but to \u201cpick your top five\u201d candidates, and donate. \u201cIf women and candidates of color are not included on that debate stage in September, October, you will not be represented,\u201d said Gillibrand. Over the past few months, Republicans and conservative Christians have worked to severely limit abortions rights. Bans have passed in states including Ohio and Kentucky. The laws are patently unconstitutional and abortion remains safe and legal in all 50 states. But supporters hope the bans will be challenged all the way to the supreme court, where the conservative-leaning majority could reconsider Roe v Wade. Social conservatives have also attempted to make abortion inaccessible through administrative means. This week, political appointees in Missouri attempted to shut down the state\u2019s last abortion clinic and a federal court decided in favor of the Trump administration allowing federal funding to go to clinics which do not offer comprehensive family planning services. The South Carolina event was organized in response to such Republican moves. It had the air of a party \u2013 a DJ blasted Lizzo from the speakers \u2013 but one whose attendees were frankly fed up. For at least some candidates, this presented a challenge. The former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper stumbled through a short history of his life in the restaurant industry before saying he could oversee a \u201cmagnificent expansion of Title X\u201d federal funding for family planning. Planned Parenthood president Dr Leana Wen told the Guardian her group is \u201cworking with all the candidates to develop the most proactive policies that would protect women\u2019s health and rights\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The Queensland environment department may have acted \u201cunlawfully\u201d when it approved of Adani\u2019s groundwater plan, in the process backing down on a longstanding requirement that the miner provide definitive proof about the source of an ancient desert spring. Environmental groups are now considering a legal challenge to the approval, partly because the state\u2019s Department of Environment and Science (DES) appeared to negotiate a last-minute compromise with Adani rather than applying strict conditions. The DES insisted on Friday that it had not changed its position when granting approval for Adani\u2019s groundwater dependent ecosystems management plan \u2013 the final hurdle that will allow the company to begin construction of the Carmichael coalmine. But documents obtained by Guardian Australia, and an email sent by a DES spokesman on 9 April, indicate that the department softened its interpretation of a key requirement in the politically charged weeks before clearing the proposal. The email of 9 April says the department believed the CSIRO and Geoscience Australia had highlighted \u201cuncertainties\u201d about whether Adani had identified the source aquifer of the Doongmabulla Springs complex. \u201cBased on the CSIRO and Geoscience Australia report, it would appear that a number of uncertainties remain, including whether the (groundwater plan) definitively identifies the source aquifers of the Doongmabulla Springs Complex, which has always been a requirement for state approval,\u201d the email says. Four days after the federal election, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, insisted on a timeframe for DES to make a decision about the groundwater plan. When the clock ran out on 13 June, Adani\u2019s plan was approved, and DES had subtly changed its language. It said Adani had \u201csufficiently\u201d identified the \u201cmain source aquifer\u201d. The miner\u2019s conditions require it to identify the \u201csource aquifer(s)\u201d. DES said its decision to approve the management plan was made after it received legal advice. It also took into account additional advice from the federal science agencies, received on 7 June, which said that \u201csome level of uncertainty\u201d would always exist with conceptual groundwater models. As part of the approved plan, Adani has committed to future work to \u201cimprove the understanding of source aquifers\u201d. But environmental groups say the condition required Adani to identify the source of the springs before any groundwater plan could be approved; and that the process was designed to safeguard the springs from potential damage caused by the drawdown of groundwater during construction or mining operations. On 11 June, two days before the approval was announced, Lock the Gate wrote to DES saying it would be \u201cunlawful\u201d to approve of Adani\u2019s groundwater plan because expert advice clearly outlined that the source aquifers had not been established. \u201cBy pressuring [DES] into approving the water plan without doing the required research and identifying beyond doubt the source aquifer for the Doongmabulla Springs Complex, Adani and the Queensland Government have found themselves in legally questionable territory,\u201d Lock the Gate campaign coordinator Carmel Flint said. The Australian Conservation Foundation\u2019s Stop Adani campaigner Christian Slattery said the group was considering the decision and examining legal avenues available. \u201c(The process) seems to show how politics has completely trumped science and the Queensland government has sold out the long-term interests of regional communities, traditional owners, and the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe watering down of that interpretation of that environmental authority condition is a clear demonstration of how the government is afraid to stand up to big mining corporations.\u201d Slattery said the groundwater plan deferred critical scientific research until after mining would commence and \u201cwhen irreversible impacts may already have occurred\u201d. A DES spokesman said the department\u2019s assessment of Adani\u2019s various plans had \u201calways been rigorous and based on the best available science\u201d. \u201cAs the independent regulator, the department made its own decision after receiving Adani\u2019s final version of the (groundwater plan) on 12 June, which addressed previous feedback the department had given. \u201cThe department and Adani met regularly \u2026 to ensure the plan was robust and provided the maximum environmental protection.\u201d",

In a briefing document circulated to more than 100 Labour MPs and peers yesterday, Watson says sections of the analysis leaked to the media have \u201cskewed\u201d understanding of the party\u2019s plight. He warns that if Labour does not face the actual lessons and become a Remain party, it risks electoral disaster. In his memo, obtained by the Observer, he challenges five of the key points made to the shadow cabinet in the briefing, which cast doubt on the benefits of Labour becoming a more explicitly pro-Remain party. Watson warns that unless Labour grasps the reality of its position, it faces a \u201ccatastrophic loss of votes\u201d to the Liberal Democrats and Greens \u201cthat could enable a Conservative landslide\u201d at a general election. His intervention comes ahead of further discussion at the shadow cabinet on Tuesday of Labour\u2019s Brexit position. After last week\u2019s meeting, the party issued a statement that disappointed supporters of a second referendum and appeared to leave Labour\u2019s nuanced position on another public vote unchanged, while not committing the party to a clear pro-Remain stance. Watson is concerned that accounts of last week\u2019s meeting released to the media misrepresented the full picture, fundamentally underplaying the extent of the loss of votes from Labour to Remain parties, while overplaying the danger to the party of adopting a more pro-Remain policy in key seats that backed Leave in the 2016 referendum. Watson says accounts of the shadow cabinet analysis \u201cmay have skewed understanding within the media, the party and the shadow cabinet about the huge challenge confronting Labour\u201d. In a message to his Future Britain group of MPs and peers, which is backing its own centre-left set of policy approaches, he says: \u201cMany people in this group have contacted me following the Brexit shadow cabinet that took place this week and ahead of the key shadow cabinet that will next week decide the future of Labour\u2019s policy on Brexit, and in particular whether the party will campaign to remain in a referendum on any future deal. \u201cJeremy has already committed Labour to holding a confirmatory public ballot on any future Brexit deal, whether the deal is negotiated by the Tories or by Labour.

Some of Hunt\u2019s supporters felt able to go rather further. Mark Garnier MP, former minister of international trade, who backs Hunt, replied when asked if he thought his man would benefit from Johnson\u2019s local difficulties: \u201cOn the one hand you think, this is bollocks, people have arguments. My wife and I have ding dongs every now and then like all couples - although the line \u2019get off my fucking laptop\u2019 does make you wonder if she was checking his browsing history (I\u2019m just putting that out there).The other side of this is that he has fucked up on the very first evening.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy good-natured instinct is that we would not want to capitalise on this, of course not. But you have to say this is the type of attention that Boris attracts. He has the capacity to be front page news for this kind of thing. Obviously I know Boris well, and I would be perfectly happy with him being prime minister, I just think Jeremy would be better. I don\u2019t want to get into an argy-bargy about his character. We want to win this on policy.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Saturday the pro-Johnson lobby was out in force, arguing that Johnson\u2019s and Symonds\u2019s neighbours who leaked the story of the row to the <em>Guardian</em> were politically motivated and that Tory members in the shires would see that the whole fuss was about nothing more than a red wine induced tiff, whipped up deliberately by \u201clefties\u201d.</p> \n<p>A Tory MP who does not back Johnson said he feared that, as usual, he would ride the story out and that his backers would somehow turn it to his advantage. \u201cIf Boris was not acceptable to Conservatives we would know by now. You can never be sure but I don\u2019t think a row with his partner will harm him when no end of far worse things have not.\u201d</p>",

But you have to say this is the type of attention that Boris attracts. He has the capacity to be front page news for this kind of thing. Obviously I know Boris well, and I would be perfectly happy with him being prime minister, I just think Jeremy would be better. I don\u2019t want to get into an argy-bargy about his character. We want to win this on policy.\u201d On Saturday the pro-Johnson lobby was out in force, arguing that Johnson\u2019s and Symonds\u2019s neighbours who leaked the story of the row to the Guardian were politically motivated and that Tory members in the shires would see that the whole fuss was about nothing more than a red wine induced tiff, whipped up deliberately by \u201clefties\u201d. A Tory MP who does not back Johnson said he feared that, as usual, he would ride the story out and that his backers would somehow turn it to his advantage. \u201cIf Boris was not acceptable to Conservatives we would know by now. You can never be sure but I don\u2019t think a row with his partner will harm him when no end of far worse things have not.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Super Eagles were forced to work hard for that by a valiant Burundian team. The debutants gave as good as they got in the first half, but Nigeria gradually found a higher groove in the second half. And their goal was a marvel, Ighalo producing a neat finish after a sumptuous backheeled pass from Aina. 90+3 min: A corner by Bigirimana is cleared out for another. He sends this one to the edge of the six-yard box, where Fiston arrives to power a header just over the bar! 90+2 min: Burundi certainly haven\u2019t given up. They\u2019re going full-gun for the equaliser, making Nigeria sweat in the final seconds ... Burundi substitution: Mohamed on, Berahino off. 90+1 min: Musa flies down the left but, as so often, makes a mess of the cross. 89 min: Fiston goes on a run towards the Nigerian box and makes a surprising amount of ground before opening fire ... with a pea-roller. 87 min: Ighalao makes a nice turn and then rattles off a shot from 25 yards. It hurtles over. 86 min: Akpeyi makes a meal of dealing with a well delivered corner, simply punching it into a crowd of players in front of him. One shot is blocked before Nigeria bundle the ball to safety. 85 min: Or maybe not! Fiston skedaddles down the left and into the box, and Nigeria have to strain to stop him, conceding a corner. 83 min: Nigeria are starting to look comfortable; Burundi look to have given their all. 81 min: Omeruo receiving treatment after a heavy fall. 78 min: After working so hard to take the lead, Nigeria almost give it away! Akpeyi flaps at a cross and drops it in front of a Berahino. But the striker is crowded out and Akpeyi exhales! That\u2019s how to make an impact! Moments after coming on Ighala breaks the deadlocks with a smart finish. But Aina played a big part in the goal with a break in-field from the left and a delicious backheeled pass, worthy of Ronaldinho! Ighalo ran on to it and, from an angle, guided it past the advancing keeper and into the net! Nigeria substitution: Ighalo on, Onuachu off. 72 min: Corner to Burundi after Akpeyi loses his bearings and makes a one-handed save that wasn\u2019t required, as the ball was heading way wide. The corner is badly delivered, like so many of the previous ones from both sides. 70 min: Chukwueze slaloms past two opponents and into the box, then sends a cross/shot looping over the bar. 69 min: Dinky one-touch play by Nigeria outside the Burundian box. They\u2019re finding their rhythm now and making Burundi strain hard. Will the pressure pay dividend? 67 min: Nigeria are starting to apply more pressure. They\u2019re penning Burundi back. 64 min: Amissi taps the ball back to Berahino at the corner of the box. Confronted by two defenders Berahino decides against an improbable shot and instead rolls it back to Fiston, who, with less composure, tonks the ball high and wide from distance. 63 min: A booking for Nahimana for a studs-up tackle on Ndidi. He won the ball but the technique was dicey. Ndidi sportingly tells the ref not to make a too big a deal of it but he shows a yellow card, all the same. 60 min: Lovely play by Iwobi to open up the play with a pair of clever one-touch passes. Then he releases Musa down the left and dashes into the box to join those waiting for a good delivery .... which Musa fails to provide, instead presenting the keeper with a gift. Burundi substitution: Kamsoba on for his debut, Mustafa off. Nigeria substitution: Musa on, Mikel off. That suggests a change of approach and, at least, an injection of mobility. 56 min: Aina flings in a throw from the left. Burundi win the header and then punt the ball clear. 54 min: Nigeria\u2019s hopes at the moment seem to hang on Burundi tiring or one of the Super Eagles conjuring a moment of magic. Neither looks likely. 52 min: Etebo flights a rare good setpiece delivery towards the back post. Omeruo powers a decent header just over the bar. 51 min: Bigirimana wins the ball yet again in midfield and suddenly Burundi have an opportunity to cut through a scattered Nigerian defender. But their passing lets them down and gets Nigeria off the hook. 50 min: Mikel wanders into an offside position, curtailing a Nigerian move that didn\u2019t really seem to be going anywhere anyway. 48 min: A dive by Fiston - a swallow dive, let\u2019s say - gives Burundi a freekick in a dangerous position on the left. Amissi fires it a low one under the two-man wall, and Akpeyi pushes it out for a corner. 46 min: Here we go again, as Whitesnake might put it. The newcomers have held their own against the Super Eagles and, indeed, had the better chances. This one could go either way, which is something not a lot of people were saying beforehand. The only real threat from Nigeria from out wide, where Iwobi and Chukwueze have been dangerous. But Burundi are no on top in midfield, where Bigirimana is running the show, and Amissi looks sharp up front. While Gernot Rohr tries to figure out what to do about all that, why not spend half-time reading this interesting piece by Nick Ames about the Burundi side. 44 min: Chukwueze\u2019s run down the right is brought to an undignified end by Duhayindayi. With players awaiting a delivery in the box, Chukwueze dabs an awful freekick straight to the first defender. 43 min: Freekick to Burundi from wide on the left. Bigirimana curls it in. Akpeyi punches it out. Nigeria substitution: Awaziem on, Shehu off. 41 min: Shehu is unable to continue. For the moment Nigeria are playing on with 10 men. 39 min: Shehu is down receiving treatment. While he explains what his problems is, Olivier Niyungeko gathers his players for a powwow - not to make any major adjustment, I\u2019ll wager, because his team have played cannily and competently so far. The game is as well balanced as the score suggests. 37 min: ay, ay, Burundi go close from a setpiece! Nsabiuma came up from the back to meet a freekick from the left, outjumping Ekong and sending a looping header over Akpeyi. It bounces of the top of the crossbar and out! 37 min: Mikel finds space to meet the incoming corner at the edge of the six-yard box but miscues his header, sending it way wide. 36 min: The increasingly influential Iwobi lets off a drive from 20 yards. Moussa makes a block at the expense of a corner. 34 min: Iwobi floats over a dangerous cross from the left. But a lack of movement from the men in the box meant it drifted across goal and out the other side of the area. 32 min: Bigirimana has been excellent in central midfield so far. He\u2019s winning lots of possession and using is well. This is a surprisingly even game. And the more it stays like that, the more Nigeria will feel pressure: they were expected to walk this. 31 min: Ndidi sends another long throw from the right to Onuachu. The big striker hold the ball up at the near post as he tries to create space for a shot. But he\u2019s crowded out, and Amissi completes the clearance with an acrobatic overhead kick. 29 min: Bigirimana goes for a goal with a freekick from way out. It\u2019s a tricky swirler, and Akpeyi find it mighty awkward but manages to bundle it away. 28 min: Etebo sweeps the ball wide to Aina on the left. The cross isn\u2019t good but Iwobi collects it and then spins beautifully past Mustafa before laying the ball back for Amissi. The shot flies way over from 16 yards. 25 min: Onuachu with a snapshot from 20 yards, ignoring Iwobi who is free to the left. Nahimana makes a comfortable save. 23 min: Shehu gives the ball away to Berahino in midfield and then runs into an opponent and gets a lucky freekick. The standard of refereeing has been high so far in this tournament but that decision was all wrong and ruined a potential break for Burundi. 21 min: Iwobi, who has not been much involved so far, feints his way between two defenders and look like he\u2019s going to unleash a shot from 20 yards ... but then he tries to slip off a dainty pass, and it\u2019s intercepted. 19 min: Burundi continue to prove bothersome. Onuachu comes back to help out at a corner, heading powerfully clear at the near post. Meanwhile, Alisdair Brooks, writing from Zamalek, Cairo, has responded to my query about the cost of attening these games. \u201cTicket prices for matches not involving the host nation were announced as EGP 100 (roughly GBP \u00a35) for Category 3, EGP 300 (roughly GBP \u00a315) for Category 2 and EGP 500 (roughly GBP \u00a325) for Category 1. As to why more locals have not turned up to watch these matches, it\u2019s because Egyptians are some of the most one-eyed patriots in world football. When Egypt are playing, the atmosphere will be electric. Other matches; not so much.\u201d 16 min: Bigirmana overhits a freekick, to the angst of his teammates. Burundi\u2019s deliveries - and defending - from setpieces are going to have be to spot-on because Nigeria are by far the bigger team. 13 min: Amissi makes a canny run into the Nigerian box and is rewarded with a beautiful clipped pass. His first touch is marvellous and his second pretty good, too, but Akpeyi makes a fine save to block the powerful shot from 12 yards. What a twist it would have been if Burundi had taken the lead! 12 min: A long throw-in from the right is flicked on by Mikel. Onuachu turns a header towards goal, bringing a good save from Nahimana. 9 min: Nigeria are having all of the ball but Burundi are well organised and aren\u2019t making it easy. For how long they can keep this up remains to be seen. 7 min: Chukwueze has started well. He pressures a defender into conceding a corner and then delivers it himself. Onuachu meets it at the near post but donks it over the bar. 5 min: After a period of probing by Nigeria, Chukueze darts in from the right wing, throws a couple of lollipops to distract defenders and then bangs off a decent shot from 16 yards. But Nsabiyuma makes a good block, taking the sting out of it. 3 min: Burundi have not come simply to contain: they are playing with two strikers - and they have just tried to pick out one of them with a cross into the box from the right. But Ekong rises above Fiston to head it away. 2 min: A hefty touch by Shehu enables Nahiman to nip in and take the ball off him. But Nigeria soon win it back and resume knocking it about. Burundi file back into a solid shape and prevent any easy openings. 1 min: Burundi kick off their first ever match in the finals of the Africa Cup of Nations ... The Super Eagles are turned out in magnificent green and white jerseys with that flourish of black Vs on the arms, while Burundi are wearing their not-quite-so-familiar deep red tops with white rings around the shoulder and, um, snowdrops across the abdomen. What I wouldn\u2019t do for subbuteo sets of these two teams. The stadium in Alexandria is sparsely populated, save for a smattering of fans from both countries clustered in the shade in one of the stands: just how much are organisers charging to get into these matches? Nigeria: Akpeyi; Shehu, Troost-Ekong, Omeruo, Aina; Ndidi, Etebo; Chukwueze, Mikel, Iwobi; Onuachu Subs: Ezenwa, Balogun, Musa, Ighalo, Onyekuru, Simon, Ogu, Awaziem, Osimhen, Uzoho Burundi: Nahimana; Moussa, Duhayindavyi, Nsabiyumva, Ngando; Bigirimana; Nahimana, Moustapha, Amissi; Berahino Fiston Subs: Sabumukama, Kamsoba, Kwizera, Nizigiyimana, Mavugo, Shabani, Ndikumana, Nshimirimana, Amissi, Nduwarugira, MacArthur Referee: B Camille (Seychelles) The Super Eagles\u2019 first match in the Africa Cup of Nations is always eagerly anticipated, especially after the three-times champions contrived to miss the last two editions. But no one has been looking forward to this game more than Burundi, who are appearing in the finals for the first time. This is a historic moment - can they produce a shock to go with it?",

You win the toss and bat and think you should make 300, then you see the nature of the pitch and think 260, 270. But you play a team like Afghanistan that has a lot of talent, and they make life difficult for you.</p> <p>\u201cI decided quickly that cross-batted shots weren\u2019t on on this pitch. So I played with a straight bat and that worked. We lost a lot of wickets to the horizontal bat. But when you\u2019re facing three wrist spinners on a pitch like this it\u2019s tough, and I thought Nabi also bowled outstandingly.</p> <p>\u201cIn the end the communication was to finish Bumrah off on 49, so Shami has enough runs to defend in the last over. All in all the bowling performance was outstanding. Shami was really good today, especially his first spell, he made the ball do more than anyone today. We selected a squad because we knew these guys were hungry, they wanted an opportunity.</p> <p>\u201cWhen things don\u2019t go your way you have to fight, and show character, and I think that\u2019s what we showed from this team.\u201d<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0e68808f081e872734ccd4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T17:44:34.772Z\">6.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Gulbadin</b>: \u201cWe played really well in the first innings, everybody knew we had a strong batting lineup, but credit goes to Bumrah, the way he bowled in the last few overs was superb.</p> <p>\u201cSpinners bowled really well according to the plans. We had another option, Rahmat Shah. India is a good side, credit goes to them. The total is not that much, but sometimes in the middle we need batsmen with a good score, like 80 or 100, not 30 or 40. Middle order batsmen should go longer and take responsibility. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m telling everyone, the last four games we lose badly, but the last two games we played really well, so that\u2019s a positive note for the team.\u201d<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0e671f8f082364d7cef41e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T17:37:07.541Z\">6.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bumrah speaks to Pommie Mbangwa about their strategy. \u201cSometimes when you run behind wickets, you don\u2019t get wickets.

Afghanistan fall short, but in reality they made life hard for themselves by not taking a more focused approach earlier in their batting innings. It should never have come down to the last over. <br></p> <p>But Afghanistan were sensational with the ball. They squeezed India all day with spin, gave very little away, and made sure none of the damaging Indian batsmen bar Kohli could go large or go quickly. They restricted India to 224 and gave themselves a chance. Six bowlers used, one to two wickets apiece, Mujeeb giving away 26 in ten overs, Nabi 33 in nine.<br></p> <p>Even 224 was likely to be tough with such a mismatch between quality of bowling attack and quality of batting lineup. But the partnerships kept coming: Gulbadin with Rahmat, to Hashmatullah, to Nabi with Najibullah, to Rashid. They got close, but they still haven\u2019t worked out how to pace a chase, and that starts with more confidence from the top.</p> <p>Shami took 4-40 with his hat-trick at the end, Bumrah 2-39 from 10, Chahal 2-36 and Kuldeep 0-39, with Pandya relatively expensive for 51 but took two key wickets.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b111cea73bb9dc74125fb88d7c8901fbc71825c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b111cea73bb9dc74125fb88d7c8901fbc71825c/0_0_4516_3040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"India\u2019s captain Virat Kohli (left) shakes hands with Afghanistan\u2019s Mujeeb Ur Rahman after victory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">India\u2019s captain Virat Kohli (left) shakes hands with Afghanistan\u2019s Mujeeb Ur Rahman after victory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T17:58:19.716Z\">at 6.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d0e65a78f080e828514d7b3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T17:31:59.360Z\">6.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hat-trick!

Shami is angry, so he bowls full pace now, short, and it\u2019s a fierce bouncer that Nabi gets nowhere near as he tries to pull while walking across. Then tangled up trying to flick past fine leg, walking across again, and instead gets a leg bye off the thigh pad. He backs away instead from the last ball and smacks the cut shot.

It also helps Afghanistan when Shami follows with a wide, and then another. One batsman pulls a single, the other steers one, both right and left-hander succeeding when Shami stays back of a length. Najibullah almost pops up a catch to midwicket from the fifth ball, with Shami right-arm over the wicket and in at his ribs, drawing a leading edge from a fend. But Chahal was just too deep to charge in enough. </p> <p>The equation tightens to 60 in 54. Can Afghanistan finish off a stunner? Will India\u2019s bowling do the job?

Not smashed, but good enough to get him four. Placement spot on. And when Shami reverts to the short ball, it goes just fractionally off line and is called wide for a leg-side infringement.

Gulbadin, spooked, has a huge swing at a full ball and misses it entirely, nearly losing his off stump. He also earlier in the over hit a full toss straight to midwicket and didn\u2019t score. He started the tournament batting at No8 and perhaps he should have stayed there. But with Mohammad Shahzad sent home injured, Gulbadin has promoted himself to fill that spot.</p> <p>Aditya writes in from Mumbai. \u201cWhen the West Indies won the World T20 in 2016, the only game they lost all tournament was against Afghanistan. Also, the only game the Afghans won in the entire group stage was against West Indies, the eventual champions. Afghanistan beating India today is all we need to lift the cup.

Then fuller, hitting the pad to provoke that DRS review. But somehow Hazratullah survives the over. Kohli isn\u2019t happy that they\u2019ve lost that review, he had a long conversation with the umpire I think asking why it wasn\u2019t umpire\u2019s call as to where it pitched, with such a fine margin.

But it doesn\u2019t look likely in the first over, as he swings and pokes and prods and misses Shami\u2019s bowling about four times.

Dhoni has just clogged up an end, forward defence back to spinners with seven overs to go and ended with a strike rate of about fifty. Not a word against him. The Sky Sports commentary team would be shredding England for a performance like this. Barely a word either for the fantastic bowling by the Afghans.\u201d I did hear some praise for the bowlers, but you\u2019re right about Dhoni getting a pass. For the real story, you\u2019ll just have to stick with the OBO.

In between, there are runs, but only five of them. So the two seamers end up with combined figures of 16-1-105-3, pricey but not toothless, and the four spinners with 34-0-117-5. All four of them bowled well on a surface that was deliciously slow and sticky, like a song by Marvin Gaye. </p> <p>Among the batsmen, Virat Kohli was in a league of his own, not so much reading the conditions as transcending them. His 67 came off only 63 deliveries, whereas nobody else got near a run a ball.

It\u2019s the strongest team in the World Cup so far against the weakest. But the last time India met Afghanistan, in Dubai last September, the result was\u2026 <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8532/scorecard/1153253/afghanistan-vs-india-5th-match-super-four-asia-cup-2018\">a tie</a>. On behalf of the neutrals, I\u2019m putting in a request for another one of those.</p> <p>A cup isn\u2019t a proper cup without a few upsets. England have done their best as hosts to make the party go with a swing, by stumbling to defeat against Pakistan and Sri Lanka. But those two games are the only ones in which a team from the top four has lost to one of the other six. Today, for the sake of the tournament, West Indies need to beat New Zealand, who have a 100pc record when they get onto the field. The same is true of India, but the chances of Afghanistan springing a shock do look a bit remote.</p> <p>For Virat Kohli, who missed the tie in Dubai, the question is whether to rest any of his big guns and give a World Cup debut to Rishabh Pant. Rest is hardly needed as India have only played three games so far, but England showed yesterday that it\u2019s unwise to keep letting the same batsmen do all the work, because then, when you\u2019re in a tight corner, the spare parts are liable to be rusty and brittle. Pant is a thrilling stroke-player who surely should have been in India\u2019s squad in the first place. He has it in him to be this team\u2019s Geoff Hurst.</p> <p>For Afghanistan, it\u2019s all about getting over their most recent experience, watching in disbelief as Eoin Morgan scored a century in sixes. \u201cYou\u2019re only as good as your last match,\u201d people are apt to say \u2013 and it\u2019s nonsense. A firework display is often followed by a fizzle, and vice-versa. Morgan went from hero to zero yesterday; Rashid Khan, his main victim on Tuesday, left nursing a bruised ego and figures of 9-0-110-0, is easily good enough to make the same journey in the opposite direction.</p> <p>The match is at Southampton, which tends to be a sporting surface with plenty of runs in it. Play starts at 10.30am BST, in about 35 minutes.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "So India move to third place on 9 points, with New Zealand on 9 but playing West Indies now. England at fourth have to play India, England and Australia in their next three games. That\u2019s enough for today \u2013 it\u2019s been a lot of fun. Until next time. Kohli speaks on satisfaction with the win. \u201cIt\u2019s right up there to be honest. You win the toss and bat and think you should make 300, then you see the nature of the pitch and think 260, 270. But you play a team like Afghanistan that has a lot of talent, and they make life difficult for you. \u201cI decided quickly that cross-batted shots weren\u2019t on on this pitch. So I played with a straight bat and that worked. We lost a lot of wickets to the horizontal bat. But when you\u2019re facing three wrist spinners on a pitch like this it\u2019s tough, and I thought Nabi also bowled outstandingly. \u201cIn the end the communication was to finish Bumrah off on 49, so Shami has enough runs to defend in the last over. All in all the bowling performance was outstanding. Shami was really good today, especially his first spell, he made the ball do more than anyone today. We selected a squad because we knew these guys were hungry, they wanted an opportunity. \u201cWhen things don\u2019t go your way you have to fight, and show character, and I think that\u2019s what we showed from this team.\u201d Gulbadin: \u201cWe played really well in the first innings, everybody knew we had a strong batting lineup, but credit goes to Bumrah, the way he bowled in the last few overs was superb. \u201cSpinners bowled really well according to the plans. We had another option, Rahmat Shah. India is a good side, credit goes to them. The total is not that much, but sometimes in the middle we need batsmen with a good score, like 80 or 100, not 30 or 40. Middle order batsmen should go longer and take responsibility. \u201cI\u2019m telling everyone, the last four games we lose badly, but the last two games we played really well, so that\u2019s a positive note for the team.\u201d Bumrah speaks to Pommie Mbangwa about their strategy. \u201cSometimes when you run behind wickets, you don\u2019t get wickets. So we wanted to make sure we made the run rate high, create that pressure, and that will bring wickets.\u201d It did. Two points for India as expected, but nothing else about this match went as expected. Afghanistan fall short, but in reality they made life hard for themselves by not taking a more focused approach earlier in their batting innings. It should never have come down to the last over. But Afghanistan were sensational with the ball. They squeezed India all day with spin, gave very little away, and made sure none of the damaging Indian batsmen bar Kohli could go large or go quickly. They restricted India to 224 and gave themselves a chance. Six bowlers used, one to two wickets apiece, Mujeeb giving away 26 in ten overs, Nabi 33 in nine. Even 224 was likely to be tough with such a mismatch between quality of bowling attack and quality of batting lineup. But the partnerships kept coming: Gulbadin with Rahmat, to Hashmatullah, to Nabi with Najibullah, to Rashid. They got close, but they still haven\u2019t worked out how to pace a chase, and that starts with more confidence from the top. Shami took 4-40 with his hat-trick at the end, Bumrah 2-39 from 10, Chahal 2-36 and Kuldeep 0-39, with Pandya relatively expensive for 51 but took two key wickets. Make that another famous World Cup 213! If anyone could hit two sixes in two balls it might as well have been Mujeeb, who can swing as hard as anyone. He does, but Shami is at the base of the stumps once again, and gets his reward. Three in three to win the match. On a hiding to nothing, the No 10 batsman walks out needing 12 off 3 balls, heaves and misses. Middle stump. That\u2019s the match! Nabi wanted a six, he got the full ball to hit, but Shami just cramped him for room enough, in at his pads even though Nabi had backed away. Hit it well but not quite enough at this big ground, and long-on takes it inside the rope moving across. 49.2 overs: Clouted out to deep midwicket, but Nabi says no to the single. Wants to finish this himself. 12 from 4. 49.1 overs: Clouted down the ground for four! Low full toss, driven straight, and it\u2019s 12 off 5 needed. 49th over: Afghanistan 209-7 (Nabi 48, Ikram 7) Yorker! Perfect from Bumrah, wide, and Nabi can\u2019t get it past backward point. Advances this time, slaps the low full toss wide of long-off, gets back for two. 19 needed from 10 balls. We\u2019re getting a change in bats. Four bats being brought down the stairs. Bumrah doesn\u2019t mind the wait. Nails another yorker, on middle, and Nabi drives for one. 18 from 9. Ikram slaps a low full toss straight to short midwicket on the bounce. Dot ball. Nabi gives him advice. Another perfect one, and Ikram backs away and gets it to point, for one. 17 from 7. Yorker! Perfection! 16 from the last over needed. 48th over: Afghanistan 204-7 (Nabi 44, Ikram 6) Well. The overturned review comes from the first ball, and a subsequent single is disallowed because the ball is dead once there\u2019s a review. Nabi gets a single next ball, but Ikram is tied down for a couple, then fends a short ball into the ground, then gets a high bouncer that isn\u2019t called as a wide. Finally he lines up the last ball, pulling it away for two. Nabi gets strike for the next over. He needs 21 from 12. \u201cOk seriously,\u201d writes Sandile Xaso, \u201care the commentators of this World Cup not allowed to criticize India\u2019s performance or their players? I know the ICC is no completely in thrall to the commercial king that is the BCCI but it\u2019s getting a bit embarrassing. The game has been gripping and enjoyable though.\u201d It sure has. I doubt there are directives as such, but those who work a lot on India matches, there\u2019s probably some element of knowing on which side your bread is buttered. It would be hard for there not to be any influence. Nabi is given lbw. I think that\u2019s hit him outside the line? He was striding forward at Shami and missed a swing across the line. No edge on it, says the technology. And it\u2019s outside the line! Overturned. Nabi survives. 47th over: Afghanistan 201-7 (Nabi 43, Ikram 4) Should have been a run out! Ikram squeezed out a yorker and ran, panicked. Pandya at backward square had all the time in the world, with Nabi well short of his ground, but missed. And Nabi doesn\u2019t miss the next one! Short, pulled, six! Up into the stands. The 200 comes up. They need 25 to win. Yorker from Bumrah, and Nabi can\u2019t make contact. Then again, perfect, and Nabi can only dig. Last ball, needs a single. Gets it! Drives the wider one to deep point. Breathe in. Breathe out. 24 from 18. 46th over: Afghanistan 193-7 (Nabi 36, Ikram 3) Rashid started the over with a fierce reverse sweep for four, then fell. Ikram Ali Khil is the Afghan keeper, and he gets going immediately by sweeping a brace and then a single. They need 32 from 24, and they need Nabi on strike. Chahal gets through! That\u2019s huge. Rashid Khan can hit big, and he\u2019d just started to do so. But Dhoni is the best in the business at stumpings, and Chahal lured Rashid into a drive, then dipped the ball and turned it past him. Rashid didn\u2019t advance but his back foot was dragged out, and that\u2019s all it takes. 45th over: Afghanistan 185-6 (Nabi 35, Rashid 10) What a shot! The TV commentators are already calling this an Indian win, which seems a bit premature when Nabi walks at Shami and drives him over extra cover for four to start the over. He jams a single, then Rashid plays a forehand down the ground for one. Shami is angry, so he bowls full pace now, short, and it\u2019s a fierce bouncer that Nabi gets nowhere near as he tries to pull while walking across. Then tangled up trying to flick past fine leg, walking across again, and instead gets a leg bye off the thigh pad. He backs away instead from the last ball and smacks the cut shot. Jadhav in the deep doesn\u2019t field it cleanly, but dives after the ricochet and pulls it back inches from the rope, but concedes a second run. Nine from the over. 40 from 30. \u201cThis game and yesterday\u2019s feel like a return to proper old school ODI cricket,\u201d writes Brian Withington. \u201cChasing 230 and struggling to keep up with the tricky run rate, never mind retaining wickets. Where\u2019s Clive Radley when you need him?\u201d Who is the Afghan Geoff Marsh? The people want to know. 44th over: Afghanistan 176-6 (Nabi 30, Rashid 7) Here\u2019s Bumrah, the man who could finish this off. Two length balls, where Rashid finds the field, then a slow yorker on leg stump squeezed for a single. Nabi hacks another to mid-on. Rashid backs away and slaps the short ball through cover, and there is one of those twos, with a quick turn and return. Then a walking pull shot, straight to Kohli at midwicket, and Nabi almost gets run out turning back to the non-striker\u2019s end. 49 in 36 is the equation. 43rd over: Afghanistan 172-6 (Nabi 29, Rashid 4) Chahal gets away with an over there really. Twice Rashid Khan was cutting, but only got a couple of runs. Ditto his sweep shot. Boundaries were on offer once or twice there. Afghanistan are starting to need some, or at least to make ones into twos. 53 from 42. 42nd over: Afghanistan 169-6 (Nabi 29, Rashid 1) So it\u2019s Rashid Khan ahead of the keeper. He made 27 from 11 against Australia \u2013 that would be very handy now. He starts with a single, then Nabi dabs a couple to fine third man. Four wickets in hand. 56 needed from the last eight overs. There it goes! You just felt it was inevitable a wicket would fall. Not to anything amazing, but Pandya bowls a slower ball, Najibullah is trying to knock it away for one, but was through the shot early. Leading edge to midwicket, straight to Chahal this time. Now it\u2019s tough for Afghanistan. 41st over: Afghanistan 165-5 (Nabi 26, Najibullah 21) That helps! Shami bowls on the pads and Najibullah plays a lovely whip, away through midwicket. It slows up towards the rope but rolls into it eventually. It also helps Afghanistan when Shami follows with a wide, and then another. One batsman pulls a single, the other steers one, both right and left-hander succeeding when Shami stays back of a length. Najibullah almost pops up a catch to midwicket from the fifth ball, with Shami right-arm over the wicket and in at his ribs, drawing a leading edge from a fend. But Chahal was just too deep to charge in enough. The equation tightens to 60 in 54. Can Afghanistan finish off a stunner? Will India\u2019s bowling do the job? Bumrah has three overs left, which will be key. 40th over: Afghanistan 157-5 (Nabi 25, Najibullah 16) Pace at both ends with Pandya and Shami. The former has Nabi bolt for a single from a straight drive, then Najibullah calls for a fast second after chipping through the off-side. Good to see some urgency between the wickets, unlike earlier. Najibullah hits the same region for two more, better timed and along the ground this time, then cuts one. So the over yields six runs. They need 68 in 60. 39th over: Afghanistan 151-5 (Nabi 24, Najibullah 11) Shami is bowling superbly today. Tight on off stump, tough length, so even when Najibullah hits is crisply it\u2019s straight to point. But mid-off is up inside the circle, so when Shami gets just a touch fuller, Najibullah rolls the dice. Stands up and drives off the back foot, over the top! Not smashed, but good enough to get him four. Placement spot on. And when Shami reverts to the short ball, it goes just fractionally off line and is called wide for a leg-side infringement. Najibullah flicks a single, Nabi drives one. Eight from the over. The equation is 74 in 66. 38th over: Afghanistan 143-5 (Nabi 22, Najibullah 6) Kuldeep carries on. Nabi takes a couple of singles. Najibullah wants to get moving, tries the reverse sweep again, misses out completely. Survives an appeal as well. They\u2019re just not able to get enough away at the moment, Afghanistan. 83 needed off 72 now. 37th over: Afghanistan 140-5 (Nabi 20, Najibullah 5) Shami comes back and he is on the money immediately. Pace, in at off stump, and Nabi defends and tries to find where the ball has gone and realises it\u2019s right at his feet, nearly squirming past his pad. Then Shami is bowling bouncers, sharp ones, forcing dot balls, forcing fends. One of them yields two runs. Three from the over. 36th over: Afghanistan 137-5 (Nabi 19, Najibullah 3) Kuldeep will bowl now, spin rather than pace. Najibullah Zadran is the new man in. Can bat. Nabi plays a little sweep for a couple, with the spin, then nudges one. Najibullah, left-hander facing left-armer, reverse-sweeps his first ball, striking it nicely for two. A couple more singles follow. They need 88 from 84. 35th over: Afghanistan 130-5 (Nabi 15) Last ball of the over, Chahal gets his man! Nabi had already boshed four through midwicket on the sweep to start the over. Asghar tried to end it by walloping the same way, but he only opens up the gate for Chahal to dart through and take the stumps. 34th over: Afghanistan 125-4 (Asghar 8, Nabi 10) Four singles from Hardik Pandya, just knocked around or pushed straight, as the holding pattern is maintained. 33rd over: Afghanistan 121-4 (Asghar 6, Nabi 8) Surely time for Shami rather than Pandya with the high chance of ropey shots against pace? Chahal bowls spin, and they only get two singles from five, the pressure building. But Chahal throws the last ball out wide and Nabi plays a calm shot rather than a huge swipe, slicing the cut shot along the ground behind point. Four runs. 104 needed from 102. 32nd over: Afghanistan 116-4 (Asghar 5, Nabi 4) Pandya again, kicking off with a wide. Asghar cuts a single, Nabi pulls a double. Then there\u2019s a horror shot as Nabi tries to smash over cover, but that ball was never full enough for the stroke and it takes a huge outside edge. Loops high over backward point, but two fielders converge and the man running out puts off the man running in. Neither of them go for it, and it drops between them. Two runs and a massive slice of luck for Nabi. \u201cAny clues on why Kohli hasn\u2019t been turning to Kedar Jadhav as extensively in the World Cup as he was in their tour of Australia and NZ?\u201d asks Kanishk Srinivasan. \u201cHe\u2019s unorthodox, but I feel like he could be a great go-to as a street smart, blink-and-you-miss-it bowler who has the goods to take key wickets every now and then.\u201d I\u2019m guessing that the aforementioned tours were a chance to let Jadhav bowl a fair bit, as with Shankar, to see if he could handle it and to let him get settled in that role. Then he can be called upon if needed. But here today, pace has got the rewards, especially the short ball. Whereas the spinners have been handled, even if they haven\u2019t been expensive. 31st over: Afghanistan 110-4 (Asghar 4, Nabi 0) Chahal is doing a fine job in the deep, belting around again at fine leg to tumble and save Asghar\u2019s leg glance from Bumrah. Two runs. A short ball makes Asghar flinch, but he\u2019s able to play it down into the pitch. Bumrah is getting up towards 150 kilometres per hour. But his yorker doesn\u2019t get through Asghar, and his bouncer gets pulled for one. Still taking on the short ball. 115 needed from 114 balls. Here comes the tipping point. 30th over: Afghanistan 107-4 (Asghar 1, Nabi 0) Asghar Afghan, formerly Asghar Stanikzai, gets moving immediately, driving Pandya to deep cover for one. But Nabi wants to take his time, resisting the wide ball, defending the straight ball. 29th over: Afghanistan 106-4 (Asghar 0) Last ball of the over takes the second wicket, and Mohammad Nabi will be out next. So it\u2019s a case of starting from scratch for him and Asghar Afghan. They need 118 from 126. Treat it as an easy T20 total with a couple of batsmen missing? Two in three balls! The batsmen crossed when Rahmat was out, so Bumrah has got both set batsmen in an over. Short and at the body, Rahmat was hopping as he played it, no control, and it just popped off the splice far enough for Bumrah to run forward in his follow-through and dive. There\u2019s that breakthrough. Another half-hearted pull shot, another top edge. Another ball that might drop short, but Chahal charges in from the deep to take it diving forward. Now the heat will start to turn up for Afghanistan. 28th over: Afghanistan 106-2 (Rahmat 36, Hashmatullah 21) Once again Hashmatullah can\u2019t get spin bowling away. He top-edges Kuldeep for a lucky couple of runs, but swings and misses well outside off stump a couple of times. One of those might have been a wide as it turned away, left-arm wrist spinner to left-handed batsman, but it probably turned more after it passed the batsman. 27th over: Afghanistan 104-2 (Rahmat 36, Hashmatullah 19) Bumrah returns, with Kohli starting to need a wicket now. I still firmly believe he\u2019ll get one soon, and Afghanistan will fall over. But dreams must live while they can. Kohli wrestles with the classic captain\u2019s angst about whether to have a slip, and decides not to. So Rahmat deliberately edges through slip, hoping for four but third man is fine enough to keep it to one. Hashmatullah drives a single for Afghanistan\u2019s hundred. Rahmat gets a tiny top edge to a slower ball but it falls short of Dhoni. Interesting whether they umpire would have given that if that catch had been taken. Rahmat takes a couple of runs next ball thanks to a misfield at backward point, then has two runs saved when he pulls to fine leg and Kuldeep dives well. Six from the over 26th over: Afghanistan 98-2 (Rahmat 31, Hashmatullah 18) This is better stuff from the batting pair. A couple of singles from Kuldeep to start the over, just keeping things moving. Then with the right and left handers swapping over, Kuldeep doesn\u2019t get his line quite right and drops short. Rahmat has the composure to go back and pull, top shot, hitting hard and into the gap at midwicket. Two sweepers converge but it pings between them, the placement spot on. 127 to win from 144. 25th over: Afghanistan 91-2 (Rahmat 25, Hashmatullah 17) That\u2019s the second time today that Dhoni has given it the big ones for a stumping appeal when the foot never left the crease. Hashmatullah was always safe. Strange stuff. This comes just after the batsman carves away a cut shot backward of point from Chahal, splitting the field for four. 24th over: Afghanistan 87-2 (Rahmat 25, Hashmatullah 13) Lots of air for Kuldeep Yadav, he\u2019ll keep challenging the batsmen all day long. They pick up three singles. Afghanistan need 138 from 156 balls, that gap narrowing for India all the time. 23rd over: Afghanistan 84-2 (Rahmat 24, Hashmatullah 11) That\u2019s another shabby over from Afghanistan. Chahal lands his leg-breaks nicely, but Hashmatullah just blocks out four of them, no thought of angling the bat to find a run. Then when he finally whips a full ball to the deep, they stroll one run instead of hustling for two. You can\u2019t afford more overs that go for one run. 22nd over: Afghanistan 83-2 (Rahmat 24, Hashmatullah 10) Thank you very much, says Hashratullah, as Kuldeep Yadav bowls the kind of bad ball that will come along eventually. Dragged down short, and the batsman is good enough to rock back and smash it through midwicket for four. A few singles make it seven from the over. They need five per over and they\u2019re still at less than four. 21st over: Afghanistan 76-2 (Rahmat 23, Hashmatullah 4) Pandya is going full aggression. The field is mostly in, with men back on the hook. So Pandya keeps using that short ball, and no one can do anything with it. Finally, to end the over, he goes full. Somehow Rahmat Shah anticipates that, coming down the wicket and driving through cover for four! Glorious shot, into the gap beautifully. 20th over: Afghanistan 71-2 (Rahmat 19, Hashmatullah 3) A couple of singles down the ground from Kuldeep, then Rahmat cuts the ball hard but Pandya at cover dives to stop it. At least some intent in that stroke. Rahmat settles for another single. Hashmatullah gets an inside edge onto his pad, misreading the turn, then sweeps a fuller ball for one. There\u2019s your four from the over. 19th over: Afghanistan 67-2 (Rahmat 17, Hashmatullah 1) Ouch! Pandya hits Hashmatullah in the ribs with the last ball of this over. The bowler got annoyed because the batsman bailed out before the ball was bowled. So Pandya went back and banged it in. It didn\u2019t get up, but the batsman was expecting more height, and couldn\u2019t protect his own body. That\u2019s a maiden. This pair are playing into India\u2019s hands, doing this. They have a long batting line-up today, but they have to score at a reasonable clip so there\u2019s less pressure on whoever comes in next. Just four an over or so. 18th over: Afghanistan 67-2 (Rahmat 17, Hashmatullah 1) The new batsman plays to type, blotting out an over of Kuldeep Yadav before working a single. His team now needs 158 from 192. They don\u2019t want to let that climb up past a run a ball, they have to keep finding singles and moving things along. Romeo emails in. \u201cI don\u2019t think it can be said often enough, but the last time these two sides played each other it was a tie. Genius experts on TV seem to tell Afghanistan how to play as if they were children. A lot of respect is required from commentators of all sorts, as is knowledge and understanding.\u201d Not just tying with India, but Afghanistan beat Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, and ran Pakistan to the second-last over from memory, in that Asia Cup. 17th over: Afghanistan 66-1 (Rahmat 17, Hashmatullah 0) The TV broadcast is showing Dwayne Leverock\u2019s catch against India as part of a Great World Cup Moments kind of series, which is a particular irony given that the wealthiest boards in cricket have ensured that smaller teams never got the chance to play in this World Cup. Afghanistan barely had a team back in 2007, and here they are now. Well, that was unnecessary from the captain Gulbadin. He and Rahmat were comfortably scoring with the glide to third man, the cut shot. They didn\u2019t need anything big. Hashmatullah Shahidi is another sensible cautious type of batsman, and he could be just the one to combine with Rahmat Shah. The short ball does it! Pandya comes back after taking some tap earlier, perhaps just to help the spinners swap ends, but he gets rewarded. Gulbadin can\u2019t resist the pull but only gets a high top edge to deep square leg. 16th over: Afghanistan 61-1 (Gulbadin 26, Rahmat 13) Same pattern, as Gulbadin gets an early single, and there\u2019s a dot ball as Rahmat misses a sweep and Dhoni convinces the umpire to go upstairs and check a stumping. The back foot never moved. Rahmat finally gets off strike with a drive to long-off. With that man back, Gulbadin gets away with a mistimed loft that bounces in that direction for one more. Then a gorgeous delivery from Kuldeep to end the over \u2013 I think that was his wrong \u2018un, and it zipped past the outside edge of the right-handed Gulbadin and so nearly takes the off stump. Drinks. 15th over: Afghanistan 57-1 (Gulbadin 24, Rahmat 11) That\u2019s a couple of times that Rahmat has missed out now. He\u2019s getting marooned against these spinners, and even when Chahal bowls a filthy full toss to end this over, Rahmat smears it along the ground straight to mid-on. That after Gulbadin almost feathered a cut shot behind. One run from each of the last three overs, all to Gulbadin, and Rahmat has faced 13 scoreless deliveries. 168 needed from 35 overs. 14th over: Afghanistan 56-1 (Gulbadin 23, Rahmat 11) Double spin now. Kuldeep Yadav comes on with his left-arm wristies. Gulbadin goes after him immediately, dropping back to pull hard with the turn out to deep midwicket. One run to the boundary rider, and that\u2019s all again as Rahmat takes his time against the new bowler, only advancing once but yorking himself on that occasion. 13th over: Afghanistan 55-1 (Gulbadin 22, Rahmat 11) Gulbadin looks much more comfortable now, driving a single first ball. Rahmat gets tied down by Chahal though, frustrated when he skips down to play a big cover drive but hits it straight to Kohli on the bounce. Kohli throws at the stumps and hits Rahat in the back, and the \u201cOh no!\u201d expression on Kohli\u2019s face is priceless. He apologises. Rohit Sharma comes up to pat the batsman on the bruise and make sure all is well. One run from the over. A reminder that Sri Lanka made only 201 in Cardiff but bowled out Afghanistan for 152. This sort of total is not remotely a stroll, especially in these tricky conditions. 12th over: Afghanistan 54-1 (Gulbadin 21, Rahmat 11) Pandya is the weak link in the bowling, and here he goes. A dodgy single squeezed from Rahmat past the stumps, but then a clipped brace for Gulbadin, a thwacked four from a length ball, and a meaty pull for four again. Mid-on drops back, midwicket comes close. Gulbadin taps square to keep the strike. The fifty is up. 171 more required, at 4.5 an over. Afghanistan are scoring at... 4.5 an over. 11th over: Afghanistan 42-1 (Gulbadin 10, Rahmat 10) Shot! Rahmat leans back to Chahal and smacks him over midwicket! That man is inside the circle, and this pull shot cleared him easily. Long-on comes around to try to save, but his trailing foot is touching the rope. Again that was sloppy running from Afghanistan, they would only have got two if that had been saved, where it should have been three. Instead they get four. And then Rahmat skips down again, confidently, to drive a single from the leg-spinner. That part of his game I like a lot. Jason, I\u2019ve got another American cricket lover for you. You and Aaron can start a support group. 10th over: Afghanistan 37-1 (Gulbadin 10, Rahmat 5) Pandya comes on early as well, Kohli looking to get his all-rounder into the game. Rahmat plays the simple glide again, Gulbadin skews a ball towards midwicket but it bounces short. Pandya sees weakness and tries a bouncer, but it goes wild and clears Dhoni for four. Wides, not byes, so the keeper won\u2019t be punished for that one. Then a couple more flicked behind square leg from Gulbadin \u2013 it should have been three but they were expecting it to make the boundary. 9th over: Afghanistan 29-1 (Gulbadin 8, Rahmat 4) Spin starts early. Yuzvendra Chahal\u2019s leg-breaks to begin with. He\u2019s not afraid to flight the ball immediately, and Rahmat Shah isn\u2019t afraid to come down the pitch for a single immediately. One of three collected from the over. 8th over: Afghanistan 26-1 (Gulbadin 7, Rahmat 2) Immediately things look calmer with Rahmat Shah out there, as he just opens the face and runs a Bumrah delivery to third man for one. Gulbadin clips through midwicket from a fuller length and picks up three, then Rahmat is clipped on the back of his shoulder as he tries to duck a short ball that didn\u2019t get up too high. Gets a leg bye for his trouble. \u201cGood day!\u201d writes Jason Cammarata. \u201cAmerican cricket fan here (we exist, though I\u2019ve yet to meet another who is native born) just expressing my thanks for your wonderful and witty coverage. My best friend is from Bangladesh, and I was lucky enough to be in Dhaka when the Tigers upended India in 2007. I can still smell the burning trash and fireworks from the street celebrations, which the caretaker government turned a blind eye to as they were giddy as the rest of us. Since then I\u2019ve been under the game\u2019s spell, and obviously rooting for the Tigers... and for Afghanistan to pull off a similar miracle today.\u201d 7th over: Afghanistan 21-1 (Gulbadin 4, Rahmat 1) The ball before he gets out, Hazratullah just works a straight ball away to midwicket and comes back for a well-run two. The next, he shoots for the moon and like most such attempts, he misses. He\u2019ll score more runs with the former method than the latter, and his team don\u2019t need that many today. Very poor cricket. In comes Rahmat Shah, probably Afghanistan\u2019s most accomplished long-innings type of batsman. He\u2019s got a few hundreds in this format, and they need something near enough to that from him today. There it goes! It has looked inevitable since the start. Shami has been monstering Hazratullah outside off stump. So when he finally bowls straighter, Hazratullah goes for broke. He really only has one shot, which is over midwicket. And he tries that to the length ball, but Shami\u2019s pace is too much. The batsman misses and loses his stumps. That\u2019ll make the bails come off. 6th over: Afghanistan 18-0 (Hazratullah 8, Gulbadin 4) Was that the dook? Half duck, half hook, as Gulbadin tries to bail out of his chosen shot halfway through Bumrah\u2019s short ball. It takes a thick top edge and lobs back near the bowler, but not quite close enough. Gulbadin, spooked, has a huge swing at a full ball and misses it entirely, nearly losing his off stump. He also earlier in the over hit a full toss straight to midwicket and didn\u2019t score. He started the tournament batting at No8 and perhaps he should have stayed there. But with Mohammad Shahzad sent home injured, Gulbadin has promoted himself to fill that spot. Aditya writes in from Mumbai. \u201cWhen the West Indies won the World T20 in 2016, the only game they lost all tournament was against Afghanistan. Also, the only game the Afghans won in the entire group stage was against West Indies, the eventual champions. Afghanistan beating India today is all we need to lift the cup. Surely history will repeat itself. Just saying.\u201d It\u2019s only logical. 5th over: Afghanistan 16-0 (Hazratullah 8, Gulbadin 2) Hazratullah gets off strike first ball to Shami, which is probably a relief for Afghanistan. Just nudges to leg. Gulbadin tries to hook a short ball but misses. He picks up two leg byes from a ball going well down leg. They\u2019re unconvincing but they\u2019re not out, these two, and that\u2019s all that really matters for the time being. See out these dangerous overs. 4th over: Afghanistan 12-0 (Hazratullah 7, Gulbadin 1) The Afghan skipper Gulbadin gets off the mark by punching a single to cover. He might want to spare his young teammate the bowling though, because he\u2019s almost getting out every ball now. Feeling for Bumrah outside off and missing. Feeling again and edging! Past slip! Kohli has two in, and that goes through third slip for four. Then another grope at thin air. And finally managing a mistimed punch to cover to get off strike, before Gulbadin is squared up from the last ball and nearly nicks. This is some exhibition of opening bowling in tandem. 3rd over: Afghanistan 6-0 (Hazratullah 2, Gulbadin 0) I don\u2019t think this one-on-one is going to last long. Hazratullah aims another booming cut at Shami but misses. Then doesn\u2019t even get the chance to play a shot, as Shami zings one off the seam that cuts away and keeps climbing from a decent length. Then fuller, hitting the pad to provoke that DRS review. But somehow Hazratullah survives the over. Kohli isn\u2019t happy that they\u2019ve lost that review, he had a long conversation with the umpire I think asking why it wasn\u2019t umpire\u2019s call as to where it pitched, with such a fine margin. Well, if it\u2019s missing that zone, I guess it\u2019s missing. Stand by. Shami wanted it desperately, he appealed backwards all the way down the pitch. Kohli asked the bowler, but knew bowlers aren\u2019t objective. Dhoni gave supporting evidence so Kohli goes for it. And it\u2019s missing the inside edge, hitting in front of middle, stone dead... except that Shami was over the wicket to a left-hander, and the ball pitched a couple of millimetres outside leg stump. Not out, and India lost their review. 2nd over: Afghanistan 6-0 (Hazratullah 2, Gulbadin 0) There\u2019s a bonus! Bumrah bowls a beauty that cuts back in and saws Hazratullah in half. But it goes over the stumps, bounces in front of Dhoni, and the keeper can\u2019t stop it rolling away for four byes. Bumrah follows with a low full toss, just missing the yorker, and Hazratullah squeezes it to backwards square for one run to the sweeper. 1st over: Afghanistan 1-0 (Hazratullah 1, Gulbadin 0) And those aren\u2019t good early signs for Afghanistan. No ability to time the ball off this slow surface. Hazratullah is the trump card for the Afghans, if he can smash a quick fifty in the way he can, and get them a headstart on this chase so the others can grind out the rest. But it doesn\u2019t look likely in the first over, as he swings and pokes and prods and misses Shami\u2019s bowling about four times. Only makes contact when he fends a short ball, and when he reaches for a single to third man. Hello all. Thanks Tim. I can\u2019t believe I get the pleasure of logging Afghanistan\u2019s glorious victory over India through the next few hours. Yeah, nah. It won\u2019t be as easy at that. India have a sensational spin duo, and I suspect even this modest-seeming total will be a bridge too far for Afghanistan\u2019s batting. But they\u2019ve given themselves a chance, a great chance, and who can ask for more than that? Direct your correspondence my way, please and thank-ya. Tim has a show to get to. Over lunch, here\u2019s a beef from Jonny Heyhoe. \u201cAnyone else tired of the constant sycophancy towards India\u2019s players by pretty much anyone on commentary?\u201d he wonders. \u201cWhenever I watch them there\u2019s constant brown-nosing, everything is brilliant and no criticism is ever voiced. Dhoni has just clogged up an end, forward defence back to spinners with seven overs to go and ended with a strike rate of about fifty. Not a word against him. The Sky Sports commentary team would be shredding England for a performance like this. Barely a word either for the fantastic bowling by the Afghans.\u201d I did hear some praise for the bowlers, but you\u2019re right about Dhoni getting a pass. For the real story, you\u2019ll just have to stick with the OBO. And with that, it\u2019s over to the award-winning Geoff Lemon. Thanks for your company and here\u2019s to a glorious win for Afghanistan. 50th over: India 224-8 (Kuldeep 1, Bumrah 1) Gulbadin sticks with seam \u2013 I can almost hear him muttering \u201cTold you so!\u201d \u2013 and it pays off as his slower ball twice brings a wicket. In between, there are runs, but only five of them. So the two seamers end up with combined figures of 16-1-105-3, pricey but not toothless, and the four spinners with 34-0-117-5. All four of them bowled well on a surface that was deliciously slow and sticky, like a song by Marvin Gaye. Among the batsmen, Virat Kohli was in a league of his own, not so much reading the conditions as transcending them. His 67 came off only 63 deliveries, whereas nobody else got near a run a ball. But he will be fretting a bit now, and asking himself how many part-time spinners he can rustle up as reinforcements for Kuldeep and Chahal. Leaving out Jadeja could prove expensive. Another one! Slower ball again, and Jadhav manages to hit it, but only straight to extra cover. Well, Gulbadin is a seamer but this ball is a spinner \u2013 a slower ball that hits leg stump some time after Mohammad Shami goes for a big mow. 49th over: India 219-6 (Jadhav 49, Shami 1) So well bowled Aftab, who goes for a respectable six off the over. I take it all back. In a stroke of genius, Gulbadin tries seam at both ends. Aftab bowls a bouncer that would be a wide if Pandya wasn\u2019t set on flicking it over the keeper. At last, we have a wicket falling to a seamer. And we\u2019re down to that tail! 48th over: India 213-5 (Jadhav 47, Pandya 4) Gulbadin seems to be a Brexit supporter: he sees something going abysmally and persists with it anyway. He brings himself back on, which is like Dominic Raab thinking he should be prime minister. His over goes for seven, not too bad, but worse than almost any over of spin today. 47th over: India 206-5 (Jadhav 43, Pandya 1) Rashid Khan\u2019s final over brings a near-stumping, as Jadhav just gets his foot back in, and a near-LBW, as you\u2019ve heard, and only one run. He finishes with 10-0-38-1, which is a triumph for him after his Eoin mauling, and also a nice example, like Morgan\u2019s innings yesterday, of cricket being a great leveller. HawkEye says it was missing leg. Good review, initiated by Pandya. To Rashid Khan... clipping leg I reckon. 46th over: India 205-5 (Jadhav 43, Pandya 1) After seeing spin do the trick again, Gulbadin naturally goes back to seam. On comes Aftab and Jadhav celebrates by flicking him for four, then one-handing him for six, as Rashid, too, gets one hand to it, just inside the fence at long-on. 45th over: India 194-5 (Jadhav 32, Pandya 1) So, a big scalp for Rashid, and a rare dismissal for Dhoni \u2013 the first time he\u2019s been stumped in eight years, apparently. The good news for India is that it gives Pandya time to pepper the crowd. Dhoni goes! He finally loses patience, giving Rashid the charge. Ikram pulls off a crisp stumping and celebrates by windmilling his arm like Pete Townshend. 44th over: India 192-4 (Dhoni 28, Jadhav 31) Mujeeb returns, and so does sobriety. And so Mujeeb, the youngest man in the tournament, the only one born this century, finishes with the quietly admirable figures of 10-0-26-1. \u201cAfternoon, Tim.\u201d Afternoon, Phil Sawyer. \u201cMorning de Lisle (41st over) sounds like a particularly fancy breakfast yoghurt. Or possibly an exotic dancer of young Robinson\u2019s acquaintance.\u201d This is a wild guess, but I\u2019m not sure anyone ever said anything like that to Neville Cardus. 43rd over: India 190-4 (Dhoni 27, Jadhav 30) Noooo! Gulbadin brings back Aftab Alam, whose long hop is soon sitting up, begging to be hit. Jadhav helps it on its way and almost gets the first six of the day. Dhoni follows suit with a lofted cover drive. Eleven off the over. Still no sixes, but the partnership has passed fifty \u2013 55 off 77 balls. 42nd over: India 179-4 (Dhoni 23, Jadhav 23) Gulbadin takes himself off, quite rightly, and brings back Mujeeb, who concedes only a single and a wide. As at the start, we are watching two different games at once here. Here\u2019s Peter Salmon. \u201cExtremely envious of Matt Dony [34th over], as I\u2019m sure we all are. I have the misfortune of sharing a name with a man who at one stage oversaw the commissioning of all BBC productions (he is the first million Google results, I\u2019m on about page 256). As I work in the literary field, I am used to meeting writers who would pound across the room to meet me and make a pitch, only to gradually fade back into the crowd as I explained the truth. Got to the point where I ended up telling people I actually was that Peter Salmon. Got some great story ideas out of it. I wonder if our M Dony is ever tempted to do the same?\u201d 41st over: India 177-4 (Dhoni 23, Jadhav 22) Only two off Rashid Khan\u2019s over. This sticky wicket has nursed him back to form. \u201cMorning de Lisle, morning everybody (well, it\u2019s morning here in Chicago),\u201d says Josh Robinson. \u201cI see from the fact that Lemon is slated to take over from you when you\u2019re done that you\u2019re once again avoiding being seen in the same place at the same time.\u201d 40th over: India 175-4 (Dhoni 22, Jadhav 21) For most of his innings, Dhoni has been doing just what Gulbadin would like. Now Gulbadin returns the compliment by keeping himself on when he doesn\u2019t need to. Dhoni cashes in with a pull for four, and Gulbadin\u2019s spell has gone for 16 off two overs. Has he miscounted, or merely miscalculated? 39th over: India 166-4 (Dhoni 16, Jadhav 18) Back to spin as Rashid continues. Just the three singles off the over. And there\u2019s more from Brian Withington. \u201cMy head is spinning with the news that Abhijato Sensarma and OB Jato are one and the same,\u201d he says. \u201cNever mind Jane Austen, are we all characters in an OBO-centric holographic universe? Are you, Geoff Lemon and Rob Smyth truly \u2018Guardians of the Universe\u2019 \u2013 or all the same being?\u201d Ha. You can decide for yourself later, when Geoff de Lemon takes over. 38th over: India 163-4 (Dhoni 14, Jadhav 17) Gulbadin only has to dish up one more over of seam, and he takes the curious decision to go for it now, with himself as the bowler. Dhoni seizes his chance, slamming the first ball for his first four. That feels horribly like a turning point. Also coming back on: Brian Withington. \u201cOB Jato\u2019s rhetorical query at over 24 has got me thinking about predestination and mortality (again),\u201d he writes. \u201cProfessor Brian Cox has a similar effect when describing entropy and the inevitable heat death of the universe. Please can you reassure us that there will always be an OBO inbox for Abhijato Sensarma (over 13) and other good souls to fill? And as I write that, Kohli is out - can I safely ignore my tax return now?\u201d 37th over: India 156-4 (Dhoni 8, Jadhav 16) Back comes Rashid Khan as Gulbadin rotates his four slow men of the apocalypse. This is the 28th over of spin today, and Jadhav has had enough \u2013 after four dots, he pulls, savagely, for four. Rashid bounces back, taking the top edge with his googly, but it falls safely to the keeper\u2019s left. 36th over: India 152-4 (Dhoni 8, Jadhav 12) Another testing over from Mujeeb, who even gets away with a wide by claiming a caught-behind, not given. If Afghanistan had a review left, they might be using it now. And that\u2019s drinks, with Afghanistan on top, although the Indian wrist-spinners will be eyeing this pitch as if it was lunch at Lord\u2019s. Sunny Gill has been listening to TMS. \u201cBBC commentary for the last 10 mins,\u201d he reports, \u201cseem to think Kuldeep Yadav is in bat not Kedar Jadhav!\u201d The fools. 35th over: India 151-4 (Dhoni 8, Jadhav 11) Yet more singles \u2013 five of them, off Nabi. This would be boring if it wasn\u2019t adding to the chances of Afghanistan stealing a win. 34th over: India 146-4 (Dhoni 6, Jadhav 8) Gulbadin turns back to Mujeeb, the master of the dot ball, and he delivers by going for just three singles. For the sake of the game, we need Dhoni to hit out or get out, so Hardik Pandya can come in. Here\u2019s Matt Dony, picking up on the Jato business (24th and 30th overs). \u201cWhile we\u2019re on the subject of people being related to people,\u201d he murmurs, \u201ccan I just clear up that I am definitely not related to MS Dhoni. But I do enjoy hearing commentary of him doing well; I can feel vicariously successful. Hoping for the sake of the tournament he doesn\u2019t do too well today, though.\u201d 33rd over: India 143-4 (Dhoni 5, Jadhav 6) Nabi continues and goes for five as Jadhav shows some urgency. Dhoni has shown none at all: he has five off 20 balls. Sunil Gavaskar would approve. 32nd over: India 138-4 (Dhoni 4, Jadhav 2) Rahmat gets his leg-break to go like something from a gif involving Mike Gatting. It\u2019s starting outside off, so it\u2019s harmless. Off the last five overs, the kings of the world have managed 14-1. 31st over: India 136-4 (Dhoni 4, Jadhav 1) A moment to savour for Mohammad Nabi, who now has figures of 7-0-23-2. Princely. Two more wickets and they\u2019re down to that long tail. It all hinges on Dhoni. The big one! Nabi keeps plugging away and Kohli top-edges a cut to backward point, where Rahmat takes a fine catch, diving forward. Game on. 30th over: India 133-3 (Kohli 66, Dhoni 3) Back comes Rahmat, who was just changing ends. Dhoni is stroking it into the covers, just like Kohli, except that Dhoni\u2019s shots are going to the only man saving the single. India still not racing away with this: maybe that score predictor was right. My question about Abhijato (24th over) has elicited a reply. \u201cAh, I am!\u201d he exclaims, suddenly turning into a character from Jane Austen. \u201cOB Jato is my pen-name, which helps people get around the frankly complicated pronunciation of my formal name in everyday life... It\u2019s also easier to remember for people who follow my writing and/or musical endeavours on the Internet :)\u201d Of course. 29th over: India 128-3 (Kohli 62, Dhoni 2) Rahmat is taken off, unexpectedly, as Nabi returns and keeps it tight. The Afghanis are managing to keep Kohli off strike, which may be as close as they can get to frustrating him. A good spot from Romeo. \u201cThat\u2019s Rahmat\u2019s 14th wicket in 67 ODIs.\u201d 28th over: India 125-3 (Kohli 60, Dhoni 1) Rashid rushes through his over as Dhoni makes his usual scratchy start. Rashid has 5-0-26-0, which must be sheer bliss after the battering he took the other day. 27th over: India 124-3 (Kohli 59, Dhoni 1) So success for Rahmat, who straightened that one just enough. And here comes Old Man Dhoni, who could easily be putting his feet up now that India have two spare wicketkeepers on board. Gulbadin gives him a slip. Steve Waugh would have a slip, a gully, a short leg and a silly point. Aleem Dar called it right \u2013 hitting leg stump. It\u2019s not the big one, but it\u2019s well worth having. Shankar given LBW, sweeping. It looks straight... 26th over: India 122-2 (Kohli 58, Shankar 28) Just when the game is threatening to go to sleep, Kohli spots a long hop from Rashid and plays a pull with so much whip that you could serve it on a cone and charge \u00a32.50 for it. 25th over: India 115-2 (Kohli 53, Shankar 27) Shankar chips Rahmat over extra cover, inside-out, for his best shot of the day, and that\u2019s another fifty partnership off 63 balls. A moment earlier, the score predictor was giving India 298. I\u2019d say 330, for what it\u2019s worth: eight or nine an over for the second half of the innings. Come on Gulbadin, conjure up a wicket. 24th over: India 109-2 (Kohli 52, Shankar 22) Rashid continues, which means both batsmen can wear caps. A decent over ends with a googly that squeezes into Kohli\u2019s pads. \u201cDeath, taxes and a Virat Kohli masterclass,\u201d says OB Jato, \u201cthe three things that are certain in life.\u201d Is he by any chance related to our friend Abhijato? 23rd over: India 105-2 (Kohli 51, Shankar 19) Gulbadin takes himself off and turns to Rahmat Shah, so it\u2019s leg-spin from both ends. He does have a slip, which is surely right, but Shankar seizes on a half-volley and gets four on the strength of a misfield in the deep. Where\u2019s Brian Withington when you need him? Right here. \u201cAs good hosts,\u201d he writes, \u201cEngland have done much to help the round-robin stage of this tournament by losing twice already, thereby somewhat alleviating the risk of the dreaded \u2018dead rubber\u2019 syndrome. Is it too much to ask that India, as the dominant force in world cricket, show similar consideration today; and perhaps when they play England, too? Just asking.\u201d 22nd over: India 98-2 (Kohli 50, Shankar 13) Kohli, facing Rashid, cruises to fifty off 49 balls, with only four fours but several hard-run twos. It\u2019s the 93rd time he has reached fifty in a one-day international, and the third in succession. What a champion he is. 21st over: India 91-2 (Kohli 47, Shankar 10) The singles keep coming off Nabi. Gulbadin needs to make something happen. 20th over: India 86-2 (Kohli 44, Shankar 8) Gulbadin takes himself off and brings on Rashid Khan. He\u2019s brave enough to toss his first ball up to Kohli, who is ruthless enough to cover-drive for four. Kick a man when he\u2019s down, why don\u2019t you? Rashid actually bowls a good first over, but his desperation shows in a very poor review. It was a good ball, but there was a big fat inside edge. It\u2019s Rashid Khan, with his googly... 19th over: India 79-2 (Kohli 38, Shankar 7) Nabi continues, with not a single close fielder, when Afghanistan\u2019s best hope has to be to keep on taking wickets. If it was stopping the runs, it might make sense, but the singles are flowing. 18th over: India 75-2 (Kohli 36, Shankar 5) Gulbadin tries a slower-ball bouncer against Kohli, who pulls and misses. Between them the bowlers have managed to push him into the middle lane. And that\u2019s drinks, with Afghanistan narrowly on top, but India still threatening to go big. In other cricket news, England\u2019s women are playing West Indies. Here\u2019s Raf Nicholson\u2019s report. 17th over: India 73-2 (Kohli 35, Shankar 4) An over from Nabi that\u2019s so frugal, it could have been Mujeeb himself. And here\u2019s John Starbuck, picking up on Abhijato\u2019s point (13th over). \u201cThere used to be a case whereby a batsman could object to a substitute fielder in a \u2018specialist\u2019 position. Does this still happen? If so, how far does \u2018specialist\u2019 extend?\u201d I don\u2019t think it does, but I\u2019m waiting to be corrected, probably by Romeo. 16th over: India 71-2 (Kohli 34, Shankar 3) More singles off Gulbadin, who will be quite happy to see Shankar nicking the strike off the last ball. 15th over: India 66-2 (Kohli 32, Shankar 1) Well done Nabi, who has 2-0-6-1. He and Mujeeb, the two offies, have 2-24 between them, while the seamers have 0-44. In a perfect world, Rishabh Pant would now be striding out to join Kohli. In the real world, it\u2019s Vijay Shankar, who came in against Pakistan to replace the injured Dhawan, and ended up replacing the injured Kumar. Well, it\u2019s not the one they wanted, but it\u2019ll do. Rahul suddenly pulls out the reverse sweep and gives the easiest of catches to backward point. 14th over: India 64-1 (Rahul 30, Kohli 30) Gulbadin gets milked again, but doesn\u2019t go for any fours. 13th over: India 59-1 (Rahul 26, Kohli 30) Mujeeb is taken off \u2013 well, he did concede a four \u2013 and replaced by another off-spinner, Nabi. He goes for three singles, and a wide, as the fifty partnership comes up off 51 balls. If your inbox is ever feeling empty, there\u2019s one person you can count on: Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cIf a player is injured,\u201d he muses, \u201che does not come out to bat and his team sends out just ten men; it shouldn\u2019t be too crazy, then, to suggest that the same team must field with ten fielders as well when the time comes! One possible counterargument to this is that bowling and batting are primary tasks, both of which become impossible to perform on injury, while fielding is a secondary element of the game, but the point persists. This year\u2019s IPL as well as the ongoing World Cup has seen many substitute fielders do better than the ones they\u2019ve replaced, giving the teams what could be perceived as an unfair advantage. Your thoughts on the matter?\u201d A word to the wise, Abhijato: choose your battles. 12th over: India 55-1 (Rahul 24, Kohli 29) Gulbadin gives up on slips altogether, which is modest (as he himself is the bowler) but surely too deferential. Kohli is finding it all too easy, motoring along at three runs every two balls, while Rahul and Sharma together have gone at one every two. So Afghanistan simply have to get Kohli out. 11th over: India 49-1 (Rahul 22, Kohli 26) Mujeeb finally concedes a four, off his 36th ball, as he dishes up a full toss onto Kohli\u2019s pads and the gift is gratefully accepted. Kohli has 26 off only 16 balls: anything Eoin can do... 10th over: India 41-1 (Rahul 20, Kohli 20) Does Kohli ever run out of motivation? He\u2019s right in the mood now, getting way forward to cover-drive Gulbadin\u2019s first ball for three. He has caught up with Rahul already, after facing just 12 balls, to Rahul\u2019s 38. The powerplay ends with Afghanistan entitled to feel very pleased with themselves, while just ruing that fateful field change. 9th over: India 36-1 (Rahul 19, Kohli 16) Same old story: another over from Mujeeb goes for two singles. 8th over: India 34-1 (Rahul 18, Kohli 15) Gulbadin is giving the batsmen singles to midwicket, perhaps in an attempt to get them LBW. Kohli just sees the gap and thinks \u201cI\u2019ll have two there\u201d. Then he flicks Aftab for four and back-foot-drives him for four more. We have two completely different ballgames going on at the same time. 7th over: India 20-1 (Rahul 17, Kohli 2) Mujeeb is still asking questions and commanding respect. He has figures of 4-0-8-1, which would be superb in any ODI, let alone a World Cup game against India. 6th over: India 18-1 (Rahul 16, Kohli 1) India, the grandest of all the cricket nations these days, reassert themselves as Rahul forces Aftab for four. Gulbadin blinks and tinkers with the field, moving first slip out, keeping second \u2013 and a regulation edge goes straight through the gap. Oh dear. 5th over: India 9-1 (Rahul 7, Kohli 1) So Afghanistan\u2019s bowlers, far from being cowed by the battering they took from England, have bounced back and made a textbook start. Now they just need five more wickets to get down to India\u2019s long tail. Beauty! Sharma, who never got going, is utterly bamboozled by Mujeeb\u2019s carrom ball, which pitches on off stump, grips,d turns and takes out the off bail. 4th over: India 7-0 (Rahul 6, Sharma 1) Aftab isn\u2019t quick, around 82mph, but he\u2019s busy and bustling and gets some lift. He keeps KL Rahul quiet and gets a maiden. 3rd over: India 7-0 (Rahul 6, Sharma 1) An even thriftier over and another moral victory for Mujeeb as Rahul plays a curious shot, a mistimed top-spin forehand that goes close to the man at short midwicket. 2nd over: India 6-0 (Rahul 5, Sharma 1) It\u2019s seam at the other end in the shape of Aftab Alam. He\u2019s wearing a headband, half red and half green, like a boy in the back yard saying \u201cI\u2019m McEnroe. And Viv Richards.\u201d Three off the over again, with Rahul pushing into the covers for a couple. 1st over: India 3-0 (Rahul 2, Sharma 1) The new ball is taken by Mujeeb, the teenaged off-spinner who was Afghanistan\u2019s best bowler against England. He makes a tidy start, conceding three singles and drawing a leading edge from Rohit Sharma. The pitch looks slow. Just the one change for India, and that\u2019s enforced, as Mohammad Shami comes in for the injured Bhuvneshwar Kumar. So there\u2019s no Pant, unfortunately for the crowd, and India have a long tail. The Afghan bowlers\u2019 job is to get down to it. Gulbadin makes two changes, bringing back Hazratullah at the top of the order and Aftab at the bottom. Dawlat, the man who dropped Eoin Morgan on 28, pays the price, as if he hadn\u2019t already. But it\u2019ll be good to see Hazratullah, who is 21 (thanks for the correction, Romeo) and already on his second career. His first was as a security man, aged 15, working nights. He had internet access and used the time to study his favourite players. India 1 Sharma, 2 Rahul, 3 Kohli (capt), 4 Shankar, 5 Dhoni (wkt), 6 Pandya, 7 Jadhav, 8 Kuldeep, 9 Shami, 10 Chahal, 11 Bumrah. Afghanistan 1 Hazratullah, 2 Gulbadin (capt), 3 Rahmat, 4 Hashmatullah, 5 Afghan, 6 Nabi, 7 Najibullah, 8 Rashid, 9 Ikram (wkt), 10 Aftab, 11 Mujeeb. Kohli wins the toss and chooses to bat. Gulbadin, still smiling, says he would have done the same. Morning everyone and welcome to what may well be the perfect mismatch. It\u2019s the strongest team in the World Cup so far against the weakest. But the last time India met Afghanistan, in Dubai last September, the result was\u2026 a tie. On behalf of the neutrals, I\u2019m putting in a request for another one of those. A cup isn\u2019t a proper cup without a few upsets. England have done their best as hosts to make the party go with a swing, by stumbling to defeat against Pakistan and Sri Lanka. But those two games are the only ones in which a team from the top four has lost to one of the other six. Today, for the sake of the tournament, West Indies need to beat New Zealand, who have a 100pc record when they get onto the field. The same is true of India, but the chances of Afghanistan springing a shock do look a bit remote. For Virat Kohli, who missed the tie in Dubai, the question is whether to rest any of his big guns and give a World Cup debut to Rishabh Pant. Rest is hardly needed as India have only played three games so far, but England showed yesterday that it\u2019s unwise to keep letting the same batsmen do all the work, because then, when you\u2019re in a tight corner, the spare parts are liable to be rusty and brittle. Pant is a thrilling stroke-player who surely should have been in India\u2019s squad in the first place. He has it in him to be this team\u2019s Geoff Hurst. For Afghanistan, it\u2019s all about getting over their most recent experience, watching in disbelief as Eoin Morgan scored a century in sixes. \u201cYou\u2019re only as good as your last match,\u201d people are apt to say \u2013 and it\u2019s nonsense. A firework display is often followed by a fizzle, and vice-versa. Morgan went from hero to zero yesterday; Rashid Khan, his main victim on Tuesday, left nursing a bruised ego and figures of 9-0-110-0, is easily good enough to make the same journey in the opposite direction. The match is at Southampton, which tends to be a sporting surface with plenty of runs in it. Play starts at 10.30am BST, in about 35 minutes.",

In the March election the previously unknown figure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/02/ekrem-imamoglu-unifying-political-force-to-take-on-erdogan-istanbul\" title=\"\">delivered one of the biggest challenges</a> to President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s grip on Turkey in years. Although the governing AKP and nationalist party coalition secured more than 50% of the vote across the country in the 31 March polls, voters delivered an unexpected slap to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s party in four major cities, widely viewed as a rebuke for his handling of Turkey\u2019s burgeoning financial crisis. Istanbul, governed by the AKP and its Islamist party predecessors for 25 years, was the most painful loss. The city constitutes one third of the entire Turkish economy and is the main driver of the AKP\u2019s patronage networks. The president, who began his political career here as mayor in the 1990s and often talks about his deep love for his hometown, also viewed it as a personal rejection.</p> <p>While critics say Erdo\u011fan\u2019s expanded presidential powers are helping erode Turkey\u2019s democratic structures, in March voter turnout \u2013 traditionally high across the country \u2013 still stood at 84%. On election night many Istanbullus who had dejectedly shown up at polling stations to carry out their democratic duty earlier in the day watched the live results at first with curiosity, and then excitement. When the live stream of results from the government news agency stopped at about 9pm, people across the country realised \u0130mamo\u011flu, the People\u2019s Republican party (CHP) candidate, was pulling ahead of his AKP rival, powerful and well-funded former prime minister Binali Yildirim.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7161df1cf59a9f47be59ddb4b7a62083360955d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7161df1cf59a9f47be59ddb4b7a62083360955d/0_10_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters gather at a rally for the pro-government candidate, in the Kagithane district of the city.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters gather at a rally for the pro-government candidate, in the Kagithane district of the city.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Initial results gave \u0130mamo\u011flu a razor-thin lead of 0.28% with 99.8% of ballots counted, but the city was forced to endure more than two weeks of waiting for recounts demanded by the AKP before \u0130mamo\u011flu was finally given an official mandate to start work at city hall.</p> <p>Rerunning elections and removing elected officials from their posts have become routine in the 16 years since the AKP came to office. But even by Turkish standards, this race is different. It eventually dawned on the president that conceding Istanbul would accelerate the already shifting dynamics within his party and threaten his position. As Erdo\u011fan famously once said: \u201cWhoever loses Istanbul, loses Turkey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe stakes are very high,\u201d said Sinem Adar, a researcher at Berlin\u2019s Humboldt University. \u201cLess obvious, [than the AKP\u2019s financial considerations] but perhaps the more important implication of the rerun is for the post-election power configuration between Erdo\u011fan and his allies. Cracks within the party that have also become quite visible since [the elections] are further contributing to weakening his grasp of power.\u201d</p> <p>Five weeks after the election, Turkey\u2019s electoral board upheld one of the dozens of complaints made by the AKP and declared the race for mayor of Istanbul must be rerun, triggering an outcry from opposition parties and even from members of the AKP itself, who worried the rerun would dent the party\u2019s democratic credentials.</p> <p>The decision has, curiously, turned \u0130mamo\u011flu into both victor and victim, now fighting on a platform of saving Turkish democracy. The softly spoken 49-year-old has become a household name across Turkey, welcomed as a breath of political fresh air and touted as a possible presidential candidate in 2023.</p> <p>In inclusive, conciliatory speeches \u2013 the opposite of those of the firebrand politicians who have come to dominate Turkey\u2019s polarised political scene \u2013 \u0130mamo\u011flu talked about the need for the city to come together to overcome problems with unemployment and the rising cost of living.</p> <p>He won hearts and minds in pious and working-class AKP neighbourhoods all over the city by showing up to meetings and reaching out both by knocking on doors and through social media across Istanbul\u2019s ethnic, political and religious divides. Yildirim, in contrast, was almost completely sidelined by the president himself, who held huge rallies where he framed the local elections as a matter of \u201cnational survival\u201d and accused opposition parties of links to terrorism.</p> <p>Despite almost blanket pro-AKP media coverage, \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s campaign cut through, reinvigorating a beleaguered and poorly organised CHP unable to field candidates with broad cross-party appeal in the past.</p> <p>In an interview shortly after he entered city hall, \u0130mamo\u011flu told the <em>Observer</em> he was unperturbed by the prospect of an electoral rerun. \u201cI am not feeling any pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are 16 million people in this city waiting for me to serve them and do the job I was elected to do.\u201d But tensions across the city have been steadily building ahead of Sunday\u2019s vote. Many in Istanbul were keen to show their support after the election results were cancelled on 6 May.

      "bodyText": "The graffiti appeared in Istanbul\u2019s Gayrettepe neighbourhood one morning last month. It showed the word \u201cjustice\u201d written on a piece of paper held up by a disembodied hand. With a lighter, the other hand was setting fire to it. \u201cWrite down \u2018justice\u2019 on a bit of paper. And then burn its corners,\u201d the tag read. Within a day it had vanished, painted over by a municipality cleaning team. For the Istanbul street artist who goes by the name of Pepe, work is a constant game of cat-and-mouse with authorities seeking to remove his political creations. \u201cI drew that when the AKP (Turkey\u2019s ruling Justice and Development party) cancelled the Istanbul election,\u201d he said, sitting at a bar on Friday, two days before the city goes back to the polls in a controversial rerun today. \u201cWe have a right to free and fair information that Turkish media suppresses these days. They do a good job of shutting down the opposition. But they\u2019ll never completely manage it.\u201d That cat-and-mouse struggle, writ large, has been playing out across Istanbul this weekend as the AKP seeks to undo the mayoral victory of opposition coalition candidate Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu. In the March election the previously unknown figure delivered one of the biggest challenges to President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s grip on Turkey in years. Although the governing AKP and nationalist party coalition secured more than 50% of the vote across the country in the 31 March polls, voters delivered an unexpected slap to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s party in four major cities, widely viewed as a rebuke for his handling of Turkey\u2019s burgeoning financial crisis. Istanbul, governed by the AKP and its Islamist party predecessors for 25 years, was the most painful loss. The city constitutes one third of the entire Turkish economy and is the main driver of the AKP\u2019s patronage networks. The president, who began his political career here as mayor in the 1990s and often talks about his deep love for his hometown, also viewed it as a personal rejection. While critics say Erdo\u011fan\u2019s expanded presidential powers are helping erode Turkey\u2019s democratic structures, in March voter turnout \u2013 traditionally high across the country \u2013 still stood at 84%. On election night many Istanbullus who had dejectedly shown up at polling stations to carry out their democratic duty earlier in the day watched the live results at first with curiosity, and then excitement. When the live stream of results from the government news agency stopped at about 9pm, people across the country realised \u0130mamo\u011flu, the People\u2019s Republican party (CHP) candidate, was pulling ahead of his AKP rival, powerful and well-funded former prime minister Binali Yildirim. Initial results gave \u0130mamo\u011flu a razor-thin lead of 0.28% with 99.8% of ballots counted, but the city was forced to endure more than two weeks of waiting for recounts demanded by the AKP before \u0130mamo\u011flu was finally given an official mandate to start work at city hall. Rerunning elections and removing elected officials from their posts have become routine in the 16 years since the AKP came to office. But even by Turkish standards, this race is different. It eventually dawned on the president that conceding Istanbul would accelerate the already shifting dynamics within his party and threaten his position. As Erdo\u011fan famously once said: \u201cWhoever loses Istanbul, loses Turkey.\u201d \u201cThe stakes are very high,\u201d said Sinem Adar, a researcher at Berlin\u2019s Humboldt University. \u201cLess obvious, [than the AKP\u2019s financial considerations] but perhaps the more important implication of the rerun is for the post-election power configuration between Erdo\u011fan and his allies. Cracks within the party that have also become quite visible since [the elections] are further contributing to weakening his grasp of power.\u201d Five weeks after the election, Turkey\u2019s electoral board upheld one of the dozens of complaints made by the AKP and declared the race for mayor of Istanbul must be rerun, triggering an outcry from opposition parties and even from members of the AKP itself, who worried the rerun would dent the party\u2019s democratic credentials. The decision has, curiously, turned \u0130mamo\u011flu into both victor and victim, now fighting on a platform of saving Turkish democracy. The softly spoken 49-year-old has become a household name across Turkey, welcomed as a breath of political fresh air and touted as a possible presidential candidate in 2023. In inclusive, conciliatory speeches \u2013 the opposite of those of the firebrand politicians who have come to dominate Turkey\u2019s polarised political scene \u2013 \u0130mamo\u011flu talked about the need for the city to come together to overcome problems with unemployment and the rising cost of living. He won hearts and minds in pious and working-class AKP neighbourhoods all over the city by showing up to meetings and reaching out both by knocking on doors and through social media across Istanbul\u2019s ethnic, political and religious divides. Yildirim, in contrast, was almost completely sidelined by the president himself, who held huge rallies where he framed the local elections as a matter of \u201cnational survival\u201d and accused opposition parties of links to terrorism. Despite almost blanket pro-AKP media coverage, \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s campaign cut through, reinvigorating a beleaguered and poorly organised CHP unable to field candidates with broad cross-party appeal in the past. In an interview shortly after he entered city hall, \u0130mamo\u011flu told the Observer he was unperturbed by the prospect of an electoral rerun. \u201cI am not feeling any pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are 16 million people in this city waiting for me to serve them and do the job I was elected to do.\u201d But tensions across the city have been steadily building ahead of Sunday\u2019s vote. Many in Istanbul were keen to show their support after the election results were cancelled on 6 May. After a child shouted \u201cHer \u015fey \u00e7ok g\u00fczel olacak\u201d \u2013 \u201cEverything will be alright\u201d \u2013 at \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s tour bus, the slogan became the new rallying cry for the level-headed candidate, chanted in bars and at football matches and shared millions of times as a hashtag on social media. Pepe, the graffiti artist, made it the basis of one of his latest pieces. The AKP has learned from \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s success, copying some of the CHP candidate\u2019s ideas, such as subsidised public transport and making an effort to reach young people, conservative-leaning Kurdish voters and AKP supporters who did not vote last time.

But they must know what is at risk now.

In the past few days, the usually solid AKP election platform has wobbled. Erdo\u011fan has lashed out at \u0130mamo\u011flu, hinting he is in league with the outlawed Kurdish People\u2019s Workers party (PKK), and a bizarre last-minute tactic \u2013 a message from jailed Kurdish PKK leader Abdullah \u00d6calan urging potential swing-voter Kurds not to vote for the CHP \u2013 backfired after Kurdish political parties reiterated their support for \u0130mamo\u011flu. \u201cConservative Kurds, people who used to vote for the AKP, have woken up,\u201d said Hassan Kaplan, 27, one of Istanbul\u2019s estimated 4 million Kurds. \u201cI\u2019m scared there is too much expectation on \u0130mamo\u011flu, but he\u2019s the only person who has given us hope in a while.\u201d Neither AKP nor CHP supporters know what to expect when Sunday\u2019s results come in or what course of action the president might take if faced with another unsatisfactory result.

We never had the police come round but every relationship has a falling out at sometime or other and that\u2019s a personal thing. No crime was committed,\u201d he said, adding that Johnson would need to address it because \u201cwe are looking at somebody who is going to potentially be our prime minister and that sort of reputation doesn\u2019t bode well when you\u2019re dealing with many other countries.\u201d Jane McKinven, 58, said she and her husband, Jim, row \u201call the time\u201d and their neighbour \u2013 who happens to be Michael Fabricant MP \u2013 has never complained. \u201cHe\u2019s in the middle of a leadership race, it\u2019s going to get tense,\u201d she said of Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s just stress, I\u2019m sure, and it really shouldn\u2019t be out there for the media pulling at every little piece of it.\u201d Her husband, Jim, said Johnson needed to nip the story in the bud to stop his rivals from making political capital out of it. \u201cI think Boris needs to address it because those who don\u2019t like Boris are scoring political points from it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a domestic argument, that\u2019s all.\u201d Suzanne Webb, a Tory councillor on Birmingham city council, said she did not believe the episode was relevant, describing it as \u201cbehind closed doors, end of\u201d. Webb said she was \u201ctotally undecided\u201d over which candidate to back but she was not concerned by the episode.",

That run from Rasheedat Ajibade early in the second half was as exhilarating as football gets. Had Desire Oparanozie got a toe on Ajibade\u2019s cross to half the deficit, this would have been a whole lot tighter. Nigeria will also point to the questionable VAR call that allowed Germany\u2019s first goal to stand, with Svenja Huth standing in front of Chiamaka Nnadozie, offside, arguably interfering with play. But Germany had too much, even in second gear, as Alexandra Popp scored her 48th international goal while Lea Schuller bagged a clinical first at a World Cup. They advance to the quarters having played four, won four, scored nine, conceded none. Imagine what they might do if they start playing well!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5237a421a411c1a07500a47905087ba8c6343d07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5237a421a411c1a07500a47905087ba8c6343d07/0_204_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Germany players and coaching staff huddle as they celebrate after the match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Germany players and coaching staff huddle as they celebrate after the match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emmanuel Foudrot/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T17:54:05.895Z\">at 6.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d0e64858f082364d7cef401\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T17:26:35.593Z\">6.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FULL TIME: Germany 3-0 Nigeria</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Germany maintain their record of reaching every World Cup quarter-final!

Eight-time European champions Germany. Current Olympic champions Germany. Three wins out of three in this year\u2019s groups without conceding a goal Germany. Yes, you remember them.</p> <p><strong>The loss to injury of playmaker Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n, who broke her toe in Germany\u2019s opening match with China, goes a little way to explaining the slightly subdued expectations of the <em>Nationalelf</em>. </strong>But they\u2019ve come out of the group with a perfect record, having spread the goals around the team; there have been six of them, by five different scorers. They\u2019re currently on a 15-match unbeaten run in all competitions. Alexandra Popp, who manages on average a goal every other cap, could be making her 100th appearance today. Oh, and Marozs\u00e1n could get a run-out as sub, which would augur well for the rest of the tournament ...</p> <p><strong>... because the assumption is that Germany will progress. </strong>They\u2019ve met Nigeria twice before in World Cup competition, and won both matches, scoring five times and letting in nothing. Nigeria have played European opposition at the World Cup on a dozen occasions, losing nine and winning just the once, against Denmark in 1999. And while Germany sailed through the groups, Nigeria only squeaked through as the fourth-best third-placed team, a 2-0 win over a poor South Korea their only positive result.</p> <p><strong>But in football, nothing\u2019s ever certain. </strong>And there\u2019s always hope. Nigeria might be the underdogs today, but they can boast Barcelona\u2019s Asisat Oshoala in their ranks. The former Liverpool and Arsenal striker came off the bench in this year\u2019s Champions League final to score Barca\u2019s consolation against Lyon, and has already contributed to this World Cup with a glorious finish against the Koreans, rounding the keeper and slotting home from a tight angle with poise and panache. As Thomas Dennerby, Nigeria\u2019s head coach, says: \u201cIf we score, they may get nervous and we will have a chance.\u201d</p> <p><strong>So this promises to be a belter. </strong>It\u2019s the knockout stages of the World Cup! It\u2019s the Super Eagles and the <em>Nationalelf</em>! It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>4.30pm BST, 5.30pm local at the Stade des Alpes, Grenoble.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T13:50:09.212Z\">at 2.50pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Germany were deserved winners, dominating possession, scoring three, keeping yet another clean sheet. But Nigeria performed with great resolve and no little skill. That run from Rasheedat Ajibade early in the second half was as exhilarating as football gets. Had Desire Oparanozie got a toe on Ajibade\u2019s cross to half the deficit, this would have been a whole lot tighter. Nigeria will also point to the questionable VAR call that allowed Germany\u2019s first goal to stand, with Svenja Huth standing in front of Chiamaka Nnadozie, offside, arguably interfering with play. But Germany had too much, even in second gear, as Alexandra Popp scored her 48th international goal while Lea Schuller bagged a clinical first at a World Cup. They advance to the quarters having played four, won four, scored nine, conceded none. Imagine what they might do if they start playing well! Germany maintain their record of reaching every World Cup quarter-final! They\u2019ll play Sweden or Canada next Saturday. Nigeria are on the way home. 90 min +4: Ogebe goes on a determined run down the inside right and nearly breaks through. But a consolation goal\u2019s not to be. 90 min +3: Huth dribbles at pace down the inside left. Ayinde hauls her down, but gets away with it. No free kick. 90 min +2: There will be five added minutes, incidentally. 90 min +1: No, but this wasn\u2019t half close. Oparanozie creams the free kick towards the top right. It\u2019s a pearler, but inches over the crossbar. That would have been a net-ripper had it been three or four inches lower. 90 min: Ordega sashays in from the left, and is unceremoniously upended by a sliding Oberdorf. A free kick just to the left of the box, 25 yards out. Can Nigeria find a consolation, and become the first team to score against Germany at this World Cup? 89 min: Huth makes a right-to-left diagonal run and nearly dribbles her way into a shooting position just inside the Nigerian box. But she ends up down a cul-de-sac. A fourth goal would be hard on Nigeria. 87 min: This game is fizzling out now. Germany have done the job required of them. But Nigeria didn\u2019t half make them work hard for it. 85 min: That was a stunning finish by Schuller. She hasn\u2019t done a great deal today, but when a chance presented itself she really delivered. Birgit Prinz or Gerd Muller would have been proud of that. 83 min: Kanu is replaced by Ogebe. It\u2019s all over. Ayinde dithers over the ball while facing her own goal under pressure. She attempts a backpass to the keeper, but can\u2019t get enough purchase on the panicked pass, and it sits up short for Schuller, who takes a stride down the inside-right channel before fizzing a clinical first-time shot into the bottom left. 81 min: Hegering suffers another whack, this time from Ajibade\u2019s elbow, planted into the back of her head as the pair contest a high ball. It was more clumsy than malicious, but Ajibade is going into the book nevertheless. 79 min: Some baroque dribbling by the fresh Oberdorf down the left. She cuts inside and rolls a gorgeous pass down the channel to release Dabritz into the box. Dabritz only has Nnadozie to beat, but she\u2019s coming in from a tight-ish angle, and drags her shot across the keeper and harmlessly out of play to the right of goal. That could have put this game to bed. As it is, Nigeria are still in this. But they need something soon. 77 min: A free kick for Nigeria just inside the German half. It\u2019s launched into the mixer. Okobi rises just inside the area, and gets a header on target, but she\u2019s too far out and there\u2019s not enough power in the effort. Schult gathers without drama. 75 min: Ihezuo departs to warm applause from the 17,988 inside the Stade des Alpes. Nearly a full house. Fingers crossed that\u2019s nothing more than cramp; she\u2019s put in quite a shift at both ends of the pitch this afternoon. She\u2019s replaced by Uchendu. 74 min: Ihezuo is down with a severe case of cramp. On comes the stretcher, it doesn\u2019t look as though she\u2019ll be able to continue. Team-mates perform the internationally understood mime to request a sub. 72 min: Gwinn has been a livewire presence for Germany. She very nearly fashions space to get a shot away from just inside the Nigeria box, but she\u2019s closed down at the last. Nigeria half clear. Then Simon fizzes down the left and cuts back for Popp, whose latest attempt at the spectacular nearly hits the left-hand corner flag from the best part of 35 yards. 70 min: Huth dribbles down the left and earns Germany\u2019s latest corner. Simon takes. She hits it long. Popp shapes for a volley, 12 yards out, and connects, but not cleanly. The ball squirts into a thicket of players before eventually being whacked clear. 69 min: Germany make their final change, switching Magull for Oberdorf. 67 min: Hegering is made of strong stuff and good to continue. 66 min: A free kick hoicked long into the German box. Oparanozie goes up with Hegering, and accidentally clashes heads with the defender. Ooyah oof. On comes the ice pack. That will have hurt. 64 min: Buhl earns a corner out on the right. Simon sends it straight down Nnadozie\u2019s throat. 62 min: More space for Simon on the left. Nnadozie punches this one clear with purpose. 61 min: Oparanozie is booked for coming straight through the back of Popp. Should Nigeria somehow turn this around, she\u2019ll not be playing it the quarter-final. 60 min: It\u2019s end-to-end fun. Kanu can\u2019t quite sort her feet out to shoot from the edge of the German box. Then Simon finds a lot of space down the left and crosses, the ball evading Nnadozie. But there\u2019s nobody in a white shirt available to turn the ball home. 58 min: Germany can\u2019t find much in the way of fluency, though this is better, as Buhl chases Popp\u2019s pass down the right and backheels for Gwinn, barrelling into space down the inside-left channel. Gwinn lifts her shot over the bar, in an attempt to float a chip over Nnadozie. A lovely move, shame about the finish. 57 min: Huth is booked for a clumsy charge into the back of Okeke. 56 min: Dabritz has a bash from distance. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner, which results in Gwinn sending a dribbler towards goal from 25 yards. It\u2019s easily gathered by Nnadozie. 54 min: It\u2019s scrappy, but Nigeria will take that right now. They\u2019ve asked a fair few questions of Germany, whose passes aren\u2019t sticking. 52 min: Germany look a little shocked by that burst of brilliance. A flustered Hegering slices a simple clearance behind her and out for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece, but it\u2019s enough to get a concerned Martina Voss-Tecklenburg out of the dugout and into her technical area. 50 min: What a run by Ajibade! From the halfway line, she bursts down the left with great purpose and skill, gliding past Gwinn, who is left in the dust. Ajibade enters the box and fires a low ball across the face of goal. If Oparanozie connects with a telescopic leg at the far post, it\u2019s a goal, but the ball evades her toe by millimetres. What an entrance to the World Cup that was by Ajibade! 48 min: Germany come back at Nigeria, Buhl very nearly bustling her way into the box after getting on the end of a long clearance by Schult. She earns a corner. Hegering stops Nnadozie claiming on her line, and the whistle blows for a foul. Pressure off. 46 min: An early corner for Nigeria out on the right. It\u2019s sent sailing straight through the box and away from danger. But that\u2019s a statement of intent from the underdogs, who need something to happen quickly. And we\u2019re off again! Germany get the ball rolling for the second half, having made two changes. Schweers and Leupolz have been replaced by Simon and Buhl. Meanwhile Nigeria have swapped Nwabuoku for Ajibade, who makes her World Cup debut. Half-time entertainment. The design of Germany\u2019s shirt: a homage to this Atari Video Computer System classic? And that\u2019s the first half. Germany have reached the quarter-final stage of every World Cup to date, and they\u2019re 45 minutes plus however many extra hours will be added for VAR checks from making it again. 45 min +4: Or do they? Kanu is afforded more space down the right. She hoofs the ball towards Gwinn, who is facing the other way. The ball hits her upper arm. Nigeria want a penalty, and the referee checks, but it\u2019s not happening. The correct decision - Gwinn wasn\u2019t aware, she was right next to Kanu, and her arm was a totally natural position - but the crowd boo nevertheless. The neutrals have taken sides. 45 min +3: The ball\u2019s swung in from the right. Popp rises highest to flick a fine defensive header away from danger. And she\u2019s fouled in doing so. Germany weather the late storm. 45 min +2: A free kick for Nigeria on the halfway line. Ohale launches it long. Germany only half clear, and Ordega is able to cue up a cross from the right. She sends it in low, and Oparanozie tries to flick it home from the edge of the six-yard box. Doorsoun is forced to clip the ball out for a corner. 45 min: Dabritz sends it into the mixer. Oparanozie is forced to head behind. Dabritz takes again, Nnadozie dealing with the second one very well. There will be four extra minutes to play before the break, making up for all that VAR faff. 44 min: A quick throw releases Schuller into plenty of space down the right. She earns a corner. Nigeria simply can\u2019t afford to concede another before half-time. 42 min: Gwinn crosses hard from the right. Huth, ten yards out and level with the right-hand post, attempts to guide the ball into the net with a spectacular scorpion kick. Had that gone in, it would have surely been goal of the tournament. As it was, the ball sailed harmlessly wide. But full marks for ambition. 40 min: German passes aren\u2019t quite sticking right now. That\u2019s a testament to the way Nigeria have bounced back since conceding the second goal. They\u2019ve grown into the game again. 38 min: Okobi whips the ball towards the near post. It\u2019s whistling towards the top left, but Schuller is on the line to head clear. Another header, this time from Schweers, completely quashes the danger. Schult wasn\u2019t getting to that cheeky free kick, though. 37 min: Leupolz bundles into Ihezuo as the Nigerian forward works her way down the left. This is a free kick just to the side of the German box. Trouble ahoy for the two-time champs. 36 min: It\u2019s getting a bit tasty out there, as Popp becomes the latest player to go in the book for a cynical clip on Ordega, who was in the process of turning her and making off into space. 34 min: Now it\u2019s Gwinn\u2019s turn to be clattered, as Ihezuo jumps into her from behind in the midfield. A bit of payback, I\u2019ll be bound. The referee issues a one-last-chance lecture, but no booking. 32 min: Dabritz rolls a gorgeous pass down the inside-right channel, very nearly releasing Gwinn on the overlap. Ihezuo does extremely well to keep up and shepherd the ball out of play for a goal kick. Gwinn, slightly exasperated, takes a wild swipe at the ball just before it runs out, and connects with Ihezuo instead. She\u2019s booked. 30 min: Short corner. Faff. Ball easily cleared. Did the first goal not teach Germany anything? 29 min: And Nigeria had started so well, too. The crowd have turned on the referee and Germany, and are booing at the non-award of every perceived foul. Germany care not, going about their business and winning another corner out on the right. Dabritz sends an unstoppable arrow into the bottom-right corner. Perfectly placed and executed! Nnadozie went the right way, but couldn\u2019t get anywhere near it, even at full stretch. 26 min: Nnadozie is lectured by the referee. Don\u2019t move off that line! There\u2019s hardly been any action for the last six minutes. It\u2019s all VAR-related shenanigans. The rhythm of the NFL. 25 min: Yep, it\u2019s a penalty, and Nwabuoku is booked. The crowd don\u2019t like this, and boo heartily, but this is the correct decision. 24 min: And now there\u2019s more VAR action, as Germany come straight back at Nigeria, Magull attempting to latch onto a ball in the Nigerian box. Nwabuoku swipes at the ball, but misses, kicking Magull\u2019s knee instead. This is probably going to be a penalty. So clumsy. 23 min: Probably, yes. But according to VAR, no. So the goal stands! 22 min: Of course, Fifa have their new toy, so this is going to VAR, with Huth possibly standing offside, marginally. Is she in front of Nnadozie, restricting the keeper? Here\u2019s what happens when you don\u2019t play a short corner. Magull\u2019s presence wins a corner out on the left. The ball\u2019s whipped into a crowded six-yard box by Dabritz, who lands it perfectly on Popp\u2019s head. She doesn\u2019t have to move, instead flashing an instinctive header into the bottom right. Nnadozie had no chance! 19 min: One corner leads to another. Now it\u2019s Schweers and Magull\u2019s turn to pull off a clever short set piece. You know how this ends up. One of these routines will bear fruit soon, surely. 17 min: Popp has a pop from distance. Her shot is deflected high into the sky and briefly threatens to loop into the top right, over a stranded Nnadozie. But the ball flies away from harm. Corner. 16 min: Nnadozie takes her time over a goal kick in order to take a little sting out of the game. Plus it\u2019s hot. 14 min: Once again, Germany over-elaborate at a set-piece. Schweers and Dabritz make a holy mess of some routine or other. But the good news for Germany is their ability to think on the hoof when plans go awry. Not for the first time, they respond to making a mess of a free kick by recycling the ball well. Schweers is sent clear down the wing after some neat, crisp triangulation. Sadly the resulting cross is no good. 13 min: Magull is threatening to break into space down the left with a cute turn. She\u2019s unceremoniously upended by Okobi, and this is another dangerous free kick for Germany out on the touchline, the box loaded. 12 min: Schweers and Huth fiddle around with a short, intricate corner, to little effect. Schweers eventually loops a long, aimless ball over everyone in the box and out for a goal kick. 11 min: The corner is no good. Easily claimed by Schult. Germany go up the other end, Gwinn earning a corner down the right off Ohale. It\u2019s two-all in corners already. 10 min: Okobi bursts through a huge gap in the midfield and nearly releases Kanu into acres down the left. Doorsoun does extremely well to come across and nip the attack in the bud. But Nigeria are soon coming back at Germany again, Oparanozie dropping a shoulder to make gains down the left and earning a corner off Doorsoun. 8 min: Schuller busies herself down the German left to earn a corner. The set piece is hoicked into the mixer, and Nnadozie comes off her line, flapping wildly under the ball. She\u2019s lucky to get away with that one. Huth tries to recycle things out on the right, but can\u2019t keep the ball in play. It\u2019s been a really open and entertaining game so far. 6 min: Germany make an awful mess of a training-ground routine. But they recycle the ball, and Dabritz loops in from the left. The ball lands at the feet of Magull, who really should score from a central position, eight yards out. But she lets the ball get snagged between her feet, and by the time she gets a shot away, Ohale spreads to make a sensational block. Nigeria clear. 5 min: Ayinde concedes a clumsy foul, needlessly barging into Dabritz out on the German left. This is a free kick in a very dangerous position. Germany load the box. 3 min: Ordega, who has been involved in everything so far, makes good down the right and loops a cross into the German box. It\u2019s too close to Schult, who claims easily enough. But this is a very sprightly start by the underdogs. 2 min: The corner is whipped low towards the near post. Ordega, her back to goal, traps, turns and whistles a shot straight at Schult from a tight angle and at close range. The keeper gathers. And we\u2019re off! Nigeria get the party started. And within 45 seconds they win the first corner of the game down the right, after lovely work by Oparanozie, who sprays a pass wide to Ordega, who in turn feeds Ayinde. She bursts into the box and sees her cross knocked out. Here come the teams! The knockout stage of the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup is upon us at last. This gets real, right here, right now. An anticipatory fever sweeps around the Stade des Alpes in Grenoble. Jack White\u2019s most popular riff is hollered from every corner as two nation armies take to the stage. The atmosphere is boiling up nicely ... and the weather\u2019s pretty pleasant too, a balmy 30 degrees. Blasts of the Deutschlandlied and Arise, O Compatriots are performed and well-respected. Hands are clasped. Pennants are swapped. Coins are tossed. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! A word with Nigeria coach Thomas Dennerby. \u201cFirst we have to bring our good defence. But we also have to be a bit more patient in building up our attacks. If we find the right ways to attack, we will have the opportunity to steal some balls. They use their full-backs high, so there will be some spaces behind. We hope for that!\u201d Pre-match entertainment. Our Louise Taylor has been on the road in France, putting in the hard yards so you don\u2019t have to. Here\u2019s her weekly diary, which considers the impact the #MeToo movement has made on sunbathing habits in Nice, and hails the boundless energy of Phil \u2018New Guardiola\u2019 Neville. Germany wear their first-choice white shirts this afternoon. Alexandra Popp will be handing over this lovely pennant before kick-off. That none-more-modern DFB logo was designed in 1926. 1926! Nigeria will play in their second-choice dark green shirts. And by the looks of it they\u2019ll be properly hydrated. Just as well, as it\u2019s a sunny day in Grenoble. Alexandra Popp wins her 100th cap for the Nationalelf. The 28-year-old Wolfsburg striker has scored 47 goals for Germany since making her debut against North Korea in 2010. Lea Sch\u00fcller gets the nod to play alongside her. Meanwhile so much for building up the goal threat of Asisat Oshoala. She hasn\u2019t fully recovered from picking up a knock in Nigeria\u2019s final group game against France, and isn\u2019t fit to start. Uchenna Kanu makes her World Cup debut on the wing while Chinwendu Ihezuo and captain Desire Oparanozie lead the line. At the back, Evelyn Nwabuoku will make an African-record 14th appearance at a World Cup. Germany: Schult, Gwinn, Doorsoun, Hegering, Schweers, Huth, Leupolz, Magull, Dabritz, Popp, Schuller. Subs: Benkarth, Simon, Hendrich, Maier, Oberdorf, Goessling, Marozsan, Elsig, Dallmann, Buhl, Knaak, Frohms Nigeria: Nnadozie, Okeke, Ebi, Nwabuoku, Ohale, Ordega, Ayinde, Okobi, Kanu, Ihezuo, Oparanozie. Subs: Oluehi, Okoronkwo, Imo, Oshoala, Uchendu, Ajibade, Ogebe, Chukwudi, Ebere, Chikwelu, Michael, Jonathan. Referee: Yoshimi Yamashita (Japan). With most of the headlines so far being made by goal-hungry reigning champions USA, happy hosts France, upwardly mobile hopefuls England and the Netherlands, Aussie striker Sam Kerr, and that eejit in the VAR truck, Germany have arrived at the knockout stage almost unannounced. That\u2019s two-time world champions Germany. Eight-time European champions Germany. Current Olympic champions Germany. Three wins out of three in this year\u2019s groups without conceding a goal Germany. Yes, you remember them. The loss to injury of playmaker Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n, who broke her toe in Germany\u2019s opening match with China, goes a little way to explaining the slightly subdued expectations of the Nationalelf. But they\u2019ve come out of the group with a perfect record, having spread the goals around the team; there have been six of them, by five different scorers. They\u2019re currently on a 15-match unbeaten run in all competitions. Alexandra Popp, who manages on average a goal every other cap, could be making her 100th appearance today. Oh, and Marozs\u00e1n could get a run-out as sub, which would augur well for the rest of the tournament ... ... because the assumption is that Germany will progress. They\u2019ve met Nigeria twice before in World Cup competition, and won both matches, scoring five times and letting in nothing. Nigeria have played European opposition at the World Cup on a dozen occasions, losing nine and winning just the once, against Denmark in 1999. And while Germany sailed through the groups, Nigeria only squeaked through as the fourth-best third-placed team, a 2-0 win over a poor South Korea their only positive result. But in football, nothing\u2019s ever certain. And there\u2019s always hope. Nigeria might be the underdogs today, but they can boast Barcelona\u2019s Asisat Oshoala in their ranks. The former Liverpool and Arsenal striker came off the bench in this year\u2019s Champions League final to score Barca\u2019s consolation against Lyon, and has already contributed to this World Cup with a glorious finish against the Koreans, rounding the keeper and slotting home from a tight angle with poise and panache. As Thomas Dennerby, Nigeria\u2019s head coach, says: \u201cIf we score, they may get nervous and we will have a chance.\u201d So this promises to be a belter. It\u2019s the knockout stages of the World Cup! It\u2019s the Super Eagles and the Nationalelf! It\u2019s on! Kick off: 4.30pm BST, 5.30pm local at the Stade des Alpes, Grenoble.",

      "bodyText": "The neighbour who contacted the police over a late-night altercation between Tory leadership favourite, Boris Johnson, and his partner, Carrie Symonds, has gone public with his side of the story. Tom Penn, who has lived at the property in south London for just over a year, said he wanted to put the record straight on his reasons for recording the row and then dialling 999. Penn, who heard the loud argument, said he only contacted the police as a last resort after knocking three times at the couple\u2019s flat and was concerned over the \u201cbizarre and fictitious allegations\u201d put to him and his wife since news of the incident broke and dominated front pages. It comes after the Guardian revealed that police were called to the flat Johnson shares with Symonds in the early hours of Friday morning after the neighbour heard a loud altercation involving screaming followed by slamming and banging. On a recording made by the neighbour, Symonds can be heard telling Johnson to \u201cget off me\u201d and \u201cget out of my flat\u201d.

On the track the performances of Blue Point, Japan and Pinatubo will live long in the memory as well as Stradivarius, the brilliant Gold Cup winner. Off the track Aidan O\u2019Brien was a clear winner of the trainers\u2019 title and Frankie Dettori nailed the jockeys\u2019 equivalent with a superb four-timer on Thursday. Hayley Turner\u2019s win on Friday ended a 32-year drought for female riders at the meeting and the five-day fixture ended with a poignant success for King Power Racing.

A chance is taken on <strong>Younevercall</strong>, whose hurdling exploits suggest he might be good enough to beat these on his Flat-racing debut. After a wind operation, he bolted up at Sandown in April. He\u2019s been fragile, so connections are reluctant to send him chasing and this is evidently an attempt to add another string to his bow. The Chester Cup did not work out for Cleonte but better is expected at a course where he has run well a couple of times, including when third to Dee Ex Bee in the Sagaro last month. </p> <p>Dettori ends his fine week aboard Corelli, who steps up in distance by a mile. While bred to cope, it\u2019s a lot to ask at the first attempt and he wears a hood, suggesting a need to keep him calm in order to help him conserve energy. That doesn\u2019t bode particularly well. Among the jumpers on show is Black Corton, lining up in a Flat race for the very first time. All his races for the past two years have been over fences and his jumping can help him in that sphere, so I worry about him proving one-paced in a contest without obstacles, but he should give Megan Nicholls an enjoyable spin at the very least.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbb61d8757467be7b409612a3e15d64f5d66a02b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbb61d8757467be7b409612a3e15d64f5d66a02b/0_26_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Masar, ridden by James Doyle, stumbles at the start of the Hardwicke Stakes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Masar, ridden by James Doyle, stumbles at the start of the Hardwicke Stakes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0e51cd8f082364d7cef34c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T16:07:26.004Z\">5.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wokingham Stakes Handicap (5.00pm) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>1 <strong>Cape Byron</strong> (Andrea Atzeni) 7-2 Fav <br>2 <strong>Tis Marvellous</strong> (A Kirby) 14-1 <br>3 <strong>Danzeno</strong> (L Dettori) 7-1 <br>4 <strong>Raucous</strong> (Cieren Fallon) 50-1 <br>26 ran <br>Non Runners: 14,25,28 </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61866a3b12845f19b996c02f1c3d96df211d25a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61866a3b12845f19b996c02f1c3d96df211d25a0/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saturday always attracts the biggest crowd at Royal Ascot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saturday always attracts the biggest crowd at Royal Ascot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0e518c8f082364d7cef34a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T16:05:27.004Z\">5.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>That result means that Frankie Dettori cannot be caught now and has won the Royal Ascot jockeys\u2019 title.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HonestFrank/status/1142463270491762688\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Frankie Dettori, with 7 winners, cannot be passed and is top jockey at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoyalAscot?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RoyalAscot</a> meeting for the sixth time and for the first time in 15 years<br><br>Dettori will be 50 at the end of next year <a href=\"https://t.co/osb3RxtAXc\">pic.twitter.com/osb3RxtAXc</a></p>&mdash; Francis Keogh (@HonestFrank) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HonestFrank/status/1142463270491762688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 22, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0e4fde8f082364d7cef327\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T16:00:27.183Z\">5.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wokingham Stakes Handicap (5.00pm)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And they\u2019re off ...

Paul D\u2019Arcy\u2019s veteran was an unlucky ninth in this last year on his first run of the season and beat 19 rivals to a big pot here next time out. Just 4lb higher and sharper for a Listed-race run at Windsor, he could get involved under his claiming rider. Cape Byron has been clipped to 9-2, which looks very tight for a big-field cavalry charge. He won the Victoria Cup here last month, one of several bits of good course form, and travelled strongly enough to suggest this shorter trip won\u2019t be a problem. </p> <p>Dettori is aboard the second-favourite, Danzeno, now eight years old. A close fifth in this from the same rating a year ago, he won on his reappearance three weeks ago. Hey Jonesy was only beaten a couple of lengths in a Group One here last year. This is only his second handicap but, on the available evidence, his rating does not look especially lenient. Bacchus won this last summer on his first run of the year and tries to turn the same trick, from just a 3lb higher mark.

The French raider City Light and Bound From Nowhere, from the US, are to be feared, while other contenders have travelled from Singapore and New Zealand. </p> <p>But all of them may struggle to match a horse whose home is just two hours up the road at Newmarket. <strong>The Tin Man</strong> took this prize in 2017 and was a marginally unlucky fourth last year. He also won here on Champions Day in 2016 and bagged the third Group One of his career at Haydock last autumn. He should be a lot sharper for his first run back at Windsor, when he was giving weight to the first two, and looks the value in the race at 11-1. He seems to have struck up a good partnership with Oisin Murphy. </p> <p>It\u2019s asking a lot for Blue Point to do his thing just four days after running to a very high level on what was, at the time, rain-softened ground. He\u2019s better at five furlongs than six and today\u2019s final furlong could be a long one for him. I\u2019d like to see Tip Two Win run well and the ground is certainly coming in his favour. He was a surprise second in last year\u2019s Guineas, a head in front of Masar. It\u2019s not clear that he has the raw speed to get competitive in a top-class sprint.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17059ae0498608eef5fddb66c5c55c7eca485231\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17059ae0498608eef5fddb66c5c55c7eca485231/0_101_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raymond Blanc presents a trophy to jockey Daniel Tudhope after Space Traveller won the Jersey Stakes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raymond Blanc presents a trophy to jockey Daniel Tudhope after Space Traveller won the Jersey Stakes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Davy/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0e3f278f080e828514d616\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T14:47:29.022Z\">3.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hardwicke Stakes (3.40pm) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>1 <strong>Defoe</strong> (Andrea Atzeni) 11-4 Fav <br>2 <strong>Nagano Gold</strong> (C Soumillon) 25-1 <br>3 <strong>Mirage Dancer</strong> (P J Dobbs) 6-1 <br>8 ran <br>Also: 12-1 Morando 4th <br>Non Runner: 9 </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13152378596839ed7c03935bfcaf1afacbbe75ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13152378596839ed7c03935bfcaf1afacbbe75ca/0_150_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Racegoers on day five of Royal Ascot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Racegoers on day five of Royal Ascot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Crowhurst/Getty Images for Ascot Racecourse</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0e3e818f082364d7cef265\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T14:45:57.084Z\">3.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Extraordinary run form Nagano Gold in the Hardwicke Stakes.

Mirage Dancer has some of the right credentials, being from the yard of Sir Michael Stoute, who has won this a record 11 times. Stoute could have run Crystal Ocean in this but switched him to the Prince of Wales on Wednesday, which he won. Was that decision made in the knowledge that he had an able substitute for the Hardwicke? Judging by his Goodwood win, in a race he also won last year, Mirage Dancer is still improving, but this requires a big step forward.</p> <p><strong>Defoe</strong> is more convincing, as a Group One winner last time who nonetheless meets these rivals at level weights in a Group Two. It looks like his midwinter gelding operation has helped. His stable was among the winners yesterday. Lah Ti Dar is a non-runner, having failed to eat up, so Dettori\u2019s fans will have to sit on their hands for half an hour. Southern France has attracted support, despite being winless for over a year. He has some solid form at marathon trips, including a close second to Stradivarius last month, but this drying ground will be a problem if he\u2019s at all short of pace at this shorter distance. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ccd0b72643849b10559b635bce07c1ce5caa01d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ccd0b72643849b10559b635bce07c1ce5caa01d/292_133_1806_3122/578.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Tikhomirova arrives at Royal Ascot.\" width=\"578\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Tikhomirova arrives at Royal Ascot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images for Ascot Racecourse</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0e385d8f081e872734cad0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T14:17:27.746Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>What Simon says ... racing starting to move with the times</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RowleyfileRRR/status/1142435696059342848\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Good to have Sky Sports Racing starting to give out times after races. 1m 24.57s (0.29s outside course record) for the Jersey apparently.</p>&mdash; Simon Rowlands (@RowleyfileRRR) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RowleyfileRRR/status/1142435696059342848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 22, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0e37ae8f081e872734cacc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T14:15:54.933Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jersey Stakes (3.05pm) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>1 <strong>Space Traveller</strong> (D Tudhope) 25-1 <br>2 <strong>Space Blues</strong> (James Doyle) 5-2 Fav <br>3 <strong>Angel\u2019s Hideaway</strong> (R Havlin) 14-1 <br>18 ran <br>Also: 7-1 Urban Icon 4th </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37e528832de7e196fd35f0f4a87738f42692793a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37e528832de7e196fd35f0f4a87738f42692793a/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Racegoers watch the action during day five of Royal Ascot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Racegoers watch the action during day five of Royal Ascot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0e36158f080e828514d5cf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T14:08:43.682Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jersey Stakes (3.05pm)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And they\u2019re off ...

The horse that beat her that day was Advertise, a Group One winner again here yesterday. Having needed her first run back, So Perfect powered home at Naas last time and looks ready for seven furlongs. Space Blues has bundles of speed and will be suited by the drying surface. </p> <p>Momkin was a close second in the Craven and excuses could be made for his midfield effort in the Guineas. The step down in class and distance could show Roger Charlton\u2019s colt to advantage. Dettori\u2019s mount, Marie\u2019s Diamond, is of course shortening in the betting but he is winless since July, does not seem to be improving and looks held by Space Blues on Epsom form.

The trainer seems to have developed a soft spot for this race, which he has won twice in the past three years, and only ran a 14-1 shot on the other occasion.</p> <p>Pinatubo is unbeaten in two, most recently in the Woodcote at Epsom, when he ran on strongly, suggesting this extra furlong will be fine. That form does not look strong, however. Rose Of Kildare, the mount of Frankie Dettori, has been steadily cut from 25-1 down to 7s with some firms. Mark Johnston\u2019s filly is the most experienced in the field after five runs and Liberty Beach, who beat her last time, was a good fourth in the Queen Mary here on Wednesday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb6f43c988931a38d6d73819f9dcd5af71c0e8b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb6f43c988931a38d6d73819f9dcd5af71c0e8b4/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crowds in the paddock waiting for the Royal Procession.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crowds in the paddock waiting for the Royal Procession.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T13:13:17.357Z\">at 2.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d0e27368f082364d7cef1af\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T13:04:25.182Z\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Queen's Hat Stakes (2.00pm) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>1st <strong>Green</strong> 5-2</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"108e81849b851cb911d0c9c4226b4fdbbc7e93ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/108e81849b851cb911d0c9c4226b4fdbbc7e93ff/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Queen in green.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Queen in green.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T13:27:14.805Z\">at 2.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d0e25ed8f081e872734ca57\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T13:03:25.211Z\">2.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The sectional timing, sponsored by Longines, has been an excellent addition to Royal Ascot this week and expert race times analyst and Racing TV pundit James Willoughby has been giving his reaction: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen throughout the week that the way that races are run varies considerably and can have a profound impact on important races. Every section of a race requires, in theory, equal effort from the horse, but that\u2019s not the way races are run. Races are run in a manner that some parts are run much more strongly than others, and horses who gain lengths in those sections need to be upgraded against those who gain their lengths when the pace is slow.</p> <p>\u201cThe difference between the two things is impossible to tell with the eye. The final time of a horse race is fairly pointless, but sectionals help us to understand them to a point where we can catch lightning in a bottle.\u201d</p> <p>Willoughby is still analysing this week\u2019s data but said: \u201cI think <strong>Laurens</strong>, though only sixth in the Queen Anne, ran an absolute screamer, and that the St James\u2019s Palace winner <strong>Circus Maximus</strong> should be rated as having won by much further, whereas some analysts believe runner-up King Of Comedy was unlucky.</p> <p>\u201cThe St James\u2019s Palace was slowly run early, but they ran very hard round the bend and into the straight and Circus Maximus put in a huge amount of effort to burn off Too Darn Hot and make it easier for the second and fourth-placed Skardu to close on him. The sectionals for the Norfolk were interesting too, and I believe the winner <strong>A\u2019Ali,</strong> put in the fastest single furlong so far.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"555e88d56b03c93f462ec097e8daa246e3598461\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/555e88d56b03c93f462ec097e8daa246e3598461/0_159_4779_2867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Racegoers attend day five of Royal Ascot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Racegoers attend day five of Royal Ascot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images for Ascot Racecourse</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T13:06:05.662Z\">at 2.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d0e1e9a8f082364d7cef171\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-22T12:30:56.379Z\">1.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Gay Kelleway, who was the first female rider to win a race at Royal Ascot 32 years before Hayley Turner yesterday, posted this earlier today.

More than any other day this week, the train takes the strain, as an estimated 30,000 normally travel here by the Waterloo-Reading line on the Saturday of the Royal meeting, so we will find out how much disruption is caused by the continuing industrial action by rail staff. <br><br>The Queen\u2019s track is bathed in warm sunshine and we finally have the sort of weather you\u2019d like to expect in mid-June. The famously free-drying track is described as good to firm in places and GoingStick readings also suggest that any horses in need of soft are basically sunk. This is a day to be backing zippy types with quick actions who float across the turf, raising memories of Danehill, Habibti and other great sprinters with their names on the trophies here.<br><br>Speaking of greats, Frankie Dettori is back, trying to find the one extra winner he needs to make this his best Royal Ascot ever at the age of 48. I\u2019m afraid he is one down already, as Lah Ti Dar, his intended mount in the Hardwicke, has been withdrawn after failing to eat up. I\u2019ve already heard one punter talking of combining the Italian\u2019s mounts in multiple bets - but first he must find a bookie still prepared to take such bets.<br><br>Hayley Turner is not here, alas. Yesterday, she became only the second female jockey to ride a winner at Royal Ascot but today her business takes her to Newmarket and Lingfield. The only woman riding here is Megan Nicholls, booked by her father for Black Corton in the very last race. Black Corton is not without his chance in the Queen Alexandra, his very first Flat race, and it will be remembered that he has done several good turns for another female jockey, Bryony Frost, who won her first Grade One on him two Christmases ago.<br><br>But the meat of the afternoon is the two sprints, the classy Diamond Jubilee at 4.20pm and the unsolveable Wokingham at 5pm. They are Royal Ascot in miniature, over before you know it after a tonne of preparation. But the memories will be sweet if you can pinpoint either winner.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from Royal Ascot for another year. On the track the performances of Blue Point, Japan and Pinatubo will live long in the memory as well as Stradivarius, the brilliant Gold Cup winner. Off the track Aidan O\u2019Brien was a clear winner of the trainers\u2019 title and Frankie Dettori nailed the jockeys\u2019 equivalent with a superb four-timer on Thursday. Hayley Turner\u2019s win on Friday ended a 32-year drought for female riders at the meeting and the five-day fixture ended with a poignant success for King Power Racing. Let\u2019s meet back next year when the country may have changed beyond recognition but the Royal Procession will be the same. A poignant end to Royal Ascot with victory for Cleonte in the Queen Alexandra Stakes and a win for King Power Racing, founded by the late Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. 1 Cleonte (S De Sousa) 7-2 2 Pallasator (Oisin Murphy) 10-1 3 Max Dynamite (R L Moore) 10-3 Fav 11 ran Also: 11-2 Lucky Deal 4th Non Runners: 4,8 And they\u2019re off ... Younevercall is running wide and solo ... Black Corton leads the main field ... Younevercall has joined the bulk of runners now ... and goes second behind Black Corton with Max Dynamite in third ... Paddy\u2019s Motorbike is close up ... and Pilansberg is last ... Corelli is in midfield with Frankie Dettori ... Corelli makes a move ... and joins Black Corton in the lead ... and goes for home ... Max Dynamite comes there with Cleonte who just gets on top and Pallasator challenges but Cleonte wins the final race of Royal Ascot. Cleonte \u2013 10/3 Max Dynamite \u2013 5/1 Younevercall \u2013 5/1 Corelli \u2013 11/2 Lucky Deal \u2013 7/1 Pallastor \u2013 12/1 Black Corton \u2013 12/1 Coeur Blimey \u2013 28/1 Paddy\u2019s Motorbike \u2013 50/1 Jukebox Jive \u2013 80/1 Pilansberg \u2013 250/1 Full betting at Oddschecker here Willie Mullins knows how to win this and reports are encouraging about his Max Dynamite, though the nine-year-old has not been the most reliable. A chance is taken on Younevercall, whose hurdling exploits suggest he might be good enough to beat these on his Flat-racing debut. After a wind operation, he bolted up at Sandown in April. He\u2019s been fragile, so connections are reluctant to send him chasing and this is evidently an attempt to add another string to his bow. The Chester Cup did not work out for Cleonte but better is expected at a course where he has run well a couple of times, including when third to Dee Ex Bee in the Sagaro last month. Dettori ends his fine week aboard Corelli, who steps up in distance by a mile. While bred to cope, it\u2019s a lot to ask at the first attempt and he wears a hood, suggesting a need to keep him calm in order to help him conserve energy. That doesn\u2019t bode particularly well. Among the jumpers on show is Black Corton, lining up in a Flat race for the very first time. All his races for the past two years have been over fences and his jumping can help him in that sphere, so I worry about him proving one-paced in a contest without obstacles, but he should give Megan Nicholls an enjoyable spin at the very least. 1 Cape Byron (Andrea Atzeni) 7-2 Fav 2 Tis Marvellous (A Kirby) 14-1 3 Danzeno (L Dettori) 7-1 4 Raucous (Cieren Fallon) 50-1 26 ran Non Runners: 14,25,28 That result means that Frankie Dettori cannot be caught now and has won the Royal Ascot jockeys\u2019 title. And they\u2019re off ... Lake Volta and Watchable are out quickly ... and the field has split in two ... Vanburgh is close up and Gunmetal ... Cape Byron finishing strongly and lands a hefty gamble. Has Blue Point run his last race? Chris Cook has just called to say that trainer Charlie Appleby has suggested that it may well be. \u201cWe\u2019ll let the dust settle, but I\u2019m not sure what there is left to do,\u201d said Appleby in the huddle speaking to journalists after his horse\u2019s victory in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes. Cape Byron \u2013 4/1 Danzeno \u2013 9/1 Hey Jonesy \u2013 12/1 Summerhand \u2013 14/1 Gunmetal \u2013 14/1 Tis Marvellous \u2013 16/1 Stone of Destiny \u2013 16/1 Bacchus \u2013 18/1 Spring Loaded \u2013 18/1 Southern Horse \u2013 18/1 Vanbrugh \u2013 20/1 Foxtrot Lady - 25/1 Cenotaph \u2013 28/1 Soldier\u2019s Minute \u2013 28/1 Watchable \u2013 28/1 Intisaab \u2013 33/1 Lake Volta \u2013 33/1 Gifted Master \u2013 33/1 Perfection \u2013 40/1 Baron Bolt \u2013 40/1 Sir Maximillian \u2013 50/1 Raucous \u2013 50/1 Fighting Irish \u2013 66/1 Straight Right \u2013 80/1 Marnie James \u2013 80/1 Corinthia Knight \u2013 80/1 Full betting at Oddschecker here Fallout from the Hardwicke Stakes -- Defoe heading for the King George, Masar likely to go back in trip for the Juddmonte International and Nagano Gold has the Arc as his main target. Defoe\u2019s trainer Roger Varian said: \u201cHe is just a lovely horse. He is very straightforward, tries and relaxes and is getting better with age. Hopefully we can bring him back in one piece for the King George. It is up to other people to have their opinion, but I have my opinion of the horse which is very high, and he is backing that up with his performances. We are excited for the rest of the season.\u201d Charlie Appleby, who trains Masar, said: \u201c\u201cI\u2019m delighted to see him back. We had a little bit of a mishap with a bit of a stumble out of the gates and therefore it didn\u2019t materialise quite how we wanted it to. Without speaking to His Highness [Sheikh Mohammed] yet, I\u2019d imagine something potentially like the Juddmonte International, as I wouldn\u2019t mind coming back in trip. \u201cFor me he has still got plenty of boot there.\u201d For a horse with a fair record at this track, Spring Loaded was a big price when betting began on Thursday, though he\u2019s since shortened to 16-1. Paul D\u2019Arcy\u2019s veteran was an unlucky ninth in this last year on his first run of the season and beat 19 rivals to a big pot here next time out. Just 4lb higher and sharper for a Listed-race run at Windsor, he could get involved under his claiming rider. Cape Byron has been clipped to 9-2, which looks very tight for a big-field cavalry charge. He won the Victoria Cup here last month, one of several bits of good course form, and travelled strongly enough to suggest this shorter trip won\u2019t be a problem. Dettori is aboard the second-favourite, Danzeno, now eight years old. A close fifth in this from the same rating a year ago, he won on his reappearance three weeks ago. Hey Jonesy was only beaten a couple of lengths in a Group One here last year. This is only his second handicap but, on the available evidence, his rating does not look especially lenient. Bacchus won this last summer on his first run of the year and tries to turn the same trick, from just a 3lb higher mark. His stable has gone four weeks without a winner. Brilliant performance from Blue Point, quickening up in great style. 1 Blue Point (James Doyle) 6-4 Fav 2 Dream Of Dreams (D Tudhope) 12-1 3 Kachy (R Kingscote) 33-1 17 ran Also: 50-1 Speak In Colours 4th Non Runner: 4 And they\u2019re off ... Kachy is quickly away and goes clear ... Blue Point is well placed ... Emblazoned is there ... Blue Point takes the lead and is all out to beat Dream of Dreams who finishes very fast. All eyes are on Blue Point as he bids to become the first horse since 2003 to win the King\u2019s Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot and follow up in the Diamond Jubilee since Choisir in 2003. Czech mate! ITV Racing\u2019s Francesca Cumani under fire ... Blue Point \u2013 7/4 City of Light \u2013 15/2 Invincible Army \u2013 17/2 Le Brivido \u2013 9/1 The Tin Man \u2013 10/1 Bound For Nowhere \u2013 16/1 Sands of Mali \u2013 16/1 Dream of Dreams \u2013 18/1 Emblazoned \u2013 20/1 Yafta \u2013 40/1 Kachy \u2013 40/1 Projection \u2013 50/1 Speak in Colours \u2013 66/1 Keystroke \u2013 66/1 Lims Cruiser \u2013 100/1 Tip Two Win \u2013 100/1 Enzos Lad \u2013 200/1 Full betting at Oddschecker here An international field assembles for the big race on Royal Ascot\u2019s closing card, in which Blue Point tries to add to his victory here on Tuesday. The French raider City Light and Bound From Nowhere, from the US, are to be feared, while other contenders have travelled from Singapore and New Zealand. But all of them may struggle to match a horse whose home is just two hours up the road at Newmarket. The Tin Man took this prize in 2017 and was a marginally unlucky fourth last year. He also won here on Champions Day in 2016 and bagged the third Group One of his career at Haydock last autumn. He should be a lot sharper for his first run back at Windsor, when he was giving weight to the first two, and looks the value in the race at 11-1. He seems to have struck up a good partnership with Oisin Murphy. It\u2019s asking a lot for Blue Point to do his thing just four days after running to a very high level on what was, at the time, rain-softened ground. He\u2019s better at five furlongs than six and today\u2019s final furlong could be a long one for him. I\u2019d like to see Tip Two Win run well and the ground is certainly coming in his favour. He was a surprise second in last year\u2019s Guineas, a head in front of Masar. It\u2019s not clear that he has the raw speed to get competitive in a top-class sprint. 1 Defoe (Andrea Atzeni) 11-4 Fav 2 Nagano Gold (C Soumillon) 25-1 3 Mirage Dancer (P J Dobbs) 6-1 8 ran Also: 12-1 Morando 4th Non Runner: 9 Extraordinary run form Nagano Gold in the Hardwicke Stakes. Badly hampered at the start and could well have won but for that \u2013 what does that say about Czech Republic racing and the talent there. Masar was another who had a bad start \u2013 it appears he stumbled at the start and collided with Nagano Gold. And they\u2019re off ... Nagano Gold was hampered at the start and Salouen leads the field in the early stages ... Masar is towards the rear ... Mirage Dancer is second ... Communique is close up ... Southern France is in midfield ... Mirage Dancer kicks for home with Masar challenging ... Nagano Gold comes late and fast but Defoe holds him off. It\u2019s getting even faster ... The return of last year\u2019s Derby winner Masar in the Hardwicke Stakes next is one of the highlights of Royal Ascot. Masar \u2013 11/4 Defoe \u2013 10/3 Southern France \u2013 9/2 Mirage Dancer \u2013 13/2 Salouen \u2013 17/2 Morando \u2013 18/1 Communique \u2013 18/1 Nadano Gold - 50/1 Full betting at Oddschecker here He was quite impressive in last year\u2019s Derby but there\u2019s no way Masar can be the right favourite for this after a year off with a leg injury. Mirage Dancer has some of the right credentials, being from the yard of Sir Michael Stoute, who has won this a record 11 times. Stoute could have run Crystal Ocean in this but switched him to the Prince of Wales on Wednesday, which he won. Was that decision made in the knowledge that he had an able substitute for the Hardwicke? Judging by his Goodwood win, in a race he also won last year, Mirage Dancer is still improving, but this requires a big step forward. Defoe is more convincing, as a Group One winner last time who nonetheless meets these rivals at level weights in a Group Two. It looks like his midwinter gelding operation has helped. His stable was among the winners yesterday. Lah Ti Dar is a non-runner, having failed to eat up, so Dettori\u2019s fans will have to sit on their hands for half an hour. Southern France has attracted support, despite being winless for over a year. He has some solid form at marathon trips, including a close second to Stradivarius last month, but this drying ground will be a problem if he\u2019s at all short of pace at this shorter distance. What Simon says ... racing starting to move with the times 1 Space Traveller (D Tudhope) 25-1 2 Space Blues (James Doyle) 5-2 Fav 3 Angel\u2019s Hideaway (R Havlin) 14-1 18 ran Also: 7-1 Urban Icon 4th And they\u2019re off ... So Perfect and Duke Of Hazzard are out fast but Marie\u2019s Diamond has the lead ... Space Blues is towards the rear ... Duke Of Hazzard challenges ... Space Blues picks up to come through but Space Traveller quickens up the best to win. And Danny Tudhope again \u2013 with his fourth winner of the week. Charlie Appleby told the Racing Post of the winner of the first: \u201cGoing forward, I think something like the Vintage [Stakes at Glorious Goodwood]would suit Pinatubo. The undulations of Goodwood can catch some horses out, but he already has experience of Epsom. You need to be able to travel at Goodwood and that seems to be one of his attributes.\u201d Space Blues \u2013 11/4 So Perfect \u2013 5/1 Urban Icon \u2013 8/1 Happy Power \u2013 17/2 Momkin \u2013 17/2 Angels Hideaway \u2013 14/1 Maries Diamond \u2013 16/1 Bye Bye Hong Kong \u2013 18/1 I Am Superman \u2013 18/1 Space Traveller \u2013 33/1 Duke of Hazzard \u2013 40/1 Western Frontier \u2013 50/1 Fire Fly \u2013 66/1 No Nonsense \u2013 66/1 Masaru \u2013 80/1 On a Session \u2013 100/1 Dubai Dominion \u2013 100/1 Air Hair Lair \u2013 500/1 Full betting at Oddschecker here. There\u2019s a lot to like about the zippy Space Blues but he does not deserve to be half the price of So Perfect. O\u2019Brien\u2019s filly was beaten less than a length in the Queen Mary here last year and later came within half a length of a Group One win against males. The horse that beat her that day was Advertise, a Group One winner again here yesterday. Having needed her first run back, So Perfect powered home at Naas last time and looks ready for seven furlongs. Space Blues has bundles of speed and will be suited by the drying surface. Momkin was a close second in the Craven and excuses could be made for his midfield effort in the Guineas. The step down in class and distance could show Roger Charlton\u2019s colt to advantage. Dettori\u2019s mount, Marie\u2019s Diamond, is of course shortening in the betting but he is winless since July, does not seem to be improving and looks held by Space Blues on Epsom form. Air Hair Lair is not good enough to get involved but it\u2019s pleasing to see his name on a Royal Ascot racecard just the same \u2013 try saying it to yourself in your poshest, most nasal voice. That was fast ... the ground definitely on the fast side of good and Pinatubo looks very useful. William Hill are 10-1 for the 2,000 Guineas. Trainer Charlie Appleby told ITV Racing: \u201cI\u2019m delighted. He came here with the right credentials. I was quite confident throughout the race. He just goes out there and does his job.\u201d Winning jockey James Doyle added: \u201cHe\u2019s a horse that shows up nicely on the gallops without setting it alight. He\u2019s a very smart horse and he travelled well. He\u2019s not slow, but I\u2019m sure up to a mile will be within his compass.\u201d 1 Pinatubo (James Doyle) 3-1 2 Lope Y Fernandez (R L Moore) 5-4 Fav 3 Highland Chief (Raul Da Silva) 14-1 14 ran Also: 33-1 Sun Power 4th Non Runners: 3,8,10 And they\u2019re off ... Rose Of Kildare and Dramatic Sands out quickly ... Lope Y Fernandez just behind the leaders ... Harpocrates now prominent ... Lope Y Fernandez has come through but Pinatubo impressively kicks clear under James Doyle for a smooth win. Lope Y Fernandez \u2013 5/4 Pinaturbo \u2013 7/2 Rose of Kildare \u2013 11/1 Year of the Tiger \u2013 14/1 Highland Chief \u2013 14/1 Heaven Forfend \u2013 20/1 Harpocrates \u2013 20/1 Dramatic Sands \u2013 28/1 Sun Power \u2013 50/1 United Front \u2013 66/1 Clay Regazzoni \u2013 66/1 Zmile \u2013 100/1 Montanari \u2013 100/1 Ardenlee Star \u2013 100/1 Full betting at Oddschecker here Lope Y Fernandez has obvious claims on his debut win but Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s second-string might be a better option and not for the first time this week. Year Of The Tiger ran a promising race in second the same day, looking as though this step up in trip was needed, and his pedigree promises much. The trainer seems to have developed a soft spot for this race, which he has won twice in the past three years, and only ran a 14-1 shot on the other occasion. Pinatubo is unbeaten in two, most recently in the Woodcote at Epsom, when he ran on strongly, suggesting this extra furlong will be fine. That form does not look strong, however. Rose Of Kildare, the mount of Frankie Dettori, has been steadily cut from 25-1 down to 7s with some firms. Mark Johnston\u2019s filly is the most experienced in the field after five runs and Liberty Beach, who beat her last time, was a good fourth in the Queen Mary here on Wednesday. 1st Green 5-2 The sectional timing, sponsored by Longines, has been an excellent addition to Royal Ascot this week and expert race times analyst and Racing TV pundit James Willoughby has been giving his reaction: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen throughout the week that the way that races are run varies considerably and can have a profound impact on important races. Every section of a race requires, in theory, equal effort from the horse, but that\u2019s not the way races are run. Races are run in a manner that some parts are run much more strongly than others, and horses who gain lengths in those sections need to be upgraded against those who gain their lengths when the pace is slow. \u201cThe difference between the two things is impossible to tell with the eye. The final time of a horse race is fairly pointless, but sectionals help us to understand them to a point where we can catch lightning in a bottle.\u201d Willoughby is still analysing this week\u2019s data but said: \u201cI think Laurens, though only sixth in the Queen Anne, ran an absolute screamer, and that the St James\u2019s Palace winner Circus Maximus should be rated as having won by much further, whereas some analysts believe runner-up King Of Comedy was unlucky. \u201cThe St James\u2019s Palace was slowly run early, but they ran very hard round the bend and into the straight and Circus Maximus put in a huge amount of effort to burn off Too Darn Hot and make it easier for the second and fourth-placed Skardu to close on him. The sectionals for the Norfolk were interesting too, and I believe the winner A\u2019Ali, put in the fastest single furlong so far.\u201d Gay Kelleway, who was the first female rider to win a race at Royal Ascot 32 years before Hayley Turner yesterday, posted this earlier today. As one response to this tweet puts it ... Miaow! Frankie Dettori 7 wins Ryan Moore 5 Danny Tudhope 3 Jim Crowley 1 Oisin Murphy 1 James Doyle 1 Pierre-Charles Boudot 1 Harry Bentley 1 Richard Kingscote 1 Seamie Heffernan 1 David Egan 1 Hayley Turner 1 Dettori has now matched his best ever Royal Ascot of 21 years ago, when one of his winners was Kayf Tara in the Gold Cup. He has six chances to set a new personal best, including the fancied Danzeno and Corelli at the end of the card. Moore has two favourites and a second favourite as he seeks to get the two more winners he needs. If the pair end the day tied, Moore wins on a countback of second places, of which he has six to the Italian\u2019s three. Evidently, the bookies don\u2019t expect that, as Moore is 7-2 while Dettori is 1-5 to hold on. Silvestre de Sousa, who is having a tough week, has four second places. Aidan O\u2019Brien 5 wins Sir Michael Stoute 2 John Gosden 2 William Haggas 2 Mark Johnston 2 Andrew Balding 1 Charlie Hills 1 Charlie Fellowes 1 Roger Varian 1 Ian Williams 1 Charlie Appleby 1 David O\u2019Meara 1 Simon Crisford 1 Ralph Beckett 1 Martyn Meade 1 Francis-Henri Graffard 1 O\u2019Brien seems set fair for another Royal Ascot title, as Stoute only has three runners left, while Haggas has none. Gosden has four and Johnston has five but O\u2019Brien has as many as those two put together. It has been a fine week for the Irishman, though he has had seven beaten favourites along the way (Hermosa, Ten Sovereigns, Magical, Fleeting, Norway, I Can Fly, Magic Wand). The way Michael Stoute campaigns his two-year-olds is as fascinating as his older horses and here\u2019s an interesting stat from the Racing Posts\u2019s Lee Mottershead. Line of Duty comes to Royal Ascot The Telegraph reported today (you can read the full story below in my original tweet) that Bet 3565 was taking the unusual step of turning down multiple bets on Frankie Dettori\u2019s rides after his 449-1 four-timer on Thursday. It seems it\u2019s spreading. 1st Carriage THE QUEEN The Duke of York The Hon. William Vestey Mr. John Warren 2nd Carriage General Sir Adrian Bradshaw Lady Bradshaw Sir Peter Vela Lady Vela 3rd Carriage Mr. Ben Case Mrs. Ben Case Mr. Clive Webb-Carter Mrs. Clive Webb-Carter 4th Carriage Mr. Mark Etherington The Lady Alexandra Etherington Mr. Chris Waller Mrs. Chris Waller I attended a Serpentine gallery exhibition by artist Mark Wallingerback in 1994 when one of his installations, called \u2018Royal Ascot\u2019, consisted of a series of video monitors on top of wheeled flight cases, each isolating the royal carriage\u2019s leisurely progress down the track on the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (respectively, as it was then) of the meeting with the added TV commentary. The British Council described the work thus: \u2018Simultaneous footage exposes precise choreography: the Queen\u2019s frozen smile and rigid curls, the tilt of her head, her gloved wave, the Duke of Edinburgh raising his top hat, the national anthem striking up. Appropriately for an event whose media coverage focuses on the parade of hats and dresses rather than the sport, here we have a close-up on clothes, on the Queen\u2019s dolly mixture of pinks, tangerines, limes; the difference from day to day is barely discernible, just as the four BBC commentaries merge in a confused blather. This repetition of imagery, all backed by bright green turf, brings into play Andy Warhol\u2019s late screenprints of Elizabeth II from his \u2018Reigning Queens\u2019 series (1985), a quartet of the postage stamp icon in camp conjugations of Hollywood make-up and bubblegum colours.\u2019 The Duke of Edinburgh, who has retired from royal duties and apparently hated his trips down the road from Windsor Castle to the races, is missing but little else has changed including the blather. This is last year\u2019s Royal Procession on the Saturday \u2013 see if you can spot the difference. This is a great little feature with some terrific pics on Ireland\u2019s junior jockeys in the Observer tomorrow. Take a look ... As revealed yesterday, Ladbrokes have given up on this having been stung this week. William Hill are still joining in and report good money for yellow, from 5-1 in to 3\u2019s, Rupert Adams stating: \u201cWe know the Queen is a favourite of yellow and we think she will roll it out for the final day of the Royal meeting.\u201d \u201cThis year\u2019s hat stakes have taken an interesting turn as bookies, again, suspended betting this morning, said a spokesperson for W2.bet. \u201cPink was a very popular pick yesterday and got punters back on track after some interesting turns this week. But in the end, so far, the hat stakes have been won by punters. Today\u2019s favourite is yellow, followed by white/cream and then purple.\u201d Frankie Dettori\u2019s getting rides everywhere now! Many thanks to all who took part in our tipping competitions this week! Our winners will be contacted by email by Monday. They were: Tuesday: fallguy99 Wednesday: melonk Thursday: JimmyDeuce Friday: mycopia23 We\u2019re not running a tipping competition today, as we\u2019ve found in the past that Saturday attracts fewer players. But do please share your selections and fancies below. If enough people get involved, we\u2019ll review this for next year. You want to know what\u2019s going to win, right? Here are our selections for the final day at Royal Ascot. Stay here and we\u2019ll have an in-depth preview for every race as the afternoon goes on. 2.30 Chesham Stakes Year Of The Tiger 14-1 3.05 Jersey Stakes So Perfect (nap) 5-1 3.40 Hardwicke Stakes Defoe (nb) 7-2 4.20 Diamond Jubilee Stakes The Tin Man 11-1 5.00 Wokingham Handicap Spring Loaded 14-1 5.35 Queen Alexandra Stakes Younevercall 6-1 But never mind those, let\u2019s talk about the five winners on Friday ... If I could live a day\u2019s racing over and over, it would be that one. And I have no regrets about the Sandringham, which I always find difficult; there is just no way I could have picked Thanks Be. So I dare say today will be a 0/6 and bump back to Earth, but I still like the look of a few of these, especially So Perfect, who seems strong in the betting. Spring Loaded\u2019s price has collapsed, at last in part because the influential Hugh Taylor has also put him up. Younevercall seems popular. I\u2019m surprised The Tin Man is so big, having so much good course form to his name. Mark your card. These are not turning up, for the various reasons outlined. 2.30pm Chesham Stakes 3 DARK KRIS (Going) 10 MOHICAN HEIGHTS (Going) 3.40pm Hardwicke Stakes 9 LAH TI DAR (Self Certificate, Not Eaten Up) 5.00pm Wokingham Heritage Handicap 14 MERHOOB (IRE) (Going)2 5 ALBA POWER (IRE) (Vet\u2019s Certificate, Lame) 28 RECON MISSION (IRE) (Going) 5.35pm Queen Alexandra Stakes 8 LE MAITRE CHAT (USA) (Going) The going for the fifth day of Royal Ascot 2019 has changed to Good, Good to Firm in places (from Good on the straight course and Good, Good to Soft in places on the round course at the end of Friday) It has been dry since racing on Wednesday when there was 10 millimetres of rain. A dry and sunny day is forecast, with temperatures up to 22 degrees Celsius. Chris Stickels, clerk of the course at Ascot, said at 9.00am: \u201cIt is a lovely, bright, dry and sunny morning. We have now been dry since Wednesday and the track is drying out really nicely.\u201d GoingStick Readings at 8.15am today: Stand side: 8.2, Centre: 8.4, Far Side: 8.1. Round: 6.7 (Friday GoingStick readings: Stand side: 7.4, Centre: 7.6, Far Side: 7.4. Round: 6.0) (Thursday GoingStick readings: Stand side: 7.0, Centre: 7.0, Far Side: 7.0. Round: 5.7) (Wednesday GoingStick readings: Stand side: 8.2, Centre: 8.4, Far Side: 8.2. Round: 7.2) (Tuesday GoingStick readings: Stand side: 8.9, Centre: 8.9, Far Side: 8.7, Round: 7.4) Stalls Straight Course: Centre; Round Course: Inside And so we face the final curtain for this Royal Ascot. It\u2019s the people\u2019s day, insofar as any day at this venue can ever carry such a label, when more folk are able to attend and a crowd of around 70,000 packs out the stand. More than any other day this week, the train takes the strain, as an estimated 30,000 normally travel here by the Waterloo-Reading line on the Saturday of the Royal meeting, so we will find out how much disruption is caused by the continuing industrial action by rail staff. The Queen\u2019s track is bathed in warm sunshine and we finally have the sort of weather you\u2019d like to expect in mid-June. The famously free-drying track is described as good to firm in places and GoingStick readings also suggest that any horses in need of soft are basically sunk. This is a day to be backing zippy types with quick actions who float across the turf, raising memories of Danehill, Habibti and other great sprinters with their names on the trophies here. Speaking of greats, Frankie Dettori is back, trying to find the one extra winner he needs to make this his best Royal Ascot ever at the age of 48. I\u2019m afraid he is one down already, as Lah Ti Dar, his intended mount in the Hardwicke, has been withdrawn after failing to eat up. I\u2019ve already heard one punter talking of combining the Italian\u2019s mounts in multiple bets - but first he must find a bookie still prepared to take such bets. Hayley Turner is not here, alas. Yesterday, she became only the second female jockey to ride a winner at Royal Ascot but today her business takes her to Newmarket and Lingfield. The only woman riding here is Megan Nicholls, booked by her father for Black Corton in the very last race. Black Corton is not without his chance in the Queen Alexandra, his very first Flat race, and it will be remembered that he has done several good turns for another female jockey, Bryony Frost, who won her first Grade One on him two Christmases ago. But the meat of the afternoon is the two sprints, the classy Diamond Jubilee at 4.20pm and the unsolveable Wokingham at 5pm. They are Royal Ascot in miniature, over before you know it after a tonne of preparation. But the memories will be sweet if you can pinpoint either winner. Be lucky!",

So avoid grabbing, if you possibly can, the nearest Thomas Pynchon or Virginia Woolf. On the other hand, something overly dumb or badly written is also off the cards as it can be too aesthetically upsetting \u2013 no Jeffrey Archer or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/24/el-james-new-romance-thrashed-critics-no-1-the-mister-fifty-shades\" title=\"\">EL James</a> (or <em>The Little Book of Calm</em> for that matter).</p> <p>Historical fiction is a great way to de-stress.

      "bodyText": "Q: What can I read to help me de-stress after a bad day at work? Health worker at a regional trauma centre, 63 A: Novelist Tim Lott, whose latest book, When We Were Rich (Scribner, \u00a316.99), will be published on 27 June, writes: You do not want anything that requires too much mental effort. So avoid grabbing, if you possibly can, the nearest Thomas Pynchon or Virginia Woolf. On the other hand, something overly dumb or badly written is also off the cards as it can be too aesthetically upsetting \u2013 no Jeffrey Archer or EL James (or The Little Book of Calm for that matter). Historical fiction is a great way to de-stress. I read Golden Hill by Francis Spufford last year and as intelligent a book I have rarely read. Or try JG Farrell\u2019s great The Siege of Krishnapur. A short thriller is also a lovely way to relax \u2013 try Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter by Tom Franklin for a masterclass in absorption. And, of course, How to Be Idle by Tom Hodgkinson if you\u2019re in the habit of working too hard. I find short stories unsatisfying, so I stick to essays by Tom Wolfe or John Steinbeck for a brief dip before I fall asleep. Wolfe\u2019s Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers is my favourite, an extended essay way ahead of its time. Steinbeck\u2019s best collection is Of Men and Their Making. You could try laughing yourself back to sanity. Anything by PG Wodehouse, of course \u2013 The Code of the Woosters is as good as any, and early William Boyds are witty without being trite. Anne Tyler\u2019s The Accidental Tourist is a great book about recovering from trauma (if you think you\u2019ve had a bad day, you\u2019ve nothing on Macon Leary). If you want a new worldview to help you think about stress in the long term, read some Zen texts \u2013 Alan Watts\u2019s The Meaning of Happiness \u2013 is a masterpiece of de-stressing in 120 pages, and Lin Yutang\u2019s The Importance of Living has the advantage of being funny as well as wise.

Sound familiar? | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I am struck by Clegg\u2019s decision to walk away from the gravest political crisis of his life. Because the Labour leadership failed to oppose Brexit, the \u201cminor\u201d parties increased in significance, as did politicians such as Clegg and Tony Blair, whose sell-by date seemed long passed. Say what you liked about them, but at least they were fighting back. Clegg said Brexit was a battle that had to be won, then fled the field as the struggle began.</p> <p>The same temptation in a different form diverts people who see themselves as committed activists. If they but realised it, they would understand that they too are opting out of necessary fights and making a nonsense of their professed principles. They say Brexit is a calamity, but their behaviour shows they don\u2019t believe it. They say they oppose an archaic first-past-the-post system that forces the public to choose between two discredited parties. But they do nothing to overcome its biases.</p> <p>Rob Ford, Manchester University\u2019s professor of political science, ran the numbers for me.

      "bodyText": "You may not know it but you are about to become Nick Clegg. I don\u2019t want to become Nick Clegg, I hear you protest. The idea is not only repellent but ridiculous. Facebook won\u2019t offer me \u00a31m-plus a year and a Silicon Valley mansion if I sell out. I agree that it won\u2019t. But opting out is far more common than selling out and Clegg is the market leader in both. I called him in October 2018 to check a point in a piece I was writing. I should have paid more attention to the note of alarm when he realised that a journalist was on the phone. He told me he was in Sheffield. Ah, I said, you are preparing to fight Sheffield Hallam again. He lost the seat to a mentally troubled Labour candidate, who poured out levels of abuse against women, gay people and his own constituents that were too much even for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party. Clegg could have retaken the constituency with ease and gone back to Westminster to champion the Remain cause. He almost laughed at my quaint suggestion. No, he wasn\u2019t thinking of returning to politics. Two days later, I learned why when news broke of his new career. Technology specialists can describe the awfulness of a Liberal Democrat accepting the position of vice-president at a rapacious wannabe monopoly that has facilitated the corruption of liberal democracy by Putin and the super-rich and allowed the mass murder of Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya Muslims to be incited on its site. I am struck by Clegg\u2019s decision to walk away from the gravest political crisis of his life. Because the Labour leadership failed to oppose Brexit, the \u201cminor\u201d parties increased in significance, as did politicians such as Clegg and Tony Blair, whose sell-by date seemed long passed. Say what you liked about them, but at least they were fighting back. Clegg said Brexit was a battle that had to be won, then fled the field as the struggle began. The same temptation in a different form diverts people who see themselves as committed activists. If they but realised it, they would understand that they too are opting out of necessary fights and making a nonsense of their professed principles. They say Brexit is a calamity, but their behaviour shows they don\u2019t believe it. They say they oppose an archaic first-past-the-post system that forces the public to choose between two discredited parties. But they do nothing to overcome its biases. Rob Ford, Manchester University\u2019s professor of political science, ran the numbers for me. First past the post is a \u201cnon-linear\u201d system or, as others might put it, a dazzlingly stupid way to organise a modern democracy. The Liberal Democrats could get 18% of the vote and be stuck with the 12 MPs they have now. They could get 23% and see that number rise to a mere 20 MPs.

If the pattern of continental politics is repeated, and one of the paradoxes of Brexit is that it is making Britain resemble the rest of Europe, the Greens will fight Labour in the cosmopolitan cities, as they fight the socialists and social democrats in France and Germany, and the Liberal Democrats will fight the Tories in the shires. Explain the need for Remainer co-operation and activists shudder. They prefer the purity of failure to the compromises that breaking out of our decaying system entails.

      "body": "<p>Kevin Barry was born in Limerick in 1969. His debut novel, <em>City of Bohane</em>, won the 2013 Impac Dublin literary award and was shortlisted for the Costa first novel award. His next novel, <em>Beatlebone</em> (2015), was the winner of the Goldsmiths prize, which rewards British and Irish fiction that \u201cbreaks the mould or extends the possibilities of the novel form\u201d. The book imagines John Lennon travelling to the west coast of Ireland in 1978 to try to reach the small island of Dorinish, which the musician had actually bought in 1967 for \u00a31,700. Barry described his approach as \u201cgoing as wild as I can within my stories\u201d. His new novel, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/night-boat-to-tangier-9781782116172.html\" title=\"\"><em>Night Boat to Tangier</em></a>, moves between the fictional town of Berehaven in the west of Ireland and the port of Algeciras in Spain. It features two ageing Irish gangsters who reminisce about their wayward lives while waiting for the arrival of the boat from Tangier, and with it the possibility of finding a missing girl who binds them both.</p> <p><strong><em>Night Boat to Tangier</em></strong><strong>\u2019s protagonists, Charlie and Morris, spend a lot of time waiting and talking. Is it possible for an Irish novelist to write about two characters waiting without Samuel Beckett hanging over proceedings?</strong><br>[Laughs] The short answer is no. If there\u2019s two fellas waiting in a story, Beckett is sitting right there on your shoulder. Interestingly, I saw a Druid theatre production of <em>Waiting for Godot</em> a while back and it was good to be reminded that it\u2019s a comedy. Basically, Charlie and Morris are big, yappy characters who have been hanging around in my head for a while. I tried to fit them into a play and a short story but they ruined both because they were just too big and belligerent.</p> <p><strong>There is a lot revealed in the way they converse</strong><strong>, but also a lot held back or hinted at.</strong><br>Yes, they\u2019re combative characters, but almost in a coded way. There\u2019s always these little secret tussles going on in their conversations. Norman Mailer said: \u201cWhenever two men say hello to each other in the street, one of them loses.\u201d That\u2019s very Irish. There are certain conversations where it can take years to figure out what was actually meant.</p> <p><strong>The location, as ever in your writing, is also central. In this instance, not just the isolation of certain coastal towns in the west of Ireland, but also the transient nature and seediness of ports and terminal ferries.</strong><br>I\u2019ve been bolting to Spain every winter since about 1999. As soon as the grey descends on the west of Ireland, I\u2019m out of there. I tend to drift around a lot of little Spanish towns. That, in itself, is the best kind of research because it doesn\u2019t feel like research. When I went back to Algeciras recently, the area around the port had been cleared up a bit, which was a bit disappointing for my purposes, but the town is still a bit shady. I often write on location, so I did quite a bit of sitting in the ferry terminal with my notebook, scribbling a lot and probably looking a bit mad.</p> <p><strong>Dialogue is also an essential part of your writing. You have a keen ear for the rhythms and energy of Irish rural and urban vernacular speech. </strong><strong>It\u2019s almost as if Charlie and Morris are thinking out loud.</strong><br>Initially, I saw their banter as a kind of shield they were putting up around themselves. Then it came to me that they were in grief, because of what had inevitably happened to them along the way. If you live that kind of life, bad stuff is going to come to you. So then I started to feel warm to them despite their occupations. I also wanted to get that thread of menace that you often find in Harold Pinter\u2019s writing. In <em>The Birthday Party</em>, for instance, you don\u2019t even want to think about what the characters might have done, but you can sense it in their way of talking.</p> <p><strong>So you\u2019re happy to go where your characters take you, rather than start with a fixed idea of who they are?</strong><br>Yes, for me it\u2019s kind of exciting when you can\u2019t get a fix on your characters. Even now that the novel is finished, I still wonder with the two lads, how much is big talk, how much is their personas? So, there\u2019s an ambiguity there which is interesting to me. They were vital characters to spend time with, sometimes scarily so. They were in the room with me, pushing me as I was writing, sometimes where I didn\u2019t want to go.</p> <p><strong>I was intrigued by the female characters</strong><strong> \u2013 Cynthia</strong><strong> and Dilly, her daughter</strong><strong> \u2013 both negotiating, in very different ways, this dangerous but lucrative macho world</strong><strong>.</strong><br>To be honest, they were more difficult to write initially. Dilly is of a generation that is completely unknowable to me, not even a millennial, beyond that. There are no scales over her eyes, she is very clear about what she grew up in, but she also has that strain in her, the wildness. Cynthia is more complicit, pulling the strings in this big criminal enterprise. It makes for an interesting family dynamic, and one from which Dilly is trying to escape.</p> <p><strong>In <em>Beatlebone</em>, you followed John Lennon into the deep west of Ireland, and there was this implied sense that the land itself \u2013 the elemental energy of the Atlantic coast \u2013 might cleanse his anxious soul. It is an almost unearthly presence in many of your stories.</strong><br>I have a very strong feeling of time unfixed in certain landscapes in the west of Ireland. It\u2019s like you\u2019re tuning into the deep stuff when you go there. There are certain places, like the Ox Mountains, where I set an early story [<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/10/29/ox-mountain-death-song\" title=\"\">Ox Mountain Death Song</a>], where time as a chronological concept just does not apply. You might go up there at a certain time of the year and wouldn\u2019t know where you are. People say that Ireland has changed rapidly, and it has, but the old weird Ireland is still out there.</p> <p><strong>In terms of influences, which novelists\u2019 work do you most revisit?</strong><br>I go back to Dermot Healy and John McGahern a lot. Healy\u2019s last book, <em>Long Time, No See</em>, is very strange and underrated. McGahern, of course, is a master. I also go back to Saul Bellow \u2013 <em>Herzog</em> and <em>Humboldt\u2019s Gift</em>, mainly \u2013 and to Don DeLillo just for a view of the mountain. Like everyone else, I\u2019m waiting on the next Hilary Mantel. The two Thomas Cromwell books are masterpieces, and so incredibly contemporary.</p> <p><strong>And who are your favourite non</strong><strong>fiction writers?</strong><br>Joan Didion is consistently brilliant. I recently read <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/south-and-west-from-a-notebook-9780008257200.html\" title=\"\"><em>South </em><em>and West</em></a>, her previously unpublished essays, which was up there with everything else she has written. I also loved John Jeremiah Sullivan\u2019s essay collection, <em>Pulphead</em>. There\u2019s a great young Irish writer, Ian Maleney, whose essays, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/minor-monuments-9781916434202.html\" title=\"\"><em>Minor Monuments</em></a>, were published recently. It\u2019s about growing up in a bog in Offaly and his grandfather\u2019s dementia. He has amazing control for a young writer.</p> <p><strong>Which classic novel have you failed to finish reading?</strong><br>There are a lot of embarrassing gaps in my reading and, until recently, Flaubert\u2019s <em>Madame Bovary</em> was one of them. I thought I\u2019d better give it a go, so I spent three weeks struggling though the horrible thing and then I threw it at the wall. I know I am increasingly drawn to short-sharp-shock novels and that it\u2019s difficult, because of that, to grapple with slower-paced books, but this wasn\u2019t just slow, the pace was glacial. Basically, if you don\u2019t have me in five or 10 pages, you can fuck off.</p> <p>\u2022 Night Boat to Tangier by Kevin Barry is published by Canongate (\u00a314.99).

McGahern, of course, is a master. I also go back to Saul Bellow \u2013 Herzog and Humboldt\u2019s Gift, mainly \u2013 and to Don DeLillo just for a view of the mountain. Like everyone else, I\u2019m waiting on the next Hilary Mantel. The two Thomas Cromwell books are masterpieces, and so incredibly contemporary. And who are your favourite nonfiction writers? Joan Didion is consistently brilliant. I recently read South and West, her previously unpublished essays, which was up there with everything else she has written. I also loved John Jeremiah Sullivan\u2019s essay collection, Pulphead. There\u2019s a great young Irish writer, Ian Maleney, whose essays, Minor Monuments, were published recently. It\u2019s about growing up in a bog in Offaly and his grandfather\u2019s dementia. He has amazing control for a young writer. Which classic novel have you failed to finish reading? There are a lot of embarrassing gaps in my reading and, until recently, Flaubert\u2019s Madame Bovary was one of them. I thought I\u2019d better give it a go, so I spent three weeks struggling though the horrible thing and then I threw it at the wall. I know I am increasingly drawn to short-sharp-shock novels and that it\u2019s difficult, because of that, to grapple with slower-paced books, but this wasn\u2019t just slow, the pace was glacial. Basically, if you don\u2019t have me in five or 10 pages, you can fuck off. \u2022 Night Boat to Tangier by Kevin Barry is published by Canongate (\u00a314.99).

They are certainty not the most fluid attackers in the tournament, and have little of the flair that DR Congo can summon, but Uganda are a decent unit and a menace from setpieces.

      "bodyText": "The Cranes are off to a flier thanks to a thoroughly deserved victory, their first at the Africa Cup of Nations for 41 years! They were the better team in all departments - more organised, more dynamic, smarter and sharper. Kaddu and Okwi scored the goal from setpieces but Uganda were also dominant in open play. This was an impressive performance and sets them up nicely for possible progression to the next round. DR Congo were frankly dreadful. 90+1 min: Wait? actually, Uganda are trying to increase their lead. They cut through Congo\u2019s ragged midfield again before slipping in Muleme, whose shot on the run whizzes over. 90 min: Uganda will have to wait at least three more minutes before they can celebrate. 88 min: Juuko and Muleme join forces to dispossess Elia on the left wing. Uganda substitution: Awany on, Miya off. 86 min: Assombalonga wins a foul about 40 yards out.The freekick is curled into the area but Wasswa nods it back out. 84 min: Lovely footwork again in midfield by Miya. He has been my man of the match today. Like his teammates he has worked tirelessly, and also been very nimble in possession and a precise and clever distributor of the ball. 83 min: Elia dinks in a teasing cross from the left. Onyango rises high above Assombalonga to make a safe catch. Uganda substitution: Muleme on, Lumala off. 79 min: As Lumala is carried off the pitch on a stretcher after a heavy fall following a challenge with Bolingi, Azira rushes up to the referee to ask how much time is remaining. Uganda are close to their first victory in this tournament for 41 years ... 77 min: Okwi receives the ball mid-way inside the Congolese half and is allowed to turn and jog towards the box. When a defender eventually comes to confront him, Okwi sidesteps him easily .... and then tonks the ball way over the bar. Uganda substitution: Kyambaddde on, Kaddu off after a fine performance. 74 min: Bakambu - hugely disappointing so far - miscontrols in the Congolese box, allowing Wasswa to hammer the ball clear. 71 min: The excellent Kaddu works back to nick the ball off Masuaku: Uganda\u2019s dynamism has been in stark contrast to the sluggishness of Dr Congo all day, and no one has encapsulated it better than Kaddu. DR Congo substitution: Assombolanga on, Bolasie off after making no impact. 70 min: Elia clips a decent cross into the area. It headed back out. But Bop\u00e9 hooks it back in, and Bolingi nods it over the keeper ... and on to the crossbar! 68 min: Lumala hurtles down the right, leaving Masuaku panting in his wake. Then he delivers a nicely aimed cross. Kaddu gets to it first ... but doesn\u2019t make a true connection, scuffing the ball wide from seven yards! 66 min: Kaddu finds space again in the Congolese box and chests the ball back for Okwi, who cracks a half-volley against the post! 64 min: Elia drops his shoulder and darts in-field from the left wing, then unloads a shot that takes a deflection. Bolinghi stretches out a leg in a bid to turn it into the net but the keeper snaffles the ball first and cops a bang of Bolingi\u2019s boot. No real harm done, though. DR Congo substitution: Maghoma on, Mbemba off. 63 min: Bop\u00e9 gives away yet another freekick. presenting Uganda with a shooting opportunity from about 25 yards. The freekick is almost bang centre. Miya curls it over the wall but into the arms of Matampi. 61 min: Okwi cuts in from the right wing and tries to arrow a shot into the far corner. But instead he finds an empty seat in the stands. Which isn\u2019t hard considering about 95% of them are empty. 59 min: Uganda have to do a bit of serious defending for the first time in the second half. And they don\u2019t do it particularly well, as Bope is left free to meet a delivery from Bolasie from the right. But Bope\u2019s header is even worse than the defending, as he misses the target by about six yards. 56 min: Miya sends a superb dipping freekick from 30 yards towards the top corner ... but Mutampi keeps his eye on it and backpedals to tip it over the bar. 54 min: DR Congo can\u2019t string two passes together at the moment. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re frazzled by Uganda\u2019s relative strength and slickness. 53 min: Bope booked for flicking out a foot at Miya in midfield. Pure frustration. DR Congo look off the pace and ragged. DR Congo substitution: Bolingi on, M\u2019Poku off. 50 min: We knew beforehand that Uganda were dangerous from setpieces and both their goals have come from them (the first from a corner, the second a freekick). But the fact is they have also been the far superior team in open play. If it carries on like this, they are not only going to win this match, they are going to do so emphatically. Having been fouled for the freekick, Okwi takes his revenge by sending a superb back header into the net from 12 yards. The delivery from Miya was beautiful, inviting Okwi to guide it into the net, which he did perfectly. As for DR Congo\u2019s defenders, they were mere spectators. 47 min: Congo remain second to the ball all over the pitch. And a slovenly tackle by Issama on Okwi gives Uganda a freekick on the left wing. Danger here ... 46 min: Dr Congo restart the game, but have they rebooted their system during the break? They need a drastic improvement to get the better of Uganda now. It\u2019s been an excellent half from the underdogs, who fully deserve to be in front. In fact, they may be disappointed not to have a bigger lead - they have been by far the sharper and more coherent team, dominant in midfield and, with Kaddu, have an attacker whose movement is causing regular problems. Before this game DR Congo talked about winning this tournament but they\u2019re heading for an embarrassing defeat if they don\u2019t buck up their ideas. 45+2 min: DR Congo scramble a corner away as Mugabi threatened to turn it into the net from close range. 45+1 min: Bolasie latches on to a long clearance from the back. As he tries to wriggle into a shooting position at the edge of the box, he\u2019s clattered by Juuku. But the referee spots the Bolasie was going down before being hit so books him for diving. 45 min: Aucho intercepts a stay pass in midfield and begins building yet another Ugandan attack. DR Congo are frankly a mess at the moment. 44 min: Masuakupicks out a nice low pass to Bakambu, who collects it with his back to goal. He pulls away from the defender and gets off a shot on the turn ... it\u2019s heading towards the bottom corner until Onyango plunges to his right and pushes it out for a corner! 42 min: Miya cracks one just over t he bar from the edge of the area. 40 min: Miya races on to a threaded pass into the box, beating the keeper to it and then going down. No penalty! There\u2019s no doubt the attacker was first to the ball but the ref seems to have turned down the appeals because he went down before actually being touched by the keeper. 38 min: Impish skill by Miya in midfield, as he rides one tackle and then gracefully sidesteps another before being brought down. The Ugandan midfielders in general have been far better than their opponents. 37 min: Kaddu embarks on a strong run down the left before being upended by Luyindama. That gives Uganda an opportunity to send in a freekick from the left. Miya\u2019s delivery is so bad he even laughs at it himself! He kicked the ground before the ball. 35 min: Juuko booked for a sneaky tackle in midfield on Mbemba, who was threatening to instigate a counter-attack. 33 min: Play resumes and Uganda continue to be the sharper, tidier side. They\u2019re outplaying DR Congo, simple as that. 31 min: Very sensibly, the referee calls for a pause so that players can take on board some water. It\u2019s boiling out there. 30 min: Bolasie runs in to meet a corner at the back post ... but bumps into his Bakambu and thus makes a mess of his header: the goal was at his mercy from eight yards! 29 min: Aucho has a blast with his left foot from 25 yards. It\u2019s a ferocious effort and takes a little deflection, but Matampi deals with it well, diving to his left and clasping it safely to his chest. 26 min: \u201cTell you what, a good enough defence from Uganda might just block out the equaliser and earn them a shock victory,\u201d parps Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m thinking too far ahead, but tell me this about the team -- how\u2019s Uganda\u2019s defence?\u201d So far, so good, Abhijato, except for that moment of laxity when Bakambu was left free to receive the ball on the edge of the area. Fortunately for Uganda, they got away with that one. Apart from that they\u2019ve done well, and Bolasie has now switched from the left wing to the right in the hope of having more success there. 24 min: Bolasie does well to hold on to the ball in midfield under tenacious pestering by Aucho. But Dr Congo\u2019s attack ends with a rather desperate effort from long range by Bope. 21 min: The Leopards can\u2019t play their way through midfield because of their own lack of cohesion and the dynamism and organisation of Uganda. It\u2019s a poor show so far from the Congolese, but Cranes fans must be delighted with how superior their team have looked so far. 19 min: Kaddu peels away from the Congolese defence again, this time to connect with a lovely cross from the right by Walusimbi. Kaddu heads for goal from a difficult angle, and Matampi beats his shot away. A panicky Congolese defence complete the clearance. They\u2019re all over the shop back there! Kaddu\u2019s movement has them all a-fluster. 17 min: That was a perfect header by Kaddu, who celebrated with uplifting joy. And the 23-year-old who plays for Kampala Capital City Authority should have scored another just now - after eluding the Leopards\u2019 negligent defenders, he latched on to a cross from the right but guided his header wide from eight yards! The Cranes takes a shock lead thanks to a tremendous near-post header by Kaddu from an inswinging corner by Miya! 14 min: Lumala dashes down the right and delivers a good cross, which Miya heads out for a corner. 13 min: The Ugandan defence is prised part easily with a pass from the left by Mbemba. Bakambu mis-controls when through on goal, knocking the ball behind him so that he has to turn back and then shoot on the swivel. His ensuing shot from the edge of the box hasn\u2019t enough to trouble Onyango in goal. 12 min: Bokadi strides through midfield before inviting Bolasie to go on a scamper down the left. But Mugabi does well to prevent the winger from making gains. 10 min: Uganda have pushed their opponents on the back foot over the last few minutes, without creating any openings yet. 8 min: Okwi charges down an attempted clearance by Luyindama, clobbering the man in the process. The Moroccan ref decides against a booking, in keeping with the lenient spirit shown in the tournament\u2019s opener last night. 6 min: Uganda attack for the first time. Lumala collects the ball with his back to goal wide on the right and then turns sharply and sets off on a buzzing run in-field. He looks for a one-two with Okwi but it doesn\u2019t come off. 5 min: Luyindula launches a long ball towards Bakambu, who can\u2019t get on the end of it. 3 min: Tisserand launches himself at a dangerous cross from the left wing. He misses it by millimetres, so next Bolasie tries. But he, too, fails to get his head to the ball so the cross flies wide, much to the relief of Uganda. 1 min: DR Congo v Uganda is go! It hasn\u2019t exactly captured the imagination of the Egyptian public, apparently, because there seems to be more people (23) on the pitch than in the stands. No matter, some good action is in store. The players are on the pitch, doing their last stretches and knockabouts. Kickoff is nigh ... While the teams limber up, you might like to have a gander at this little piece on Mauritania, who\u2019ll be making their tournament debut on Monday against Mali. They\u2019ve come along way: DR Congo: Matampi; Mpeko, Luyindama, Mbemba, Tisserand, Masuaku, M\u2019Poku, Bokadi, Elia, Bolasie, Bakambu Subs: Muzinga, Ungenda, Akolo, Mputu, Bolingi, Moke, Mossi, Assombolanga, Maghoma, Shabani, Mandanda Uganda: Onyango; Mugabi, Walusimbi, Wasswa, Juuko; Azira; Aucho, Miya, Lumala; Okwi, Kaddu Subs: Odongkara, Ochaya, Awany, Lwanga, Kizito, Nsibambi, Mukiibi, Kateregga, Wadada, Magoola, Muleme, Kyambadde Hello and welcome.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has said that if Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon, it will be prosperous and have the US president as \u201ca best friend\u201d \u2013 but also warned that the Islamic Republic would be \u201cobliterated\u201d in any war between the two countries. Trump\u2019s remarks on Saturday morning came in the wake of his eleventh-hour decision to call off airstrikes in reprisal for the downing of a US surveillance drone. They are significant in that they differ starkly from the official line of his own administration: that Iran must fulfil a list of 12 US demands before sanctions can be lifted. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to have a nuclear weapon,\u201d Trump told reporters before leaving the White House for Camp David. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have Iran have a nuclear weapon. \u201cWhen they agree to that, they\u2019re going to have a wealthy country. They\u2019re going to be so happy, and I\u2019m going to be their best friend. I hope that happens.\u201d Iran has insisted it has no intention of acquiring nuclear weapons and the International Atomic Energy Agency has said there is no recent evidence of development or experimentation with weaponisation. Iran has so far stuck to the limits on its nuclear programme agreed in a multilateral 2015 agreement. But more than a year after Trump pulled the US out of the deal and imposed severe sanctions, the government in Tehran is threatening to break some of those agreed limits. Iran has defended the shooting down of a US navy Global Hawk drone on Thursday morning, saying it had entered Iranian airspace. A senior commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards struck a defiant note on Saturday, in comments quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). Brig Gen Amirali Hajizadeh, head of the Guards\u2019 aerospace division, said: \u201cThis is our response to a violation of Iranian space and if the violation is repeated then our response will be repeated. It\u2019s possible that this infringement of the Americans was carried out by a general or some operators.\u201d Hajizadeh appeared to be mirroring Trump\u2019s suggestion that the shooting down of the drone was the work of a rogue Iranian general. Trump said he would be holding meetings to discuss the standoff with Iran. In his remarks, he seemed to confirm for the first time an Iranian claim that there was a manned US spy plane in the air near the Global Hawk when the drone was brought down. \u201cThere was a plane with 38 people yesterday, did you see that?\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a big story. They had it in their sights and they didn\u2019t shoot it down. I think they were very wise not to do that. And we appreciate that they didn\u2019t do that. I think that was a very wise decision.\u201d In an interview for NBC\u2019s Meet the Press taped on Friday but due to air on Sunday, Trump said if a conflict did break out there would be \u201cobliteration like you\u2019ve never seen before\u201d. \u201cBut I\u2019m not looking to do that,\u201d he said, making clear that potential that Iran might build nuclear weapons was his sole concern. Last May, secretary of state Mike Pompeo laid down 12 conditions for the normalisation of US-Iran relations, which included nuclear demands but also limits on missile development, withdrawal from Syria and an end to support for Houthi rebels in Yemen.

      "body": "<p>As a player, I loved the pressure of the big time moments that occur during the World Cup\u2019s knockout rounds. You feel more butterflies, a bit more stress and a little bit more excitement. Training sessions are more intense. Everything goes up a few more notches. You think you have given it your all during the group-stage games but then you learn that there\u2019s another level to reach for in the knockout stages. You know that if you lose, you go home. The intensity goes up and those who embrace that pressure can find it to be fun. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/21/women-world-cup-2019-power-rankings-usa-england\">Women\u2019s World Cup 2019 power rankings: USA top and England third | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s different for coaches. We\u2019d see the stress build up in them months before the tournament even began. They would scout other teams and start to worry if opponents played well in pre-tournament friendlies. They\u2019d play around with our tactics and try new things, especially defensively and work on gamesmanship like wasting time. Doubt starts to creep in for the coaching staff. I\u2019ve seen every coach go through this stage. They have to figure out how to hide their own nerves from the players. We all live in hotels and travel together so many of the players \u2013 especially the veterans \u2013 are aware of and tune in with every little thing that goes on while younger players perhaps remain oblivious entrenched in television and on their phones. </p> <p>We\u2019re not naive to the situation. The power of the players is that they can actually take the pressure off the coaching staff when a tournament starts. They can have a great training session and help to provide a great environment where everyone is feeling confident and more relaxed. There is laughter and even a few extra curse words at training, a combination that is a beautiful energy. It\u2019s the players who control the environment and the coaches can step back and take a deep breath. That doesn\u2019t mean everything will be perfect, but coaches must know they can trust the players they\u2019ve chosen and are now dependent upon. </p> <p>During the group stage, I was really impressed by Rose Lavelle, Lindsey Horan and Sam Mewis in the United States midfield. They\u2019ve been superb. Many people think a US attack with Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Tobin Heath is our strongest quality but, so far this young midfield has provided the USA with such control of the game. They could perhaps be one of the best midfields we have ever seen. Rose, Lindsay and Sam really control the tempo of a game very well when they play together. For me, Julie Ertz is not a natural midfielder. She\u2019s an incredible center back and I think it\u2019s her best position. She is so dominant and she\u2019s one of the best defenders in the world. I enjoyed playing behind her in goal. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/21/uswnt-sweden-takeaways-world-cup\">Confident USA riding high entering Women's World Cup knockout stage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I haven\u2019t seen any nerves from any American first-time World Cup players like Rose. She still has to prove herself over the entire tournament but I was really impressed with how she played against Sweden \u2013 it was a great test for her. It\u2019s incredibly impressive that the US has played a number of different players and have shown different playing styles over the first three games. It means that they\u2019re not going to be 100% predictable and opponents will have to decide how to approach the game when they meet the United States.</p> <p>Assuming the US beat Spain, and that France does beat Brazil, the quarter-final match between France and the US could be one of the most epic matches in the history of women\u2019s football. I couldn\u2019t have imagined anything being more exciting than the 2011 quarter-final match between the USA and Brazil in terms of drama and emotion: a Brazil penalty (that I saved but had to be re-taken when one of our players encroached), a US red card, a late US equalizer in extra-time, and a penalty shootout. </p> <p>The 2011 World Cup in Germany was so special. There was a great atmosphere that reverberated throughout the country. We were playing in old cities with cobblestone walkways and packed stadiums. We played in front of football-intelligent crowds. There were viewing parties where fans could watch games on huge screens in town centers. The World Cup seemed to be everywhere and you couldn\u2019t ignore it. Which is why I had high expectations for France this year. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/19/hope-solo-sweden-cowards-comments-womens-world-cup-2019\">I was punished for calling Sweden cowards, but now rawness is accepted | Hope Solo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019d imagined it would be more like Germany rather than Canada in 2015. When we were in Winnipeg in 2015 many people had no idea that there was even a World Cup going on. So I was surprised that as we have traveled across France there\u2019s not the same atmosphere as Germany. It\u2019s even stranger considering how much the attitude towards women\u2019s soccer has changed in France. </p> <p>When I lived in France in 2005 no one cared about women\u2019s football. In every Uber or taxi that I\u2019ve taken in the past few weeks, the oftentimes older male drivers make a point to tell me that they won\u2019t be working when France plays and that they want to make sure they are able to bring their sons to the match or at least watch the national team play with their boys. </p> <p>There has been a shift in support for women\u2019s football from the public, even from the older generation. I just wish that the local organizing committee had shown as much support and trust as the fans, coaches and the players are trying to. It would be great to see the tournament\u2019s organizers raise their intensity over the next few weeks, too. Atmosphere can help new fans fall in love with the game. </p> <p>Still, USA-France in 2019 could be worthy of a final itself. The US and France are similar teams. They both like to attack and do so in a variety of different ways. They have strong ability from set pieces, both teams have speed, and both teams know how to play as a team. Both teams have questions about their defenses as do most teams in this World Cup. </p> <p>This is not a tournament of sound defense but rather a tournament for goalscorers.</p>",

You think you have given it your all during the group-stage games but then you learn that there\u2019s another level to reach for in the knockout stages. You know that if you lose, you go home. The intensity goes up and those who embrace that pressure can find it to be fun. It\u2019s different for coaches. We\u2019d see the stress build up in them months before the tournament even began. They would scout other teams and start to worry if opponents played well in pre-tournament friendlies. They\u2019d play around with our tactics and try new things, especially defensively and work on gamesmanship like wasting time. Doubt starts to creep in for the coaching staff. I\u2019ve seen every coach go through this stage. They have to figure out how to hide their own nerves from the players. We all live in hotels and travel together so many of the players \u2013 especially the veterans \u2013 are aware of and tune in with every little thing that goes on while younger players perhaps remain oblivious entrenched in television and on their phones. We\u2019re not naive to the situation. The power of the players is that they can actually take the pressure off the coaching staff when a tournament starts. They can have a great training session and help to provide a great environment where everyone is feeling confident and more relaxed. There is laughter and even a few extra curse words at training, a combination that is a beautiful energy. It\u2019s the players who control the environment and the coaches can step back and take a deep breath. That doesn\u2019t mean everything will be perfect, but coaches must know they can trust the players they\u2019ve chosen and are now dependent upon. During the group stage, I was really impressed by Rose Lavelle, Lindsey Horan and Sam Mewis in the United States midfield. They\u2019ve been superb. Many people think a US attack with Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Tobin Heath is our strongest quality but, so far this young midfield has provided the USA with such control of the game. They could perhaps be one of the best midfields we have ever seen. Rose, Lindsay and Sam really control the tempo of a game very well when they play together. For me, Julie Ertz is not a natural midfielder. She\u2019s an incredible center back and I think it\u2019s her best position. She is so dominant and she\u2019s one of the best defenders in the world. I enjoyed playing behind her in goal. I haven\u2019t seen any nerves from any American first-time World Cup players like Rose. She still has to prove herself over the entire tournament but I was really impressed with how she played against Sweden \u2013 it was a great test for her. It\u2019s incredibly impressive that the US has played a number of different players and have shown different playing styles over the first three games. It means that they\u2019re not going to be 100% predictable and opponents will have to decide how to approach the game when they meet the United States. Assuming the US beat Spain, and that France does beat Brazil, the quarter-final match between France and the US could be one of the most epic matches in the history of women\u2019s football. I couldn\u2019t have imagined anything being more exciting than the 2011 quarter-final match between the USA and Brazil in terms of drama and emotion: a Brazil penalty (that I saved but had to be re-taken when one of our players encroached), a US red card, a late US equalizer in extra-time, and a penalty shootout. The 2011 World Cup in Germany was so special. There was a great atmosphere that reverberated throughout the country. We were playing in old cities with cobblestone walkways and packed stadiums. We played in front of football-intelligent crowds. There were viewing parties where fans could watch games on huge screens in town centers. The World Cup seemed to be everywhere and you couldn\u2019t ignore it. Which is why I had high expectations for France this year. I\u2019d imagined it would be more like Germany rather than Canada in 2015. When we were in Winnipeg in 2015 many people had no idea that there was even a World Cup going on. So I was surprised that as we have traveled across France there\u2019s not the same atmosphere as Germany. It\u2019s even stranger considering how much the attitude towards women\u2019s soccer has changed in France. When I lived in France in 2005 no one cared about women\u2019s football. In every Uber or taxi that I\u2019ve taken in the past few weeks, the oftentimes older male drivers make a point to tell me that they won\u2019t be working when France plays and that they want to make sure they are able to bring their sons to the match or at least watch the national team play with their boys. There has been a shift in support for women\u2019s football from the public, even from the older generation. I just wish that the local organizing committee had shown as much support and trust as the fans, coaches and the players are trying to. It would be great to see the tournament\u2019s organizers raise their intensity over the next few weeks, too. Atmosphere can help new fans fall in love with the game. Still, USA-France in 2019 could be worthy of a final itself. The US and France are similar teams. They both like to attack and do so in a variety of different ways. They have strong ability from set pieces, both teams have speed, and both teams know how to play as a team. Both teams have questions about their defenses as do most teams in this World Cup. This is not a tournament of sound defense but rather a tournament for goalscorers.",

      "body": "<p>Ever since I read John Updike\u2019s <em>Rabbit</em> tetralogy, I have felt that the ultimate test of a writer is to capture a single life from beginning to end in the pages of a novel. </p> <p>The idea of a single life captured through different points in time was behind the TV documentary series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/09/63-up-michael-apted-television-series\" title=\"\">63</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/09/63-up-michael-apted-television-series\" title=\"\"> Up</a></em> (I am also 63). Partly for research into my next novel and partly out of curiosity, I find myself asking, who was I at 7, at 14, at 21, and so on? Does looking back on an entire life help us shape who we want to be from now on? Am I still the same person \u2013 or someone entirely different? After all, every life has two distinct aspects: the external and the internal. </p> <p>I want to examine the span of my life, like the <em>63</em><em> Up</em> subjects, to see where I am and perhaps where I want to be, as my life approaches its own closing chapters. I want to try to shrink it down to something like a few sequential thoughts, if only to find out if there is any point in the exercise. So here goes\u2026</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to examine the span of my life as it approaches its closing chapters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a child in working-class west London, I was, my mother proclaimed, \u201ca dreamer\u201d living in, according to school reports, a \u201clittle world of his own\u201d. But I was also, like all hyper-introverts, vulnerable to bullying \u2013 both at school and, to a greater extent, by my elder brother. By my teenage years, I had become uneasy and restless. I indulged in booze, soft drugs and pointless acts of vandalism. This followed a decision I made to abandon the shy, bookish boy I was, lest I be bullied any more. In short, I re-invented myself, as I have had to do repeatedly.</p> <p>At that time I had already determined to achieve several things in my life \u2013 primarily that I would escape my dull, suburban, penurious background, by becoming a journalist. I was determined to avoid the 9-5 at all costs. I also wanted to generate thoughts that were <em>worth having</em>, rather than the chaotic ego-driven chaos of my consciousness.</p> <p>I was also desperate to escape the zeitgeist I was born into, the sterile \u201cnothing but\u201d philosophy of British pragmatism and scientism (as in, say, love is \u201cnothing but a series of electrochemical reactions\u201d). I wanted to find a richer philosophy of life. I determined to live a life of extremes, to somehow generate a story worth telling. Finally, I was set on the idea I would never marry or have children. Instead I wanted, as teenage boys do, to have brief, passionate affairs with as many women as possible.</p> <p>It started well. At the age of 19 I had been plucked from my trainee status at a local paper to work on the then-powerful music press. I travelled the world, interviewing the likes of David Bowie, Freddie Mercury and Fleetwood Mac.</p> <p>On the outside my life was going well and was a lot of fun, but much was hidden \u2013 including my anxiety.

      "bodyText": "Ever since I read John Updike\u2019s Rabbit tetralogy, I have felt that the ultimate test of a writer is to capture a single life from beginning to end in the pages of a novel. The idea of a single life captured through different points in time was behind the TV documentary series 63 Up (I am also 63). Partly for research into my next novel and partly out of curiosity, I find myself asking, who was I at 7, at 14, at 21, and so on? Does looking back on an entire life help us shape who we want to be from now on? Am I still the same person \u2013 or someone entirely different? After all, every life has two distinct aspects: the external and the internal. I want to examine the span of my life, like the 63 Up subjects, to see where I am and perhaps where I want to be, as my life approaches its own closing chapters. I want to try to shrink it down to something like a few sequential thoughts, if only to find out if there is any point in the exercise. So here goes\u2026 As a child in working-class west London, I was, my mother proclaimed, \u201ca dreamer\u201d living in, according to school reports, a \u201clittle world of his own\u201d. But I was also, like all hyper-introverts, vulnerable to bullying \u2013 both at school and, to a greater extent, by my elder brother. By my teenage years, I had become uneasy and restless. I indulged in booze, soft drugs and pointless acts of vandalism. This followed a decision I made to abandon the shy, bookish boy I was, lest I be bullied any more. In short, I re-invented myself, as I have had to do repeatedly. At that time I had already determined to achieve several things in my life \u2013 primarily that I would escape my dull, suburban, penurious background, by becoming a journalist. I was determined to avoid the 9-5 at all costs. I also wanted to generate thoughts that were worth having, rather than the chaotic ego-driven chaos of my consciousness. I was also desperate to escape the zeitgeist I was born into, the sterile \u201cnothing but\u201d philosophy of British pragmatism and scientism (as in, say, love is \u201cnothing but a series of electrochemical reactions\u201d). I wanted to find a richer philosophy of life. I determined to live a life of extremes, to somehow generate a story worth telling. Finally, I was set on the idea I would never marry or have children. Instead I wanted, as teenage boys do, to have brief, passionate affairs with as many women as possible. It started well. At the age of 19 I had been plucked from my trainee status at a local paper to work on the then-powerful music press. I travelled the world, interviewing the likes of David Bowie, Freddie Mercury and Fleetwood Mac. On the outside my life was going well and was a lot of fun, but much was hidden \u2013 including my anxiety. My urgent ambition acted as a way of escape, not only from my background but from my own mind. By 28 I had founded a magazine, and made enough money to attend the LSE. I had friends, a good family and plenty of cash. However, my mental health was fragile. After the break-up of an important relationship and, completing my degree, I was offered the editorship of a major London magazine, a task I was ill-suited for. After three weeks, I resigned, suffered a breakdown and became suicidally depressed. It turned out social mobility wasn\u2019t as problem-free as advertised.

Or they could be paying their workers an inflation-busting pay rise to make up for the freezes and low pay awards that characterised the years following the financial crash. Some companies can indeed claim that the money has found its way into customers or workers\u2019 pockets. A few have kept sums aside for a rainy day, although manufacturing businesses have spent the cash stockpiling raw materials and parts more than they have bolstered their bank balances. But the majority of listed companies have followed a different route \u2013 acting as cash machines for shareholders and shovelling money into the greedy mouths of the sovereign wealth funds, money managers and desperate pension savers that own so much of the stock market. The latest figures show that UK companies have been dishing out record levels of dividends, reaching \u00a319.7bn in the first quarter of this year. The information provider Link Asset Services says that\u2019s a rise of more than 15% compared with the same period in 2018.

The general rule is that companies should generate profits to cover dividend payments by at least one and a half times. British Gas owner Centrica has one of the worst records for overpaying. In fact, its profits amounted to only 90% of its dividend payment. Hammerson, the property group hit by declining retail rents, just about covered its dividend payout with pre-tax profits, as did energy group SSE, but not by much. And Vodafone still paid a dividend, albeit one reduced by 40%, even though it slumped into a massive \u00a37.6bn loss. The same trend can be seen in the rest of Europe and in the US. No wonder financial regulators have been asking themselves why companies have borrowed so much in recent years. For instance, the IMF has warned about corporate borrowing and many of the world\u2019s central banks, including the Bank of England, have voiced their concerns. They wonder why corporates have refused to follow ordinary consumers and rein in their borrowing. Consumer borrowing as a proportion of GDP remains well below pre-crisis levels across the OECD, the 34-member club of rich nations. That\u2019s not the case for corporate borrowing, much of which is done through the bond market rather than directly from commercial banks. Earlier this year the OECD said companies from developed-world economies had seen their outstanding bond debts rise by 70%, from $6tn in 2008 to $10.2tn in 2018. It said the situation was even worse than these figures would suggest after a significant rise in the numbers of hugely indebted \u201czombie\u201d companies in almost all developed nations. The lowest grade bonds now account for 54% of the market, showing that hundreds of thousands of businesses that have borrowed huge sums stand on the precipice of going bust. Analysts at the OECD reckon a similar shock to 2008 would force traders to downgrade $500m of investment-grade bonds to junk status. The bond market would be in turmoil and governments would immediately be forced to turn to their taxpayers for bailout funds. These governments, it should be remembered, have also increased their borrowing to levels never seen before, up from $10.9tn in 2010 in the wake of the financial crisis to an expected $11tn this year. In its warning, the OECD said in the next three years companies were due to refinance $4tn worth of corporate bonds \u2013 a sum \u201cclose to the total balance sheet of the US Federal Reserve\u201d. Companies that have over-borrowed and live in fear of their shareholders need one thing: cheap interest rates. Last week, stock markets in the UK, Europe and the US rose in response to signals from the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the US Fed that interest rates would stay lower for longer.

Braine works in an old Turkish bathhouse in the garden, where a \u201cgraveyard\u201d flower bed is studded with shards of her broken pottery. Childhood nightmares of \u201cGrimm\u2019s fairytales, Peter and the Wolf and dark forests at night\u201d seep into her triffid-like forms.

On the ground floor, the malachite-green wallpaper is a foil for ancestral-looking paintings, like Sir Henry Gilbert\u2019s 19th-century portrait of Henry IV, snapped up at auction in Lille \u201cand hauled back on the train\u201d. Like those of her former bohemian neighbours, Braine\u2019s artistic career has spanned different media. She originally studied art and sculpture at City &amp; Guilds, and went on to specialise in portraiture. The filmmaker Sam Wanamaker commissioned her to make the portrait of William Shakespeare for the Globe theatre, which perches on a plinth downstairs. Braine once spent months \u201cstalking\u201d Francis Bacon to get a true likeness for a bust that ended up in the artist\u2019s Soho drinking den, the Colony Room Club. Pottery has been her \u201caddiction\u201d for 20 years. \u201cA day without making a pot is a day wasted,\u201d she says. Braine works in an old Turkish bathhouse in the garden, where a \u201cgraveyard\u201d flower bed is studded with shards of her broken pottery. Childhood nightmares of \u201cGrimm\u2019s fairytales, Peter and the Wolf and dark forests at night\u201d seep into her triffid-like forms. She loves the physicality of pottery, \u201cslashing and cutting\u201d clay into waving tendrils: \u201cI like pushing clay to the limits of its breakability, which is why some of it ends up in the flower bed.\u201d Until now, Braine has only sold her work to friends and family but next month she holds her first solo show, at home. Tendril is the Night, curated by art consultant and former Sotheby\u2019s director Fru Tholstrup, will unleash two decades\u2019 worth of Braine\u2019s creatures on to shelves and mantlepieces bringing another \u201cphantasmagorical\u201d presence to this charismatic house. Tendril is the Night, 27-30 June and then by arrangement, 20 Cheyne Row, London SW3 (k8braine@hotmail.com)",

Until then, Missguided\u2019s biggest problem had been keeping up with customer demand: the bikini was selling out in every size \u2013 from 4 to 24 \u2013 within 45 minutes after each restock.</p> <p>Founded a decade ago by Nitin Passi, Missguided is among a small number of internet fashion brands to have enjoyed success at a time when the traditional high street is on its knees.</p> <p>While big names like Marks &amp; Spencer (M&amp;S), Topshop and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/20/monsoon-accessorize-cut-rents-closures\" title=\"\">Monsoon</a> are struggling to hang on to their ageing customer bases, Missguided and online rivals Asos, Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing have cleaned up, selling inexpensive fashion to young women in their teens and twenties who shop online rather than on the high street.</p> <p>Passi told the <em>Observer </em>that despite the furore, the company was not embarrassed about the \u00a31 bikini as it was being sold at a loss as a marketing stunt \u2013 designed to pull in the punters to sell them other items at the same time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"428770b9c69cb26a2fd115cc3f8a4940c3f255c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/428770b9c69cb26a2fd115cc3f8a4940c3f255c8/0_103_3824_2294/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Last year\u2019s Love Island, where contestants regularly wore clothes by Missguided.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Last year\u2019s Love Island, where contestants regularly wore clothes by Missguided.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Gourley/ITV/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think we have to careful not to confuse the symbolism of totems with real issues,\u201d says Passi. \u201cThe \u00a31 bikini was priced to generate interest and we\u2019re not embarrassed about it. We\u2019ve always lived close to the edge when it comes to marketing, but we\u2019re comfortable with that because there are never shortcuts when it comes to the product.\u201d</p> <p>The 36-year-old entrepreneur, who started Missguided in 2009, accepts that it was perhaps \u201cinevitable\u201d that the product would be judged in the context of the government\u2019s response to the EAC. But he adds: \u201cOur \u00a31 bikini was sourced no differently to anything else we offer. It was made by one of our audited supplier partners and with the same meticulous attention to detail as every item on our site, whether it\u2019s \u00a320 or \u00a3200.\u201d</p> <p>With the exuberance of a dotcom-era startup, Missguided\u2019s headquarters in Salford Quays \u2013 sandwiched between the Manchester United stadium and the BBC\u2019s Media City \u2013 feature a \u201cselfie tunnel\u201d and a meeting room with swings instead of chairs. In one YouTube video the former Cranleigh schoolboy conducts a tour of the HQ he refers to as a \u201ccrib\u201d while riding a hoverboard.</p> <p>Britons buy more new clothes than any other country in Europe, with high-street clothing chains in thrall to a fast-fashion model that demands new products arrive in store every week \u2013 rather than at the start of each season \u2013 to satisfy shoppers\u2019 insatiable appetite for novelty.</p> <p>Missguided claims that it goes one better than fast fashion by offering \u201crapid\u201d fashion, with 1,000 new products landing on the site every week: dresses start at \u00a38 and you can buy a pair of jeans and a T-shirt for around \u00a320. By last year the business had shifted more than \u00a3200m worth of clothes, although it is still a minnow compared to market leader M&amp;S, which has a clothing business worth more than \u00a33bn.</p> <p>Despite a welter of consumer surveys highlighting the growing ethical and environmental awareness of millennials and Generation Z, the sales of online fashion companies tell a different story. At the last count, Boohoo\u2019s sales were up 27%, while PrettyLittleThing\u2019s had surged by 42%. Asos\u2019s sales last year were \u00a32.4bn.</p> <p>Those huge sales uplifts are coming in a \u00a348bn clothing and footwear market that has been shrinking for several years \u2013 as, despite the shocking picture of waste revealed by the EAC inquiry, Britons are buying fewer clothes and choosing to spend their disposable income on other things.</p> <p>\u201cI would argue that what consumers say and do are in reality two different things,\u201d says Retail Economics\u2019 chief executive, Richard Lim, who points to the huge success story that is Primark, despite its historical connection to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rana-plaza\" title=\"\">Rana Plaza</a> factory disaster in Bangladesh.</p> <p>\u201cThe consumer surveys paint a different picture, but there is not much evidence of shoppers voting with their wallets and taking their spend away from these [fast-fashion] retailers.\u201d</p> <p>In 2017, when Missguided was exploring bringing in outside investors, the company \u2013 which is 100% owned by Passi \u2013 was judged to be worth as much as \u00a3700m by analysts. However, its wings were clipped spectacularly a year later when the decision to open a handful of stores proved disastrous and the company crashed to a pre-tax loss of \u00a346m in 2018.</p> <p>The Missguided stores failed to cover their costly rent bills and Passi, who had ceded some control to senior management, was forced to retake the reins and lead a turnaround. The business is now in a \u201cmuch better place\u201d, he says.</p> <p>Like Umar Kamani, the larger-than-life 31-year-old boss of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/03/a-fairytale-brand-prettylittlething-joins-fashion-a-list-umar-kamani\" title=\"\">PrettyLittleThing</a>, Passi has created a brand that resonates with a new generation of shoppers which marketers say are hard to reach. The Missguided brand is all about <a href=\"https://www.missguided.co.uk/babe-manifesto\" title=\"\">\u201cbabe power\u201d</a>: its customer base are all \u201cbabes\u201d and the website featuring a \u201cbabeZine\u201d where they can read about everything from \u201cWTF do I wear for massive boobs?\u201d to working in social media.</p> <p>Passi insists the business is not built on his family connections \u2013 his father is a successful clothing supplier \u2013 since their expertise is in dressing a different demographic: \u201cI borrowed \u00a350,000 from my dad in 2009 and paid him back in 2010,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e67645520048b8b2f8bf3474fedb1603f1341242\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e67645520048b8b2f8bf3474fedb1603f1341242/0_495_2170_1301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Missguided founder Nitin Passi and singer Rainy Milo in London, 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Missguided founder Nitin Passi and singer Rainy Milo in London, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Missguided is based in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/manchester\" title=\"\">Manchester</a> mainly because Passi\u2019s uncle offered him free office space at the back of one of his factories to get started.</p> <p>He attributes its success to a nimble business model that is able to react to what its customers are talking about on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s about the speed of what we offer,\u201d Passi says. \u201cTalking to them where they are through social.\u201d</p> <p>The rise of internet shopping has been a major factor in the current high-street crisis: online marketplaces such as Amazon and Asos have altered the way many Britons shop forever.

Online retailers are making moves to improve their [profit] margins by changing their service to customers.\u201d</p> <p>Recently, online giant Asos changed its returns policy to clamp down on \u201cserial returners\u201d \u2013 shoppers who regularly buy clothes, wear them and then return them for a refund. Its perceived challenges are reflected in a share price that has fallen by nearly 60% over the last year as investors question an investment-hungry business model amid slowing growth and a profit squeeze.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are realising that there\u2019s no such thing as truly \u2018free delivery\u2019,\u201d says Watson, who points to the prospect of suburban roads clogged with delivery vans. \u201cThe upcoming generation of shoppers is questioning the wisdom of items travelling huge distances \u2013 only for them to be returned and rack up more \u2018product miles\u2019.\u201d</p>",

We\u2019ve always lived close to the edge when it comes to marketing, but we\u2019re comfortable with that because there are never shortcuts when it comes to the product.\u201d The 36-year-old entrepreneur, who started Missguided in 2009, accepts that it was perhaps \u201cinevitable\u201d that the product would be judged in the context of the government\u2019s response to the EAC. But he adds: \u201cOur \u00a31 bikini was sourced no differently to anything else we offer. It was made by one of our audited supplier partners and with the same meticulous attention to detail as every item on our site, whether it\u2019s \u00a320 or \u00a3200.\u201d With the exuberance of a dotcom-era startup, Missguided\u2019s headquarters in Salford Quays \u2013 sandwiched between the Manchester United stadium and the BBC\u2019s Media City \u2013 feature a \u201cselfie tunnel\u201d and a meeting room with swings instead of chairs. In one YouTube video the former Cranleigh schoolboy conducts a tour of the HQ he refers to as a \u201ccrib\u201d while riding a hoverboard. Britons buy more new clothes than any other country in Europe, with high-street clothing chains in thrall to a fast-fashion model that demands new products arrive in store every week \u2013 rather than at the start of each season \u2013 to satisfy shoppers\u2019 insatiable appetite for novelty. Missguided claims that it goes one better than fast fashion by offering \u201crapid\u201d fashion, with 1,000 new products landing on the site every week: dresses start at \u00a38 and you can buy a pair of jeans and a T-shirt for around \u00a320. By last year the business had shifted more than \u00a3200m worth of clothes, although it is still a minnow compared to market leader M&amp;S, which has a clothing business worth more than \u00a33bn. Despite a welter of consumer surveys highlighting the growing ethical and environmental awareness of millennials and Generation Z, the sales of online fashion companies tell a different story. At the last count, Boohoo\u2019s sales were up 27%, while PrettyLittleThing\u2019s had surged by 42%. Asos\u2019s sales last year were \u00a32.4bn. Those huge sales uplifts are coming in a \u00a348bn clothing and footwear market that has been shrinking for several years \u2013 as, despite the shocking picture of waste revealed by the EAC inquiry, Britons are buying fewer clothes and choosing to spend their disposable income on other things. \u201cI would argue that what consumers say and do are in reality two different things,\u201d says Retail Economics\u2019 chief executive, Richard Lim, who points to the huge success story that is Primark, despite its historical connection to the Rana Plaza factory disaster in Bangladesh. \u201cThe consumer surveys paint a different picture, but there is not much evidence of shoppers voting with their wallets and taking their spend away from these [fast-fashion] retailers.\u201d In 2017, when Missguided was exploring bringing in outside investors, the company \u2013 which is 100% owned by Passi \u2013 was judged to be worth as much as \u00a3700m by analysts. However, its wings were clipped spectacularly a year later when the decision to open a handful of stores proved disastrous and the company crashed to a pre-tax loss of \u00a346m in 2018. The Missguided stores failed to cover their costly rent bills and Passi, who had ceded some control to senior management, was forced to retake the reins and lead a turnaround. The business is now in a \u201cmuch better place\u201d, he says. Like Umar Kamani, the larger-than-life 31-year-old boss of PrettyLittleThing, Passi has created a brand that resonates with a new generation of shoppers which marketers say are hard to reach. The Missguided brand is all about \u201cbabe power\u201d: its customer base are all \u201cbabes\u201d and the website featuring a \u201cbabeZine\u201d where they can read about everything from \u201cWTF do I wear for massive boobs?\u201d to working in social media. Passi insists the business is not built on his family connections \u2013 his father is a successful clothing supplier \u2013 since their expertise is in dressing a different demographic: \u201cI borrowed \u00a350,000 from my dad in 2009 and paid him back in 2010,\u201d he says. Missguided is based in Manchester mainly because Passi\u2019s uncle offered him free office space at the back of one of his factories to get started. He attributes its success to a nimble business model that is able to react to what its customers are talking about on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s about the speed of what we offer,\u201d Passi says. \u201cTalking to them where they are through social.\u201d The rise of internet shopping has been a major factor in the current high-street crisis: online marketplaces such as Amazon and Asos have altered the way many Britons shop forever. This shift has contributed to the financial collapse of the Debenhams and House of Fraser department store chains but also smaller brands at all price points, from upmarket kitten-heel seller LK Bennett to inexpensive clothing chain Select. A new report on the UK shopping market by global real estate adviser Colliers International makes the case that the \u201cgolden age\u201d of online retailing could be coming to an end as websites start facing up to the shortcomings of their own business models \u2013 not least the cost of processing their daily mountain of returns. James Watson, Colliers\u2019 head of retail capital markets, says: \u201cThe days when you could order three items of clothing in different sizes, in the knowledge that you could return them free of charge, are coming to an end. Online retailers are making moves to improve their [profit] margins by changing their service to customers.\u201d Recently, online giant Asos changed its returns policy to clamp down on \u201cserial returners\u201d \u2013 shoppers who regularly buy clothes, wear them and then return them for a refund. Its perceived challenges are reflected in a share price that has fallen by nearly 60% over the last year as investors question an investment-hungry business model amid slowing growth and a profit squeeze. \u201cPeople are realising that there\u2019s no such thing as truly \u2018free delivery\u2019,\u201d says Watson, who points to the prospect of suburban roads clogged with delivery vans. \u201cThe upcoming generation of shoppers is questioning the wisdom of items travelling huge distances \u2013 only for them to be returned and rack up more \u2018product miles\u2019.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For Lewis Hamilton, pole at the French Grand Prix seemed an almost inevitable conclusion for a driver clearly enjoying a confidence and touch in a Mercedes that is exceptional even by his own standards. In contrast for Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel, what has already been a difficult weekend looks set to end only in another largely thankless slog on Sunday afternoon after he could manage only seventh. Indeed, such was the gap between Mercedes and Ferrari, for the first time this season Hamilton clearly indicated his battle for the title was now with his teammate Valtteri Bottas.</p> \n<p>Hamilton has 86 career poles. This is his third this season and with five wins already his form here suggests another is well within his grasp. He is, as he put it in France, firing on all cylinders. Calm and collected enough to put in an almost flawless performance with equanimity.</p> \n<p>Hamilton delivered a piece of controlled, precision driving to secure pole with two clinical laps. He had set the pace with a strong opener on the first hot runs in Q3 with a time of 1 minute 28.488 seconds.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/22/daniel-ricciardo-renault-switch-from-red-bull\">Daniel Ricciardo: \u2018There was more risk staying. Renault excited me\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On their second outings, Hamilton found another level altogether; he was almost half a second up, but for losing time at the last two corners. He still had enough, however, and concluded with a 1m 28.319sec lap, a track record. Bottas was almost three-tenths back in second but Mercedes were in a different class. Charles Leclerc finished in third for Ferrari, sixth-tenths down.</p> \n<p>Hamilton has a 29-point advantage over Bottas and is 62 points clear of Vettel. Ferrari trail Mercedes by 123 points in the constructors\u2019 championship and, with 14 races remaining, for the first time this season there appeared to be an admission from Hamilton that his focus is now on his teammate in the title fight.</p> \n<p>\u201cI do feel strong, each weekend I feel I start on the right foot but Valtteri goes in and puts in bloody good laps every time,\u201d he said. \u201cI am constantly being pushed by Valtteri.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hamilton has talked up Ferrari\u2019s challenge until now but after Mercedes dominated all weekend in France, he appeared to now consider it a two-horse chase.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are some races where we as a team have not been pushed as hard as we would like to be by the others,\u201d he said. \u201cNonetheless there is still the battle within us.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn a lot of the races there has been half a tenth to a tenth and a half between Valtteri and I. So I still have my work cut out, I still have to perform, still have to deliver. The work ethic is exactly the same, the stress is exactly the same as if we were fighting with the Ferraris.\u201d</p> \n<p>Of concern for Bottas, however, was that Hamilton knows he is entering the period of the year when his form generally only improves. \u201cIt usually gets better when I get to this point of the season,\u201d he added. \u201cI am definitely getting more comfortable with the car. I don\u2019t expect that to stop.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ferrari and Vettel, however, have faced a weekend that reflects their season. Vettel had been given a five-second penalty after he was pressured into an error by Hamilton and went off at the last round in Canada. The team have since pursued a review of the decision which was summarily dismissed by the stewards on Friday. They were left angry and disappointed, although what they had cited as \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence in their favour turned out to be distinctly underwhelming and was judged to be irrelevant.</p> \n<p>Hamilton\u2019s reaction at learning Ferrari were putting forward Sky pundit\u2019s Karun Chandhok\u2019s analysis as part of their case perhaps summed up the weakness of the Scuderia\u2019s position. \u201cI heard it was Karun Chandhok\u2019s video that was the new evidence so I was pretty relaxed after that,\u201d he said to considerable laughter.</p> \n<p>Unsettled as Ferrari have been by underperforming all season, they have reeled from errors, bad luck and an inability to catch or better Mercedes even when they have an advantage.

      "bodyText": "For Lewis Hamilton, pole at the French Grand Prix seemed an almost inevitable conclusion for a driver clearly enjoying a confidence and touch in a Mercedes that is exceptional even by his own standards. In contrast for Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel, what has already been a difficult weekend looks set to end only in another largely thankless slog on Sunday afternoon after he could manage only seventh. Indeed, such was the gap between Mercedes and Ferrari, for the first time this season Hamilton clearly indicated his battle for the title was now with his teammate Valtteri Bottas. Hamilton has 86 career poles. This is his third this season and with five wins already his form here suggests another is well within his grasp. He is, as he put it in France, firing on all cylinders. Calm and collected enough to put in an almost flawless performance with equanimity. Hamilton delivered a piece of controlled, precision driving to secure pole with two clinical laps. He had set the pace with a strong opener on the first hot runs in Q3 with a time of 1 minute 28.488 seconds. On their second outings, Hamilton found another level altogether; he was almost half a second up, but for losing time at the last two corners. He still had enough, however, and concluded with a 1m 28.319sec lap, a track record. Bottas was almost three-tenths back in second but Mercedes were in a different class. Charles Leclerc finished in third for Ferrari, sixth-tenths down. Hamilton has a 29-point advantage over Bottas and is 62 points clear of Vettel. Ferrari trail Mercedes by 123 points in the constructors\u2019 championship and, with 14 races remaining, for the first time this season there appeared to be an admission from Hamilton that his focus is now on his teammate in the title fight. \u201cI do feel strong, each weekend I feel I start on the right foot but Valtteri goes in and puts in bloody good laps every time,\u201d he said. \u201cI am constantly being pushed by Valtteri.\u201d Hamilton has talked up Ferrari\u2019s challenge until now but after Mercedes dominated all weekend in France, he appeared to now consider it a two-horse chase. \u201cThere are some races where we as a team have not been pushed as hard as we would like to be by the others,\u201d he said. \u201cNonetheless there is still the battle within us. \u201cIn a lot of the races there has been half a tenth to a tenth and a half between Valtteri and I. So I still have my work cut out, I still have to perform, still have to deliver. The work ethic is exactly the same, the stress is exactly the same as if we were fighting with the Ferraris.\u201d Of concern for Bottas, however, was that Hamilton knows he is entering the period of the year when his form generally only improves. \u201cIt usually gets better when I get to this point of the season,\u201d he added. \u201cI am definitely getting more comfortable with the car. I don\u2019t expect that to stop.\u201d Ferrari and Vettel, however, have faced a weekend that reflects their season. Vettel had been given a five-second penalty after he was pressured into an error by Hamilton and went off at the last round in Canada. The team have since pursued a review of the decision which was summarily dismissed by the stewards on Friday. They were left angry and disappointed, although what they had cited as \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence in their favour turned out to be distinctly underwhelming and was judged to be irrelevant. Hamilton\u2019s reaction at learning Ferrari were putting forward Sky pundit\u2019s Karun Chandhok\u2019s analysis as part of their case perhaps summed up the weakness of the Scuderia\u2019s position. \u201cI heard it was Karun Chandhok\u2019s video that was the new evidence so I was pretty relaxed after that,\u201d he said to considerable laughter. Unsettled as Ferrari have been by underperforming all season, they have reeled from errors, bad luck and an inability to catch or better Mercedes even when they have an advantage. In France, Vettel had to abort his first hot lap after he went wide when he missed an upshift at turn nine and then just could not find the grip on his last shot in Q3. As inconsistency has dogged his and Ferrari\u2019s season, so it had blighted his qualifying. \u201cI am not happy with that and not happy to not extract the maximum today,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not have a good feel for the car. It is the inconsistency that made it difficult. Some laps it felt really good, others didn\u2019t.\u201d Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen was in fourth, but there was a real shot in the arm for McLaren. Britain\u2019s Lando Norris put in a superb lap to take the highest grid position of his F1 career in fifth, one place ahead of his more experienced teammate, Spain\u2019s Carlos Sainz. Renault\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo was in eighth, Red Bull\u2019s Pierre Gasly in ninth and Antonio Giovinazzi in the Alfa Romeo was in 10th. Alexander Albon was in 11th for Toro Rosso, with Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen in 12th for Alfa Romeo in front of the Renault of Nico H\u00fclkenberg, Racing Point\u2019s Sergio P\u00e9rez and the Haas of Kevin Magnussen. Daniil Kvyat was in 15th for Toro Rosso in front of the Haas of Romain Grosjean and the Racing Point of Lance Stroll. George Russell and Robert Kubica were in 19th and 20th for Williams. Russell will start form the back of the grid for an ERS change and Kyvat will be in 19 after a penalty for taking a new power unit.",

It failed and was forced instead to resort to voices from around her to piece together the life story and development of France\u2019s manager. She is a reluctant trailblazer. The 44-year-old former international has a reputation for training players hard and demanding a tight adherence to the team\u2019s rules of conduct. The dropping to the bench of Val\u00e9rie Gauvin for France\u2019s opener at the Parc des Princes because the forward, in her own words, was late, was a hint that no occasion is too big to stray from procedure. Diacre, though, brushed over the decision, saying it was \u201ctactical\u201d. Gauvin\u2019s return to the fold for their second Group A game, after Diacre had insisted she would select an unchanged XI, was queried post-match. \u201cWell, you shouldn\u2019t believe everything I say,\u201d Diacre responded. It is not uncommon for managers to skirt questions about possible starting lineups but the manner in which Diacre toys with the press catches the eye. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the pool and on the deckchair and the girls have been in the shade because, as I\u2019m very strict, they have to stay in the shade and in their rooms \u2013 of course, I make the most of the sun,\u201d she said before the Norway game. \u201cCompared to the weather we had in Paris, I\u2019m really enjoying myself. I\u2019m not working very hard \u2013 I let my staff do most of the work.\u201d She is funny. Ironically, her sense of humour is drawing the attention she is so keen to deflect. Having done so few interviews, her profile in France is surprisingly low, though the decision of the French Football Federation and the national broadcaster, TF1, to air the squad announcement live to the nation, as they did the men\u2019s, has made her more recognisable. Another boost to her profile and already healthy stock has come from France finishing top of their group with victories in front of sold-out crowds, albeit at times with less than convincing performances. After the controversial 1-0 defeat of a 10-player Nigeria thanks to Wendie Renard\u2019s 79th-minute penalty awarded after a VAR review, Diacre was typically direct in her assessment: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell what we have to do better right now. We wanted to win our three group games and it\u2019s done even if it was difficult. But that\u2019s how you build momentum.\u201d No matter how it was achieved, it was still France\u2019s eighth consecutive victory and their 17th in their last 18 matches. Win the World Cup, while continuing to entertain along the way, and she will have to get used to the attention.",

When I was writing <em>Only Ever Yours</em> I didn\u2019t set out to write a book for young adults. I just told the story the way that I felt it needed to be told \u2013 that did cause some difficulties because many publishers struggled to see how they would market it. Was it YA? Was it adult fiction?\u201d</p> <p>That blurring is particularly pronounced where fantasy is concerned, says Rachel Winterbottom, senior editor at Gollancz who this year will bring out YA juggernaut Leigh Bardugo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bea/article/80198-bookexpo-2019-an-adult-debut-for-leigh-bardugo.html\" title=\"\">first adult novel</a> <em>Ninth House</em>. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a move going on which you can see with Leigh, Victoria Schwab \u2013 who is Victoria for the YA books and VE Schwab for the adult ones \u2013 and also Sarah J Maas, who is writing her first adult fantasy series,\u201d she says. \u201cPart of it is that the adult genre does allow them to go a bit darker and explore other themes. YA itself does cover a lot of dark themes but branding it as an adult book is a way of announcing very early to the audience that this is something different. I think also it allows writers to keep their readership even as they perhaps age out of young adult books. With Leigh\u2019s book, even though it\u2019s very different from her YA fantasy because it\u2019s set in our world, albeit with supernatural elements, it\u2019s still recognisably her voice and her addictive way of telling a story. That\u2019s a big part of the appeal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a43621c62eea8913e30f4bb69299162c8d17ce7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a43621c62eea8913e30f4bb69299162c8d17ce7b/0_337_900_1125/800.jpg\" alt=\"YA juggernaut Leigh Bardugo.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">YA juggernaut Leigh Bardugo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Orion Books</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And, while some of this change is driven by market forces \u2013 YA fiction recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/27/authors-voice-alarm-after-sharp-drop-in-sales-of-ya-fiction\" title=\"\">suffered its lowest sales</a> in over a decade \u2013 many authors find their focus and interests shifting over time. \u201cWith my last couple of YA books, <em>Hidden Among Us</em> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jul/24/review-katy-moran-the-hidden-princess\" title=\"\"><em>The Hidden Princess</em></a>, I realised that my focus was increasingly with the older characters,\u201d says the Carnegie-medal nominated Katy Moran., <a href=\"https://katymoran.co.uk\" title=\"\">whose new novel</a> <em>Wicked By Design</em> is the second in a series of adult historical fantasies set in a world where Napoleon won the battle of Waterloo. \u201cI also think that while there\u2019s no theme you can\u2019t cover in YA or children\u2019s fiction you do have a responsibility to your reader when writing for teenagers which you don\u2019t have when writing for adults. So for example in <em>False Lights</em> [her first adult novel] Crow, the book\u2019s hero, would have had to be the villain because of how he behaves towards his younger brother Kitto.

YA authors are expected to be well-versed in these issues, which is not a bad thing despite what some would have you believe and I\u2019m interested to see if that will begin to seep into adult fiction because I\u2019d love to see authors for any age category feel encouraged to take risks with their work.\u201d</p> <p>For Collins, whose next book due out in 2020 follows a group of students in an alternate Europe in the 1930s, that shift is already occurring. \u201cI definitely think that <em>The Binding</em> would never have been published ten years ago,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a snobbery about what constituted serious fiction and what kind of story we had to be telling.

She pointed out that when launching the museum idea last year, Poland\u2019s culture minister, Piotr Gli\u0144ski, declared that it would explore the history of \u201cmutual love\u201d between Poles and Jews. She said she respected Blatman as a historian but believed he was being used by Polish authorities to give an Israeli seal of approval to a distorted narrative of the Holocaust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7082fe9b66d8ebe0dfc31b6dbf2688167becc33b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7082fe9b66d8ebe0dfc31b6dbf2688167becc33b/0_0_4314_2775/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Warsaw Ghetto Museum will be housed in a former children\u2019s hospital.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Warsaw Ghetto Museum will be housed in a former children\u2019s hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Grycuk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe know from the archives that in the spectrum of behaviour towards the Jews, the righteous were the exception, not something that was common. The history of the Holocaust is not a buffet where you can choose which bits you want,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In an interview at the museum planning offices in central Warsaw, Blatman insisted that the criticism was unfair. He said he had not met any government officials or been given instructions and did not believe that any area of Holocaust history was taboo, saying that \u201cobviously\u201d the museum would deal with Polish antisemitism and instances of collaboration. \u201cThere is nothing which is forbidden,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Warsaw ghetto was the largest of all the Jewish ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe, with around 400,000 Jews crammed into a little over a square mile of land. Most were killed, either through execution, starvation or after deportation to concentration camps. The ghetto was razed in 1943 after a heroic but doomed uprising by its inhabitants. Today, the area of the former ghetto is part of central Warsaw, with only a few plaques and small monuments to remind visitors of its dark past.</p> <p>The museum will be housed in a former children\u2019s hospital, built by Jewish philanthropists in the 1870s. It treated thousands of children during the ghetto period, many for malnutrition and starvation, and most of its patients were eventually sent to their deaths at Treblinka.

      "bodyText": "The museum of the Warsaw ghetto is not due to open for several years, but is already shaping up to be one of the most contentious museums in Europe. Backed by Poland\u2019s populist government, which has been accused of rewriting history to fit its political agenda, the museum has caused a bitter spat between historians of the Holocaust about how best to tell the tragic story of Warsaw\u2019s Jews. On one side is the museum\u2019s Israeli chief historian, Daniel Blatman, who teaches Holocaust studies at the University of Jerusalem, and promises that the exhibits will provide an accurate and thought-provoking look at the formation and liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto, and of the Holocaust in Poland more generally. On the other side are numerous Polish and Israeli Holocaust scholars who say Blatman is at best being used by the Polish government, and at worst is a willing participant in historical distortions. Agnieska Haska, of the Polish Centre for Holocaust Research in Warsaw, said it became clear early on that the museum would offer a distorted view of the Holocaust and gloss over instances of collaboration. She pointed out that when launching the museum idea last year, Poland\u2019s culture minister, Piotr Gli\u0144ski, declared that it would explore the history of \u201cmutual love\u201d between Poles and Jews. She said she respected Blatman as a historian but believed he was being used by Polish authorities to give an Israeli seal of approval to a distorted narrative of the Holocaust. \u201cWe know from the archives that in the spectrum of behaviour towards the Jews, the righteous were the exception, not something that was common. The history of the Holocaust is not a buffet where you can choose which bits you want,\u201d she said. In an interview at the museum planning offices in central Warsaw, Blatman insisted that the criticism was unfair. He said he had not met any government officials or been given instructions and did not believe that any area of Holocaust history was taboo, saying that \u201cobviously\u201d the museum would deal with Polish antisemitism and instances of collaboration. \u201cThere is nothing which is forbidden,\u201d he said. The Warsaw ghetto was the largest of all the Jewish ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe, with around 400,000 Jews crammed into a little over a square mile of land. Most were killed, either through execution, starvation or after deportation to concentration camps. The ghetto was razed in 1943 after a heroic but doomed uprising by its inhabitants. Today, the area of the former ghetto is part of central Warsaw, with only a few plaques and small monuments to remind visitors of its dark past. The museum will be housed in a former children\u2019s hospital, built by Jewish philanthropists in the 1870s. It treated thousands of children during the ghetto period, many for malnutrition and starvation, and most of its patients were eventually sent to their deaths at Treblinka. The doctors chose euthanasia for some of the children rather than see them deported to the concentration camp. It was one of very few buildings in Warsaw to survive the war relatively unscathed and, after renovations in the 1950s, it again functioned as a children\u2019s hospital until it was closed in 2014. As it awaits transformation into the museum, the building is now closed to the public, the smell of disinfectant lingering in the empty orange-painted corridors. The plan is for the museum to open in 2023, for the 80th anniversary of the uprising. Blatman said the focus would be on the Holocaust as it fitted into the broader narrative of the war and the Nazi occupation of Poland. \u201cPoles and Jews were both victims. Not equal victims, but both victims of the same tyranny. The concept will focus on the fate of the Jews, not forgetting the other.\u201d He said that as the first major museum of the Holocaust to be placed on a site where the Holocaust actually occurred, it would naturally have a different focus than Yad Vashem in Jerusalem or the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC. \u201cWe cannot tell the story of the Jews and the Warsaw ghetto without some hints about what\u2019s going on the other side of the wall,\u201d he said. His critics are not convinced. Hava Dreifuss, history professor at Tel Aviv University, who for many years worked at Yad Vashem, said she had been asked to work with the museum and had rejected the offer, believing the museum wanted Israeli approval for a museum that leading Polish historians of the Holocaust had refused to work with.

      "bodyText": "Raids on migrants in cities including New York, Chicago and Miami could begin as early as Sunday. The raids, which Donald Trump described in a tweet earlier this week, will target more than 2,000 migrants who have received letters ordering them to appear in immigration court, according to the Miami Herald. The operation, which the Washington Post said the president has ordered, could target people in Miami, Atlanta, Chicago, Baltimore, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York and San Francisco. The Department of Homeland Security agency that oversees deportations, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), said the agency does not provide details about enforcement operations, citing the safety of Ice personnel. \u201cAll of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and \u2013 if found removable by final order \u2013 removal from the United States,\u201d an Ice spokesman said. Trump defended the raids on Saturday morning, tweeting: \u201cWhen people come into our country illegally, they will be DEPORTED!\u201d Over the past seven years, more undocumented people have entered the US legally on visas then become undocumented when their visas expire, or by illegally crossing the border. In a second tweet, Trump incorrectly conflated having a deportation order with evading the law. It is not unusual for people with deportation orders to routinely check in with Ice while they seek other forms of immigration relief or challenge the orders in court. Since Trump announced on Twitter that \u201cmillions\u201d of migrants would be deported next week, immigration advocacy groups across the US have said they are prepared for the raids, which could not reach a million people because of limited staffing at Ice. \u201cWe have spent the last two and a half years learning how to respond to these situations, teaching our communities how to respond and creating materials with how to support them,\u201d said Camille Mackler, director of immigration legal policy at the New York Immigration Council (NYIC). NYIC represents more than 200 migrant and refugee communities in New York state, which has long been home to one of the biggest Central American populations in the US. Trump has for months complained about Central American families crossing the southern border. This week, NYIC has ramped up education and awareness efforts, including encouraging people to use resources on its website, advising those who have received a deportation order to contact a lawyer and telling people to make a plan for their family in case they are arrested. \u201cWe know how to respond to these raids,\u201d Mackler said. She and other immigration advocates condemned the raids as a political ploy timed to follow Trump\u2019s formal announcement that he is running for re-election on Tuesday and to support an administration narrative that Central American families at the border are criminals, not people fleeing violence and poverty to pursue their right to seek asylum. Sandra Cordero, director of Families Belong Together, a coalition fighting family separations, said in a statement the potential raids are \u201ca disgusting political ploy to stoke fear and rile up Trump\u2019s base for 2020\u201d. Cordero said: \u201cThis is yet another flagrant disregard for the welfare of children on behalf of a cruel administration bent on fomenting fear and creating chaos.\u201d The acting homeland security secretary, Kevin McAleenan, has been encouraging Ice to narrow the operation, according to the Washington Post. McAleenan reportedly raised concerns that the larger operation would lead to renewed family separation \u2013 because parents and guardians of US citizen children are expected to be affected \u2013 and undermine the agency\u2019s argument that it needs emergency funding to address the record number of families approaching the border. Though Trump has made aggressive immigration enforcement a cornerstone of his presidency, he has deported far fewer people than Barack Obama. In the last fiscal year, Ice removed 250,000 undocumented migrants compared to 410,000 removed in 2012. Trump, however, has done away with deportation priorities Obama put in place in his second term, and used anti-migrant rhetoric that creates fear. Kevin Lo, staff attorney for the Immigrant Rights Program at Asian Americans Advancing Justice\u2019s Asian Law Caucus, said calls to the group\u2019s multiple migration hotlines have increased since Trump\u2019s tweet, with more people reporting activity that looks like it could be Ice. Lo said the Cambodian community he works with has seen Ice raids every four months and that each time a raid occurs it has an immediate, devastating impact. People who are able to fight their case in court still suffer devastating consequences, Lo said \u2013 after being arrested in a raid and detained, people lose work and fail to make payments on cars and homes, while trying to pay for calls to their family from detention and for family visits. \u201cFamilies definitely don\u2019t recover from this,\u201d Lo said, \u201ceven if their loved one gets to stay.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>There is no arguing with the numbers. Wembley Stadium is brimming with fans, even on a wet Tuesday. A dozen people fill the vast stage, reproducing some of the most opulent harmonies and venomous kiss-offs of the late 20th century. On <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3ywicffOj4\" title=\"\">Dreams</a>, a bittersweet classic written by an enduringly swirly Stevie Nicks, a chandelier descends from the rigging. Amusingly, it goes back up afterwards, reappearing and disappearing with every one of her compositions on the final night of Fleetwood Mac\u2019s European tour.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/stevie-nicks-harry-styles-friendship-timeline.html\" title=\"\">Superfan Harry Styles</a> has brought his mum, Nicks reveals, complimenting her on what a well-brought-up young man he is. Super-producer Jimmy Iovine (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Nicks\u2019s 1981 solo album <em>Bella Donna</em>) has flown over from the States, she says. The Fleetwood Mac setlist \u2013 barely varying from Berlin to London \u2013 is replete with peak-period hits and refreshed by a couple of deeper cuts. One, the Peter Green-era blues Black Magic Woman, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQND785xlJY\" title=\"\">made famous by Carlos Santana</a>, finds Nicks vamping her way through a female reading of the tune as the chandelier glitters darkly.</p> <p>You can\u2019t help but wonder, though, what constitutes a quorum in Macworld \u2013 a notoriously fickle place, which has seen a number of key personnel go missing. The reunited classic 70s lineup of Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie (back in the fold since 2013) has been touring for a year without guitarist and songwriter Lindsey Buckingham. Fleetwood asked Buckingham to join his band in 1974. Buckingham assented, but only if he could bring Nicks. The results were immediate: two of the biggest albums in rock history, sacks of cash, dangerous liaisons, mucous membranes caked in \u201cbooger sugar\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The crowd are perfectly happy to sing along with Neil Finn, rather than fold their arms in protest</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBYHwH1Vb-c\" title=\"\">The Chain</a> is pretty much the only song this schism-prone outfit ever wrote together. As its bass riff booms out across the stadium, keeping the rain at bay, two new links join this fraught concatenation. Loudest to look at is lead guitarist <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoyvJL6LIbs\" title=\"\">Mike Campbell</a>, a man whose big-hat-and-shades combo nods to Slash from Guns N\u2019 Roses even as his bright yellow raincoat channels Paddington Bear. <a href=\"https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tom-petty-stevie-nicks-friendship/\" title=\"\">He is an old friend.</a> Campbell was the late Tom Petty\u2019s guitarist in the Heartbreakers, played on Nicks\u2019s <em>Bella Donna</em>, and, incidentally, also co-wrote Don Henley\u2019s fantastic non-Eagles 80s hit, The Boys of Summer. (Henley and Nicks had a <em>Rumours</em>-era relationship.)</p> <p>Campbell\u2019s role is to play \u201cmaverick lead guitarist\u201d in someone else\u2019s band, unspooling solos and abetting a cover of Petty\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lWJXDG2i0A\" title=\"\">Free Fallin\u2019</a>, sung by Nicks, in the encore.

      "bodyText": "There is no arguing with the numbers. Wembley Stadium is brimming with fans, even on a wet Tuesday. A dozen people fill the vast stage, reproducing some of the most opulent harmonies and venomous kiss-offs of the late 20th century. On Dreams, a bittersweet classic written by an enduringly swirly Stevie Nicks, a chandelier descends from the rigging. Amusingly, it goes back up afterwards, reappearing and disappearing with every one of her compositions on the final night of Fleetwood Mac\u2019s European tour. Superfan Harry Styles has brought his mum, Nicks reveals, complimenting her on what a well-brought-up young man he is. Super-producer Jimmy Iovine (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Nicks\u2019s 1981 solo album Bella Donna) has flown over from the States, she says. The Fleetwood Mac setlist \u2013 barely varying from Berlin to London \u2013 is replete with peak-period hits and refreshed by a couple of deeper cuts. One, the Peter Green-era blues Black Magic Woman, made famous by Carlos Santana, finds Nicks vamping her way through a female reading of the tune as the chandelier glitters darkly. You can\u2019t help but wonder, though, what constitutes a quorum in Macworld \u2013 a notoriously fickle place, which has seen a number of key personnel go missing. The reunited classic 70s lineup of Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie (back in the fold since 2013) has been touring for a year without guitarist and songwriter Lindsey Buckingham. Fleetwood asked Buckingham to join his band in 1974. Buckingham assented, but only if he could bring Nicks. The results were immediate: two of the biggest albums in rock history, sacks of cash, dangerous liaisons, mucous membranes caked in \u201cbooger sugar\u201d. The Chain is pretty much the only song this schism-prone outfit ever wrote together. As its bass riff booms out across the stadium, keeping the rain at bay, two new links join this fraught concatenation. Loudest to look at is lead guitarist Mike Campbell, a man whose big-hat-and-shades combo nods to Slash from Guns N\u2019 Roses even as his bright yellow raincoat channels Paddington Bear. He is an old friend. Campbell was the late Tom Petty\u2019s guitarist in the Heartbreakers, played on Nicks\u2019s Bella Donna, and, incidentally, also co-wrote Don Henley\u2019s fantastic non-Eagles 80s hit, The Boys of Summer. (Henley and Nicks had a Rumours-era relationship.) Campbell\u2019s role is to play \u201cmaverick lead guitarist\u201d in someone else\u2019s band, unspooling solos and abetting a cover of Petty\u2019s Free Fallin\u2019, sung by Nicks, in the encore. The brightly attired American also provides something for the eye to follow in what is largely a static band. The exception is Fleetwood, the 6ft 5in court jester of British blues-rock, whose open-mouthed \u201cdrum-face\u201d is plastered all over the giant screens as he solos at length in the middle of World Turning, the kind of carry-on punk was invented to destroy. For the latter half of the solo, Fleetwood straps on an African talking drum and faces off against percussionist Taku Hirano, prompting a mass exodus to the bar, and air punching in roughly equal measure. Then there\u2019s Neil Finn of Crowded House, tasked with rhythm guitar and vocals. He sings lead on his own composition, Don\u2019t Dream It\u2019s Over (\u201cthis is a song of unity, without a trace of irony\u201d), which gets one of the biggest singalongs of the night, and all of Buckingham\u2019s songs, starting with Second Hand News. \u201cI know there\u2019s nothing to say,\u201d the song goes, resignedly, \u201cSomeone has taken my place.\u201d Last year, just when it seemed the sordid telenovela of Fleetwood Mac could provide no further twists, the band kicked Buckingham out, reportedly at the behest of Nicks. Flashpoints reportedly included Buckingham\u2019s desire to tour his own solo album around the Fleetwood Mac world tour dates, and that he \u201csmirked\u201d behind Nicks as she gave an acceptance speech at a gala performance. Nicks announced, via the band\u2019s manager, Irving Azoff, that she never wanted to share a stage with Buckingham again, and issued Fleetwood Mac with an ultimatum: him or her. Buckingham sued the band and the spat was settled out of court in December for an undisclosed sum. Who knows what else lies beneath this drama, but the band\u2019s latterday tensions predate 2018. In 2013, the long-absent Christine McVie began performing with the band again, prompting an EP of new songs.

      "body": "<p>British and French authorities have ramped up attempts to prevent refugees reaching the UK with camp evictions in north France running at several a day, new analysis reveals.</p> <p>More than 800 clearances of migrant camps near the ports of Calais and Dunkirk have been recorded since last August, a zero tolerance strategy that campaigners say is designed to stop migrants attempting to cross the Channel by boat.</p> <p>French police carried out 12 evictions in Calais last July when reports of Channel crossings began to emerge, compared to 79 in May, the latest month for which figures are available.</p> <p>Charities argue that the increasing tempo of evictions, a strategy backed by UK border authorities, is forcing the 1,300 refugees currently in northern France to risk the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/09/teenage-refugee-tells-of-channel-crossing\" title=\"\">dangerous</a> Channel crossing. Last month the number of crossings by migrants from France hit record levels.</p> <p>The Calais-based organisation Human Rights Observers and French group <a href=\"https://www.laubergedesmigrants.fr/en/home/\" title=\"\">L\u2019Auberge des Migrants</a> have produced a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2KYMYSq\" title=\"\">report</a> that shows attempts to drive out refugees from northern France have increased to record levels, with 803 forced evictions recorded between 1 August 2018 and 1 June 2019.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an astronomical figure which illustrates the authorities\u2019 relentless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/08/french-police-accused-of-harassing-aid-workers-at-calais\" title=\"\">harassment </a>of displaced people in Calais. The cadence of these operations is uncompromising, occurring on the weekends as well as on bank holidays,\u201d said Jenni Whitaker of Human Rights Observers.</p> <p>The controversial \u201cmigrant management strategy\u201d is backed by the<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-uk-france-centre-opens-in-calais-to-tackle-criminality-at-border\" title=\"\"> UK-France Coordination and Information Centre in Calais</a>, which is staffed by Home Office border officials, National Crime Agency officers and British immigration enforcement staff.</p> <p>The centre, funded by the UK, shares \u201creal-time intelligence between UK and French agencies\u201d and is dedicated to stopping refugees trying to cross the border.</p> <p>The repeated destruction of makeshift camps around the Calais port area and the town of Grande-Synthe, near Dunkirk, has forced many of the refugees to sleep without shelter and also lose their possessions.</p> <p>Of 500 migrants currently living near Calais, 139 are unaccompanied minors, with another 150 children among 800 living in rudimentary camps close to Dunkirk.</p> <p>The scheme to transfer vulnerable child refugees from France to Britain has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/may/17/transfer-of-vulnerable-child-refugees-from-france-to-uk-to-end-charities-say-home-office\" title=\"\">reportedly been ended</a>, leaving hundreds of lone children facing exploitation.

      "bodyText": "British and French authorities have ramped up attempts to prevent refugees reaching the UK with camp evictions in north France running at several a day, new analysis reveals. More than 800 clearances of migrant camps near the ports of Calais and Dunkirk have been recorded since last August, a zero tolerance strategy that campaigners say is designed to stop migrants attempting to cross the Channel by boat. French police carried out 12 evictions in Calais last July when reports of Channel crossings began to emerge, compared to 79 in May, the latest month for which figures are available. Charities argue that the increasing tempo of evictions, a strategy backed by UK border authorities, is forcing the 1,300 refugees currently in northern France to risk the dangerous Channel crossing. Last month the number of crossings by migrants from France hit record levels. The Calais-based organisation Human Rights Observers and French group L\u2019Auberge des Migrants have produced a report that shows attempts to drive out refugees from northern France have increased to record levels, with 803 forced evictions recorded between 1 August 2018 and 1 June 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s an astronomical figure which illustrates the authorities\u2019 relentless harassment of displaced people in Calais. The cadence of these operations is uncompromising, occurring on the weekends as well as on bank holidays,\u201d said Jenni Whitaker of Human Rights Observers. The controversial \u201cmigrant management strategy\u201d is backed by the UK-France Coordination and Information Centre in Calais, which is staffed by Home Office border officials, National Crime Agency officers and British immigration enforcement staff. The centre, funded by the UK, shares \u201creal-time intelligence between UK and French agencies\u201d and is dedicated to stopping refugees trying to cross the border. The repeated destruction of makeshift camps around the Calais port area and the town of Grande-Synthe, near Dunkirk, has forced many of the refugees to sleep without shelter and also lose their possessions. Of 500 migrants currently living near Calais, 139 are unaccompanied minors, with another 150 children among 800 living in rudimentary camps close to Dunkirk. The scheme to transfer vulnerable child refugees from France to Britain has reportedly been ended, leaving hundreds of lone children facing exploitation. A 10-year-old unaccompanied boy was among those recently attempting to reach the UK, where he has relatives. \u201cThe relentless and repetitive nature of the evictions appear to deliberately exhaust the communities, and render them even more materially precarious,\u201d said the report. Of particular concern, says Whitaker, is how police establish a \u201csecurity perimeter\u201d during evictions to prevent refugees retrieving their belongings. On one occasion last March, gendarmes are alleged to have initially prevented a mother retrieving her child from a tent. The Human Rights Observers, set up in October 2017 to investigate allegations of mistreatment by the French authorities against refugees, also report that tents have been routinely broken and confiscated and food sprayed with teargas, and that even jerrycans of drinking water have been slashed. \u201cThese evictions only serve to add to the accumulated trauma of refugees and migrants, and aim only to create further hostility rather than offer a dignified solution. This has led to a deterioration of both the physical and mental health of those affected,\u201d said the report. The vast majority of evacuations occur at Calais, with clearances in Grande-Synthe more sporadic, and currently take place at a rate of two per week. However, conditions at Grande-Synthe are said to be dire with 87% of migrants telling a recent survey they do not have access to a toilet and more than half saying they do not have enough to eat. Charities celebrated a legal victory last week against the French authorities over alleged human rights violations at Grande-Synthe, a verdict that means the state must provide water, showers and toilets for the hundreds living there. A Pakistani man told the report\u2019s authors: \u201cToday police came. They take my tent. In two days, I sleep maximum two hours. It\u2019s too much difficult. The mind is not working, the brain stops working. All the refugees are so afraid now.\u201d In October 2016 a huge semi-permanent camp in Calais, home to around 8,000 refugees, was demolished in a move by the French government to remove migrants from its northern coast.",

      "bodyText": "The neighbour who called the police after hearing a row between Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds said they dialled 999 as a last resort after receiving no response from individuals in the flat. After hearing a row involving smashing and screaming in the early hours of Friday morning, the individual says they discussed how to respond with their partner, out of concern for the safety of those involved. \u201cThe very last thing I\u2019d heard was a loud bang and screaming. First I knocked on their door to make sure everyone was OK,\u201d they told the Guardian on Saturday. \u201cThere was no response at all, I couldn\u2019t hear anything. I knocked three times. Then I went back, discussed further that there was no response and we decided to call the police.\u201d The neighbour, who was waiting up for a takeaway delivery, described loud shouting that could be heard throughout the vicinity, an account backed up by other residents in the area. Another neighbour, a nursery teacher who lives with her husband and four-year-old son in the top flat next door, told the Times that she could hear \u201cshouting and screaming\u201d. Fatimah, 32, said: \u201cIt was really loud, loud enough to make me turn down the TV and see what was going on. I could hear shouting and screaming from a lady, she sounded really angry. There was a man\u2019s voice too, but he was much calmer and he was telling her to calm down but she was still chucking things about,\u201d she told the Times. \u201cIt went on for about 10 minutes. I\u2019ve never heard anything like it. I was considering calling the police but then a [police] van and car came.\u201d The neighbour who called the police said: \u201cI\u2019d heard the screaming and shouting that sounded like it was from the street before I went to get my food.

      "body": "<h2>Surprise! We live in influencer hell</h2> <p>Dearly beloved, we are assembled here today to witness a heartwarming story of modern #love. I hope you\u2019ve got tissues at the ready because it\u2019s guaranteed to bring a tear to your eye.</p> <p>The story starts in New York with a glamorous heterosexual couple: Marissa Casey Fuchs and Gabriel Grossman. Fuchs is a director of brand partnerships at Goop and a fashion influencer with almost 200,000 followers; Grossman is an investment banker. (Please don\u2019t immediately hate them because of their jobs, wait a few paragraphs and hate them because of their personalities.)</p> <p>Last Tuesday Fuchs, who goes by @fashionambitionist on Instagram, shared a video of Grossman sort-of proposing. \u201cI have the most important question of my life to ask you,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/By21YcGAfag/\">announced</a>. \u201cThe problem is, we\u2019re not really into traditional weddings. It\u2019s not really our style.\u201d The romantic renegade then explained he was dispatching his beloved on \u201can extraordinary adventure\u201d. The internet watched in delight as Fuchs headed off on a scavenger hunt spanning New York, Miami, and Paris in search of Grossman and her happily ever after. Every step was diligently documented on Instagram, and the whole thing went viral.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/By21YcGAfag/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Rumours soon started swirling that this \u201csurprise\u201d engagement was nothing of the sort; rather it was a staged marketing stunt. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/was-viral-proposal-staged/592141/\">The Atlantic</a> got hold of a <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/HoJbPPL\">pitch deck</a> that brands and advertising agencies had been sent by Grossman; this contained a detailed itinerary of the proposal and offered them the chance to \u201calign with this momentous occasion\u201d. It\u2019s not entirely clear whether Fuchs knew about this deck (Grossman has told the Atlantic she didn\u2019t), but the fact she diligently followed the content posting schedule in the presentation means a lot of people suspect she was in on the whole thing.

      "bodyText": "Surprise! We live in influencer hell Dearly beloved, we are assembled here today to witness a heartwarming story of modern #love. I hope you\u2019ve got tissues at the ready because it\u2019s guaranteed to bring a tear to your eye. The story starts in New York with a glamorous heterosexual couple: Marissa Casey Fuchs and Gabriel Grossman. Fuchs is a director of brand partnerships at Goop and a fashion influencer with almost 200,000 followers; Grossman is an investment banker. (Please don\u2019t immediately hate them because of their jobs, wait a few paragraphs and hate them because of their personalities.) Last Tuesday Fuchs, who goes by @fashionambitionist on Instagram, shared a video of Grossman sort-of proposing. \u201cI have the most important question of my life to ask you,\u201d he announced. \u201cThe problem is, we\u2019re not really into traditional weddings. It\u2019s not really our style.\u201d The romantic renegade then explained he was dispatching his beloved on \u201can extraordinary adventure\u201d. The internet watched in delight as Fuchs headed off on a scavenger hunt spanning New York, Miami, and Paris in search of Grossman and her happily ever after. Every step was diligently documented on Instagram, and the whole thing went viral. Alas, the course of true love never does run smoothly. Rumours soon started swirling that this \u201csurprise\u201d engagement was nothing of the sort; rather it was a staged marketing stunt. The Atlantic got hold of a pitch deck that brands and advertising agencies had been sent by Grossman; this contained a detailed itinerary of the proposal and offered them the chance to \u201calign with this momentous occasion\u201d. It\u2019s not entirely clear whether Fuchs knew about this deck (Grossman has told the Atlantic she didn\u2019t), but the fact she diligently followed the content posting schedule in the presentation means a lot of people suspect she was in on the whole thing. Long story short, it seems highly likely the pair had schemed to turn their \u201csurprise\u201d engagement into sponsored content. \u201cWelcome to the era of branded engagements,\u201d the Atlantic proclaimed. You know what? Despite my snarking, I\u2019ve actually got a grudging respect for this couple. Marriage is already highly commoditized \u2013 why not cynically make a buck out of the whole thing?

The company actively promoted surprise engagements, for example, because research showed men would spend more on a ring when a woman wasn\u2019t involved in the selection process.

      "body": "<p>Truth or consequences, a parlour game in which players are penalised for dishonesty or wrongdoing, is mostly fun \u2013 but it also reflects a broad moral consensus about the unacceptability of lying. This long-held belief is deeply rooted in popular culture. <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_or_Consequences\" title=\"\">Truth or Consequences</a></em> was the title of a postwar American TV quiz show whose success was so great that a New Mexico town was named after it. Put simply, and as a general rule, most people expect that if you tell whoppers, you get punished.</p> <p>Why, then, do so many modern leaders seem to think they can lie and get away with it? A propensity to deny, dodge or disown the consequences of political actions is spreading globally like a toxic virus. There was a time, as David Miliband, the former foreign secretary, argues in this year\u2019s Fulbright Lecture, when public accountability was on the rise. Not any more. In what <a href=\"https://www.rescue.org/press-release/new-arrogance-power-global-politics-age-impunity\" title=\"\">he </a><a href=\"https://www.rescue.org/press-release/new-arrogance-power-global-politics-age-impunity\" title=\"\">calls the age of impunity</a>, \u201cthose engaged in conflicts around the world believe they can get away with anything, including murder\u201d.</p> <p>The past week threw up glaring examples of how leaders lie \u2013 cynically, shamelessly and routinely. After a meticulous inquiry, international investigators announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/19/mh17-criminal-charges-ukraine-russia\" title=\"\">three Russians and a Ukrainian will face murder charges</a> over a ground-to-air missile attack in eastern Ukraine in 2014 that brought down Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, killing 298 people.</p> <p>The evidence tying these individuals to Vladimir Putin\u2019s government is overwhelming, based on witness testimony, satellite images and intercepted phone calls to Moscow. The Buk missile launcher used in the attack has been tracked from its base in Kursk to Ukraine and back again. All three Russians worked for their country\u2019s security apparatus. It\u2019s a safe bet they did not act alone.</p> <p>Kremlin denials nevertheless flow thick and fast. Russia, <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/russia-denies-accusation-on-malaysian-boeing-downing/1510337\" title=\"\">it says, had no involvement</a>. It had no military personnel in Ukraine and \u201cno opportunity\u201d to participate in the investigation. In other words, Russia is being framed. By any reasonable, factual measure, these protestations are demonstrably, ridiculously false. But contemptuous of the victims and their families\u2019 need for justice, Moscow\u2019s lies just keep on coming.</p> <p>If a major world power can behave this way, why not lesser leaders, too? Last week Saudi Arabia also waged a bare-faced war on truth after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/19/jamal-khashoggi-killing-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-evidence-un-report\" title=\"\">a UN investigator</a> implicated Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, in last October\u2019s murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Since this scandal first erupted, the kingdom\u2019s preferred defence has been deceit, not decency.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Kremlin denials flew thick and fast. By any reasonable standard, these protestations are demonstrably, ridiculously false</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Riyadh\u2019<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/19/jamal-khashoggi-dead-saudi-arabian-state-television-confirms\" title=\"\">s denials and explanations,</a> proffered in the days following Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, were quickly exposed as fabrications. Unfazed, a senior minister once again flatly rejected the UN\u2019s \u201ccredible evidence\u201d of the crown prince\u2019s complicity. Its finding that the murder was \u201can extrajudicial killing for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible under international law\u201d was dismissed as \u201cnothing new\u201d.</p> <p>Is it enough simply to say something isn\u2019t so, even when everybody knows (or strongly suspects) it is? Let\u2019s ask Donald Trump, a serial liar and leading authority on fake news. The US president launched his 2020 re-election campaign in Florida last week. But be aware. Anything he says must be taken with a large shovel of salt. According to White House whopper-trackers, he has made <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/441095-washington-post-fact-checker-says-trump-has-now-hit-10000-lies-as-president\" title=\"\">10,796 false or misleading statements</a> since taking office.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s porky total<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/19/trump-2020-campaign-launch-keep-america-great\" title=\"\"> rose sharply in Orlando</a>.

      "bodyText": "Truth or consequences, a parlour game in which players are penalised for dishonesty or wrongdoing, is mostly fun \u2013 but it also reflects a broad moral consensus about the unacceptability of lying. This long-held belief is deeply rooted in popular culture. Truth or Consequences was the title of a postwar American TV quiz show whose success was so great that a New Mexico town was named after it. Put simply, and as a general rule, most people expect that if you tell whoppers, you get punished. Why, then, do so many modern leaders seem to think they can lie and get away with it? A propensity to deny, dodge or disown the consequences of political actions is spreading globally like a toxic virus. There was a time, as David Miliband, the former foreign secretary, argues in this year\u2019s Fulbright Lecture, when public accountability was on the rise. Not any more. In what he calls the age of impunity, \u201cthose engaged in conflicts around the world believe they can get away with anything, including murder\u201d. The past week threw up glaring examples of how leaders lie \u2013 cynically, shamelessly and routinely. After a meticulous inquiry, international investigators announced three Russians and a Ukrainian will face murder charges over a ground-to-air missile attack in eastern Ukraine in 2014 that brought down Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, killing 298 people. The evidence tying these individuals to Vladimir Putin\u2019s government is overwhelming, based on witness testimony, satellite images and intercepted phone calls to Moscow. The Buk missile launcher used in the attack has been tracked from its base in Kursk to Ukraine and back again. All three Russians worked for their country\u2019s security apparatus. It\u2019s a safe bet they did not act alone. Kremlin denials nevertheless flow thick and fast. Russia, it says, had no involvement. It had no military personnel in Ukraine and \u201cno opportunity\u201d to participate in the investigation. In other words, Russia is being framed. By any reasonable, factual measure, these protestations are demonstrably, ridiculously false. But contemptuous of the victims and their families\u2019 need for justice, Moscow\u2019s lies just keep on coming. If a major world power can behave this way, why not lesser leaders, too? Last week Saudi Arabia also waged a bare-faced war on truth after a UN investigator implicated Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, in last October\u2019s murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Since this scandal first erupted, the kingdom\u2019s preferred defence has been deceit, not decency. Riyadh\u2019s denials and explanations, proffered in the days following Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, were quickly exposed as fabrications. Unfazed, a senior minister once again flatly rejected the UN\u2019s \u201ccredible evidence\u201d of the crown prince\u2019s complicity. Its finding that the murder was \u201can extrajudicial killing for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible under international law\u201d was dismissed as \u201cnothing new\u201d. Is it enough simply to say something isn\u2019t so, even when everybody knows (or strongly suspects) it is? Let\u2019s ask Donald Trump, a serial liar and leading authority on fake news. The US president launched his 2020 re-election campaign in Florida last week. But be aware. Anything he says must be taken with a large shovel of salt. According to White House whopper-trackers, he has made 10,796 false or misleading statements since taking office. Trump\u2019s porky total rose sharply in Orlando. He lied about the Mueller report (it did not exonerate him) and the \u201cbiggest tax cut in history\u201d (it wasn\u2019t). He said \u201cwe are starting to remove a lot of troops\u201d from the Middle East even as he deployed another 1,000 to scare Iran. He bragged about his Mexico border \u201cwall\u201d, which mostly doesn\u2019t exist. Truly, Trump would swear the Queen is his bosom buddy if it helped get him votes. In fact, he has. Trump fans seem not to care that their hero cannot be trusted. And many other countries are similarly infected by the mendacity virus. In China, state media baldly assert that Hong Kong\u2019s street protests are a foreign conspiracy. In Egypt, the regime brazenly denies that its cruel mistreatment of the deposed president, Mohamed Morsi, caused his death in custody. In Britain, Tory prime ministerial hopefuls lie and lie and, in one prominent case, lie low. What chance the governments or politicians cited above will be punished for their dishonesty, in the courts or otherwise? Saudi, Russian and Chinese citizens do not have much redress when their rulers hide or distort the truth. Moscow, for example, will not allow extradition of the MH17 suspects. And who believes a ranking Saudi royal could be forced to answer for his actions? Yet the quest for truth or consequences cannot just be abandoned. Last week the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court pleaded with the UN security council to use the present upheaval in Sudan to help her finally put the perpetrators of the Darfur genocide in the dock. They have been beyond her reach for 14 years. \u201cNow is the time to act. The victims of Darfur have waited far too long to see justice done,\u201d Fatou Bensouda said. There is little sign her plea will be answered, by either Sudan\u2019s new military rulers or the major powers.

      "body": "<p>When Sotheby\u2019s sold a 17th-century portrait miniature last year, it was unable to identify its black sitter, cataloguing him only as \u201ca North African, possibly an Abyssinian\u201d. When Christie\u2019s sold it some 20 years earlier, it too had been unable to put a name to a face. Now a British art expert has discovered that the sitter was a pretender to the Ethiopian throne.</p> <p>Philip Mould, co-presenter of the BBC\u2019s <em>Fake or Fortune?</em>, has proved that it depicts Zaga Christ, who died tragically young, having made his mark in the royal courts of France and Italy.</p> <p>The oval portrait measures just 57mm high, but is an object of great historical importance, he said: \u201cIt is the earliest-known European portrait miniature to depict a black sitter. It represents a moment all too rare in the European history of the early modern period \u2013 one in which an African sitter is treated by an artist in exactly the same terms as a European. It\u2019s a rediscovery, a revelation.\u201d</p> <p>It was painted in 1635 by Giovanna Garzoni, one of the most famous Italian female painters of the 17th century.</p> <p>Zaga Christ emerged from the desert on a camel, travelling to France and Italy, where he was welcomed by Cardinal Richelieu and the Pope. Although some doubted his claim to be the son of the murdered Emperor Jacob of Ethiopia, one contemporary wrote: \u201cWhen Zaga Christ appeared among other princes, the beauties of his mind and body were such that he eclipsed them all.\u201d</p> <p>He fell in love with a Franciscan nun, Caterina Massimi. Their letters, written in the 1630s in their own blood, were discovered after his death in France from pleurisy aged 28.</p> <p>The identity of the miniature had been forgotten when it came up for auction, Mould said: \u201cThe writing on the reverse is how we cracked it. In a delightful deceit, in deference to her Ethiopian subject, the artist \u2013 a rare female artist of the period \u2013 wrote her name in Ethiopian.\u201d</p> <p>Last December, Sotheby\u2019s had estimated that the miniature would fetch between \u00a35,000 and \u00a38,000. The auctioneer described it as a \u201cremarkable\u201d portrait, whose sitter\u2019s identity is \u201ccurrently unknown, however the richness of his clothes may indicate that he held a position at court\u201d.</p> <p>Mould sensed its potential, taking the bidding to around \u00a355,000. Such is its museum-quality significance that it will be priced at \u00a3250,000 when it is exhibited for the first time with its new identity at <a href=\"https://www.masterpiecefair.com/\" title=\"\">the Masterpiece London art fair</a>, which opens on 27 June. </p>",

      "bodyText": "When Sotheby\u2019s sold a 17th-century portrait miniature last year, it was unable to identify its black sitter, cataloguing him only as \u201ca North African, possibly an Abyssinian\u201d. When Christie\u2019s sold it some 20 years earlier, it too had been unable to put a name to a face. Now a British art expert has discovered that the sitter was a pretender to the Ethiopian throne. Philip Mould, co-presenter of the BBC\u2019s Fake or Fortune?, has proved that it depicts Zaga Christ, who died tragically young, having made his mark in the royal courts of France and Italy. The oval portrait measures just 57mm high, but is an object of great historical importance, he said: \u201cIt is the earliest-known European portrait miniature to depict a black sitter. It represents a moment all too rare in the European history of the early modern period \u2013 one in which an African sitter is treated by an artist in exactly the same terms as a European. It\u2019s a rediscovery, a revelation.\u201d It was painted in 1635 by Giovanna Garzoni, one of the most famous Italian female painters of the 17th century. Zaga Christ emerged from the desert on a camel, travelling to France and Italy, where he was welcomed by Cardinal Richelieu and the Pope. Although some doubted his claim to be the son of the murdered Emperor Jacob of Ethiopia, one contemporary wrote: \u201cWhen Zaga Christ appeared among other princes, the beauties of his mind and body were such that he eclipsed them all.\u201d He fell in love with a Franciscan nun, Caterina Massimi. Their letters, written in the 1630s in their own blood, were discovered after his death in France from pleurisy aged 28. The identity of the miniature had been forgotten when it came up for auction, Mould said: \u201cThe writing on the reverse is how we cracked it. In a delightful deceit, in deference to her Ethiopian subject, the artist \u2013 a rare female artist of the period \u2013 wrote her name in Ethiopian.\u201d Last December, Sotheby\u2019s had estimated that the miniature would fetch between \u00a35,000 and \u00a38,000. The auctioneer described it as a \u201cremarkable\u201d portrait, whose sitter\u2019s identity is \u201ccurrently unknown, however the richness of his clothes may indicate that he held a position at court\u201d. Mould sensed its potential, taking the bidding to around \u00a355,000. Such is its museum-quality significance that it will be priced at \u00a3250,000 when it is exhibited for the first time with its new identity at the Masterpiece London art fair, which opens on 27 June.",

Around the end of August each year, the fledgling jockeys of the horse and pony circuit descend on this fabled white strand outside the village of Ballyferriter in West Kerry.

      "body": "<p>Tall trees silhouetted against the sky, darkening as the journey into the woods grows deeper, Humperdinck\u2019s fairytale opera <strong><a href=\"https://openairtheatre.com/production/hansel-and-gretel\" title=\"\">Hansel and Gretel</a></strong> (1893) found its ideal setting at Regent\u2019s Park Open Air theatre. In a collaboration with English National Opera, the theatre\u2019s artistic director, Timothy Sheader, has created a bewitching show full of charm, surprise and enough ribald wit to keep the lid on schmaltz. Adults singing children\u2019s roles can push up the squirm factor to an uncomfortable level. Not here.</p> <p>The bustling presence of children and students from <a href=\"https://artsed.co.uk/\" title=\"\">ArtsEd</a>, <a href=\"http://pimlicomusicalfoundation.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Pimlico Musical Foundation</a> and <a href=\"https://bird-college.com/\" title=\"\">Bird College</a> conservatoire ensured a youthful and engaging atmosphere. Above all, the mezzo-soprano <a href=\"http://www.rachelkellymezzo.com/\" title=\"\">Rachel Kelly</a> and soprano <a href=\"https://www.intermusica.co.uk/artist/Susanna-Hurrell\" title=\"\">Susanna Hurrell</a>, singing the title roles of the children lost in the forest, were unbeatable: credible, touching, and terrific actors and singers who know when to stop. Both have burgeoning careers at the Royal Opera House and elsewhere. They were transformed beyond recognition here, lanky, ageless children in denim dungarees and check shirts.</p> <p>Conducted with flair and impetus by Ben Glassberg, members of the ENO orchestra, hidden behind a screen, played a reduction of the score by Derek J Clark, which turned all into admirable soloists. The loss of Humperdinck\u2019s heavy, Wagner-inspired textures if anything liberated the piece, suiting the open-air context and leavening some of the work\u2019s weightier psychological implications. So this production, in David Pountney\u2019s familiar and robust translation, is unburdened by undertone: no message about the planet, or poverty, or child molesters, or the risks of E numbers in houses made of luridly coloured iced biscuits. Were you buying it, this <em>Hansel and Gretel</em> would be in the \u201cfree from\u201d aisle.</p> <p>Duncan Rock as the ribald, drunken father, and Rosie Aldridge as the tight-lipped, oppressed mother, have stylish stage presence. Gillian Keith\u2019s Sandman and He Wu\u2019s Dew Fairy contribute memorable cameos, all helped by <a href=\"https://www.petermckintosh.com/\" title=\"\">Peter McKintosh</a>\u2019s beautiful designs. The witch herself, played by Alasdair Elliott in vulgar drag, red kitten heels and polka dot slit dress, is straightforwardly mean and nasty. Among many skilful touches, Sheader and movement director Lizzi Gee turned the 14 angels who protect the sleeping children into shiny, blond-wigged, white-uniformed flight attendants (that whole dream sequence worked triumphantly); trees are made of upturned broomsticks; gingerbread children\u2019s eyes glow green; the family\u2019s wooden house is transformed before our eyes into part of the forest, then turns into the witch\u2019s house: enough magic, but enough sap and vigour too. You can catch <em>Hansel and Gretel</em> elsewhere this season, with Susan Bullock playing both mother and witch at the Theatre in the Woods <a href=\"https://grangeparkopera.co.uk/whats-on/hansel-gretel/\" title=\"\">at Grange Park Opera</a>.</p> <p>This is the bicentenary of Jacques Offenbach (1819-80), though you may not have realised. German-born, French by adoption, the composer best known for the lyricism of <em>Les Contes d\u2019Hoffmann</em> or the slapstick of <em>Orph\u00e9e aux enfers</em> doesn\u2019t sit quite comfortably in the British operatic landscape. The humour in his operettas lacks the steely edge of Gilbert and Sullivan, or perhaps their essential French charm is lost in often effortful translation. Garsington Opera has form with his rarities. After <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3KIaRsYwlQ\" title=\"\">Vert-Vert</a> </em>in 2014, this year they have staged the UK premiere of <strong><a href=\"https://www.garsingtonopera.org/performance/fantasio\" title=\"\">Fantasio</a></strong> (1872), a late flop about a court jester, not short of rapturous music and exuberant choruses but whichever way you read it, a thin tale.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfe5b9d838db94b751688c47a7efcdc4a19f9274\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfe5b9d838db94b751688c47a7efcdc4a19f9274/0_0_3884_3008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hanna Hipp (Fantasio) and Jennifer France (Princess Elsbeth) in Fantasio at Garsington Opera.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"774\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hanna Hipp (Fantasio) and Jennifer France (Princess Elsbeth) in Fantasio at Garsington Opera.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At first sight it didn\u2019t look promising: Toulouse-Lautrec and De Chirico meet the Munchkins. Yet there\u2019s a tender melancholy to the music (appreciated, too, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCHSDbyJYs4\" title=\"\">by Mark Elder</a>, who conducted it in a concert performance in 2013 and a recording for Opera Rara), and several showpiece numbers, which Garsington\u2019s cast and orchestra, conducted by Justin Doyle, performed impressively. <a href=\"http://jamesblackmanagement.com/artists/category/sopranos/jennifer-france\" title=\"\">Jennifer France</a> was outstanding as Princess Elsbeth. Her sparkling coloratura arias were a reminder of how versatile this rising-star soprano is (recently seen as Ophelia in Brett Dean\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/29/hamlet-glyndebourne-tour-review-brett-dean-oxford-lieder-festival-2017\" title=\"\">Hamlet</a></em>, and as Ice in Stuart MacRae\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/03/anthropocene-review-stuart-macrae-louise-welsh-scottish-opera-arctic-lpo-jurowski-die-walkure\" title=\"\">Anthropocene</a></em>).

Even his skills couldn\u2019t disguise the weakness of the original material. The chorus sang excellently, and their routines were well rehearsed and nimble.

      "bodyText": "Tall trees silhouetted against the sky, darkening as the journey into the woods grows deeper, Humperdinck\u2019s fairytale opera Hansel and Gretel (1893) found its ideal setting at Regent\u2019s Park Open Air theatre. In a collaboration with English National Opera, the theatre\u2019s artistic director, Timothy Sheader, has created a bewitching show full of charm, surprise and enough ribald wit to keep the lid on schmaltz. Adults singing children\u2019s roles can push up the squirm factor to an uncomfortable level. Not here. The bustling presence of children and students from ArtsEd, Pimlico Musical Foundation and Bird College conservatoire ensured a youthful and engaging atmosphere. Above all, the mezzo-soprano Rachel Kelly and soprano Susanna Hurrell, singing the title roles of the children lost in the forest, were unbeatable: credible, touching, and terrific actors and singers who know when to stop. Both have burgeoning careers at the Royal Opera House and elsewhere. They were transformed beyond recognition here, lanky, ageless children in denim dungarees and check shirts. Conducted with flair and impetus by Ben Glassberg, members of the ENO orchestra, hidden behind a screen, played a reduction of the score by Derek J Clark, which turned all into admirable soloists. The loss of Humperdinck\u2019s heavy, Wagner-inspired textures if anything liberated the piece, suiting the open-air context and leavening some of the work\u2019s weightier psychological implications. So this production, in David Pountney\u2019s familiar and robust translation, is unburdened by undertone: no message about the planet, or poverty, or child molesters, or the risks of E numbers in houses made of luridly coloured iced biscuits. Were you buying it, this Hansel and Gretel would be in the \u201cfree from\u201d aisle. Duncan Rock as the ribald, drunken father, and Rosie Aldridge as the tight-lipped, oppressed mother, have stylish stage presence. Gillian Keith\u2019s Sandman and He Wu\u2019s Dew Fairy contribute memorable cameos, all helped by Peter McKintosh\u2019s beautiful designs. The witch herself, played by Alasdair Elliott in vulgar drag, red kitten heels and polka dot slit dress, is straightforwardly mean and nasty. Among many skilful touches, Sheader and movement director Lizzi Gee turned the 14 angels who protect the sleeping children into shiny, blond-wigged, white-uniformed flight attendants (that whole dream sequence worked triumphantly); trees are made of upturned broomsticks; gingerbread children\u2019s eyes glow green; the family\u2019s wooden house is transformed before our eyes into part of the forest, then turns into the witch\u2019s house: enough magic, but enough sap and vigour too. You can catch Hansel and Gretel elsewhere this season, with Susan Bullock playing both mother and witch at the Theatre in the Woods at Grange Park Opera. This is the bicentenary of Jacques Offenbach (1819-80), though you may not have realised. German-born, French by adoption, the composer best known for the lyricism of Les Contes d\u2019Hoffmann or the slapstick of Orph\u00e9e aux enfers doesn\u2019t sit quite comfortably in the British operatic landscape. The humour in his operettas lacks the steely edge of Gilbert and Sullivan, or perhaps their essential French charm is lost in often effortful translation. Garsington Opera has form with his rarities. After Vert-Vert in 2014, this year they have staged the UK premiere of Fantasio (1872), a late flop about a court jester, not short of rapturous music and exuberant choruses but whichever way you read it, a thin tale. At first sight it didn\u2019t look promising: Toulouse-Lautrec and De Chirico meet the Munchkins. Yet there\u2019s a tender melancholy to the music (appreciated, too, by Mark Elder, who conducted it in a concert performance in 2013 and a recording for Opera Rara), and several showpiece numbers, which Garsington\u2019s cast and orchestra, conducted by Justin Doyle, performed impressively. Jennifer France was outstanding as Princess Elsbeth. Her sparkling coloratura arias were a reminder of how versatile this rising-star soprano is (recently seen as Ophelia in Brett Dean\u2019s Hamlet, and as Ice in Stuart MacRae\u2019s Anthropocene). Hanna Hipp, too, played the title role with panache. She, France and the rest of the soloists, notable among them Huw Montague Rendall as the Prince, did their best to deliver the screeds of spoken dialogue, cleverly translated by Jeremy Sams. Even his skills couldn\u2019t disguise the weakness of the original material. The chorus sang excellently, and their routines were well rehearsed and nimble. Directed by Martin Duncan and designed by Francis O\u2019Connor, Fantasio is a once-in-a-lifetime piece. That\u2019s to say, you won\u2019t want to see it twice. Let\u2019s be grateful, though, that places such as Garsington exist to give us the chance. For Offenbach favourites, ENO has a new Orpheus in the World directed by Emma Rice in the autumn, and Blackheath Halls Opera is staging La belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne next month. Can-cans all the way. The tenor Mark Padmore, a resident artist at this year\u2019s Aldeburgh festival, joined forces with the baritone Roderick Williams, pianist Julius Drake and, as narrator, the actor Rory Kinnear for a programme at a sold-out Snape Maltings entitled The Sea, The Sea. If only all concerts had this elegance and variety of construction. Far-ranging, including songs by Haydn, Faur\u00e9 and Schubert as well as Stanford, Britten and Tippett, it scotched any narrow idea of an island race and embraced wider horizons. As an encore all four performers, Drake and Kinnear too, sang \u2013 winningly \u2013 an arrangement by Roderick Williams of Shenandoah: a river, not a sea but I expect it gets there eventually. Star ratings (out of five) Hansel and Gretel \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Fantasio \u2605\u2605\u2605 The Sea, The Sea \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Fantasio is in rep at Garsington Opera until 20 July",

Back at Krak\u00f3w I took an overnight train to Budapest (costing about \u00a36-7 if you pay local price) and, voil\u00e0, was in a new city and on the next leg of my Interrail trip.<br><strong>Peter Sala</strong></p> \n<h2>\u2019Appy days exploring Europe</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"82f98ba14fde31d4605f541794e5456e11201644\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82f98ba14fde31d4605f541794e5456e11201644/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cologne Cathedral and train station.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cologne Cathedral and train station.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergey Borisov/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/may/06/france-by-train-paris-bordeaux-provence-round-trip\">France by train: Paris-Bordeaux-Provence round trip</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As novice Interrailers, we weren\u2019t brave enough to just wave our passes and see where fate took us.

      "bodyText": "Winning tip: Slow and social, Italy Italy\u2019s length makes it a great country to use an Interrail card. You can travel overnight to save on hotel bills and make the most of your time in cities \u2013 leave Milan at midnight, wake up in Naples at 7am! Some Italian regional trains are great fun, too. They go everywhere and you will have farmers, housewives and students for company, more than willing to share wine, lunch and lives. Once, on a train from Bologna to Florence, six of us in a shared compartment sorted out a woman\u2019s relationship dilemma: whether to move in with her boyfriend in Florence or do a love commute from Bologna every other day. Nicoletta Splitting up in Madrid Beware of trains that split! Heading for Seville, I travelled across the Spanish plains on a rickety old service \u2013 very scenic and romantic. At Madrid, it stopped for a long time and the destination boards weren\u2019t clear. Leaving my rucksack in one compartment, I went into the next carriage to find an English speaker. \u201cThe guys back there tell me we\u2019re going to Seville,\u201d I said to my new American friend. \u201cThere is no \u2018back there\u2019,\u201d she replied. \u201cWe\u2019re on the train to Lisbon!\u201d It took 36 hours to be reunited with my bag, sadly without the camera. Neil Bled bugs bite On the way from Vienna to Lake Bled, normally a six-hour trip, our train was cancelled midway and we were forced to find an alternative route. Eventually, at 4am, eight hours after we had planned to, we wearily arrived at Bled to find our hostel wasn\u2019t open yet. Exhausted, my friend and I decided to sleep by the lake for a few hours until it opened. An hour later, I woke up to my friend shouting in agony. He had been using an ants\u2019 nest as a pillow. Dominic Travel days and local fares If you are travelling on a flexi pass, consider whether it is worth using one of the travel days for every train journey, or whether paying cash and saving a travel day works out cheaper \u2013 particularly in eastern Europe, where fares are lower. For instance, Sarajevo-Mostar (wonderfully scenic) costs about \u00a36 each-way, which is significantly less than a travel day is worth. Alex Creating in Croatia If your Interrailing priority is returning home armed with some killer anecdotes, the sleeper train between Zagreb and Split is a must. Expect three-tier bunks dangling by a rope, a paper sheet in lieu of bedding, and limited bathroom facilities. The journey is likely to be enlivened by beer-wielding backpackers who are keen to make the most of the eight-hour journey, so entertainment isn\u2019t in short supply. What\u2019s more, waking up to daybreak on the Croatian coastline makes up for lack of sleep. Bunks need to be reserved for a small fee on top of the Interrail pass. Susie Night trains save time and money, Krak\u00f3w-Budapest When possible, take a night train. They are comfortable and you save a whole extra day to visit a city, and they also count as one day on your ticket. Night trains usually incur only a small extra cost, cheaper than an extra hotel/hostel night. One leg of my trip saw me in Krak\u00f3w, where I visited the beautiful old town and took a morning trip from the central station to visit Auschwitz. Back at Krak\u00f3w I took an overnight train to Budapest (costing about \u00a36-7 if you pay local price) and, voil\u00e0, was in a new city and on the next leg of my Interrail trip.

According to a report from the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, they could face long-term problems from future heatwaves. But we can give them a helping hand.</p> <p>You don\u2019t need to keep honeybees to help bees \u2013 in fact, <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6374/392\" title=\"\">a 2018 study commissioned by Cambridge University</a> suggests that this can harm wild bees. It\u2019s thought that the more bees there are in an area, the more competition there is for nectar and pollen; if every shopping centre has three or four hives on the roof, what does that mean for the wild bees?</p> <p>It would be easy to assume that our built-up towns and cities are deserts for pollinators. Yet among the grey is also green: parks, gardens, balconies, doorsteps and window boxes, each with the potential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/14/city-bees-allotments-gardens-help-arrest-decline-study\" title=\"\">to feed a city of bees</a>. In fact, urban spaces can, in some instances, be better for bees and other pollinators than the countryside, where wildlife <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/18/saving-bees-save-ourselves-pollinators\" title=\"\">has largely been pushed out</a> to make space for more crops and livestock. Gardens and parks are home to a greater variety of flowering plants than in the wild, and for a longer season, too. What\u2019s more, we\u2019re less likely to use pesticides in them, enabling bees and other pollinators to feed safely. Indeed, <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.0807\" title=\"\">a study published last summer in the journal Proceedings </a><a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.0807\" title=\"\">Of </a><a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.0807\" title=\"\">The Royal Society B</a> found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/27/bumblebees-thrive-in-towns-more-than-countryside\" title=\"\">bumblebee colonies in urban areas were actually stronger than those in the wild</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2b638083d7c2e8ada0beb88f436326d01c96a935\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b638083d7c2e8ada0beb88f436326d01c96a935/64_297_3428_4526/757.jpg\" alt=\"Wooden insect house decorative bug hotel, ladybird and bee home for butterfly hibernation and ecological gardening\" width=\"757\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bee hotels mimic the cavities where solitary bees nest. Photograph: Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marjan Cermelj/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most bees are solitary: in the British Isles there are about 267 species of bee; of those, 220 species of wild bee are solitary. These nest individually; the male and female mate then the female finds somewhere to lay her eggs. She makes a series of cells, in which she lays an egg on a \u201ccake\u201d of pollen and nectar, and then, coming to the end of her life cycle, she dies, leaving her young to feed themselves on the stores she has left for them. Some nest in the ground, in lawns or sandy borders. Others nest in cavities, such as walls, old plant stems and holes in dead wood. Many survive in urban areas.</p> <p>Wild bees include 25 species of bumblebee, which, like the honeybee, live in a colony led by a queen: she largely stays in the nest while her workers forage for nectar and pollen to feed the grubs. Nests are annual, and you may be lucky enough to find one beneath a shed or hedge. The tree bumblebee nests in bird boxes.</p> <p>To help wild bees, you don\u2019t need to buy loads of kit. You don\u2019t even need a garden. The first thing to do is grow as many flowering plants as you can cram into your outdoor space. All bees need nectar and pollen, both to feed themselves and their young. Some emerge from hibernation as early as February, while others wait until September. Therefore, growing flowering plants from February to November is key. Grow crocus and primrose in spring, lavender in summer, and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/16/how-to-grow-verbena-bonariensis-gardens\" title=\"\">Verbena bonariensis</a></em> and echinacea in autumn.</p> <p>The second thing to do is to create nesting habitats. If you have a garden, start <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/27/how-to-compost-gardening-advice\" title=\"\">a compost heap</a>, or let an area of grass grow long, and leave twigs and leaf litter to accumulate at the back of your borders. Bumblebees might make a nest or even hibernate here. You could also erect a bee hotel \u2013 a box designed to mimic the cavities in which some solitary bees nest \u2013 in a garden, balcony or doorstep.</p> <p>If we make all our green spaces bee friendly, we will help tackle the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/03/climate-crisis-is-about-to-put-humanity-at-risk-un-scientists-warn\" title=\"\">extinction crisis</a> head on.</p> <h2>Five species to help this summer</h2> <p><strong>Leafcutter</strong><strong> solitary bees</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7decbddcc30ff7de0708f89eb9b559ac440bc95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7decbddcc30ff7de0708f89eb9b559ac440bc95/0_0_5100_3387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A leafcutter bee, Megachile centuncularis, nest-building in bamboo tubes in a UK garden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leafcutters will readily use bee hotels.

      "bodyText": "Last year\u2019s extreme weather meant a tough year for many of the UK\u2019s bees, and conservationists are concerned that could have a knock-on effect this year and beyond. According to a report from the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, they could face long-term problems from future heatwaves. But we can give them a helping hand. You don\u2019t need to keep honeybees to help bees \u2013 in fact, a 2018 study commissioned by Cambridge University suggests that this can harm wild bees. It\u2019s thought that the more bees there are in an area, the more competition there is for nectar and pollen; if every shopping centre has three or four hives on the roof, what does that mean for the wild bees? It would be easy to assume that our built-up towns and cities are deserts for pollinators. Yet among the grey is also green: parks, gardens, balconies, doorsteps and window boxes, each with the potential to feed a city of bees. In fact, urban spaces can, in some instances, be better for bees and other pollinators than the countryside, where wildlife has largely been pushed out to make space for more crops and livestock. Gardens and parks are home to a greater variety of flowering plants than in the wild, and for a longer season, too. What\u2019s more, we\u2019re less likely to use pesticides in them, enabling bees and other pollinators to feed safely. Indeed, a study published last summer in the journal Proceedings Of The Royal Society B found that bumblebee colonies in urban areas were actually stronger than those in the wild. Most bees are solitary: in the British Isles there are about 267 species of bee; of those, 220 species of wild bee are solitary. These nest individually; the male and female mate then the female finds somewhere to lay her eggs. She makes a series of cells, in which she lays an egg on a \u201ccake\u201d of pollen and nectar, and then, coming to the end of her life cycle, she dies, leaving her young to feed themselves on the stores she has left for them. Some nest in the ground, in lawns or sandy borders. Others nest in cavities, such as walls, old plant stems and holes in dead wood. Many survive in urban areas. Wild bees include 25 species of bumblebee, which, like the honeybee, live in a colony led by a queen: she largely stays in the nest while her workers forage for nectar and pollen to feed the grubs. Nests are annual, and you may be lucky enough to find one beneath a shed or hedge. The tree bumblebee nests in bird boxes. To help wild bees, you don\u2019t need to buy loads of kit. You don\u2019t even need a garden. The first thing to do is grow as many flowering plants as you can cram into your outdoor space. All bees need nectar and pollen, both to feed themselves and their young. Some emerge from hibernation as early as February, while others wait until September. Therefore, growing flowering plants from February to November is key. Grow crocus and primrose in spring, lavender in summer, and Verbena bonariensis and echinacea in autumn. The second thing to do is to create nesting habitats. If you have a garden, start a compost heap, or let an area of grass grow long, and leave twigs and leaf litter to accumulate at the back of your borders. Bumblebees might make a nest or even hibernate here. You could also erect a bee hotel \u2013 a box designed to mimic the cavities in which some solitary bees nest \u2013 in a garden, balcony or doorstep. If we make all our green spaces bee friendly, we will help tackle the extinction crisis head on. Five species to help this summer Leafcutter solitary bees There are several species of leafcutter bee (Megachile species). They nest in cavities, such as old plant stems and holes in dead wood, but will readily use bee hotels. They use pieces of rose and wisteria leaf to line their nests. To attract them, grow old roses (with floppy leaves), such as gallica roses, and sweet peas and knapweeds. Flies June to August. Wool carder solitary bees This distinctive bee (Anthidium manicatum) has black with yellow spots down each side of its abdomen. The female nests in bee hotels higher up than other species, so you may entice them in if you live in a high rise. The female lines her nests with hairs from furry leaves, such as lambs\u2019 ear. Grow these and mullein to attract them. Flies June to August. Red mason solitary bees Another cavity nester, this rusty orange bee (Osmia bicornis) lines its nest cells with mud. It\u2019s thought to be about 125 times more efficient at pollinating apple blossom than the honey bee. Grow fruit trees and catmint to attract them. Flies April to early July. Buff-tailed bumblebees This large, black and yellow species (Bombus terrestris) with a buff or white tail nests underground in old mouse holes, beneath sheds. Nests are annual and founded by the queen, who might have about 150 workers in summer. Grow lavender, alliums and cornflowers to attract them. Flies March to November. Tree bumblebees Ginger, white and black, the tree bumblebee (Bombus hypnorum) specialises in nesting high up, and seems to have a preference for bird boxes. Grow daisy-type flowers, such as single dahlias or chamomile to attract them. Flies March to July. \u2022 Wildlife Gardening For Everyone And Everything by Kate Bradbury is published by Bloomsbury at \u00a314.99.",

      "bodyText": "Every two years, the gnarled old apple tree in my parents\u2019 garden bursts into life. First, with an abundance of sweet blossom in the spring, and then with a harvest of more apples than any family could possibly hope to eat in a year, let alone in the few weeks of summer that they need to be picked. So I\u2019m always trying to come up with new recipes to use up the glut. This year, we\u2019ll be munching these spiced apple fritters while sitting in the garden with a glass of chilled apple juice. Spiced apple fritters Pectin is a sugar that acts as the magical gelling agent in jams. Adding extra pectin to this apple sauce allows you to cut down on some of the sugar, and it will leave you with a fruitier taste, too. Prep 15 min Cook 25 min Makes 25-30 For the fritters 200g plain flour 1 tsp baking powder 1 tbsp plus 1 tsp ground cinnamon 1 tbsp plus 1 tsp ground allspice \u00bd tsp salt 180g whole milk 60g dark brown sugar 2 medium eggs, beaten 40g unsalted butter, melted 2 large apples (I like granny smith) 250ml vegetable oil, for frying For the apple sauce 250g cloudy apple juice 40g apple pectin (I use Certo) 100g granulated or caster sugar Juice of 1 small lemon Greek yoghurt, to serve To make the apple sauce, put the apple juice in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Continue to simmer until halved in volume, then add the pectin, sugar and lemon juice. Boil for another five minutes, until the mix has started to thicken, then set aside to cool. Sieve the flour, baking powder, spices and salt into a bowl. Warm the milk and sugar in the microwave \u2013 just 30 seconds or so, to help dissolve the sugar \u2013 then pour the mixture over the dry ingredients, followed by the eggs and melted butter. Stir until you have a thick batter, adding a little extra milk if it is too thick. Peel, core and grate the apples, then stir them into the batter. To cook the fritters, pour the oil into a large frying pan and get it to a hot temperature, but not smoking. Spoon heaped teaspoonfuls of the mixture into the pan and fry for about 40 seconds on each side, until they are a deep, toasted brown.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from sportwatch for today, thank you for your company. Please feel free to return for more tomorrow when there\u2019ll be news on the Matildas\u2019 World Cup run, Ash Barty\u2019s quest for number one, and all the latest from the Cricket World Cup. TTFN. These sides could have ended the round level on points but there was a gulf in class over the four quarters at Marvel Stadium with Brisbane storming to a 56-point victory. It was just the tonic for the Lions after slipping up against Carlton before their bye week, the four points cementing their status as likely finalists for the first time since 2009. Charlie Cameron finished with five goals, headlining a ruthless team performance featuring a nine-goal third quarter. Today\u2019s Sportwatch is going to wind down once the Lions finish mauling the Saints, but if you still want to keep up with the live sport going on around the world you can begin by tuning into the India v Afghanistan Cricket World Cup liveblog. Later on you\u2019ll also be able to find OBO coverage of NZ v WI and for early risers (5am kick off) there\u2019s plenty on offer around The Matildas when they take on Norway in the last 16 of the Women\u2019s World Cup tomorrow. Indeed! Amazing what a week off can do to a side. On that subject, it will be fascinating to see if Geelong continue their horrible post-bye form against Port Adelaide later. But back to the Lions, considering how poor they were on and off field for so long Chris Fagan deserves enormous credit for their performances this season and a likely first final since 2009. Super Rugby: 57 mins: Hurricanes 32-21 Bulls - The Hurricanes are making home advantage count in their Super Rugby quarter-final against the Bulls. They\u2019re on course for a blockbuster semi-final away to the Crusaders. AFL: 3QT: St Kilda 5.7 (37) v 16.11 (107) Brisbane - Marvel Stadium is an unprepossessing place to be at the best of times but on a bleak midwinter night such as this it is the last place you want to be, especially as a St Kilda fan watching your team sliced and diced by a pack of rampaging Lions. Brisbane just turned in their best quarter in a decade (statistically), belting 9.3 past the hapless Saints. Charlie Cameron was unstoppable on the ground, Oscar McInerney and Eric Hipwood unbeatable in the air, and Chris Fagan\u2019s unlikely mob are blossoming into this season\u2019s good news story. Rugby League: Barely 24 hours after a severe allergic reaction reportedly left him close to death, Queensland\u2019s Moses Mybe has been remarkably cleared to play Sunday\u2019s State of Origin II in Perth. It has been revealed that Maroons team doctor Matt Hislop rushed to Mbye\u2019s aid after receiving a phone call for help on Friday morning, only to find the utility slumped outside his Perth hotel room. News Corp Australia said Moses, 25, went into anaphylactic shock and only had minutes to live after his airways closed by the time Hislop discovered the Wests Tigers captain. Staying on the same hotel floor, Hislop raced to Mbye\u2019s room with a first aid kit and used an anti-allergy injection EpiPen device to revive him. \u201cMoses developed a serious allergic reaction and he was worried enough to call me straight away,\u201d Hislop said in a QRL statement. \u201cBy the time I was able to see him, he was beginning to show signs of the reaction with a skin rash and swelling. \u201cI started treatment immediately and he responded quickly.\u201d Mbye completed the Maroons\u2019 captain\u2019s run at Optus Stadium on Saturday, giving no indication of the drama that had unfolded 24 hours earlier. \u201cIt was something that came on unexpectedly. I have never experienced anything like that before,\u201d Mbye said. \u201cIt was obviously a reaction to something. I started feeling a bit itchy and lightheaded. \u201cI phoned the doc and he managed it professionally. We had all our supplies here ready to go and we got on top of it early. I\u2019m feeling sweet now and ready to play.\u201d From AAP. AFL: Q3, 15.00 mins remaining: St Kilda 4.7 (31) v 10.9 (69) Brisbane - After coming through that opening quarter arm-wrestle the Lions are now bullying the Saints off the ground at Marvel Stadium. The visitors have kicked the last six goals to extend their lead beyond 30 points. Charlie Cameron is the dominant figure on the ground despite just eight touches, one mark and one tackle to his name. The reason being five of those eight disposals have been goals. Rugby League: I\u2019m going to be honest, I don\u2019t really have much of a handle on how international rugby league operates, but New Zealand have just beaten Tonga 34-14 in the opening match of the Oceania Cup. Shaun Johnson crossed for a hat-trick but it was Brandon Smith who took most of the plaudits for his performance out of dummy half. AFL: HT: St Kilda 4.6 (30) v 7.8 (50) Brisbane - The Lions extended their lead over the Saints during a scrappy second quarter at Marvel Stadium. If they see out the contest Brisbane will move up to sixth on the ladder. And if Geelong defeat Port Adelaide later on they\u2019ll enjoy a two-game buffer in the race for the finals and on course for their first September action in a decade. Golf: West Australian Hannah Green holds a three shot lead at the halfway mark of the Women\u2019s PGA Championship at Hazeltine. The 22-year old only secured her LPGA Tour card last year but is now in pole position to secure one of the biggest prizes in golf. Super Rugby: The Super Rugby semi-finals will be hosted in Christchurch and Buenos Aires after the Crusaders and Jaguares won their respective quarter-finals. The Hurricanes and Bulls play off later in Wellington for the right to take on the nine-time champions with the Brumbies welcoming the Sharks to Canberra with a trip to South America on the line. AFL: QT: St Kilda 3.3 (21) v 4.6 (30) Brisbane - The Lions will be savouring their isotonic sports drinks the most at quarter time as they enjoy a slender lead over the Saints at Marvel Stadium. Charlie Cameron has been the star of the show, booting three goals while Dan Hannebery has made a positive start to life as a Saint with 11 disposals. AFL: Positive news filtering through from the MCG with Ross Lyon indicating Jesse Hogan\u2019s injury isn\u2019t as bad as first thought, dismissing suggestions it\u2019s a recurrence of the navicular problem. The Sunshine Coast Lightning have kept alive their chances of claiming the minor premiership with a 65-57 Super Netball win against the West Coast Fever. Victory by the two-time defending champions has kept the NSW Swifts within reach and delivers a crippling blow to the sixth-placed Fever\u2019s finals hopes. Shooting pair Peace Proscovia (44 goals) and Steph Wood (21) were dominant but the home side had winners everywhere. Wing attack Laura Scherian, one of the shortest players on the court, towered over her rivals as she weaved through the Fever defence on her way to a game-high 43 feeds. Every time the Lightning threatened to race away with the contest, the visitors found a way to claw back. Sunshine Coast led by up to four goals during the first half but greater involvement from Fever goaler Kaylia Stanton kept her side in touch. The Lightning\u2019s patience was rewarded when they took charge in the third quarter. New Zealand international Laura Langman flashed into prominence with three intercepts for the quarter. Her exuberance spread throughout the Lightning camp, with defensive duo Phumza Maweni and Karla Pretorius poaching a combined three gains between them to help break open what had been a tight contest. From AAP. State of Origin: The showpiece of Australian rugby league heads to Optus Stadium in Perth tomorrow and all eyes will be on a much-changed (navy) Blues side bidding to keep the series alive. Fittler has made seven changes to an Origin team that lost Game 1 by four points, including dropping the centre who a month ago was regarded as the best player in the world. Fittler has picked fullbacks in the centres. He has picked a seven who\u2019ll play second-fiddle to the six. He has picked a tyro in the front-row and four back-rowers on the bench. Super Netball: 3QT: Lightning 51-42 Fever - The Lightning have been threatening to burst clear all game and they finally put some daylight between themselves and the Fever in the third quarter. Peace Proscovia and Steph Wood have missed just three shots between them so far. The Demons have snapped a four game losing streak to outlast a depleted Dockers at the MCG. Despite Fremantle leading for most of the opening three quarters injuries eventually took their toll with Melbourne running over the top in the final term. The most serious of those Fremantle injuries was suffered by Jesse Hogan, the star recruit in tears on the interchange bench with what looks to be a recurrence of his troublesome navicular problem. For Melbourne there was a return to form for Tom McDonald who kicked 3.2 in a 28-disposal performance while Max Gawn dominated in the ruck. Despite the victory Melbourne remain in 16th on the ladder and unlikely to feature in the finals. Fremantle stay sixth and in the running for September action but there\u2019s just one game separating them and St Kilda as far down as 12th. Tennis: I know we\u2019re deep into footy season and there are a couple of world cups to train our attention on but the story of Ash Barty may already be the sporting highlight of 2019. A recent grand slam winner the 23-year old is now two wins away from ascending to the world number one ranking. She is a star. AFL: 7.00 remaining: Melbourne 12.7 (79) v 11.5 (71) Fremantle - After trailing for most of the match Melbourne have hit the front courtesy of a timely return to form from Tom McDonald. Super Netball: HT: Lightning 33-31 Fever - The Lightning collected their second bonus point of the match to take a two-point lead into the half-time break. Sunshine Coast threatened to run away with the contest in that second quarter before West Coast pegged them back, only to see Peace Proscovia goal right on the siren. State of Origin: A crowd of 10,515 at North Sydney Oval celebrated another New South Wales victory in Women\u2019s State of Origin, the fourth in a row for the Blues. As Larissa O\u2019Connor writes, yesterday\u2019s contest typifies the continued growth of women\u2019s sport. In days gone by, sceptics of women\u2019s sport were fixated on an imbalance of physical strength but over time, many are recognising this genre\u2019s aura of excitement, wholesomeness and determination which resonate widely. It\u2019s a recipe which has seen audiences grow in key sectors such as netball, AFL and more recently, league. It\u2019s now not a case of whether the women should play a curtain raiser during the year, but where next year\u2019s Origin will be held seeing North Sydney Oval could barely hold last night\u2019s crowd and once again, food supplies were exhausted in the first half. AFL: 3QT: Melbourne 9.6 (60) v 10.5 (65) Fremantle - Speaking of The G there\u2019s all to play for still in the first AFL fixture of the day. The Dockers have led for most of the afternoon but with the margin less than a goal the Demons are not out of the picture. Brandon Matera kicked Fremantle ahead on three-quarter time, one of three goals he\u2019s bagged so far in a superb all-round performance. This remains a live topic of debate, but it also invites a cheap gag about the attendance at a Demons vs Docker fixture at the MCG... Super Netball: QT: Lightning 17-16 Fever - There\u2019s just a goal in it at quarter-time with Sunshine Coast poking their noses in front of West Coast. Lightning, second on the ladder, haven\u2019t had things all their own way in the early exchanges but the Fever\u2019s Kaylia Stanton is only shooting at 50% from six attempts. AFL: Sticking with footy, Tom Haskell has addressed the poorly disguised elephant in the room when the AFL is dishing out punishments for gambling indiscretions. With the news of Collingwood forward Jaidyn Stephenson\u2019s 10-game suspension for placing three same game multi-bets totalling $36 in three separate matches in which he played, there is a certain irony to the Rising Star winner being punished so harshly for participating in something that has become so widespread with the help of the AFL. It is difficult to have sympathy for the AFL in this regard, but for Stephenson, as a young man who fits the targeted audience, a degree of empathy ought to be granted. AFL: Paul Daley has filed a typically thought-provoking column on the latest chapter in the contested debate over the origins of Australian rules football. Like the land, so much Indigenous and shared black/white history has been colonised. White fellas didn\u2019t always admit in writing (though plenty did!) to killing the Indigenes whose families had lived forever on the land they stole. Would Wills have volunteered any Indigenous influence on the game he pioneered for the Melbourne Cricket Club, whose first match was played in Melbourne between Scotch College and Melbourne Grammar? Cricket World Cup 2019: New life was breathed into the interminable group phase of the Cricket World Cup with Sri Lanka upsetting England in a low-scoring thriller overnight. Lasith Malinga was once again the destroyer-in-chief and his intervention has made life awkward for the hosts and tournament favourites who have three matches remaining, all against likely semi-finalists, and they\u2019ll need to win at least one to guarantee their progression. In the warm-ups here Malinga had strolled up, arm wanging out behind him and knocked down a single rubber stump four times in a row on the half-volley. As England chased he bowled 82mph in his jumper and picked up a pair of edges and a pair of classic full-slinger lbws. James Vince, Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root and Jos Buttler were the flower of England\u2019s batting ripped out, all deceived by that masterly, dipping, veering command of length and line. Malinga remains a sui generis modern great, the boy from the palm scrub who swam in the sea to build his strength, who came to the city as a country nobody; who is still basically bowling a tennis ball on the beach; but who did for the most heavily resourced team in ODI history here. Rugby: The absurdity of this story makes me resent having to give it exposure, but it is sporting news and that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to discuss, so here\u2019s the latest on a wealthy young man with a multimillion dollar property empire hawking for cash. As you can imagine, the entreaties of a recent Lamborghini owner alongside those of the gravely ill did not meet with universal praise. Women\u2019s World Cup 2019: In the early hours of tomorrow morning the knockout phase of the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup gets underway with Germany taking on Nigeria at 1.30am and Australia facing Norway at 5am. It\u2019s been a rollercoaster tournament for The Matildas so far and there remain plenty of unknowns as they prepare for the round of 16. Richard Parkin is all over the ifs and buts on the French Riviera. Nice work if you can get it. The temptation in tournament football is always to keep one eye upon the pathway ahead. With a potential quarter-final showdown with England, and a possible semi-final clash with either of the two tournament favourites France or the USA, those are exactly the kind of fixtures that a Matildas side bristling to prove themselves would relish. Which is why this Norway fixture is so tricky. With talk of \u201cgoing one better\u201d after three consecutive quarter-finals appearances, the players cannot afford to have one eye on anything other than the match in Nice. AFL: HT: Melbourne 5.4 (34) v 6.4 (40) Fremantle - There\u2019s just a kick in it at half-time between Melbourne and Fremantle in an absorbing contest at the MCG. All the build-up to this one was about Demon turned Docker Jesse Hogan and the aftermath will be as well with the key forward failing to see out the half after suffering an injury to his troublesome right foot. It is feared it could be a recurrence of the navicular problem that has previously ruled Hogan out for long spells. Hello everybody and welcome to another edition of Saturday Sportwatch. On the agenda today we have live Super Netball and AFL, along with a feast of results and news from around the sporting world. We\u2019ll begin by checking in on the AFL fixture between the Demons and Dockers that got underway at 1.45pm, before turning our attention to the Saints and Lions from 4.35pm. There\u2019s only one Super Netball outing this afternoon to keep an eye on in the final round before the World Cup break takes effect. That begins at 3pm and sees the Fever travelling to the Lightning. If that wasn\u2019t enough there\u2019s the men\u2019s cricket and women\u2019s football world cups to catch up on, a rep weekend of rugby league, and the little matter of Ash Barty possibly just a few hours away from the world number one ranking.

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/petra-kvitova\" title=\"\">Petra Kvitov\u00e1</a> received her trophy after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/26/naomi-osaka-wins-australian-open-final-petra-kvitova-grand-slams-tennis\" title=\"\">the final of the Australian Open</a> this January, the crowd roared and roared. Anybody who had not watched the match would assume she had won. In fact, she had just been beaten by 21-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/naomi-osaka\" title=\"\">Naomi Osaka</a>. But this moment was perhaps the two-time Wimbledon champion\u2019s greatest achievement.</p> <p>Two years earlier, the 29-year-old Czech had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/06/petra-kvitova-tennis-star-tells-czech-court-of-knife-attack\" title=\"\">attacked by an</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/06/petra-kvitova-tennis-star-tells-czech-court-of-knife-attack\" title=\"\"> intruder</a> with a knife in her apartment in Prostejov. She fought him off, but suffered career-threatening injuries to her left hand \u2013 her playing hand. This was her first grand slam final since the attack. Accepting the runner-up plate, she tearfully thanked her team, saying: \u201cYou stuck with me when we didn\u2019t know if I would even be able to hold a racket again.\u201d</p> <p>We meet at the <a href=\"http://www.tkspartapraha.cz/en/about-us\" title=\"\">Sparta </a><a href=\"http://www.tkspartapraha.cz/en/about-us\" title=\"\">tennis club in Prague</a>, where she is training for next month\u2019s Wimbledon. This is where the Czech Republic\u2019s top tennis professionals come to practise.

Kvitov\u00e1 missed the recent French Open <a href=\"https://www.wtatennis.com/news/kvitova-withdraws-2019-french-open-arm-injury\" title=\"\">because of injury</a>, but is determined to be fit for Wimbledon, for which she is currently <a href=\"https://m.skybet.com/tennis/wimbledon/event/22510716\" title=\"\">second favourite</a> behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams\" title=\"\">Serena Williams</a>.</p> <p>Kvitov\u00e1 is tall and striking, with big, bold, Picasso-esque features \u2013 eyes blue as cornflowers, long straight nose, perfect white teeth. She is known as one of the friendliest, most approachable players on the tennis circuit. Today she smiles easily as she tells me how thrilled she is to be back, and how much she is enjoying her game. Yet it does not take long to discover just how huge an impact the attack had, and continues to have, on her life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3ff82c48352026d20c76f1dc80e1be18f0cc4921\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ff82c48352026d20c76f1dc80e1be18f0cc4921/101_632_2139_2584/828.jpg\" alt=\"Czech tennis player Petra Kvitova, with bandaged hand, at a press conference in Prague, December 23 2016, after she was attacked by an intruder on December 20 at her home in Prostejov\" width=\"828\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At a press conference in Prague three days after the attack; it took a four-hour operation to repair her severed nerves and lacerated fingers. Photograph: AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Petr David Josek/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I ask if she feels she has been lucky or unlucky. \u201cI was lucky. Definitely. I was so lucky in an unlucky situation. To be honest, I could have been in the <em>h\u0159bitov</em>.\u201d I look blank. She does a Czech-English translation on her phone and passes it to me. \u201c<em>H\u0159bitov</em> \u2013 cemetery. I could be in the cemetery,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, definitely.\u201d</p> <p>Has coming so close to death changed her? \u201cYes, it\u2019s changed me, for sure. In a good way and a bad way.\u201d Having played professional tennis for a decade, she thinks she had started to take it for granted. \u201cSometimes when you\u2019re on tour for so many years, you feel flat or unmotivated, without drive.\u201d She talks about how draining the pre-match nerves would be, how exhausting the travelling was, how demanding it was on the body, and how often she\u2019d wish she was at home with her feet up, watching the telly. Then, when after the attack she did find herself at home watching the telly, it didn\u2019t take her long to realise how much she missed her sport \u2013 and how privileged she was to play at such a level. \u201cWhen I sat on the sofa and saw the girls playing tennis, and I wasn\u2019t able to, I just couldn\u2019t watch.\u201d</p> <p>She says she is now better at putting things in perspective. In the past she would angst about the little things. \u201cI was very stressed, but now I\u2019m more relaxed. I appreciate small things more, like beautiful weather, being with my family and my friends. If there\u2019s a big problem, I do care, but if it\u2019s a small, stupid thing, I\u2019m like, yeah, whatever.\u201d</p> <p>Kvitov\u00e1 grew up in the remote Moravian-Silesian town of Fulnek, 300km from Prague. Her mother Pavla, who worked for a white goods company, was calm and kind, she says; her father Ji\u0159\u00ed was an uncompromising maths teacher who demanded the best of his daughter and her two older brothers, both academically and on the tennis court. He took Petra to play every day after school. While her friends went to the pool to relax, she was hitting ball after ball back at her father. It\u2019s not that he was training her to be a professional, she says, it\u2019s just that he was terrified she would become a waster. \u201cHe never wanted us to be in the square smoking or taking drugs.\u201d Did she ever tell him to cut her some slack; that she just wanted to hang out with her friends? \u201cYes, of course. We had many conversations. I wanted to be with my friends so badly, but he was just too tough.\u201d</p> <p>Her brothers are also talented tennis payers, but Kvitov\u00e1 says they didn\u2019t have the mental stamina to compete at the highest level. They went to university and completed master\u2019s degrees, while Kvitov\u00e1 turned professional once she had finished secondary school. At the age of 21, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/03/wimbledon-2011-petra-kvitova-champion\" title=\"\">she won Wimbledon</a> as eighth seed, beating odds-on favourite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/maria-sharapova\" title=\"\">Maria Sharapova</a> 6-3, 6-4 in the final. Did she not find Sharapova\u2019s grunting (ferocious even by her standards that day) off-putting? She laughs. \u201cNo. You don\u2019t notice at the time, you\u2019re just focusing on your play and on the ball. But when I\u2019m watching it on TV, I hate it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dae402f1eacd462e3c957bf8a72e70fb39972e23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dae402f1eacd462e3c957bf8a72e70fb39972e23/0_228_5340_3362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic hits a backhand during the ladies singles first round match against Julia Boserup of the United States on day one of the 2017 French Open at Roland Garros on May 28, 2017 in Paris, France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"630\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the French Open in 2017, her first competitive match after the attack five months earlier.

She nods when I mention it. \u201cExactly,\u201d she says. \u201cI was lost somewhere.\u201d</p> <p>Kvitov\u00e1 has had an unusual career, both in what she has achieved and what she hasn\u2019t. After that first Wimbledon win, her hero and fellow Czech, nine-times Wimbledon singles champion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/martina-navratilova\" title=\"\">Martina Navratilova</a>, said she believed Kvitov\u00e1 could get close to her record. But she struggled with the burden of expectation. She continued to win minor trophies and remained in the top 10, but another grand slam title eluded her. \u201cI was only 21 when I won, and suddenly people were saying I was going to win so many more \u2013 I wasn\u2019t ready for it. I was like, OK, so now I have to win every match.\u201d</p> <p>Three years later, in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/05/eugenie-bouchard-petra-kvitova-wimbledon-womens-final-2014-live\" title=\"\">she did win another slam</a> \u2013 again, Wimbledon. The relief was palpable. After playing the winning shot, she fell on her back and bathed in the glory. Kvitov\u00e1 had pulverised the Canadian Eugenie Bouchard 6-3, 6-0 with an astonishing display of power and accuracy, hitting 28 winners and sending Bouchard packing in 55 minutes \u2013 one of the fastest Wimbledon finals ever. She says this win meant a lot because it showed she wasn\u2019t a one-hit wonder. \u201cPeople sometimes say, \u2018Yeah, she won a grand slam: she just woke up in a good mood.\u2019 But to win two of them, that changes it. Also it was a tough draw \u2013 I had to beat three Czech girls to win.\u201d</p> <p>I ask why the Czech Republic is producing so many fine players \u2013 three of the current top 20 women are Czech. Kvitov\u00e1 knows her tennis history. She guides me through the Czech greats, starting with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/sep/15/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Jaroslav Drobn\u00fd</a>, who won three grand slams (the French Open, twice, and Wimbledon) in the 50s, then on to <a href=\"https://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/inductees/jan-kodes\" title=\"\">Jan Kode\u0161</a>, who won the same three grand slams in the 70s. In the 80s, Navratilova dominated the women\u2019s game, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ivan-lendl\" title=\"\">Ivan Lendl</a> was world No 1 for 270 weeks.</p> <p>When Czechoslovakia was part of the eastern bloc, tennis was a means of escape, Kvitov\u00e1 says. \u201cThey could travel through tennis. Otherwise they stayed in Czechoslovakia. After Martina and Lendl, every kid played. They say it\u2019s an expensive sport, but at the end of the day you just need a racket and ball, and you can play against the wall.\u201d These days, she says, it\u2019s a virtuous circle \u2013 the more good players there are, the more competition, and the more it motivates the next generation of Czech players.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3e6867d9769bc96797c83e28841d9040a49e6446\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e6867d9769bc96797c83e28841d9040a49e6446/0_142_3500_1764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic embraces her father Jiri after defeating Eugenie Bouchard of Canada in their women\u2019s singles final tennis match at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, in London July 5, 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"504\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her father in 2014, after her second Wimbledon win, beating Eugenie Bouchard 6-3, 6-0, in just 55 minutes.

In 2015, she suffered from glandular fever. In 2016, she played disastrously in all four majors, and at the end of that year was attacked. When she reached the final of the Australian Open in January this year, it was the first time she had gone beyond the quarter-final in a major tournament since winning Wimbledon. While the experts agreed Kvitov\u00e1 was unplayable on her day, she was infuriatingly inconsistent. Some said she lacked the desire to be a great champion, but when I ask her about this, she says it isn\u2019t true \u2013 until the attack she was, if anything, too hard on herself; she wanted to be one of the Czech greats like Navratilova and Lendl. These days, she puts herself under less pressure.</p> <p>There is another positive that has come out of her trauma, she says. \u201cI learned a lot about myself. I always knew I was a fighter on the court, but I didn\u2019t know I was a fighter off the court as well.\u201d Physically? \u201cNo, emotionally.\u201d Had she ever had to fight before? \u201cNo, not even at school.\u201d Was she surprised by her strength? \u201cAfterwards, yes, because he could have killed me.\u201d</p> <p>After her assailant entered the flat at 8.30am, pretending to be a plumber, he asked her to turn on the water in her bathroom. She did, and that\u2019s when he took out a knife with a 10-inch blade and put it to her neck. Kvitov\u00e1 grabbed the knife with both hands, holding the blade with her left hand, and managed to wrestle it away from him. In doing so, every finger on her left hand was lacerated and the nerves in her thumb and index finger were severed. She fell on the floor. When she reached for her mobile phone, he pushed it away. There was blood everywhere, she says, and she was still facing the intruder, who showed no sign of wanting to leave. \u201cMy mental strength came in that moment. I tried to get him to leave my flat. So I started to speak with him and then he left.\u201d</p> <p>She can\u2019t remember how long it took \u2013 five to 10 minutes. Something incredible must have happened in those moments, I say, because he may well have decided to kill her at that point \u2013 he could see all the blood, he knew he would go to jail for a long time if caught, and she could describe him perfectly. She nods. \u201cExactly. And he definitely knew that I was going to the police, so, yes, he could have killed me.\u201d</p> <p>What did you say to him? \u201cI offered him money.\u201d He asked how much she had and she said 10,000 crowns (\u00a3348). \u201cI said, \u2018Are you going to take the money and leave?\u2019 He wanted time.

I said, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t have the time for you to think about it here, I have to go to the hospital, so I\u2019m going to give you the money.\u2019 So he went, \u2018OK\u2019 and then he left.\u201d She comes to a stop. \u201cIf he had had the time to think, in the end he would have killed me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d5361eee04dcebe412ac44975c4be71ec42452d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5361eee04dcebe412ac44975c4be71ec42452d7/0_1070_5504_4705/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tennis player Petra Kvitov\u00e1 against a turquoise background.

Was she aware how badly injured she was? \u201cI didn\u2019t want to look.\u201d As she talks, I stare at that left hand. It looks perfect. She turns it over for me. All five digits have delicate scarred rivulets running down them. Again, she says how lucky she was. The operation lasted four hours. Even today, the mobility is not 100% and there is no feeling in the tips of her thumb and index finger.</p> <p>Did you always think you would play again? \u201cYes,\u201d she says decisively. But then she pauses. \u201cI did have a brief thought that I wouldn\u2019t. I said, I\u2019m still alive so I\u2019m going to do something else. So I started to study communications at university. I thought, if I don\u2019t play again, I need to do something with my life.\u201d</p> <p>Kvitov\u00e1 says her fellow tennis players were very supportive, sending messages and videos on social media, and there was an emotional reunion when she played at the French Open in 2017. Still, something had changed. \u201cThey were looking at me a little bit differently. I don\u2019t think they knew how to speak to me, how they should be, how they should behave. Nobody really knows what you are feeling.\u201d If they\u2019d asked, what would she have said to them? \u201c\u2018Just be normal.\u2019 That was my main goal, that I could be the same as before. The same tennis player and girl, not a victim. That\u2019s all I wanted to be again, which I have managed now. Of course, I have moments when it\u2019s really bad, but that\u2019s normal. I want to be known for my tennis, not because somebody attacked me.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s remarkable that you have discovered so many inner strengths, I say. \u201cYes,\u201d she says quietly, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t told you the negative side yet.\u201d I sense she doesn\u2019t quite know where to start. \u201cI didn\u2019t go out for so long. I just stayed with people I know, especially my family, because I didn\u2019t trust anybody. And that is the very bad thing about it.\u201d Isn\u2019t it inevitable that she would go through a period like that? Suddenly those big blue eyes start to well up. \u201cI don\u2019t trust in people now. Especially men.\u201d She laughs through her tears. \u201cThat is why I\u2019m single, probably. I am trusting of people I have known for a long time, but I\u2019m not very trusting of people who I have just known a short while. I can\u2019t go in a taxi alone with men. When I\u2019m in the city or in the street, I\u2019m almost running. Sometimes, I have this huge fear that somebody is at my back. It\u2019s hard.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes you feel unbelievable, and sometimes crappy. We have those hormones, right?

I don\u2019t have therapy any more.\u201d Does she think she was too trusting, I ask: many people wouldn\u2019t let strangers into their apartment without an appointment. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was, no. When I was travelling, I\u2019d never know who was due to come around to do some work. For me, it was natural to open the door, because it could have been the doping people.\u201d Professional tennis players have to provide a one-hour window every day, when they will be available for drug testing.</p> <p>Twelve months after the attack, 33-year-old Radim Zondra was arrested; in March this year he was convicted of serious battery and illegal entry into her apartment, and imprisoned for eight years (he was by then serving another prison sentence for a separate offence). It was reported that he hadn\u2019t specifically targeted Kvitov\u00e1.</p> <p>Has the verdict eased her mind? \u201cI think so. I always wanted him to be in jail. So, yes, for me, it\u2019s good that they convicted him, and he\u2019s there.\u201d Has it been cathartic? Now it\u2019s her turn to look at me blankly. I try again: does she feel she can breathe again now he is in prison? \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like that at the time. For me the worst was when I had to go to court and give evidence.\u201d She testified in a separate room at the Brno regional courthouse, to avoid seeing Zondra. \u201cAfterwards I felt much better. But giving evidence was terrifying \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anybody.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"194c93b6df519aa12c989865ea7d8fe46be7f148\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/194c93b6df519aa12c989865ea7d8fe46be7f148/0_0_4225_3015/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic speaks after losing to Japan\u2019s Naomi Osaka in the women\u2019s singles final at the Australian Open tennis championships in Melbourne, Australia, Saturday, Jan. 26, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the Australian Open final in January, after losing to Naomi Osaka.

Yes, she says, the men\u2019s game has been blessed by a generation of greats, but it has been so predictable, with the semi-final of virtually every major tournament contested by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer\" title=\"\">Roger Federer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rafaelnadal\" title=\"\">Rafael Nadal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic\" title=\"\">Nova</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic\" title=\"\">k Djokovic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray\" title=\"\">Andy Murray</a>.

For years there were famously bitter rivalries, notably between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/08/wimbledon-2015-serena-williams-maria-sharapova-semi-final-rivalry\" title=\"\">Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova</a>. \u201cThe locker room is more free now.

It remains the most shocking incident associated with tennis, possibly with professional sport.

      "bodyText": "When Petra Kvitov\u00e1 received her trophy after the final of the Australian Open this January, the crowd roared and roared. Anybody who had not watched the match would assume she had won. In fact, she had just been beaten by 21-year-old Naomi Osaka. But this moment was perhaps the two-time Wimbledon champion\u2019s greatest achievement. Two years earlier, the 29-year-old Czech had been attacked by an intruder with a knife in her apartment in Prostejov. She fought him off, but suffered career-threatening injuries to her left hand \u2013 her playing hand. This was her first grand slam final since the attack. Accepting the runner-up plate, she tearfully thanked her team, saying: \u201cYou stuck with me when we didn\u2019t know if I would even be able to hold a racket again.\u201d We meet at the Sparta tennis club in Prague, where she is training for next month\u2019s Wimbledon. This is where the Czech Republic\u2019s top tennis professionals come to practise. In the car park, there is a huge advertising hoarding showing off the players who have learned, or at least refined, their trade here: current women\u2019s world number three Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1, her twin Krist\u00fdna (I later see the sisters hitting ferociously at each other), former Wimbledon finalist Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych and, of course, Kvitov\u00e1. She has made an astonishing recovery, returning to professional tennis only five months after the attack and winning eight singles titles over the past two years \u2013 more than any other woman, rising to be ranked world number two (she is currently at number five). Kvitov\u00e1 missed the recent French Open because of injury, but is determined to be fit for Wimbledon, for which she is currently second favourite behind Serena Williams. Kvitov\u00e1 is tall and striking, with big, bold, Picasso-esque features \u2013 eyes blue as cornflowers, long straight nose, perfect white teeth. She is known as one of the friendliest, most approachable players on the tennis circuit. Today she smiles easily as she tells me how thrilled she is to be back, and how much she is enjoying her game. Yet it does not take long to discover just how huge an impact the attack had, and continues to have, on her life. I ask if she feels she has been lucky or unlucky. \u201cI was lucky. Definitely. I was so lucky in an unlucky situation. To be honest, I could have been in the h\u0159bitov.\u201d I look blank. She does a Czech-English translation on her phone and passes it to me. \u201cH\u0159bitov \u2013 cemetery. I could be in the cemetery,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, definitely.\u201d Has coming so close to death changed her? \u201cYes, it\u2019s changed me, for sure. In a good way and a bad way.\u201d Having played professional tennis for a decade, she thinks she had started to take it for granted. \u201cSometimes when you\u2019re on tour for so many years, you feel flat or unmotivated, without drive.\u201d She talks about how draining the pre-match nerves would be, how exhausting the travelling was, how demanding it was on the body, and how often she\u2019d wish she was at home with her feet up, watching the telly. Then, when after the attack she did find herself at home watching the telly, it didn\u2019t take her long to realise how much she missed her sport \u2013 and how privileged she was to play at such a level. \u201cWhen I sat on the sofa and saw the girls playing tennis, and I wasn\u2019t able to, I just couldn\u2019t watch.\u201d She says she is now better at putting things in perspective. In the past she would angst about the little things. \u201cI was very stressed, but now I\u2019m more relaxed. I appreciate small things more, like beautiful weather, being with my family and my friends. If there\u2019s a big problem, I do care, but if it\u2019s a small, stupid thing, I\u2019m like, yeah, whatever.\u201d Kvitov\u00e1 grew up in the remote Moravian-Silesian town of Fulnek, 300km from Prague. Her mother Pavla, who worked for a white goods company, was calm and kind, she says; her father Ji\u0159\u00ed was an uncompromising maths teacher who demanded the best of his daughter and her two older brothers, both academically and on the tennis court. He took Petra to play every day after school. While her friends went to the pool to relax, she was hitting ball after ball back at her father. It\u2019s not that he was training her to be a professional, she says, it\u2019s just that he was terrified she would become a waster. \u201cHe never wanted us to be in the square smoking or taking drugs.\u201d Did she ever tell him to cut her some slack; that she just wanted to hang out with her friends? \u201cYes, of course. We had many conversations. I wanted to be with my friends so badly, but he was just too tough.\u201d Her brothers are also talented tennis payers, but Kvitov\u00e1 says they didn\u2019t have the mental stamina to compete at the highest level. They went to university and completed master\u2019s degrees, while Kvitov\u00e1 turned professional once she had finished secondary school. At the age of 21, she won Wimbledon as eighth seed, beating odds-on favourite Maria Sharapova 6-3, 6-4 in the final. Did she not find Sharapova\u2019s grunting (ferocious even by her standards that day) off-putting? She laughs. \u201cNo. You don\u2019t notice at the time, you\u2019re just focusing on your play and on the ball. But when I\u2019m watching it on TV, I hate it.\u201d When she was presented with the winner\u2019s plate, she looked bewildered, as if she couldn\u2019t quite believe what she had done. She nods when I mention it. \u201cExactly,\u201d she says. \u201cI was lost somewhere.\u201d Kvitov\u00e1 has had an unusual career, both in what she has achieved and what she hasn\u2019t. After that first Wimbledon win, her hero and fellow Czech, nine-times Wimbledon singles champion Martina Navratilova, said she believed Kvitov\u00e1 could get close to her record. But she struggled with the burden of expectation. She continued to win minor trophies and remained in the top 10, but another grand slam title eluded her. \u201cI was only 21 when I won, and suddenly people were saying I was going to win so many more \u2013 I wasn\u2019t ready for it. I was like, OK, so now I have to win every match.\u201d Three years later, in 2014, she did win another slam \u2013 again, Wimbledon. The relief was palpable. After playing the winning shot, she fell on her back and bathed in the glory. Kvitov\u00e1 had pulverised the Canadian Eugenie Bouchard 6-3, 6-0 with an astonishing display of power and accuracy, hitting 28 winners and sending Bouchard packing in 55 minutes \u2013 one of the fastest Wimbledon finals ever. She says this win meant a lot because it showed she wasn\u2019t a one-hit wonder. \u201cPeople sometimes say, \u2018Yeah, she won a grand slam: she just woke up in a good mood.\u2019 But to win two of them, that changes it. Also it was a tough draw \u2013 I had to beat three Czech girls to win.\u201d I ask why the Czech Republic is producing so many fine players \u2013 three of the current top 20 women are Czech. Kvitov\u00e1 knows her tennis history. She guides me through the Czech greats, starting with Jaroslav Drobn\u00fd, who won three grand slams (the French Open, twice, and Wimbledon) in the 50s, then on to Jan Kode\u0161, who won the same three grand slams in the 70s. In the 80s, Navratilova dominated the women\u2019s game, while Ivan Lendl was world No 1 for 270 weeks. When Czechoslovakia was part of the eastern bloc, tennis was a means of escape, Kvitov\u00e1 says. \u201cThey could travel through tennis. Otherwise they stayed in Czechoslovakia. After Martina and Lendl, every kid played. They say it\u2019s an expensive sport, but at the end of the day you just need a racket and ball, and you can play against the wall.\u201d These days, she says, it\u2019s a virtuous circle \u2013 the more good players there are, the more competition, and the more it motivates the next generation of Czech players. She hasn\u2019t won another grand slam since 2014. In 2015, she suffered from glandular fever. In 2016, she played disastrously in all four majors, and at the end of that year was attacked. When she reached the final of the Australian Open in January this year, it was the first time she had gone beyond the quarter-final in a major tournament since winning Wimbledon. While the experts agreed Kvitov\u00e1 was unplayable on her day, she was infuriatingly inconsistent. Some said she lacked the desire to be a great champion, but when I ask her about this, she says it isn\u2019t true \u2013 until the attack she was, if anything, too hard on herself; she wanted to be one of the Czech greats like Navratilova and Lendl. These days, she puts herself under less pressure. There is another positive that has come out of her trauma, she says. \u201cI learned a lot about myself. I always knew I was a fighter on the court, but I didn\u2019t know I was a fighter off the court as well.\u201d Physically? \u201cNo, emotionally.\u201d Had she ever had to fight before? \u201cNo, not even at school.\u201d Was she surprised by her strength? \u201cAfterwards, yes, because he could have killed me.\u201d After her assailant entered the flat at 8.30am, pretending to be a plumber, he asked her to turn on the water in her bathroom. She did, and that\u2019s when he took out a knife with a 10-inch blade and put it to her neck. Kvitov\u00e1 grabbed the knife with both hands, holding the blade with her left hand, and managed to wrestle it away from him. In doing so, every finger on her left hand was lacerated and the nerves in her thumb and index finger were severed. She fell on the floor. When she reached for her mobile phone, he pushed it away. There was blood everywhere, she says, and she was still facing the intruder, who showed no sign of wanting to leave. \u201cMy mental strength came in that moment. I tried to get him to leave my flat. So I started to speak with him and then he left.\u201d She can\u2019t remember how long it took \u2013 five to 10 minutes. Something incredible must have happened in those moments, I say, because he may well have decided to kill her at that point \u2013 he could see all the blood, he knew he would go to jail for a long time if caught, and she could describe him perfectly. She nods. \u201cExactly. And he definitely knew that I was going to the police, so, yes, he could have killed me.\u201d What did you say to him? \u201cI offered him money.\u201d He asked how much she had and she said 10,000 crowns (\u00a3348). \u201cI said, \u2018Are you going to take the money and leave?\u2019 He wanted time. He told me he needed time to think. I said, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t have the time for you to think about it here, I have to go to the hospital, so I\u2019m going to give you the money.\u2019 So he went, \u2018OK\u2019 and then he left.\u201d She comes to a stop. \u201cIf he had had the time to think, in the end he would have killed me.\u201d Kvitov\u00e1 admits she was surprised by her self-possession. She phoned the ambulance and the police, then called her doctor and told him to call a hand surgeon she knew. Was she aware how badly injured she was? \u201cI didn\u2019t want to look.\u201d As she talks, I stare at that left hand. It looks perfect. She turns it over for me. All five digits have delicate scarred rivulets running down them. Again, she says how lucky she was. The operation lasted four hours. Even today, the mobility is not 100% and there is no feeling in the tips of her thumb and index finger. Did you always think you would play again? \u201cYes,\u201d she says decisively. But then she pauses. \u201cI did have a brief thought that I wouldn\u2019t. I said, I\u2019m still alive so I\u2019m going to do something else. So I started to study communications at university. I thought, if I don\u2019t play again, I need to do something with my life.\u201d Kvitov\u00e1 says her fellow tennis players were very supportive, sending messages and videos on social media, and there was an emotional reunion when she played at the French Open in 2017. Still, something had changed. \u201cThey were looking at me a little bit differently. I don\u2019t think they knew how to speak to me, how they should be, how they should behave. Nobody really knows what you are feeling.\u201d If they\u2019d asked, what would she have said to them? \u201c\u2018Just be normal.\u2019 That was my main goal, that I could be the same as before. The same tennis player and girl, not a victim. That\u2019s all I wanted to be again, which I have managed now. Of course, I have moments when it\u2019s really bad, but that\u2019s normal. I want to be known for my tennis, not because somebody attacked me.\u201d It\u2019s remarkable that you have discovered so many inner strengths, I say. \u201cYes,\u201d she says quietly, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t told you the negative side yet.\u201d I sense she doesn\u2019t quite know where to start. \u201cI didn\u2019t go out for so long. I just stayed with people I know, especially my family, because I didn\u2019t trust anybody. And that is the very bad thing about it.\u201d Isn\u2019t it inevitable that she would go through a period like that? Suddenly those big blue eyes start to well up. \u201cI don\u2019t trust in people now. Especially men.\u201d She laughs through her tears. \u201cThat is why I\u2019m single, probably. I am trusting of people I have known for a long time, but I\u2019m not very trusting of people who I have just known a short while. I can\u2019t go in a taxi alone with men. When I\u2019m in the city or in the street, I\u2019m almost running. Sometimes, I have this huge fear that somebody is at my back. It\u2019s hard.\u201d Has she seen a therapist? \u201cYes. I think it was helpful. I don\u2019t have therapy any more.\u201d Does she think she was too trusting, I ask: many people wouldn\u2019t let strangers into their apartment without an appointment. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was, no. When I was travelling, I\u2019d never know who was due to come around to do some work. For me, it was natural to open the door, because it could have been the doping people.\u201d Professional tennis players have to provide a one-hour window every day, when they will be available for drug testing. Twelve months after the attack, 33-year-old Radim Zondra was arrested; in March this year he was convicted of serious battery and illegal entry into her apartment, and imprisoned for eight years (he was by then serving another prison sentence for a separate offence). It was reported that he hadn\u2019t specifically targeted Kvitov\u00e1. Has the verdict eased her mind? \u201cI think so. I always wanted him to be in jail. So, yes, for me, it\u2019s good that they convicted him, and he\u2019s there.\u201d Has it been cathartic? Now it\u2019s her turn to look at me blankly. I try again: does she feel she can breathe again now he is in prison? \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like that at the time. For me the worst was when I had to go to court and give evidence.\u201d She testified in a separate room at the Brno regional courthouse, to avoid seeing Zondra. \u201cAfterwards I felt much better. But giving evidence was terrifying \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anybody.\u201d Gradually, Kvitov\u00e1 says, she is regaining her independence, but it is a slow, painful process. \u201cI stayed with my family for three months, and now I am living by myself in Prague. The first months were tough. I\u2019d be in bed and if I heard a noise from the bathroom, I\u2019d be thinking, oh my God.\u201d She wants to relearn to live by herself, though. \u201cI wanted to be me again. It was terrible that Mum and Dad, my brothers, my coaches, had to do everything for me.\u201d Do they feel you\u2019ve changed? She thinks about it. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting question. I\u2019ve never asked them, and they never tell me.\u201d *** One thing that delights Kvitov\u00e1 about playing again is that the women\u2019s game is changing: she is convinced it is more exciting than it has ever been. Yes, she says, the men\u2019s game has been blessed by a generation of greats, but it has been so predictable, with the semi-final of virtually every major tournament contested by Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. Look at the women\u2019s game today, she says. \u201cThe first 18 titles of the year were won by 18 different players. It\u2019s unbelievable. The gaps between the players are getting smaller and smaller. It\u2019s really about the day. Sometimes you wake up and you feel unbelievable, and sometimes so crappy. We have those hormones, right?\u201d She laughs. \u201cThe guys can just think about the tennis \u2013 they are a little bit different to us.\u201d She believes the old guard is changing, and says there is a greater camaraderie than when she started out. For years there were famously bitter rivalries, notably between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova. \u201cThe locker room is more free now. Maybe there\u2019s no pecking order, maybe it\u2019s just the generational shift. It\u2019s not as stressed. There is not as much hate.\u201d Twenty-six years ago, 19-year-old Monica Seles was stabbed in the back on court at the Hamburg Open, by a man obsessed with her great rival Steffi Graf. It remains the most shocking incident associated with tennis, possibly with professional sport. Seles was a phenomenon \u2013 she had already won eight grand slams and it was predicted that she would go on to break every record. She returned to the game two years later, and enjoyed some success, but won only one more major tournament. I ask Kvitov\u00e1 if she has spoken to Seles since the attack. Her face lights up. \u201cI have, actually. She came up to me last year at a pre-Wimbledon party. We\u2019d never met before. We said how much we admired each other for coming back after everything we\u2019d been through.\u201d Again, she looks tearful. \u201cSuddenly I saw somebody who had been in a very similar situation, somebody who understood. For her it happened on court, for me it was the apartment. For her the court was an unlucky place, for me it was the apartment.\u201d It\u2019s not surprising that Seles struggled when she returned, I say. \u201cYes, but she won a grand slam after it!\u201d Kvitov\u00e1 says instantly. Her message is clear. She still has her eye on that prize, and a third Wimbledon title would do just nicely, thank you. As we get up to leave, I tell her that returning to the game as she has is a wonderful achievement. She admits it hasn\u2019t been easy. \u201cAn interview like this reminds me what happened.\u201d I feel guilty about taking her back to the moment, but as I start to apologise, it becomes clear that I don\u2019t need to. \u201cTalking about it reminds me what I have come through,\u201d she says. \u201cIt reminds me that I should be proud of myself.\u201d \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).

Sentencing Rudloff in late February this year, the judge remarked: \u201cA clean brothel of this size is hard to imagine.\u201d He said he hoped the convictions would serve as a warning to the sex industry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17aaf4ac610563d7310f8a1e82b09d9b985c2f16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17aaf4ac610563d7310f8a1e82b09d9b985c2f16/0_0_5083_3299/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Holzwarth, Stuttgart\u2019s chief prosecutor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Holzwarth, the chief prosecutor at Rudloff\u2019s trial.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leif Piechowski/ Lichtgut/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three months on, questions are being asked about the scale of the criminality that could be lurking within Germany\u2019s legalised brothels. </p> <p>Augsburg\u2019s chief police inspector, Helmut Sporer, says that the huge growth of the sex industry post-legalisation has fuelled a rising demand for women. German authorities have no data on the number of women who work in the domestic sex trade, but conservative estimates suggest 400,000. According to Sporer, more than 90% of these women come from south-east Europe and Africa, and half are under 21.</p> <p>\u201cThe majority don\u2019t conform to the profile of the self-employed sex worker. They speak no German \u2013 or only very basic German. They have a limited education and they are travelling abroad for the first time. Many don\u2019t even know which city they are in,\u201d says Sporer, who says that all these factors make it likely that many are not working voluntarily in prostitution.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just migrants at risk of exploitation. Sandra Norak, 29, has never worked at Paradise, but spent six years working in brothels across Germany after meeting a man on the internet while she was still at school.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cd3cc748b692055d3fd28b2f2f359df1ecb24111\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd3cc748b692055d3fd28b2f2f359df1ecb24111/0_0_3456_5184/667.jpg\" alt=\"Sandra Norak, former prostitute, in Karlsruhe, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandra Norak, a former prostitute who now campaigns for the introduction of the \u2018Nordic model\u2019 in Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leif Piechowski/ Lichtgut/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Norak\u2019s boyfriend threatened her with violence, forcing her to work at a brothel where she had to sleep with up to 500 clients a month. She kept none of the money for herself. Now an activist for changes to Germany\u2019s prostitution laws, Norak claims her exploitation was replicated for the majority of the women she met, most of whom were pushed into the trade by pimps or traffickers.</p> <p>It was not until 2014 that she was able to get herself out of the sex trade and complete high school. </p> <p> </p> <p>The experience, she says, is a \u201ckind of destruction of your identity\u201d. \u201c[Some of the women] could have got away from the guy exploiting them but didn\u2019t have the strength or the belief to find their way back to a respectable life.\u201d</p> <p>The Paradise case has shaken the industry, says lawyer Frank Theumer, who has known J\u00fcrgen Rudloff for 30 years, and defended him at his trial. \u201cThe big brothel owners, whether in Augsburg, Hamburg or Berlin, have become more careful.\u201d According to Theumer, what happened to Rudloff could happen to anyone working in the industry. </p> <p>There are many who believe Rudloff\u2019s conviction makes it easier for campaigners pushing to criminalise prostitution. Undine de Rivi\u00e8re, of the professional association of sex workers BesD, has been connected with the trade for 25 years. These days she works mainly from her private apartment or as an escort. An hour with her in the afternoon costs from \u20ac300, depending on the services requested. De Rivi\u00e8re says that though forced prostitution and trafficking do occur, she is convinced that neither is inherent to sex work.</p> <p>Lilli Erdbeermund, also of BesD, agrees: \u201cOpponents of sex work seek such high-profile cases as supply for demanding a general ban on sex work or further special laws for our industry \u2026 [yet] these criminalising laws have particularly dire consequences for one of the most vulnerable groups in sex work: migrants.\u201d She says such laws push sex workers, especially those from marginalised groups, into danger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e24a390a6b07ad37d91180d2b6d8df7bef6daa10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e24a390a6b07ad37d91180d2b6d8df7bef6daa10/0_0_3307_1941/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sex worker at the Paradise club in Stuttgart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"587\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sex worker at the Paradise club in Stuttgart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leif Piechowski/ Lichtgut/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For prosecutors like Holzwarth, Rudloff\u2019s conviction is a warning to those cashing in on Germany\u2019s insatiable demand for commercial sex. \u201cRudloff\u2019s case was not an isolated incident,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my opinion, cooperation between brothel owners and pimps is risky but profitable for both sides. A win-win situation \u2026 but the case has had an impact already. I think brothel owners will be more careful about dealing with pimps.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Hilke Lorenz is a reporter for the <a href=\"https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/\">Stuttgarter Zeitung</a>.

Peter Holzwarth, the chief prosecutor at the trial, argued that the owner and management at the clubs were guilty of Organisationsdelikt \u2013 aiding and abetting an organisation involved in criminality. \u201cHe knew \u2013 in the cases brought to court \u2013 that the women working at his club were being exploited by pimps,\u201d says Holzwarth. \u201cAnd he knew the women were trafficked, or rather, he thought that they might be and [still let them work], and that is sufficient for a conviction.\u201d The court agreed. Sentencing Rudloff in late February this year, the judge remarked: \u201cA clean brothel of this size is hard to imagine.\u201d He said he hoped the convictions would serve as a warning to the sex industry. Three months on, questions are being asked about the scale of the criminality that could be lurking within Germany\u2019s legalised brothels. Augsburg\u2019s chief police inspector, Helmut Sporer, says that the huge growth of the sex industry post-legalisation has fuelled a rising demand for women. German authorities have no data on the number of women who work in the domestic sex trade, but conservative estimates suggest 400,000. According to Sporer, more than 90% of these women come from south-east Europe and Africa, and half are under 21. \u201cThe majority don\u2019t conform to the profile of the self-employed sex worker. They speak no German \u2013 or only very basic German. They have a limited education and they are travelling abroad for the first time. Many don\u2019t even know which city they are in,\u201d says Sporer, who says that all these factors make it likely that many are not working voluntarily in prostitution. It\u2019s not just migrants at risk of exploitation. Sandra Norak, 29, has never worked at Paradise, but spent six years working in brothels across Germany after meeting a man on the internet while she was still at school. Norak\u2019s boyfriend threatened her with violence, forcing her to work at a brothel where she had to sleep with up to 500 clients a month. She kept none of the money for herself. Now an activist for changes to Germany\u2019s prostitution laws, Norak claims her exploitation was replicated for the majority of the women she met, most of whom were pushed into the trade by pimps or traffickers. It was not until 2014 that she was able to get herself out of the sex trade and complete high school. The experience, she says, is a \u201ckind of destruction of your identity\u201d. \u201c[Some of the women] could have got away from the guy exploiting them but didn\u2019t have the strength or the belief to find their way back to a respectable life.\u201d The Paradise case has shaken the industry, says lawyer Frank Theumer, who has known J\u00fcrgen Rudloff for 30 years, and defended him at his trial. \u201cThe big brothel owners, whether in Augsburg, Hamburg or Berlin, have become more careful.\u201d According to Theumer, what happened to Rudloff could happen to anyone working in the industry. There are many who believe Rudloff\u2019s conviction makes it easier for campaigners pushing to criminalise prostitution. Undine de Rivi\u00e8re, of the professional association of sex workers BesD, has been connected with the trade for 25 years. These days she works mainly from her private apartment or as an escort. An hour with her in the afternoon costs from \u20ac300, depending on the services requested. De Rivi\u00e8re says that though forced prostitution and trafficking do occur, she is convinced that neither is inherent to sex work. Lilli Erdbeermund, also of BesD, agrees: \u201cOpponents of sex work seek such high-profile cases as supply for demanding a general ban on sex work or further special laws for our industry \u2026 [yet] these criminalising laws have particularly dire consequences for one of the most vulnerable groups in sex work: migrants.\u201d She says such laws push sex workers, especially those from marginalised groups, into danger. For prosecutors like Holzwarth, Rudloff\u2019s conviction is a warning to those cashing in on Germany\u2019s insatiable demand for commercial sex. \u201cRudloff\u2019s case was not an isolated incident,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my opinion, cooperation between brothel owners and pimps is risky but profitable for both sides. A win-win situation \u2026 but the case has had an impact already. I think brothel owners will be more careful about dealing with pimps.\u201d Hilke Lorenz is a reporter for the Stuttgarter Zeitung.

As firm opponents of no deal, the justice secretary, David Gauke, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the international development secretary, Rory Stewart, are likely to leave government. Liam Fox backed Jeremy Hunt and Johnson may feel it is time for someone new in the international trade role, and likewise for Karen Bradley in the Northern Ireland job, where she has been unable to resolve the impasse at Stormont. Jobs in the balance Keeping Amber Rudd onboard and in the cabinet would probably be appealing to Johnson, though their proposed \u201cBamber\u201d alliance ended in anger after the work and pensions secretary could not sign up to his plan to pursue no deal in October \u2013 even though many of Johnson\u2019s moderate supporters do not believe he would go through with it. Penny Mordaunt backed Hunt but is known to be extremely keen to keep her job in defence, where she has only recently replaced Williamson. Johnson would have a difficult time finding a role for his leadership rival Jeremy Hunt, currently foreign secretary, that did not seem like a demotion, apart perhaps from home secretary. Others that have supported Johnson\u2019s campaign but for whom it is difficult to see a role are Chris Grayling, James Brokenshire and Stephen Barclay.",

He comes and he goes, as it were.</p> <p>They\u2019re both incredibly content, she insists, mentioning their respective teenage children\u2019s feelings as a reason to stay independent. But it\u2019s Gwyneth\u2019s aside on the importance of \u201cmaintaining polarity\u201d in a relationship that I find much more delicious. Well, I would, because I think it\u2019s true, having merrily waved off my other half four days ago, back to his own property to maintain his own polar existence. Or, more accurately, his North Polar existence, because his idea of cosy living involves windows ajar, radiators off and icicles forming on nostrils.</p> <p>It\u2019s been this way for a couple of years. I don\u2019t want to change it. On days apart, we speak constantly via WhatsApp. If I need him, he\u2019ll appear \u2013 say, if a big spider is loose in the house, or if very bad news has happened. He is cherished entirely, but I can cherish him 13 miles away. On our days apart, I emotionally recalibrate. (Sorry, went a bit Gwynnie there.) I leave self-tan silhouettes on the bed sheets and a trail of forgotten cups of Earl Grey in every room. I eat oatcakes, harissa and hummus with pickled onions for dinner if I\u2019m not really hungry, play tinny 90s R&amp;B through my iPhone, stack the dishwasher illogically so the glasses look gritty, and indulge many other unique personality bolt-ons that my ex-husband feasibly still talks about in a PTSD support group.</p> <p>Some of us \u2013 perhaps all of us \u2013 are not really meant to cohabit full time. Four days a week together is perfect. All human life is there: the chat, the chores, the waking ups, the teeth brushings and the joint socialising. But then for three days there is silence. And I love silence. Days and days of silence, aside from the sound of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kenneth-williams\" title=\"\">Kenneth Williams </a>audiobook and the cat scrunch-washing its behind. Yes, I love to love, and to be in love, but I really love to be physically alone.</p> <p>Of course, poor old Gwynnie infuriated the world again by raising her sage concerns about modern love. Everyone has only just got over her \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/26/conscious-uncoupling-gwyneth-paltrow-chris-martin\" title=\"\">conscious uncoupling</a>\u201d, whereby the actress foolishly suggested divorce could perhaps be gentle. Divorce need not, she seemed to feel, always involve you and your soulmate descending into full mental collapse, communicating via lawyers or splitting a Sofa Workshop three-piece suite with a chainsaw to make a petty point about \u201cequal halves\u201d. You could love your way through divorce. And now, here she is, saying you can live separate lives <em>during</em> love.</p> <p>There were those who complained. \u201cYou sit on a throne of lies!\u201d they said, but these were perhaps the grumpy cohabiters who\u2019ve not had a good night\u2019s sleep since 1995 because their partner makes a sound like a Black &amp; Decker belt sander for six hours every night. Or people who\u2019d love to find their bathroom unstained and sweet-smelling on every visit. Perhaps they were people who begin sentences like, \u201cChernobyl? Yes, I\u2019d love to watch that, but my other half doesn\u2019t like disaster shows\u2026\u201d, before trailing off into an introspective abyss, accepting that somewhere along the way they have discarded the fundamentals of who they are and what they enjoy, in order to cheapen household bills, gain better living conditions and, of course, greater intimacy, which weirdly, with time, has become less intimacy with a thick underbelly of resentment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/01/grace-dent-reminder-why-dont-want-children\">Ah, the summer holidays \u2013 my annual reminder why I don't want to have kids | Grace Dent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I accept that \u201cliving apart together\u201d could be the ultimate in having your cake and eating it. The conventional wisdom has always been that if you want commitment and security from your partner, then you must pay the price of never sleeping apart, ever, and maintaining a laser-eyed scrutiny of each other\u2019s schedules. \u201cA man is only as faithful as his opportunities,\u201d I was told many times growing up. But if cohabiting actually stopped anyone cheating, then surely Premier Inn would go into liquidation tomorrow. And while most infidelity is about a short-lived urge for strangeness, the irony is, when you live part-time apart, you both carry on being the other one\u2019s sexy, mysterious thing for much longer.</p> <p>Not that Gwyneth Paltrow has to worry about this kind of thing \u2013 look at her, for God\u2019s sake. Her skin seems to radiate gold. Personally, I benefit from three days per week out of service, to focus on the arduous \u201cpainting of the Forth Bridge\u201d-style maintenance that keeps me, in my 40s, on just the right side of shaggable. My dream is to one day buy a castle where the two of us could eventually cohabit: separate wings, several bathrooms, and potentially a cottage several acres away for when one of us becomes too annoying.</p> <p>But for now, I stand with Gwyneth and the great philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sting\" title=\"\">Sting</a>. It is utterly unorthodox, yes, but if you love someone, set them free.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin parted ways in 2014, but there has been no rush by the rose quartz vagina egg-flogging star to move another man into her Hollywood home full time. Despite marrying TV producer Brad Falchuk last September, Gwyneth says he lives there sporadically. He comes and he goes, as it were. They\u2019re both incredibly content, she insists, mentioning their respective teenage children\u2019s feelings as a reason to stay independent. But it\u2019s Gwyneth\u2019s aside on the importance of \u201cmaintaining polarity\u201d in a relationship that I find much more delicious. Well, I would, because I think it\u2019s true, having merrily waved off my other half four days ago, back to his own property to maintain his own polar existence. Or, more accurately, his North Polar existence, because his idea of cosy living involves windows ajar, radiators off and icicles forming on nostrils. It\u2019s been this way for a couple of years. I don\u2019t want to change it. On days apart, we speak constantly via WhatsApp. If I need him, he\u2019ll appear \u2013 say, if a big spider is loose in the house, or if very bad news has happened. He is cherished entirely, but I can cherish him 13 miles away. On our days apart, I emotionally recalibrate. (Sorry, went a bit Gwynnie there.) I leave self-tan silhouettes on the bed sheets and a trail of forgotten cups of Earl Grey in every room. I eat oatcakes, harissa and hummus with pickled onions for dinner if I\u2019m not really hungry, play tinny 90s R&amp;B through my iPhone, stack the dishwasher illogically so the glasses look gritty, and indulge many other unique personality bolt-ons that my ex-husband feasibly still talks about in a PTSD support group. Some of us \u2013 perhaps all of us \u2013 are not really meant to cohabit full time. Four days a week together is perfect. All human life is there: the chat, the chores, the waking ups, the teeth brushings and the joint socialising. But then for three days there is silence. And I love silence. Days and days of silence, aside from the sound of a Kenneth Williams audiobook and the cat scrunch-washing its behind. Yes, I love to love, and to be in love, but I really love to be physically alone. Of course, poor old Gwynnie infuriated the world again by raising her sage concerns about modern love. Everyone has only just got over her \u201cconscious uncoupling\u201d, whereby the actress foolishly suggested divorce could perhaps be gentle. Divorce need not, she seemed to feel, always involve you and your soulmate descending into full mental collapse, communicating via lawyers or splitting a Sofa Workshop three-piece suite with a chainsaw to make a petty point about \u201cequal halves\u201d. You could love your way through divorce. And now, here she is, saying you can live separate lives during love. There were those who complained. \u201cYou sit on a throne of lies!\u201d they said, but these were perhaps the grumpy cohabiters who\u2019ve not had a good night\u2019s sleep since 1995 because their partner makes a sound like a Black &amp; Decker belt sander for six hours every night. Or people who\u2019d love to find their bathroom unstained and sweet-smelling on every visit. Perhaps they were people who begin sentences like, \u201cChernobyl? Yes, I\u2019d love to watch that, but my other half doesn\u2019t like disaster shows\u2026\u201d, before trailing off into an introspective abyss, accepting that somewhere along the way they have discarded the fundamentals of who they are and what they enjoy, in order to cheapen household bills, gain better living conditions and, of course, greater intimacy, which weirdly, with time, has become less intimacy with a thick underbelly of resentment. I accept that \u201cliving apart together\u201d could be the ultimate in having your cake and eating it. The conventional wisdom has always been that if you want commitment and security from your partner, then you must pay the price of never sleeping apart, ever, and maintaining a laser-eyed scrutiny of each other\u2019s schedules. \u201cA man is only as faithful as his opportunities,\u201d I was told many times growing up. But if cohabiting actually stopped anyone cheating, then surely Premier Inn would go into liquidation tomorrow. And while most infidelity is about a short-lived urge for strangeness, the irony is, when you live part-time apart, you both carry on being the other one\u2019s sexy, mysterious thing for much longer. Not that Gwyneth Paltrow has to worry about this kind of thing \u2013 look at her, for God\u2019s sake. Her skin seems to radiate gold. Personally, I benefit from three days per week out of service, to focus on the arduous \u201cpainting of the Forth Bridge\u201d-style maintenance that keeps me, in my 40s, on just the right side of shaggable. My dream is to one day buy a castle where the two of us could eventually cohabit: separate wings, several bathrooms, and potentially a cottage several acres away for when one of us becomes too annoying. But for now, I stand with Gwyneth and the great philosopher Sting. It is utterly unorthodox, yes, but if you love someone, set them free.",

      "body": "<p>In 1969, when the New York police raided the Stonewall Inn and encountered unexpected resistance from LGBT protesters, homosexuality was still criminalised in most countries. Even in more tolerant societies, venturing out of the closet was often akin to social and professional suicide. Today, in contrast, the prime minister of Serbia is openly lesbian and the prime minister of Ireland is proudly gay, as are the CEO of Apple and numerous other politicians, businesspeople, artists and scientists. In the United States, the average Republican today holds far more liberal views on LGBT issues than the average Democrat held in 1969. The argument has moved from \u201cshould the state imprison LGBT people?\u201d to \u201cshould the state recognise same-sex marriage?\u201d (and almost <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2017/06/26/support-for-same-sex-marriage-grows-even-among-groups-that-had-been-skeptical/\" title=\"\">half of Republicans support</a> same-sex marriage).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>History rarely moves in a straight line. There's no reason to think LGBT liberation will inevitably spread around the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That said, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/27/gay-relationships-still-criminalised-countries-report\" title=\"\">about 70 countries</a> still criminalise homosexuality today. Saudi Arabia, Iran, Brunei and several more sentence gay people to death. Even the most gay-friendly societies are rife with discrimination, abuse and hate crimes. Moreover, the remarkable achievements of the past 50 years are no guarantee for the future. History rarely moves in a straight line. There is no reason to think that LGBT liberation will inevitably spread around the world, eventually reaching Saudi Arabia and Brunei. Indeed, violent homophobic backlashes are possible, even in the most liberal countries. Just last week the Guardian revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/14/homophobic-and-transphobic-hate-crimes-surge-in-england-and-wales\" title=\"\">shocking statistics</a> that showed homophobic and transphobic hate crimes have doubled in the UK over the past five years.</p> <p>As a historical analogy, consider the situation of Europe\u2019s Jews in the 1920s and early 1930s. During that period, European Jews were liberated from centuries of discriminatory laws, and in many countries they had gained full legal, economic and political equality. Just as today the LGBT community takes pride in the prime ministers of Serbia and Ireland, so nearly a century ago Jews noted with satisfaction that the German foreign minister, Walther Rathenau, and the French prime minister, L\u00e9on Blum, were Jews. Just as today gay, lesbian and transgender people insist on the right to serve their countries in the military \u2013 as the ultimate marker of national integration \u2013 so during the first world war 100,000 Jews served loyally in the German army, and 12,000 lost their lives for the Fatherland.</p> <p>Even the gay and lesbian people who today feel so sure of their position that they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/26/ascent-lgbt-right-wing-afd\" title=\"\">support far-right parties</a> such as Germany\u2019s AfD and Italy\u2019s Lega have had their Jewish counterparts in interwar Europe. Mussolini\u2019s fascist party at first distanced itself from antisemitism, and thousands of Jews supported Mussolini and even joined the fascist party. Mussolini\u2019s lover was Jewish, as was his finance minister in the 1930s. We all know how that story ended. Blum barely survived Dachau, and the Jewish war veterans met the Jewish fascists in Auschwitz.</p> <p>There are alarming signs that the era of LGBT liberation might also be followed by an era of unprecedented persecution. In particular, LGBT people might become the preferred targets for ultra-nationalist witch-hunts. In eastern Europe, for example, nationalist leaders who refrain from antisemitism due to the terrible memories of the Holocaust instead frighten the population with tales of a global gay conspiracy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1841f3b3daf4876c5ad1bdead64ce3a5916fcbd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1841f3b3daf4876c5ad1bdead64ce3a5916fcbd9/0_0_3161_2387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstration in the wake of the Stonewall Riots, early 1970s\" width=\"1000\" height=\"755\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstration in the wake of the Stonewall Riots, early 1970s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leonard Fink/thegaycenter.org</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In both <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/07/world/europe/poland-gay-rights.html\" title=\"\">Poland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/07/world/europe/hungary-viktor-orban-election.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Hungary</a>, the governments routinely depict gay people as foreign agents and as a threat to the survival not only of the nation, but of western civilisation itself. These regimes even manage to link LGBT people to immigration, by arguing that the gay conspiracy hopes to decrease native birth rates in order to open the door to a flood of immigrants.</p> <p>The Russian regime, too, claims that a worldwide homosexual conspiracy seeks to destroy the country. Official media has depicted both anti-government demonstrations in Russia and the 2013/14 Ukrainian revolution as the handiwork of the gay cabal, Timothy Snyder writes in <em>The Road to Unfreedom</em>. The media also present Russian LGBT people as traitors, arguing that homosexuality is alien to Russian traditions, so the mere fact that you are gay is proof that you must be a foreign agent. A <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/majority-russians-believe-gays-conspiring-destroy-country-s-values-poll-n905196\" title=\"\">poll conducted in May 2018</a> revealed that 63% of Russians are convinced that an organised, global gay network is indeed working to undermine Russia\u2019s traditional spiritual values and thereby weaken the country.</p> <p>To combat this alleged threat, in 2013 Russia passed a notorious law banning \u201cgay propaganda\u201d, which has led to the arrest and persecution of numerous people. In August 2018, a 16-year-old teenager, Maxim Neverov, was charged with the \u201ccrime\u201d of uploading several pictures of guys hugging to the Russian social media platform Vkontakte. The high-school pupil was fined 50,000 roubles (\u00a3616) \u2013 more than the average monthly salary in Russia \u2013 before <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-lgbt-ruling/in-lgbt-rights-victoryrussian-teenwins-gaypropaganda-case-idUSKCN1N02JY\" title=\"\">winning a court appeal</a> against the decision.</p> <p>Eastern Europe is hardly unique. Regimes and politicians in numerous countries, from Brazil to Uganda, spread tales about LGBT conspiracies, and promise to protect the nation from the queer menace. LGBT people are tempting targets for such witch-hunts for two main reasons. First, conservative authoritarian regimes usually bemoan the fluidity and complexity of reality, and promise a return to an imaginary golden age when boundaries were clear, identities were fixed, and people had little room for making personal choices. Back in those good old days, men were men, women were women, foreigners were enemies, and nobody had to think too much about all that complicated stuff. But LGBT people blur the boundaries, mix up identities, and force people to think and choose. No wonder <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/07/27/why-autocrats-fear-lgbt-rights-trump/\">autocrats hate them</a>.</p> <p>Second, LGBT people don\u2019t have much power, so persecuting them is cheap. Throughout history, autocrats have often singled out a weak minority, made it look far more powerful and dangerous than it really was, and then promised to protect society against this non-existent threat. That was the case in the original witch-hunts in early modern Europe, which often targeted elderly women and lonely eccentrics. The same logic is now at work in such places as Russia \u2013 a country that suffers from many serious problems. Its economy is stagnating, corruption is endemic and public services are deteriorating. But fighting corruption means taking on the strongest men in Russia. It is far easier to forget about these headaches and instead protect innocent Russians from the corrupting tentacles of the global gay conspiracy. Just try to put a rouble value on all this. How many roubles would it cost to improve Russia\u2019s dysfunctional healthcare system?

The teens did not necessarily identify as LGBT. It was enough for them to show an interest in LGBT-related items \u2013 for example \u201cliking\u201d an LGBT-related story \u2013 to become a target. Israeli security forces have also been known to use various methods \u2013 including online surveillance \u2013 to identify gay Palestinians, but not in order to \u201cconvert\u201d them. Rather, gay Palestinians are <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/av8b5j/gay-palestinians-are-being-blackmailed-into-working-as-informants\" title=\"\">blackmailed to become Israeli informers</a>.

At the time, the professor was working on proving the ability of algorithms to detect whether a man is gay or straight with an accuracy of 91%, based solely on analysing a few facial pictures. While the professor himself was doing so in order to alert the public to the danger such technology poses for individual privacy, the Russian officials were probably more interested in learning how to use the technology than how to protect people\u2019s rights.</p> <p>Even if you have never had a Grindr account, never watched gay porn online and never clicked on LGBT-related news items, in the not too distant future merely allowing your eyes to roam freely could cost you your liberty. Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook\" title=\"\">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a> </em>describes how corporations are developing ever more sophisticated tools to know what their customers like. For example, if you watch a television series, the producers want to know which characters or scenes most engage your attention, in order to make future episodes even more addictive. To ask viewers for their opinions is a cumbersome and untrustworthy method. It is much better to directly track involuntary biometric signals such as eye movement and blood pressure. Tracking such signals might tell the network, for example, that 63% of viewers connect to a minor character, so it would be a good idea to expand their role.</p> <p>Exactly the same technology could also tell the future gender police that you are a secret \u201cgender traitor\u201d. If the biometric sensors incorporated into the TV discover that a man watching the kiss scene in <em>Game of Thrones</em> between Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen focuses his gaze on the macho hero more than on the Mother of Dragons \u2013 the gender police might knock on his door at 2am next morning to look further into the matter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10b5426e9556ac4b629d87ea062fc41104938459\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10b5426e9556ac4b629d87ea062fc41104938459/0_226_6000_3774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An anti-Jair Bolsonaro protester in S\u00e3o Paulo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An anti-Jair Bolsonaro protester in S\u00e3o Paulo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you think of protecting yourself by not watching any television, not surfing the internet and flushing your smartphone down the toilet, what will you do when cameras are placed on every street corner and sensors constantly scrutinise how people behave in coffeeshops or in school?

In March 2019, the Guangdong Guangya high school in China reportedly purchased 3,500 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/08/chinese-school-under-fire-for-buying-tracking-bracelets-for-students\" title=\"\">biometric bracelets</a> to monitor students\u2019 physical activities, heart rates and the number of times they raised their hands in class. By cross-referencing data-points, future schools might be able to tell not only who fell asleep during maths class, but also who fell in love with the maths teacher.</p> <p>Now multiply this thought experiment by several millions. In recent years China has turned its Xinjiang province into the world\u2019s largest surveillance laboratory. In an alleged attempt to stamp out \u201cIslamic extremism\u201d, Chinese authorities are constantly monitoring millions of local Muslims. People are forced to give samples of their DNA, blood, fingerprints, voice recordings and face scans. These markers then allow the government to track personal activities with the help of a countrywide network of CCTV cameras, handheld devices, facial recognition software and machine-learning algorithms. Sensors are placed everywhere \u2013 from markets to mosques. When the algorithms recognise a suspected pattern of behaviour \u2013 perhaps using religious speech, wearing traditional Islamic clothes, or visiting a mosque too frequently \u2013 the \u201coffender\u201d might be warned by the police or sent to a \u201cre-education\u201d camp.

What might happen, for example, if the people in charge of China\u2019s burgeoning social credit system decide that having a same-sex love affair is an antisocial behaviour that should detract from your social credit \u2013 and therefore from your ability to enter prestigious colleges, get a mortgage, or buy a plane ticket?</p> <p>Xinjiang sounds like a far-off place, but we are living in a global world. Agents of various regimes are flocking to Xinjiang these days to learn the methods and buy the technology. The combination of revolutionary technologies with conservative ideologies could well lead to the creation of the most totalitarian regimes in history.</p> <p>Technology is not inherently bad, of course. I met my husband 17 years ago on one of the first online gay dating sites, and I am deeply grateful to the engineers and entrepreneurs who developed that site. Living in a small conservative Israeli town, the only place to meet guys was online. LGBT people are particularly vulnerable to online surveillance precisely because they have benefited so much from the new online social opportunities. Therefore my message is not that we should all go offline and stop all further technological progress. Rather, the message is that technology makes the political stakes higher than ever.</p> <p>In the 20th century, people used similar technologies to build very different political regimes.

In the end, most of the dystopian scenarios that frightened people in 1969 did not materialise, because many people struggled to prevent them. If you wish to prevent the dystopian scenarios of the 21st century, there are many things you can do. But the most important thing is to join an organisation. Cooperation is what makes humans powerful. Cooperation is what the Stonewall riots were all about. They were the moment when a lot of individual suffering crystallised into a collective movement. Until Stonewall, LGBT people conducted isolated survival struggles against a terribly unjust system. After Stonewall, enough people organised together to change the system itself.</p> <p>The lesson of Stonewall is as true today as it was in 1969, and is relevant to all humans, not just to those who identify as LGBT.

To cope well with these challenges, we need to organise. I cannot tell you which organisation to join \u2013 there are many good options \u2013 but please do it soon. Do it this week.

      "bodyText": "In 1969, when the New York police raided the Stonewall Inn and encountered unexpected resistance from LGBT protesters, homosexuality was still criminalised in most countries. Even in more tolerant societies, venturing out of the closet was often akin to social and professional suicide. Today, in contrast, the prime minister of Serbia is openly lesbian and the prime minister of Ireland is proudly gay, as are the CEO of Apple and numerous other politicians, businesspeople, artists and scientists. In the United States, the average Republican today holds far more liberal views on LGBT issues than the average Democrat held in 1969. The argument has moved from \u201cshould the state imprison LGBT people?\u201d to \u201cshould the state recognise same-sex marriage?\u201d (and almost half of Republicans support same-sex marriage). That said, about 70 countries still criminalise homosexuality today. Saudi Arabia, Iran, Brunei and several more sentence gay people to death. Even the most gay-friendly societies are rife with discrimination, abuse and hate crimes. Moreover, the remarkable achievements of the past 50 years are no guarantee for the future. History rarely moves in a straight line. There is no reason to think that LGBT liberation will inevitably spread around the world, eventually reaching Saudi Arabia and Brunei. Indeed, violent homophobic backlashes are possible, even in the most liberal countries. Just last week the Guardian revealed shocking statistics that showed homophobic and transphobic hate crimes have doubled in the UK over the past five years. As a historical analogy, consider the situation of Europe\u2019s Jews in the 1920s and early 1930s. During that period, European Jews were liberated from centuries of discriminatory laws, and in many countries they had gained full legal, economic and political equality. Just as today the LGBT community takes pride in the prime ministers of Serbia and Ireland, so nearly a century ago Jews noted with satisfaction that the German foreign minister, Walther Rathenau, and the French prime minister, L\u00e9on Blum, were Jews. Just as today gay, lesbian and transgender people insist on the right to serve their countries in the military \u2013 as the ultimate marker of national integration \u2013 so during the first world war 100,000 Jews served loyally in the German army, and 12,000 lost their lives for the Fatherland. Even the gay and lesbian people who today feel so sure of their position that they support far-right parties such as Germany\u2019s AfD and Italy\u2019s Lega have had their Jewish counterparts in interwar Europe. Mussolini\u2019s fascist party at first distanced itself from antisemitism, and thousands of Jews supported Mussolini and even joined the fascist party. Mussolini\u2019s lover was Jewish, as was his finance minister in the 1930s. We all know how that story ended. Blum barely survived Dachau, and the Jewish war veterans met the Jewish fascists in Auschwitz. There are alarming signs that the era of LGBT liberation might also be followed by an era of unprecedented persecution. In particular, LGBT people might become the preferred targets for ultra-nationalist witch-hunts. In eastern Europe, for example, nationalist leaders who refrain from antisemitism due to the terrible memories of the Holocaust instead frighten the population with tales of a global gay conspiracy. In both Poland and Hungary, the governments routinely depict gay people as foreign agents and as a threat to the survival not only of the nation, but of western civilisation itself. These regimes even manage to link LGBT people to immigration, by arguing that the gay conspiracy hopes to decrease native birth rates in order to open the door to a flood of immigrants. The Russian regime, too, claims that a worldwide homosexual conspiracy seeks to destroy the country. Official media has depicted both anti-government demonstrations in Russia and the 2013/14 Ukrainian revolution as the handiwork of the gay cabal, Timothy Snyder writes in The Road to Unfreedom. The media also present Russian LGBT people as traitors, arguing that homosexuality is alien to Russian traditions, so the mere fact that you are gay is proof that you must be a foreign agent. A poll conducted in May 2018 revealed that 63% of Russians are convinced that an organised, global gay network is indeed working to undermine Russia\u2019s traditional spiritual values and thereby weaken the country. To combat this alleged threat, in 2013 Russia passed a notorious law banning \u201cgay propaganda\u201d, which has led to the arrest and persecution of numerous people. In August 2018, a 16-year-old teenager, Maxim Neverov, was charged with the \u201ccrime\u201d of uploading several pictures of guys hugging to the Russian social media platform Vkontakte. The high-school pupil was fined 50,000 roubles (\u00a3616) \u2013 more than the average monthly salary in Russia \u2013 before winning a court appeal against the decision. Eastern Europe is hardly unique. Regimes and politicians in numerous countries, from Brazil to Uganda, spread tales about LGBT conspiracies, and promise to protect the nation from the queer menace. LGBT people are tempting targets for such witch-hunts for two main reasons. First, conservative authoritarian regimes usually bemoan the fluidity and complexity of reality, and promise a return to an imaginary golden age when boundaries were clear, identities were fixed, and people had little room for making personal choices. Back in those good old days, men were men, women were women, foreigners were enemies, and nobody had to think too much about all that complicated stuff. But LGBT people blur the boundaries, mix up identities, and force people to think and choose. No wonder autocrats hate them. Second, LGBT people don\u2019t have much power, so persecuting them is cheap. Throughout history, autocrats have often singled out a weak minority, made it look far more powerful and dangerous than it really was, and then promised to protect society against this non-existent threat. That was the case in the original witch-hunts in early modern Europe, which often targeted elderly women and lonely eccentrics. The same logic is now at work in such places as Russia \u2013 a country that suffers from many serious problems. Its economy is stagnating, corruption is endemic and public services are deteriorating. But fighting corruption means taking on the strongest men in Russia. It is far easier to forget about these headaches and instead protect innocent Russians from the corrupting tentacles of the global gay conspiracy. Just try to put a rouble value on all this. How many roubles would it cost to improve Russia\u2019s dysfunctional healthcare system? How many roubles would it cost to protect Russia from the nonexistent global gay conspiracy? \u00b6 If LGBT people are increasingly the target of political witch-hunts, we are unlikely to see a return to the pre-Stonewall era of the closet. We might see something far worse. People will not be able to escape persecution by retreating back into the closet, because new technologies are breaking it apart. The combination of information technology and biotechnology is giving birth to new surveillance tools that will soon make it possible to monitor everybody all the time. For the first time in history any regime that so desires will be able to spy on all citizens 24 hours a day, and to know not only what they are doing, but even how they are feeling. If a future homophobic regime wants to round up all the gay men in a country (as authorities in the Russian province of Chechnya have recently sought to do), it might start by trying to hack the databases of gay dating sites such as Grindr. The Egyptian police, for example, have already used Grindr data to track and arrest gay men by posing as users of the site (Grindr warned users that people may be posing on its site in order to obtain their information).

In 2016 the Chinese firm Kunlun bought Grindr, but in March 2019 the US government\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States informed Kunlun that its ownership of Grindr \u201cconstitutes a national security risk\u201d. Kunlun is now forced to sell Grindr by 2020. There was no explanation given for why Chinese ownership of a gay dating site constitutes a national security risk, but I trust that by now you can answer that question yourself. On 14 July 2017, several Russian cabinet members including prime minister Dmitry Medvedev gathered for a talk by a Stanford professor who has studied the extent to which people\u2019s personality traits can be revealed by analysing their online activity.

While the professor himself was doing so in order to alert the public to the danger such technology poses for individual privacy, the Russian officials were probably more interested in learning how to use the technology than how to protect people\u2019s rights. Even if you have never had a Grindr account, never watched gay porn online and never clicked on LGBT-related news items, in the not too distant future merely allowing your eyes to roam freely could cost you your liberty. Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism describes how corporations are developing ever more sophisticated tools to know what their customers like.

In 2013 Iranian authorities ordered cafe owners to install cameras and turn over the footage on demand. In March 2019, the Guangdong Guangya high school in China reportedly purchased 3,500 biometric bracelets to monitor students\u2019 physical activities, heart rates and the number of times they raised their hands in class. By cross-referencing data-points, future schools might be able to tell not only who fell asleep during maths class, but also who fell in love with the maths teacher.

What might happen, for example, if the people in charge of China\u2019s burgeoning social credit system decide that having a same-sex love affair is an antisocial behaviour that should detract from your social credit \u2013 and therefore from your ability to enter prestigious colleges, get a mortgage, or buy a plane ticket?

The lesson of Stonewall is as true today as it was in 1969, and is relevant to all humans, not just to those who identify as LGBT. Fifty people working together as members of an organisation can accomplish far more than 500 individuals. Technology now poses the greatest challenges in our history. To cope well with these challenges, we need to organise. I cannot tell you which organisation to join \u2013 there are many good options \u2013 but please do it soon. Do it this week. Don\u2019t sit at home and complain. It is time to act \u2022 \u2022 This article was revised on 27 June 2019 by the author, at his request, to clarify an aspect of the section on surveillance and online activity.",

      "body": "<p>Last summer I attended a closed-door gathering of political scientists in Segovia, Spain, surrounded by the medieval spires of the Castile and Le\u00f3n region. The scholars had flown in from across the world to spend a few days reviewing academic literature on the vexed subject of \u201cpopulism\u201d.</p> <p>One of the academics showed me a graph charting how the number of Google searches for \u201cpopulism\u201d had rocketed in 2016, around the time of the UK\u2019s Brexit vote and the election of US president Donald Trump, and remained high ever since. For decades a niche topic mostly studied by specialists in Latin America, the study of populism was suddenly very much in vogue.</p> <p>I was in Spain on a fact-finding mission. The Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, and her deputy, Paul Johnson, had given me the green light to run a series exploring the rise of populism. The meeting in Segovia was an opportunity to consult experts on the subject that I had been grappling with for some time.</p> <p>In my previous Guardian roles \u2013 as Washington correspondent and San Francisco bureau chief \u2013 I had reported both on Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/18/donald-trump-reality-tv-and-politics\">extraordinary ascent to the White House</a> and the similarly stunning success of Bernie Sanders, a once-fringe independent senator from Vermont who <a href=\"http://./\">transformed Democratic politics</a>.</p> <p>I had also spent months trying to understand how dominant technology platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube \u2013 and the wider \u201cattention economy\u201d that makes them hugely profitable \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">were rewiring politics</a> and creating an uneven playing field that might be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth\">tilted toward populist candidates</a>.</p> <p>Back in Europe, I recognised echoes of what I\u2019d seen in America \u2013 populists on the left and right (although more so on the right) were gaining traction in countries as varied as Italy, Turkey, Sweden, Austria, Spain and Poland. Five of the world\u2019s largest democracies were run by them, including India, Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines.</p> <p>I learned two things from my trip to Spain. The first was that scholars who specialise in populism are exasperated at how frequently the term is overused or misapplied. The problem is especially acute in the UK, where commentators often use the term to refer to far-right, nativist politics, or use it as a shorthand for charismatic demagoguery.</p> <p>My second discovery was that while lots of useful research has been conducted on populism, it was limited \u2013 and there was surprisingly little in the way of empirical research tracking populist discourse, campaigns or parties.</p> <p>In the days that followed I worked with Mark Rice-Oxley, the Guardian\u2019s special projects editor, to sketch out the kinds of questions a series on populism would ask. What is populism, exactly, and where in the world is it taking root? Which parties and political leaders deserve the populist label, and what happens when they get into power? Perhaps most difficult of all: is rightwing populism, in particular, really on the rise, and, if so, why might that be?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"15b197724cb0ca6fa2318e83ef7dd40dd863e32a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15b197724cb0ca6fa2318e83ef7dd40dd863e32a/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The New Populism series grpahic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The New Populism series established that the number of populist world leaders has more than doubled since the early 2000s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: The Guardian Design Team</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>None of these questions have a simple or uncontested answer. This was always going to be an exploratory project helping us (and you, our readers) better understand populism, even if that meant there were no definitive conclusions. But we thought it was important to stay faithful to a broadly accepted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/03/what-is-populism-trump-farage-orban-bolsonaro\">definition of the p-word</a>.

      "bodyText": "Last summer I attended a closed-door gathering of political scientists in Segovia, Spain, surrounded by the medieval spires of the Castile and Le\u00f3n region. The scholars had flown in from across the world to spend a few days reviewing academic literature on the vexed subject of \u201cpopulism\u201d. One of the academics showed me a graph charting how the number of Google searches for \u201cpopulism\u201d had rocketed in 2016, around the time of the UK\u2019s Brexit vote and the election of US president Donald Trump, and remained high ever since. For decades a niche topic mostly studied by specialists in Latin America, the study of populism was suddenly very much in vogue. I was in Spain on a fact-finding mission. The Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, and her deputy, Paul Johnson, had given me the green light to run a series exploring the rise of populism. The meeting in Segovia was an opportunity to consult experts on the subject that I had been grappling with for some time. In my previous Guardian roles \u2013 as Washington correspondent and San Francisco bureau chief \u2013 I had reported both on Trump\u2019s extraordinary ascent to the White House and the similarly stunning success of Bernie Sanders, a once-fringe independent senator from Vermont who transformed Democratic politics. I had also spent months trying to understand how dominant technology platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube \u2013 and the wider \u201cattention economy\u201d that makes them hugely profitable \u2013 were rewiring politics and creating an uneven playing field that might be tilted toward populist candidates. Back in Europe, I recognised echoes of what I\u2019d seen in America \u2013 populists on the left and right (although more so on the right) were gaining traction in countries as varied as Italy, Turkey, Sweden, Austria, Spain and Poland. Five of the world\u2019s largest democracies were run by them, including India, Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines. I learned two things from my trip to Spain. The first was that scholars who specialise in populism are exasperated at how frequently the term is overused or misapplied. The problem is especially acute in the UK, where commentators often use the term to refer to far-right, nativist politics, or use it as a shorthand for charismatic demagoguery. My second discovery was that while lots of useful research has been conducted on populism, it was limited \u2013 and there was surprisingly little in the way of empirical research tracking populist discourse, campaigns or parties. In the days that followed I worked with Mark Rice-Oxley, the Guardian\u2019s special projects editor, to sketch out the kinds of questions a series on populism would ask. What is populism, exactly, and where in the world is it taking root? Which parties and political leaders deserve the populist label, and what happens when they get into power? Perhaps most difficult of all: is rightwing populism, in particular, really on the rise, and, if so, why might that be? None of these questions have a simple or uncontested answer. This was always going to be an exploratory project helping us (and you, our readers) better understand populism, even if that meant there were no definitive conclusions. But we thought it was important to stay faithful to a broadly accepted definition of the p-word. Simply put, populism is a language that frames politics as a battle between the will of ordinary people and corrupt or self-serving elites, and can exist on the left or right. A few weeks later, we launched The New Populism, a series of essays and reported dispatches from locations as varied as Rio de Janeiro, Istanbul, New Hampshire, Venice, Johannesburg, Delhi, Zurich, Glasgow and Hartlepool. The most novel parts of the series were the research projects we conducted in partnership with political scientists, including several I met in Segovia. We created a partnership with Team Populism, a global network of political scientists, to analyse the hundreds of speeches by presidents, prime ministers and chancellors of 40 countries across the world. A grant from theguardian.org, a US-based non-profit group, enabled us to hire 46 researchers who were trained to identify populist discourse in speeches. The result was the Global Populism Database, the most up-to-date, comprehensive and reliable repository of populist discourse in the world \u2013 and the basis upon we which we were able to report that the number of populist leaders has more than doubled since the early 2000s. Team Populism also helped us build a data visualisation of how reliant Trump is on a teleprompter for his particular brand of rather inconsistent populism \u2013 and a hugely popular online quiz that allowed 1.5 million Guardian readers to answer several questions to discover how populist their own views were. In another collaboration, we coordinated a team of 35 political scientists to peer-review a list of past and current populist parties in Europe. Our academic partners later helped us design and analyse a major global survey in partnership with YouGov, polling respondents in 23 countries to test populist sentiment across the world. The New Populism series finished last month, culminating in European parliamentary elections in which populist parties secured almost one in three votes. Nowhere was the success of populists more stark than in the UK, where Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party triumphed in last month\u2019s election by capitalising on discontent over the failure to enact the result of the EU referendum. Brexit is only part of the story of a decline in trust in British elites that has long roots, as the sociologist Will Davies explained in one of a host of populism-themed essays we published in the Long Reads section. It used to be said that our first-past-the-post electoral system was a bulwark against insurgent populist parties. That may prove to be true. But the language of populism is everywhere in British politics these days. You hear it in the frequent vilification of political elites, the romanticisation of ordinary or \u201creal\u201d people, the attacks on the media and the idea that politics is no longer just a battle of ideas but a winner-takes-all conflict between good and evil. It can pop up in sometimes unexpected places \u2013 from Theresa May\u2019s speeches, to the lexicon of those arch-Remainers who insist a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d is the only legitimate response to a Brexit stitch-up contrived by powerful cabal of crooks and liars.

      "body": "<p>Charlie Redmond and Maurice Hearne are Cork drug dealers, former big-time suppliers and users. Now into their 50s, their black money is squandered; they have done and could still do terrible things. \u201cThe years are rolling out like tide now. There is old weather on their faces, on the hard lines of their jaws, on their chaotic mouths. But they retain \u2013 just about \u2013 a rakish air.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s October 2018, and Charlie and Maurice find themselves keeping vigil at the Algeciras ferry terminal in southern Spain, where the night boats to Tangier depart and dock. This place has the clear contours of purgatory, perhaps one that Charlie and Maurice deserve. It is a Hades crossing point, a portal to dread.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Kevin Barry is a clairvoyant narrator of the male psyche and a consistent lyrical visionary</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet what these two horrors of men \u2013 and they are, by their own confession, flawed fellows \u2013 are carrying is a cache of missing person posters; desperately, pathetically, they are trying to find Dilly, Charlie\u2019s 23-year-old daughter. Dilly fled Ireland after the death of her mother to join new age travellers, moving on queasy and confounding ley lines between Spain and north Africa in ways Charlie and Maurice struggle to fathom. They have not seen Dilly for three years, but they have street intelligence of her whereabouts, often gleaned by intimidation. They are still tenacious, menacing, solipsistic guys, but their chances are slim and their wait at the terminal is the temporal anchor of a book that deftly pivots elsewhere.</p> <p>As the two men exchange a supple flow of defeated banter and craic, we see that they are cut straight from the toxic cloth of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/beckett\" title=\"\">Beckett</a>; an iPhone Hamm and Clov, they play out their own endgame, one urging the other to utterance in all the glory and vinegar of Irish disillusion:</p> <p><em>Personally speaking, Maurice? My arse isn\u2019t right since the octopus we ate in Malaga.</em><br><em>Is it saying hello to you, Charlie?</em><br><em>It is, yeah. And of course the octopus wasn\u2019t the worst of Malaga.</em><br><em>\u2026. They look into the distance. They send up their sighs.

      "bodyText": "Charlie Redmond and Maurice Hearne are Cork drug dealers, former big-time suppliers and users. Now into their 50s, their black money is squandered; they have done and could still do terrible things. \u201cThe years are rolling out like tide now. There is old weather on their faces, on the hard lines of their jaws, on their chaotic mouths. But they retain \u2013 just about \u2013 a rakish air.\u201d It\u2019s October 2018, and Charlie and Maurice find themselves keeping vigil at the Algeciras ferry terminal in southern Spain, where the night boats to Tangier depart and dock. This place has the clear contours of purgatory, perhaps one that Charlie and Maurice deserve. It is a Hades crossing point, a portal to dread. Yet what these two horrors of men \u2013 and they are, by their own confession, flawed fellows \u2013 are carrying is a cache of missing person posters; desperately, pathetically, they are trying to find Dilly, Charlie\u2019s 23-year-old daughter. Dilly fled Ireland after the death of her mother to join new age travellers, moving on queasy and confounding ley lines between Spain and north Africa in ways Charlie and Maurice struggle to fathom. They have not seen Dilly for three years, but they have street intelligence of her whereabouts, often gleaned by intimidation. They are still tenacious, menacing, solipsistic guys, but their chances are slim and their wait at the terminal is the temporal anchor of a book that deftly pivots elsewhere. As the two men exchange a supple flow of defeated banter and craic, we see that they are cut straight from the toxic cloth of Beckett; an iPhone Hamm and Clov, they play out their own endgame, one urging the other to utterance in all the glory and vinegar of Irish disillusion: Personally speaking, Maurice? My arse isn\u2019t right since the octopus we ate in Malaga. Is it saying hello to you, Charlie? It is, yeah. And of course the octopus wasn\u2019t the worst of Malaga. \u2026. They look into the distance. They send up their sighs. Their talk is a shield against feeling. To avoid plot spoiling, let me say that what we assume is a two-hander crime novel swells with plenitude into an emotionally crushing panorama of two friends gone wildly astray, punished by regret but with their grim solidarity intact \u2013 so far.

      "body": "<p>Car hire firms are one of Guardian Money\u2019s most complained-about sectors. Dodgy operators praying on unsuspecting holidaymakers by making them take out their extra \u201cmust-have\u201d insurance or hitting them with fake damage bills at the end of the rental are all too commonplace. So what do consumers need to look out for this summer to ensure they don\u2019t get ripped off on the road?</p> <h2><strong>1. Don\u2019t book the car direct</strong></h2> <p>Don\u2019t automatically log on to the Hertz or Europcar website to make your booking, the third party websites almost always offer a cheaper price. This week Hertz wanted \u00a3350 for a week\u2019s hire in July out of Zurich airport. Holidayautos.com offered a smaller car for \u00a3274, or a bigger car than Hertz for \u00a3289. Money recommends <a href=\"https://www.holidayautos.com/#/searchcars\" title=\"\">Holidayautos</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rentalcars.com/en/country/gb/\" title=\"\">Rentalcars</a>, Which? favourite <a href=\"https://www.zestcarrental.com/\" title=\"\">Zest</a>, and <a href=\"https://car-hire.ryanair.com/#/searchcars\" title=\"\">Ryanair\u2019s</a> car hire. If two of you will be driving, factor that into the price comparison as most firms charge more for additional drivers.</p> <p>We would avoid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/may/06/goldcar-named-worst-car-hire-company-in-which-survey\" title=\"\">hires through Goldcar</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/09/green-motion-car-hire-bills\" title=\"\">Green Motion</a>. They are cheap, but we get too many complaints about both. If a car is much cheaper than rivals, avoid it, as they will try to make up the money elsewhere.</p> <h2><strong>2. Don\u2019t mess up the options</strong></h2> <p>Hire a car at Malaga airport and you will face a bewildering range of prices and options. Unless you really are only going to do 100km over the whole week, go for a hire than offers \u201cunlimited\u201d mileage. Always opt for full-to-full fuel deal \u2013 it\u2019s much easier, and you won\u2019t get stiffed for an unexpected fuel-refill charge at the end, assuming you return it filled up.</p> <p>Do you have the choice of collecting from the terminal or off-airport? Opting for the latter is usually cheaper, but you could find yourself being driven miles into the desert. If the prices are similar, you are tight for time, or you just want an easier life, stick to a terminal branch.</p> <p>Longer hirers may decide to go off-airport if the saving is considerable. But check the reviews \u2013 previous passengers will expose very long transfers. Avoid the cheapest two-door car, instead go for four doors. It will only add a few pounds, but you\u2019ll get a better value car.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f47bb789a66840081e7f091608508623b9bd9e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f47bb789a66840081e7f091608508623b9bd9e4/0_28_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young Couple Driving Open Top Car\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Renting a car on holiday doesn\u2019t have to be a stressful experience.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MBI/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>3. Don\u2019t buy the \u2018</strong><strong>extra</strong><strong>\u2019 insurance anywhere else</strong></h2> <p>Over the years, Money has recommended readers pre-buy excess insurance, with a stand alone provider. <a href=\"https://www.insurance4carhire.com/\" title=\"\">Insurance4carhire.com</a> was a long-time favourite, but it has put up its prices in recent months and its annual European cover now costs \u00a345, or \u00a330 for seven days\u2019 short-term cover.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reducemyexcess.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Reducemyexcess.co.uk</a> is a cheaper alternative that is equally well regarded. Buy annual European cover for \u00a340.85 for the year, or \u00a319.37 for a week\u2019s short-term cover. You have to buy it before the hire commences. Daily cover is offered.</p> <p>Buying cover this way is always cheaper than buying it from the car hire firm, plus you get better cover (for example the tyres and windows will be included).</p> <p>If you damage or mis-fuel the car, or it is stolen, you pay the car firm the agreed excess \u2013 typically \u00a31,200, and then claim it back from this policy when you get home.</p> <h2><strong>4. Don\u2019t fall for the sales patter</strong></h2> <p>Arrive in the car hire office and the excess insurance \u2013 or \u201csuper collision damage waiver\u201d in car hire jargon \u2013 hard sell will immediately begin. Just don\u2019t fall for it and say no to everything. You don\u2019t even need to tell the hire firm you have already bought cover, just say you want the car on the terms of the original policy \u2013 and will pay for any damage you cause.</p> <p>They will tell you that towing charges are extra and theft is not covered. Ignore it all.

      "bodyText": "Car hire firms are one of Guardian Money\u2019s most complained-about sectors. Dodgy operators praying on unsuspecting holidaymakers by making them take out their extra \u201cmust-have\u201d insurance or hitting them with fake damage bills at the end of the rental are all too commonplace. So what do consumers need to look out for this summer to ensure they don\u2019t get ripped off on the road? 1. Don\u2019t book the car direct Don\u2019t automatically log on to the Hertz or Europcar website to make your booking, the third party websites almost always offer a cheaper price. This week Hertz wanted \u00a3350 for a week\u2019s hire in July out of Zurich airport. Holidayautos.com offered a smaller car for \u00a3274, or a bigger car than Hertz for \u00a3289. Money recommends Holidayautos, Rentalcars, Which? favourite Zest, and Ryanair\u2019s car hire. If two of you will be driving, factor that into the price comparison as most firms charge more for additional drivers. We would avoid hires through Goldcar, and Green Motion. They are cheap, but we get too many complaints about both. If a car is much cheaper than rivals, avoid it, as they will try to make up the money elsewhere. 2. Don\u2019t mess up the options Hire a car at Malaga airport and you will face a bewildering range of prices and options. Unless you really are only going to do 100km over the whole week, go for a hire than offers \u201cunlimited\u201d mileage. Always opt for full-to-full fuel deal \u2013 it\u2019s much easier, and you won\u2019t get stiffed for an unexpected fuel-refill charge at the end, assuming you return it filled up. Do you have the choice of collecting from the terminal or off-airport? Opting for the latter is usually cheaper, but you could find yourself being driven miles into the desert. If the prices are similar, you are tight for time, or you just want an easier life, stick to a terminal branch. Longer hirers may decide to go off-airport if the saving is considerable. But check the reviews \u2013 previous passengers will expose very long transfers. Avoid the cheapest two-door car, instead go for four doors. It will only add a few pounds, but you\u2019ll get a better value car. 3. Don\u2019t buy the \u2018extra\u2019 insurance anywhere else Over the years, Money has recommended readers pre-buy excess insurance, with a stand alone provider. Insurance4carhire.com was a long-time favourite, but it has put up its prices in recent months and its annual European cover now costs \u00a345, or \u00a330 for seven days\u2019 short-term cover. Reducemyexcess.co.uk is a cheaper alternative that is equally well regarded. Buy annual European cover for \u00a340.85 for the year, or \u00a319.37 for a week\u2019s short-term cover. You have to buy it before the hire commences. Daily cover is offered. Buying cover this way is always cheaper than buying it from the car hire firm, plus you get better cover (for example the tyres and windows will be included). If you damage or mis-fuel the car, or it is stolen, you pay the car firm the agreed excess \u2013 typically \u00a31,200, and then claim it back from this policy when you get home. 4. Don\u2019t fall for the sales patter Arrive in the car hire office and the excess insurance \u2013 or \u201csuper collision damage waiver\u201d in car hire jargon \u2013 hard sell will immediately begin. Just don\u2019t fall for it and say no to everything. You don\u2019t even need to tell the hire firm you have already bought cover, just say you want the car on the terms of the original policy \u2013 and will pay for any damage you cause. They will tell you that towing charges are extra and theft is not covered. Ignore it all. If you are offered a free upgrade to a bigger car, get it in writing that it is free, or just refuse. The firm will authorise the car hire excess (\u00a31,200) on your credit card so you must have sufficient credit to do this \u2013 most cards will allow you raise your limit for a week or two, if needed. It has got to be a credit \u2013 not a debit or prepaid \u2013 card. 5. Don\u2019t just drive off \u2013 check the car The biggest single mistake most people make when hiring a car is to just drive off. Don\u2019t believe the hire staff when they claim there is no damage, because there almost always is. Examine every panel, remembering to look under the bumpers.

      "body": "<p>I got to a point on my yoga journey where I realised something: I wasn\u2019t getting any better. In the first few weeks, I made a lot of progress, such as making it through the class without feeling faint. In the subsequent months, I made minor gains in the areas of understanding basic instructions, remembering left from right and holding a plank. But there were moves where my insufficiency remained stark: the hard stuff, the shapes people post on Instagram.</p> <p>The crow, where you crouch down and tip forwards, balancing on your hands and getting your feet off the ground; the side crow, which is the same thing, sideways; the toe stand balance, where you cross one foot over the other knee, while standing, then somehow manoeuvre yourself to a hovering position, balanced on one set of toes. I thought it would come gradually over time, and it didn\u2019t (believe it or not, I\u2019ve had some help in the image above). I tried practising at home, but outside the yogic environs, I felt less confident than ever.</p> <p>Finally, I went to an expert: <a href=\"https://www.goodvibesfitness.co.uk/meet-the-team/nahid-de-belgeonne\" title=\"\">Nahid de Belgeonne</a>, founder of the Good Vibes studio and a specialist in <a href=\"http://www.feldenkrais.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Feldenkrais</a>, a \u201cneuromuscular\u201d method.

      "bodyText": "I got to a point on my yoga journey where I realised something: I wasn\u2019t getting any better. In the first few weeks, I made a lot of progress, such as making it through the class without feeling faint. In the subsequent months, I made minor gains in the areas of understanding basic instructions, remembering left from right and holding a plank. But there were moves where my insufficiency remained stark: the hard stuff, the shapes people post on Instagram. The crow, where you crouch down and tip forwards, balancing on your hands and getting your feet off the ground; the side crow, which is the same thing, sideways; the toe stand balance, where you cross one foot over the other knee, while standing, then somehow manoeuvre yourself to a hovering position, balanced on one set of toes. I thought it would come gradually over time, and it didn\u2019t (believe it or not, I\u2019ve had some help in the image above). I tried practising at home, but outside the yogic environs, I felt less confident than ever. Finally, I went to an expert: Nahid de Belgeonne, founder of the Good Vibes studio and a specialist in Feldenkrais, a \u201cneuromuscular\u201d method. It\u2019s about making your movements more connected and coherent, understanding your body as an interrelated whole. \u201cHow do you do that, though?\u201d I begin, introducing an unwanted 21st-century results-driven energy to the room. \u201cWell, you really have to concentrate,\u201d De Belgeonne says gently.

In the UK, when Michael Gove hinted at a ban on disposable nappies as part of the government\u2019s plastic waste crackdown, it caused such an outcry that he was forced to issue a denial such a move was planned. Vanuatu\u2019s department of environmental protection said there was a need for a study on the effect on working parents, but that such research had not been carried out to date. The country announced the ban after research by Commonwealth Litter Programme (CLiP) showed organic waste and disposable nappies represented three-quarters of the total weight of waste produced. It is consulting with businesses to come up with local alternatives and with NGOs, civil society and other groups. The results of the consultation, which will take place from the 1 December 2019 to 31 December 2020, will be keenly watched by other countries.

A month after the ban was introduced, a waste survey showed 12% of household rubbish was plastic, with only 2% plastic bags and other banned items. This compares with 15-18% plastic in 2010 and 2014. In March, Vanuatu banned other single-use plastic items including plates, cups, stirrers, food containers, egg cartons and flowers. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 July 2019. An earlier version described Vanuatu as \u201ca tiny speck\u201d in the Pacific Ocean. The text has been amended to clarify that the country is an archipelago of 300,000 people, and a description of it as being \u201clow-lying\u201d has been removed.",

How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe \u2013 delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes that simply wouldn\u2019t have happened in Blighty? Anyone who has known me for more than 15 minutes will have heard my story of the older gentleman in a Copenhagen cemetery who collapsed into uncontrollable fits of laughter when I asked him if he could direct me to the grave of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (pretentious, moi?). \u201cYou\u2019ve come looking for Kierkegaard,\u201d he managed to splutter, \u201cat the wrong kierkegaard.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7fe5d1f201d7b0e102ead1e81b17b94f5b63c2e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fe5d1f201d7b0e102ead1e81b17b94f5b63c2e8/12_16_808_979/413.jpg\" alt=\"Old Interrail pass from 1983.

Still, it means I\u2019ve never forgotten the Danish word for \u201cchurchyard\u201d, a linguistic nugget I just know will come in handy one day.</p> <p>Or there\u2019s the New Year\u2019s Eve I spent sitting with my hosts around a less-than-perfectly-tuned television in a flat in Athens watching the Serbian version of Hootenanny. For four hours. With no sub-titles. If you\u2019ve never had the pleasure, I can tell you that it involves a lot of children\u2019s choirs and glitter.</p> <p>Perhaps the most surprising thing about these two Interrail-enabled events is that they happened nearly 30 years apart. The first when I was a young tyro cutting my peripatetic teeth; the latter just 18 months ago, when a confirmed flounderer in the murky depths of middle age. And while the earlier trip was inspired by the affordability of the ticket, the latter came about because of a decision to do my penn\u2019orth for the environment by not flying.</p> <p>Apparently, I\u2019m not alone in this. Research carried out by <a href=\"https://www.eurail.com/\" title=\"\">Eurail</a> \u2013 the company that administers Interrail \u2013 reveals that, for their customers, sustainability is \u201cmore and more influential in their decision process, especially in the north European countries\u201d. And if, like me, you\u2019re fortunate enough to have the time to go leisurely to your destination (I\u2019m an author: the only thing we\u2019re famously rich in is time), you\u2019ll find that far from being some sort of hair-shirt sacrifice, a trip across Europe by rail is one of the wonders of modern life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e35d6a126a415d0d7c5081340e97a80fe71e0c6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e35d6a126a415d0d7c5081340e97a80fe71e0c6e/0_0_1340_924/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Map of the writer\u2019s second Interrail route.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"690\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The writer\u2019s second Interrail route</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: &quot;PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like other European institutions, such as the EU and Eurovision, the Interrail pass was born in part out of idealism. The International Union of Railways (UIC) launched it in 1972 to make it affordable for young Europeans to discover their own continent. Or at least the western half of it. Of the then 21 countries involved, only two \u2013 Hungary and East Germany \u2013 were behind the Iron Curtain; though non-aligned Yugoslavia also took part, and even Morocco was part of the Interrail family for a couple of decades. The ticket was only meant to be on sale for a year, to celebrate the UIC\u2019s 50th anniversary. However, the scheme proved such a success, with more than 85,000 European youngsters taking up the offer, that it\u2019s been going ever since.

      "bodyText": "Ah, the Interrail experience. How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe \u2013 delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes that simply wouldn\u2019t have happened in Blighty? Anyone who has known me for more than 15 minutes will have heard my story of the older gentleman in a Copenhagen cemetery who collapsed into uncontrollable fits of laughter when I asked him if he could direct me to the grave of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (pretentious, moi?). \u201cYou\u2019ve come looking for Kierkegaard,\u201d he managed to splutter, \u201cat the wrong kierkegaard.\u201d Those Danes, eh? Still, it means I\u2019ve never forgotten the Danish word for \u201cchurchyard\u201d, a linguistic nugget I just know will come in handy one day. Or there\u2019s the New Year\u2019s Eve I spent sitting with my hosts around a less-than-perfectly-tuned television in a flat in Athens watching the Serbian version of Hootenanny. For four hours. With no sub-titles. If you\u2019ve never had the pleasure, I can tell you that it involves a lot of children\u2019s choirs and glitter. Perhaps the most surprising thing about these two Interrail-enabled events is that they happened nearly 30 years apart. The first when I was a young tyro cutting my peripatetic teeth; the latter just 18 months ago, when a confirmed flounderer in the murky depths of middle age. And while the earlier trip was inspired by the affordability of the ticket, the latter came about because of a decision to do my penn\u2019orth for the environment by not flying. Apparently, I\u2019m not alone in this. Research carried out by Eurail \u2013 the company that administers Interrail \u2013 reveals that, for their customers, sustainability is \u201cmore and more influential in their decision process, especially in the north European countries\u201d. And if, like me, you\u2019re fortunate enough to have the time to go leisurely to your destination (I\u2019m an author: the only thing we\u2019re famously rich in is time), you\u2019ll find that far from being some sort of hair-shirt sacrifice, a trip across Europe by rail is one of the wonders of modern life. Like other European institutions, such as the EU and Eurovision, the Interrail pass was born in part out of idealism. The International Union of Railways (UIC) launched it in 1972 to make it affordable for young Europeans to discover their own continent. Or at least the western half of it. Of the then 21 countries involved, only two \u2013 Hungary and East Germany \u2013 were behind the Iron Curtain; though non-aligned Yugoslavia also took part, and even Morocco was part of the Interrail family for a couple of decades. The ticket was only meant to be on sale for a year, to celebrate the UIC\u2019s 50th anniversary. However, the scheme proved such a success, with more than 85,000 European youngsters taking up the offer, that it\u2019s been going ever since. And they truly were youngsters in those days: at 22 you were too long in the tooth to qualify. That all changed in the 1990s when a range of all-age Interrail passes was introduced and the number of participating countries increased to 31. They\u2019re a little more expensive than their equivalent youth versions , but you still don\u2019t have to travel far before they start saving you money \u2013 and children go free up to the age of 11. When my most recent ticket came through the post (a pleasing nod to a less frantic pre-internet world) I\u2019d be lying to say it didn\u2019t give me a little frisson of anticipatory delight. How often do you get the freedom to flit about where you like in 31 countries? I began my more recent Interrail jaunt in Montreux, Switzerland, with a ticket that granted me seven days of rail travel within a month (journeys can be started and finished anywhere in Europe).

      "body": "<p>A few years ago I quit my teaching career to become an artist. I felt under a lot of pressure as a teacher. I joined the profession after my degree in textile design, partly because my dad was a teacher and I felt it was the most obvious career for me, but I also felt it would give me security. At the beginning I loved being a teacher: there was an element of creativity and flexibility to do what you wanted in the classroom as long as the pupils were learning. But towards the end it was more about ticking boxes, paperwork and admin. The creativity was taken out of the job.</p> <p>The tipping point came when I experienced two miscarriages. It all just felt so overwhelming \u2013 I remember trying to get the class through a revision session while I was miscarrying. I knew I needed a break, and I wanted to reconnect with my passion and love for the arts. I spent a lot of time gardening and creating watercolour paintings inspired by nature. I started thinking about taking it more seriously as a career when my daughter, Isla, was born two years ago.</p> <p>I\u2019m only at the start of my career as an artist and designer \u2013 most of my time is spent looking after my little girl. I rely on her nap times to work, which limits me to about five to 10 hours a week. I\u2019ve set up my own brand, Safiyyah Studios, and have released two collections of digitally printed luxury scarves. The latest is inspired by Japanese paintings of blossoms and surreal landscapes. I\u2019ve started taking wholesale orders from boutiques, and I\u2019m excited about attending my first trade show in August.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/15/i-was-kicked-out-of-school-but-i-now-im-a-motivational-speaker\">\u2018I was kicked out of school, but now I\u2019m a motivational speaker\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I also work as a textile designer on a freelance basis, creating designs for a baby clothing company. My total annual income comes to about \u00a33,000 a year. I\u2019ll spend about \u00a3300 to \u00a3400 a year reinvesting in the business and buying supplies such as watercolour paints, professional watercolour paper and high-quality brushes.</p> <p>My husband is a GP and partner at his practice. He deals with everything in terms of our mortgage [for our home in Birmingham], which comes to \u00a31,200 a month, and bills. We spend about \u00a3250 a month on food, which he pays for. Our daughter has a handful of allergies such as gluten, dairy, eggs and nuts, which makes it difficult and expensive to buy for her.</p> <p>When I was teaching and on a \u00a327,000 salary, I would contribute towards food shopping, bills and a little of the mortgage, but it\u2019s impossible for me to do that now. I think it\u2019s best for my own well-being that I stay at home and focus on building my career as an artist and designer within a more flexible timeframe. My daughter still needs my attention, and returning to work wouldn\u2019t be practical as we\u2019re hoping to have another child, and some workplaces aren\u2019t accommodating when they know that. While I\u2019m working at home, I want to make the most of the time I have with my daughter and develop my brand before working full-time when the time is right.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/01/i-started-a-chocolate-brand-as-my-son-had-dairy-intolerance\">\u2018I started a chocolate brand as my son had dairy intolerance\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We\u2019ve scaled back on our holidays since having our daughter. We went a bit crazy before Isla came along. We used to go on big, all-inclusive holidays, visiting destinations such as the Maldives, Bali and Dubai.</p> <p>Due to a lower income, I\u2019ve had to rein in my spending a little. I used to spend about \u00a3200 a month on makeup and clothes \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t think twice if I needed to buy myself anything. Now I tend to think long-term when I buy anything, and think of ways I can upcycle clothes. When I have more money, I\u2019d like to pay for dermal fillers for under my eyes. The sleepless nights have taken over, and I want a little help with that.</p> <p>In the future I\u2019d like to build a studio, converting the garage into a place of work. And when I get to a good enough position with my business, I\u2019d like to buy a property to rent out. But for the moment we\u2019re just focusing on the present.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A few years ago I quit my teaching career to become an artist. I felt under a lot of pressure as a teacher. I joined the profession after my degree in textile design, partly because my dad was a teacher and I felt it was the most obvious career for me, but I also felt it would give me security. At the beginning I loved being a teacher: there was an element of creativity and flexibility to do what you wanted in the classroom as long as the pupils were learning. But towards the end it was more about ticking boxes, paperwork and admin. The creativity was taken out of the job. The tipping point came when I experienced two miscarriages. It all just felt so overwhelming \u2013 I remember trying to get the class through a revision session while I was miscarrying. I knew I needed a break, and I wanted to reconnect with my passion and love for the arts. I spent a lot of time gardening and creating watercolour paintings inspired by nature. I started thinking about taking it more seriously as a career when my daughter, Isla, was born two years ago. I\u2019m only at the start of my career as an artist and designer \u2013 most of my time is spent looking after my little girl. I rely on her nap times to work, which limits me to about five to 10 hours a week. I\u2019ve set up my own brand, Safiyyah Studios, and have released two collections of digitally printed luxury scarves. The latest is inspired by Japanese paintings of blossoms and surreal landscapes. I\u2019ve started taking wholesale orders from boutiques, and I\u2019m excited about attending my first trade show in August. I also work as a textile designer on a freelance basis, creating designs for a baby clothing company. My total annual income comes to about \u00a33,000 a year. I\u2019ll spend about \u00a3300 to \u00a3400 a year reinvesting in the business and buying supplies such as watercolour paints, professional watercolour paper and high-quality brushes. My husband is a GP and partner at his practice. He deals with everything in terms of our mortgage [for our home in Birmingham], which comes to \u00a31,200 a month, and bills. We spend about \u00a3250 a month on food, which he pays for. Our daughter has a handful of allergies such as gluten, dairy, eggs and nuts, which makes it difficult and expensive to buy for her. When I was teaching and on a \u00a327,000 salary, I would contribute towards food shopping, bills and a little of the mortgage, but it\u2019s impossible for me to do that now. I think it\u2019s best for my own well-being that I stay at home and focus on building my career as an artist and designer within a more flexible timeframe. My daughter still needs my attention, and returning to work wouldn\u2019t be practical as we\u2019re hoping to have another child, and some workplaces aren\u2019t accommodating when they know that. While I\u2019m working at home, I want to make the most of the time I have with my daughter and develop my brand before working full-time when the time is right. We\u2019ve scaled back on our holidays since having our daughter. We went a bit crazy before Isla came along. We used to go on big, all-inclusive holidays, visiting destinations such as the Maldives, Bali and Dubai. Due to a lower income, I\u2019ve had to rein in my spending a little. I used to spend about \u00a3200 a month on makeup and clothes \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t think twice if I needed to buy myself anything. Now I tend to think long-term when I buy anything, and think of ways I can upcycle clothes. When I have more money, I\u2019d like to pay for dermal fillers for under my eyes. The sleepless nights have taken over, and I want a little help with that. In the future I\u2019d like to build a studio, converting the garage into a place of work. And when I get to a good enough position with my business, I\u2019d like to buy a property to rent out. But for the moment we\u2019re just focusing on the present.",

      "bodyText": "Ascending El Capitan, a rock formation rising 3,000ft above Yosemite national park, is a daunting task for the most experienced climbers. Selah Schneiter, 10, scaled it before she entered fifth grade. Selah became the youngest person known to have achieved the feat on 12 June. Selah was no stranger to El Capitan: the site, her father said, was \u201cin her blood\u201d. Mike, a climbing guide, brought his daughter there when she was two months old \u2013 though she wasn\u2019t quite ready to make the ascent. El Capitan was the first place Mike and Selah\u2019s mother, Joy, climbed together. In the process, they fell in love \u2013 and years later, it was there that they decided to have kids, fantasizing about climbing the formation with their own children someday. \u201cI had no idea it would happen so fast,\u201d Mike said. Selah\u2019s achievement led to a flurry of media attention and TV appearances in New York. \u201cI live in a town with a population of about 9,000\u201d in Colorado, she told the Guardian. \u201cIt can be difficult to switch to the big city.\u201d The climb itself, however, was less intimidating. \u201cThe only thing I ever got scared of was what would happen if I didn\u2019t do this,\u201d Selah said. Her determination outweighed any fear. \u201cI took a deep breath and I thought: what does this mean to me? Am I gonna bail or am I not gonna bail? I\u2019m gonna make that decision.\u201d Selah, Mike, and his friend Mark Regier didn\u2019t rush their way to the top, Mike said. They spent five days on the ascent, taking long lunch breaks and starting late, by Mike\u2019s standards \u2013 a relaxed 6.30 or 7am. Selah made her way up the route \u2013 a particularly challenging pathway known as the Nose \u2013 primarily by jumaring, or climbing with assistance from a rope and other gear. (Only a handful of people have ever made the ascent via free climbing, in which the climber uses hands and feet while attached to a rope purely for protection.) At night, father and daughter slept on a portaledge, a tent-like device for multi-day climbs. Images from the ascent are head-spinning, but as a climbing guide, \u201cyou definitely have a mindset of being really in tune with the dangers and the risks that you\u2019re faced with,\u201d Mike said. \u201cOddly, we never felt really in danger at any point. We felt really comfortable up there.\u201d When they finally reached the top, they received a surprising text from Joy, Mike said. A friend at Outside Magazine, which reported the climb, had investigated the matter and identified Selah as the youngest to have scaled El Capitan. The family had been vaguely aware that she was among the youngest climbers, but beforehand, Mike had cautioned against focusing on setting any records. \u201cDon\u2019t even look it up,\u201d he told his companions. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that to be our motivation.\u201d With her success behind her, Selah has wise words for anyone facing a difficult climb of their own \u2013 real or metaphorical. \u201cIf you have a big goal, it\u2019s really hard to attack it all at once. You have to do it piece by piece. Take that big goal and make it into a bunch of small goals.\u201d And though the heights may be dizzying, remember: \u201cYou look up a lot more than you look down.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Interrail pass was introduced in 1972 to provide an opportunity for passengers up to 21 years of age to discover more of Europe; it covered 21 countries, including now long-gone Yugoslavia and East and West Germany. In the 47 years since it has become a traveller\u2019s \u201crite of passage\u201d, particularly among students. The element of spontaneity and adventure is part of what makes Interrailing so appealing \u2013 being able to jump on a night train and wake up on the other side of Europe, without a care in the world. </p> <p>And these days, Interrail passes are available for all ages.</p> <h2><strong>Types of passes available</strong></h2> <p>Currently, there are three major categories available: the Global Pass, valid for travel within 31 European countries*; One-country Pass, for travel within a single country; and Premium Pass, for travel within Spain or Italy. With a Premium Pass, seat reservations for trains are free within these countries.</p> <p>*As of June 2019 these countries are: Austria (including Liechtenstein), Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France (including Monaco), Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Ireland (the Republic and the North), Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, North Macedonia, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.</p> <p>Global passes can\u2019t be used to travel within your own country, except for one outbound and one inbound journey.</p> <h2><strong>Pricing</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b725340b76d702c9a5be3ab32bba53151febec02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b725340b76d702c9a5be3ab32bba53151febec02/81_94_967_580/500.jpg\" alt=\"Interrail Pass ticket in front of train station-medium\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Interrailing may seem pricy compared with flying, but whereas flight prices soar in summer, the cost of a rail pass stays the same year-round \u2013 making it good value for students and other summer travellers.</p> <p>EU citizens aged 12-27 enjoy substantial discounts on all products. Currently, the cheapest Global Pass available (three days of travel within one month, second class) costs \u00a3150 for passengers aged 12-27 and \u00a3194 for those 28 and over. The prices for senior passes (aged 60+) are somewhere in the middle (\u00a3174 for the above-mentioned ticket). All Interrail passes come with <a href=\"https://www.interrail.eu/en/interrail-passes/benefits-per-country\" title=\"\">several discounts on other products, hostels and tours</a>, including a 10% discount on <a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/?utm_force=0\" title=\"\">GetYourGuide activities</a>; 10% off hostel chains such as Menninger and Generator; and 15% off European City Sightseeing bus tours. </p> <h2><strong>Flexible or continuous travel?</strong><br></h2> <p>There are a multitude of options on the <a href=\"https://www.interrail.eu/en\" title=\"\">Interrail website</a>.

You can ride unlimited trains between midnight and midnight (although when travelling on a night train, you only use a single day, that of your departure) and spread days out as you see fit. The best tactic with this pass is to save travel days for longer journeys and take your time enjoying each destination. The longest flexible Global Pass is \u201c15 days in two months\u201d (\u00a3337/\u00a3439/\u00a3395).</p> <p>There are also Global Passes that can be used for \u201ccontinuous travel\u201d \u2013 ie every day, if desired, within a set period, ranging from 15 days (\u00a3303/\u00a3394/\u00a3355) to three months (\u00a3607/\u00a3803/\u00a3723).</p> <p>First-class versions of all passes are available for around 30% more than the second-class prices quoted here.</p> <p>If you have limited time on your hands (15 days, say) and want to take your time in each city, a three or five days in one month pass might be the best option.</p> <h2><strong>Kids go free</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcec11f9e1fc0f60a01111d972d1a0b1b8eac72f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcec11f9e1fc0f60a01111d972d1a0b1b8eac72f/0_769_4915_2949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Little girl looking through the window of alpine train\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>One of the best things about Interrailing is that up to two children under the age of 12 (on their first day of travel) can travel free with any one adult, making it a brilliant option for families.

      "body": "<p>Six decades after the invention of the female pill, a male hormonal contraceptive is on the horizon as a groundbreaking clinical trial gets under way.</p> <p>A couple in Edinburgh will be among the first in the world to rely on a hormone-containing gel as their sole form of contraceptive for the next year.</p> <p>James Owers, 29, and Diana Bardsley, 27, are among 450 couples who will test the gel in a trial starting on Saturday that scientists anticipate will demonstrate an effectiveness equivalent to the female pill and that could transform social attitudes towards reproductive control and pregnancy.</p> <p>\u201cMen need more options. Right now it\u2019s very easy for men to say \u2018it\u2019s not really on me\u2019,\u201d said Owers, a PhD student. \u201cIf the gel becomes widely available, it\u2019s much more stark that by not taking that option, you actively made the decision to not take responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a massive deal,\u201d said Bardsley, a social researcher. \u201cIt gives the chance for men to have this great combination of autonomy and more responsibility as well. That can only have a positive impact on the relationship between men and women in society.\u201d</p> <p>The gel, which is applied daily to the chest, shoulders and upper arms, contains a mixture of progesterone and testosterone. The progesterone switches off sperm production in the testes and the testosterone offsets a drop in testosterone that this causes.</p> <p>Without adding testosterone back in, men get unpleasant side-effects such as low mood, weight gain and a slump in libido. Because testosterone is metabolised so quickly in the liver, it can\u2019t be delivered effectively via a pill, and this has proved the major obstacle to developing a male hormonal contraceptive.</p> <p>Recently, though, there has been significant progress. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/27/male-contraceptive-jab-as-effective-as-female-pill-trial-shows\">trial in 2016 of a hormone jab</a> demonstrated effectiveness rates close to those of the female pill, although some participants encountered other problems including acne and depression. </p> <p>Scientists hope the gel version, which is being tested at centres in the UK, Sweden, Chile and Kenya, will prove easier to use and have fewer negative side-effects.</p> <p>The drug comes in a pump something like a toothpaste dispenser and has the consistency of hand sanitiser. The man applies one dose to each shoulder, upper arm and pec each morning.</p> <p>A slight inconvenience is that the female partner has to avoid contact with this part of the body (\u201cunless Diana wants to grow a beard,\u201d Owers said) to prevent a second-hand dose of testosterone. So men are advised to either shower before bed or wear a T-shirt at night.</p> <p>After using it for six weeks, Owers learned that his sperm count had dropped to almost zero. He said he felt \u201cquite excited\u201d rather than anxious on getting the result from the trial\u2019s head nurse.</p> <p>It would take a similar length of time for sperm production to ramp back up to normal, meaning a missed dose for a few days would not result in a significant chance of pregnancy, unlike with the female pill.</p> <p>After nine weeks on the gel, the side-effects have been minimal: some small spots on the lower back, a slightly increased sex drive and putting on about 2kg have been the only notable changes. \u201cThe overarching thing is that I feel it\u2019s had very little impact on my life,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/05/male-birth-control-step-up-responsibility\">It's time for men to step up and share responsibility for birth control | Moira Donegan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If results of the year-long trial are encouraging, the scientific team hope there will be interest from pharmaceutical companies to take the product to market, and this could happen within four to five years.</p> <p>\u201cBefore the pill came into existence we couldn\u2019t have predicted the effects it would have in society,\u201d said John Reynolds-Wright, a clinical research fellow at Edinburgh who is leading the trial. \u201cIn the same way, I don\u2019t think we can really accurately predict the effect this will have.

      "bodyText": "Six decades after the invention of the female pill, a male hormonal contraceptive is on the horizon as a groundbreaking clinical trial gets under way. A couple in Edinburgh will be among the first in the world to rely on a hormone-containing gel as their sole form of contraceptive for the next year. James Owers, 29, and Diana Bardsley, 27, are among 450 couples who will test the gel in a trial starting on Saturday that scientists anticipate will demonstrate an effectiveness equivalent to the female pill and that could transform social attitudes towards reproductive control and pregnancy. \u201cMen need more options. Right now it\u2019s very easy for men to say \u2018it\u2019s not really on me\u2019,\u201d said Owers, a PhD student. \u201cIf the gel becomes widely available, it\u2019s much more stark that by not taking that option, you actively made the decision to not take responsibility.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a massive deal,\u201d said Bardsley, a social researcher. \u201cIt gives the chance for men to have this great combination of autonomy and more responsibility as well. That can only have a positive impact on the relationship between men and women in society.\u201d The gel, which is applied daily to the chest, shoulders and upper arms, contains a mixture of progesterone and testosterone. The progesterone switches off sperm production in the testes and the testosterone offsets a drop in testosterone that this causes. Without adding testosterone back in, men get unpleasant side-effects such as low mood, weight gain and a slump in libido. Because testosterone is metabolised so quickly in the liver, it can\u2019t be delivered effectively via a pill, and this has proved the major obstacle to developing a male hormonal contraceptive. Recently, though, there has been significant progress. A trial in 2016 of a hormone jab demonstrated effectiveness rates close to those of the female pill, although some participants encountered other problems including acne and depression. Scientists hope the gel version, which is being tested at centres in the UK, Sweden, Chile and Kenya, will prove easier to use and have fewer negative side-effects. The drug comes in a pump something like a toothpaste dispenser and has the consistency of hand sanitiser. The man applies one dose to each shoulder, upper arm and pec each morning. A slight inconvenience is that the female partner has to avoid contact with this part of the body (\u201cunless Diana wants to grow a beard,\u201d Owers said) to prevent a second-hand dose of testosterone. So men are advised to either shower before bed or wear a T-shirt at night. After using it for six weeks, Owers learned that his sperm count had dropped to almost zero. He said he felt \u201cquite excited\u201d rather than anxious on getting the result from the trial\u2019s head nurse. It would take a similar length of time for sperm production to ramp back up to normal, meaning a missed dose for a few days would not result in a significant chance of pregnancy, unlike with the female pill. After nine weeks on the gel, the side-effects have been minimal: some small spots on the lower back, a slightly increased sex drive and putting on about 2kg have been the only notable changes. \u201cThe overarching thing is that I feel it\u2019s had very little impact on my life,\u201d he said. If results of the year-long trial are encouraging, the scientific team hope there will be interest from pharmaceutical companies to take the product to market, and this could happen within four to five years. \u201cBefore the pill came into existence we couldn\u2019t have predicted the effects it would have in society,\u201d said John Reynolds-Wright, a clinical research fellow at Edinburgh who is leading the trial. \u201cIn the same way, I don\u2019t think we can really accurately predict the effect this will have. But like the pill, I think it will be largely for the positive.\u201d \u2022 The trial is recruiting men aged between 18 and 50 who are in a stable relationship with a woman aged between 18 and 34.

The former Middlesex bowler Richard Stewart had been waiting for his case to be resolved so he could travel back to Jamaica for the first time in half a century and visit his mother\u2019s grave, but he died a week ago, aged 74. His son, Wesley Stewart, said the cause of death was unknown, adding that his father had become stressed and depressed during the protracted process of attempting to sort out his paperwork and prove the government\u2019s errors had caused him severe problems for years. He described his father as \u201ca pioneer of cricket for the Windrush generation, and a gentleman\u201d.

The government made him feel like: you\u2019re black, you shouldn\u2019t be here, full stop,\u201d he said. Towns across the country are preparing for Windrush Day, a new annual event commemorating the arrival of the liner Empire Windrush in June 1948, carrying 492 passengers from the Caribbean, marking the symbolic beginning of a more multicultural Britain. Attitudes to the day are mixed among those affected by the immigration scandal, in which thousands of people who had arrived legally in the UK in the 1950s and 1960s were wrongly categorised as illegal immigrants by the Home Office. Last year, Theresa May announced an annual \u00a3500,000 grant to fund events celebrating the \u201ccontributions made by British-Caribbean communities over the last 70 years\u201d, as part of her attempt to apologise for the mistake, which was a direct result of \u201chostile environment\u201d policies she introduced as home secretary in 2012. Exhibitions, film festivals and workshops have been organised with the funding, but protests are also expected on Saturday, coordinated by victims who are angry at the slow progress towards compensation being paid and feel May\u2019s decision to fund the day was a token political gesture. Although 6,400 people have been given documents confirming they are in the UK legally, only 13 people have had payments from an emergency hardship fund set up to help those facing extreme financial difficulties as a result of losing their jobs, their homes and access to healthcare and benefits after being misclassified as illegal immigrants. The government announced a compensation scheme earlier this year that could pay out as much as \u00a3570m, but lawyers supporting those affected are not aware of payments having been made. Richard Stewart moved from Jamaica to England, as a British subject, in 1955 aged 10 to join his parents, and played county cricket as a fast bowler for Middlesex in the 1960s under the name Wes Stewart. He paid taxes in the UK for more than five decades but when he applied for a British passport in 2012, he was informed he was an overstayer.

Stewart had discussed the compensation forms with his son this month, but had not yet gathered all the paperwork to make an application. His death follows that of Sarah O\u2019Connor in September, also before receiving an apology or compensation. Many victims are finding the process of sorting out their affairs very challenging, 14 months after the government promised to rectify Home Office mistakes. A former NHS driver, Renford McIntyre, 65, who was made homeless when the government classified him as an illegal immigrant after 50 years in the UK, cashed in his \u00a312,000 pension pot when he was told he was neither allowed to work nor eligible for government support. Since the government admitted its error, he has been rehoused, but he still owes money to friends and faces serious financial difficulties. Supported by the Refugee and Migrant Centre (RMC) in Wolverhampton, he is gathering evidence to prove the consequences of being sacked and losing his home, but the process has been painful and complicated. Some campaigners say the compensation form, which has guidance notes running to 45 pages, is challenging for individuals to fill in without specialist help. McIntyre has been asked to pay \u00a350 by his GP for a letter summarising the impact on his health. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for my next pension payment to go and pay it,\u201d he said. \u201cI am very, very angry.

Gladstone Wilson, 63, was sacked from his job as a security guard in a Wolverhampton hospital when the Home Office classified him as an illegal immigrant, although he had been living in the UK legally since arriving aged 12 in 1968. Wilson is also in the final stages of applying for compensation \u2013 a process that has taken several months and involved several meetings with caseworkers at the RMC.

It would enable users, especially those who are unfortunate enough to lack a bank account but fortunate enough to have a Facebook account, to convert real money into Libras, to deposit it virtually, to send it to others or to simply use it to pay for services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/21/facebook-co-founder-warns-against-libra-cryptocurrency\">Facebook co-founder: Libra currency could give firms excess power</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Facebook is framing the venture as humanitarianism: Libra is here to help the world bank, not strip the world of its remaining assets. Thus, for every Uber and Mastercard that have joined Libra\u2019s association as partners (at the \u201csmall\u201d cost of $10m per company \u2013 apparently, the era of \u201cfree\u201d online stuff is over too), there are also not-for-profit groups like Mercy Corps and Women\u2019s World Banking that lend today\u2019s financial and digital capitalism a humane, even smiley face. Without this not-for-profit contingent, the Libra Association would look more like an innovation-friendly crime syndicate \u2013 just look at the total number of recent court cases involving Uber, Mastercard, and Facebook alone.</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting to misread Facebook\u2019s move into finance as yet more proof of its infinite chutzpah and shortsighted arrogance. Is Libra just a clever way of spitting into the face of angry regulators? Where does Facebook find the courage to proclaim that it\u2019s going to work with policymakers in order to \u201cshape the regulatory environment\u201d in a way that is conducive to its needs? No sane regulator would like to be seen to be shaped by anyone in Facebook\u2019s orbit.</p> <p>Facebook, however, is no novice to controversy and is probably less na\u00efve than the Libra manifesto might suggest. Sheryl Sandberg, CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s second-in-command, is very familiar with the world of finance, having spent her early career at the US treasury under Larry Summers. Could it be that Zuckerberg actually has a plan?</p> <p>Facebook is following a risky but rational two-pronged strategy. First, the company badly needs to diversify its business away from advertising. Second, it wants to pre-empt, as much as possible, some of the tougher regulatory measures that are likely to surface as the US presidential campaign goes into full swing later this year.</p> <p>The diversification bit is straightforward: Facebook\u2019s Chinese competitors have already shown that payments and communications go together and produce a very profitable mix. Besides, the world\u2019s unbanked won\u2019t stay so forever; as things stand now, they are most likely to be served by China\u2019s tech giants, as Beijing expands the digital components of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer\">One Belt, One Road</a> global strategy. Without a strong presence in payment services, Facebook would not be able to take on Tencent or Alibaba in foreign markets.</p> <p>On the other hand, by taking on Chinese competitors directly, Facebook stands to curry favor with Donald Trump: a Facebook that is aggressively trying to undermine the global expansion of Chinese firms is a more important strategic asset to Washington than the pacifist Facebook of yesteryear. For the moment, a further intensification of the tech cold war is only good news for Facebook, as such heated rhetoric (and practice) would paralyze Washington\u2019s efforts to break it up.</p> <p>But there\u2019s another rationale to Facebook\u2019s actions. As it prepares for the public battle over its future, the company seems to have grasped that its best weapon is to mobilize the exact kind of populism that has already allowed other Silicon Valley giants \u2013 especially Uber and Airbnb \u2013 to rally their users behind their anti-regulation campaigns.</p> <p>By positioning their firm as a rebel force against mediocre bureaucrats and sluggish corporate incumbents, Facebook\u2019s strategists seek to convince the public that their company, an emancipatory force of universal disruption, is a victim of global conspiracy by crony politicians and lazy competitors. Given the boundless public animosity to banks and their regulators \u2013 topped only by animosity toward telecom firms \u2013 such arguments might even sound persuasive.</p> <p>With the launch of Libra, Facebook might also be acknowledging, however subtly, that its business model will be changing soon. Remarkably, it has already quietly embraced the idea \u2013 once anathema in big tech circles \u2013 that user data is a commodity with a price tag on top. Thus, it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/11/facebook-user-data-app-privacy-study\">recently launched an app</a> that pays users in order to collect data about how they interact with the services and apps of its competitors. But what about the value of data that users generate while they use Facebook itself?</p> <p>Facebook\u2019s long-term bet could very well be that a digital economy where data and digital services are completely commodified might be as profitable as the one where the imperatives of advertising help to keep that data non-commodified. Yes, Facebook would need to pay something to its users \u2013 but, in turn, it would also be able to charge them for its services. As long as all such transactions are conducted in a currency under its implicit control\u2013 and if Facebook succeeds in convincing its users that their data, on its own, has far less value than the services it supplies \u2013 it would not necessarily be such a bad outcome for the company. In fact, it\u2019s almost certainly better than the prospect of slicing up the company into smaller pieces on antitrust grounds.</p> <p>If Facebook is prepared to embrace such a seemingly radical shift to payments and subscriptions, it would disarm many of its critics, who have been insisting that the reason to fear Facebook is precisely because it\u2019s too addicted to advertising and cannot embrace other models. But would a different Facebook \u2013 a champion of digital currencies \u2013 look any less threatening?</p> <p>Perhaps Facebook\u2019s critics have misunderstood the nature of the threat. Facebook, along with Amazon, Alphabet, and a few others, present a problem that is fundamentally different from those of other industries.</p> <p>As long as they traffic in data \u2013 and as long as data remains the lifeblood of democracy and economy alike \u2013 these firms will exercise disproportionate and undue influence over decisions that ought to be decided in parliaments, not in marketplaces. Whether they get to exercise it by extracting our data and showing us ads or by buying our data and selling us their services is not so important. A business model, however profitable, is never a sound foundation for robust democracy. For that, we have constitutions.</p> <ul> <li><p>Evgeny Morozov is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Without this not-for-profit contingent, the Libra Association would look more like an innovation-friendly crime syndicate \u2013 just look at the total number of recent court cases involving Uber, Mastercard, and Facebook alone. It\u2019s tempting to misread Facebook\u2019s move into finance as yet more proof of its infinite chutzpah and shortsighted arrogance. Is Libra just a clever way of spitting into the face of angry regulators? Where does Facebook find the courage to proclaim that it\u2019s going to work with policymakers in order to \u201cshape the regulatory environment\u201d in a way that is conducive to its needs? No sane regulator would like to be seen to be shaped by anyone in Facebook\u2019s orbit. Facebook, however, is no novice to controversy and is probably less na\u00efve than the Libra manifesto might suggest. Sheryl Sandberg, CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s second-in-command, is very familiar with the world of finance, having spent her early career at the US treasury under Larry Summers. Could it be that Zuckerberg actually has a plan? Facebook is following a risky but rational two-pronged strategy. First, the company badly needs to diversify its business away from advertising. Second, it wants to pre-empt, as much as possible, some of the tougher regulatory measures that are likely to surface as the US presidential campaign goes into full swing later this year. The diversification bit is straightforward: Facebook\u2019s Chinese competitors have already shown that payments and communications go together and produce a very profitable mix. Besides, the world\u2019s unbanked won\u2019t stay so forever; as things stand now, they are most likely to be served by China\u2019s tech giants, as Beijing expands the digital components of its One Belt, One Road global strategy. Without a strong presence in payment services, Facebook would not be able to take on Tencent or Alibaba in foreign markets. On the other hand, by taking on Chinese competitors directly, Facebook stands to curry favor with Donald Trump: a Facebook that is aggressively trying to undermine the global expansion of Chinese firms is a more important strategic asset to Washington than the pacifist Facebook of yesteryear. For the moment, a further intensification of the tech cold war is only good news for Facebook, as such heated rhetoric (and practice) would paralyze Washington\u2019s efforts to break it up. But there\u2019s another rationale to Facebook\u2019s actions. As it prepares for the public battle over its future, the company seems to have grasped that its best weapon is to mobilize the exact kind of populism that has already allowed other Silicon Valley giants \u2013 especially Uber and Airbnb \u2013 to rally their users behind their anti-regulation campaigns. By positioning their firm as a rebel force against mediocre bureaucrats and sluggish corporate incumbents, Facebook\u2019s strategists seek to convince the public that their company, an emancipatory force of universal disruption, is a victim of global conspiracy by crony politicians and lazy competitors. Given the boundless public animosity to banks and their regulators \u2013 topped only by animosity toward telecom firms \u2013 such arguments might even sound persuasive. With the launch of Libra, Facebook might also be acknowledging, however subtly, that its business model will be changing soon. Remarkably, it has already quietly embraced the idea \u2013 once anathema in big tech circles \u2013 that user data is a commodity with a price tag on top. Thus, it has recently launched an app that pays users in order to collect data about how they interact with the services and apps of its competitors. But what about the value of data that users generate while they use Facebook itself? Facebook\u2019s long-term bet could very well be that a digital economy where data and digital services are completely commodified might be as profitable as the one where the imperatives of advertising help to keep that data non-commodified. Yes, Facebook would need to pay something to its users \u2013 but, in turn, it would also be able to charge them for its services. As long as all such transactions are conducted in a currency under its implicit control\u2013 and if Facebook succeeds in convincing its users that their data, on its own, has far less value than the services it supplies \u2013 it would not necessarily be such a bad outcome for the company. In fact, it\u2019s almost certainly better than the prospect of slicing up the company into smaller pieces on antitrust grounds. If Facebook is prepared to embrace such a seemingly radical shift to payments and subscriptions, it would disarm many of its critics, who have been insisting that the reason to fear Facebook is precisely because it\u2019s too addicted to advertising and cannot embrace other models. But would a different Facebook \u2013 a champion of digital currencies \u2013 look any less threatening? Perhaps Facebook\u2019s critics have misunderstood the nature of the threat. Facebook, along with Amazon, Alphabet, and a few others, present a problem that is fundamentally different from those of other industries. As long as they traffic in data \u2013 and as long as data remains the lifeblood of democracy and economy alike \u2013 these firms will exercise disproportionate and undue influence over decisions that ought to be decided in parliaments, not in marketplaces. Whether they get to exercise it by extracting our data and showing us ads or by buying our data and selling us their services is not so important. A business model, however profitable, is never a sound foundation for robust democracy. For that, we have constitutions. Evgeny Morozov is a Guardian US columnist",

An hour later she returns without him. \u201cSo, the cat\u2019s now grabbed a second kitten,\u201d she says. \u201cNo one knows where she\u2019s taking them.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s awful,\u201d I say. \u201cOn the other hand\u2026\u201d \u201cOn the other hand, what?\u201d she says. \u201cKeep the window open, cat takes all the kittens away, the end,\u201d I say. \u201cProblem solved.\u201d It has been raining on and off all day. As we leave for book club, it is on again. Kate is keeping lookout on the corner while the middle one climbs over a garden wall. \u201cWe think they might be back there somewhere,\u201d Kate says. \u201cYou\u2019re both going to get arrested,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Kate says. At book club, my wife explains the reason for Kate\u2019s absence. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible,\u201d Nicky says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Problem solved\u2019,\u201d I say. No one speaks. Everyone else arrives, and we sit down. I usually have a lot to say at book club, but tonight I find myself preoccupied. It\u2019s raining harder than ever, and getting dark. Halfway through the evening, my wife\u2019s phone pings. She looks at the screen. \u201cOh!\u201d she says. \u201cWhat?\u201d I say. She shows me a long text message from Kate, recounting how the middle one, after crouching in the rain for hours, managed to track the cat to a secluded spot in a stranger\u2019s back garden, where, in the dark, he gathered up the missing kittens in his jacket. Cat and kittens were now reunited, and safely home. \u201cAw,\u201d says everyone. Not for the first time, I am reminded of the simple spirit of kindness that resides in every human heart except mine. After a few minutes looking at pictures of kittens on my wife\u2019s phone, we return to the book. \u201cSo,\u201d Emma says, \u201cdo we like Tim?\u201d \u201cNot really,\u201d Sash says. \u201cWere we supposed to?\u201d \u201cHe was sort of meant to be inadequate, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d Nicky says. \u201cEmotionally deficient,\u201d Emma says. \u201cOf course he was,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s called Tim.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t really like the book, to be honest,\u201d my wife says. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re all called Tim,\u201d I say. On the way home, my wife takes me to see the kittens. They are smaller, and frailer, than I could have possibly imagined.",

The government\u2019s Insolvency Service, which is funding British Steel\u2019s operations while seeking a buyer, has given bidders until 30 June to make an offer for the company, whose financial failure last month put 4,500 jobs at risk. About a dozen firms are thought to have made tentative approaches and the deadline could be extended if any ask for more time to draft a takeover plan. But the Guardian understands that Liberty House, previously considered among the most likely to buy British Steel, has cooled its interest after failing to secure government support, including loan guarantees to fund investment. Liberty wants to convert Scunthorpe\u2019s blast furnaces, which make steel from scratch, into more cost-effective electric arc furnaces that can use recycled steel to make similar products. But the plan would require a major outlay, which according to a person with knowledge of the situation would be in the \u201clow hundreds of millions\u201d. The source said there was a \u201clack of enthusiasm\u201d in government for the steps that would be required to convert the steelworks. Government officials are understood to be unwilling to provide loan guarantees or help retrain staff who might lose their jobs, although such measures are thought to fall within state aid rules. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, which would oversee any such guarantees, declined to comment.

Hesteel, which owns businesses in the US, Serbia and Switzerland, declined to comment on whether it would submit a formal offer for British Steel or any of its assets. JSW Steel, part of a multibillion-pound Indian conglomerate, also declined to comment. Representatives of several interested parties are thought to have visited the Scunthorpe steelworks over the past week, raising hopes of a deal.

They did all this because, despite the inequality and contradictory evidence that surrounded them, they believed in a particular story about Britain: that it was a fair, just nation, a land of modesty, balance, equality and opportunity, the story most Britons like to believe about their country.</p> <p>I don\u2019t have Caribbean heritage, and I wasn\u2019t born and raised in London, but to this day, little evokes the notion of black Britain to me as much as Trinidadian calypsonian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/16/lord-kitchener-empire-windrush\" title=\"\">Lord Kitchener</a> (named after the general and politician of the same name) singing the celebratory ballad \u201cLondon is the place for me\u201d at Tilbury Docks: \u201cTo live in London you are really comfortable / Because the English people are very much sociable / They take you here and they take you there / And they make you feel like a millionaire / London that\u2019s the place for me.\u201d</p> <p>There was already a long history of immigration to Britain, of course, and a black presence was nothing new when the Windrush docked. But 1948 was the moment that, finally, seemed to inscribe blackness into the soul of British mythology. It was a moment in history that I, as a black Sheffielder, could anchor myself to during moments of cultural unease, and when I was faced with British racism, because it held all kinds of blackness to its bosom. The way those men and women walked, how they spoke, what they wore, expressed a coherent and confident plurality. They didn\u2019t look exactly like the picture Britain had painted of itself in the first half of the 20th century, yet they were undeniably British. They wrote a new chapter in the story of the country, one that spoke of somewhere that would never be able to look at itself the same way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abc4dc2f0f9f0bf6b1ab7e32ebe1645e4520bb7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abc4dc2f0f9f0bf6b1ab7e32ebe1645e4520bb7c/0_162_2622_3275/801.jpg\" alt=\"'Dressed in their Sunday best (though it was a misty Tuesday morning).'\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Dressed in their Sunday best (though it was a misty Tuesday morning).\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Douglas Miller/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tilbury, June 2019</strong>. I know this story well, too. It\u2019s two o\u2019clock on an overcast and drizzly midweek afternoon in an unloved place. Polish labourers, covered in splatterings of paint and smudges of dust enjoy a stress-relieving smoke outside a Romanian bakery called Nehoiu. A Turkish man preps the evening\u2019s doner meat in Stallions kebab shop, and I buy my chocolate drink from Tilbury Wines, run by an Indian man, before taking some photographs of a white man smoking outside a Chinese fish and chips shop called Rainbow. For a while the rain pours down and I seek refuge under a bus stop, from where I can see the Thurrock Irish association club and God Saviour, an African hair salon, through a lattice of graffiti etchings and cigarette burn marks on the plastic window. Behind me is a telephone booth, also scarred. It isn\u2019t an iconic, listed red telephone booth \u2013 this area isn\u2019t important enough for one of those \u2013 but rather a boxy KX100, a relic of Thatcher\u2019s privatisation of British Telecom in the 1980s and now, along with the council estate, an emblem of urban decay. And yet, there is a sense of a down-to-earth friendliness you won\u2019t find to the west along the river in central London. It makes me think of a passage in Samuel Selvon\u2019s <em>The Lonely Londoners</em> (1956), perhaps the definitive novel of the black experience in postwar London, where Selvon\u2019s protagonist Moses Aloetta says of the city: \u201cIt divide up in little worlds, and you stay in the world you belong to and you don\u2019t know anything about what happening in the other ones except what you read in the papers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3f370afb6899df0f7ea3600c532c97fbf6bbad0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3f370afb6899df0f7ea3600c532c97fbf6bbad0/0_519_4046_2428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A drizzly midweek afternoon in Tilbury.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A drizzly midweek afternoon in Tilbury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johny Pitts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those words still ring true, especially in the age of social media, because despite Tilbury\u2019s evident street-level conviviality, the Essex district of Thurrock, which Tilbury belongs to, was one of the five districts in the UK with the highest percentage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit </a>supporters. Not all votes to leave had racist connotations; indeed, a sizeable number of black people voted to exit the EU. When Britain joined the single market in 1992 there was a lot of anxiety among black communities because most businesses within them were small, and so \u2013 the argument went \u2013 most likely to be negatively affected by new competition from the continent; community leaders such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/apr/10/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Bernie Grant</a> were vehemently opposed to the idea.</p> <p>I believe, however, that as white Europe appears to be splintering off into insular nationalisms and parochial identities, black communities in Europe must forge stronger trans-local networks of support than ever before. The fact remains that, across the UK, if you are xenophobic and racist, then if you voted, you voted to leave. In the area of Sheffield where I grew up, Firth Park (which reminds me of Tilbury, with its faded industrial heritage, working-class multicultural community, and which also voted overwhelmingly to leave the EU), I\u2019ve seen people I once called friends stirred from inertia to xenophobia by powerful narratives this country began telling itself in the aftermath of the global financial crash and the lead-up to Brexit. Some of my schoolmates joined the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/english-defence-league\" title=\"\">English Defence League</a>; another is now a staunch supporter of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage\" title=\"\">Nigel Farage</a>, who has done as much as anyone to create the toxic atmosphere surrounding \u201cthe other\u201d that people now feel so clearly in Britain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Racism is so virulent in British society because the non-white presence is a visible reminder of the death of an empire that once ruled over much of the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>During the New Labour years, when Britain became more European than ever before, I noticed how multiculturalism was detached from working-class culture, and connected to globalisation: seen on billboards and in elite international spaces \u2013 the hotel lobby, the airport lounge, the global business network or what Marc Aug\u00e9 famously called \u2018nonplaces\u2019. The neoliberal project that was failing people co-opted multiculturalism as it undermined it; a global elite, an underpaid poor, more immigration to fill the labour market, working classes left to their own devices to forge goodwill with newcomers, while the right-leaning press vilified not business owners, but the new proletariat with different accents.</p> <p>This works so well because of the crumbling of two big stories in the imagination of Britain: empire and capitalism. Racism is so virulent in British society because the non-white presence is a visible reminder of the death of an empire that once ruled over much of the world. After all, we are often here because Britain had been over \u201cthere\u201d. When people say they want their country back what they really mean is that they want other people\u2019s countries back. In the same way, multiculturalism is a charged reminder of the failures of neoliberal capitalism and globalisation. Those Polish workers are here because a business owner \u2013 somebody who wants cheap labour to build homes perhaps \u2013 is exploiting them and trying to drive down wages for low-skilled workers. The vilification of the eastern European worker down the road, or the imam at the local mosque, works because it replaces a more terrible, banal truth: that there are people in power \u2013 politicians and business leaders \u2013 who don\u2019t care about the majority of people living in the country the politicans claim to represent, whether they are black or white.</p> <p>But unlike the story of the Empire Windrush, which was built on hope, plurality, working-class connection and cross-cultural goodwill, the stories you can find passing through places such as Tilbury now are those built on anger, intolerance and resentment. Which is why the undermining of the Windrush generation, in the hostile environment imposed by the Conservative government, is such a gross act of violence against the cultural fabric of this country. It\u2019s not just about people who have been here for years contributing to society, working for the NHS, bringing culture and labour, but about the very idea of them being part of the British story: this is what is under attack. We are the stories we tell ourselves. Who are \u201cwe\u201d? Why are we here? What are we trying to achieve?

But they were also more British because Britain is, more than ever, like them. I heard it in the language of some of the white kids in the group \u2013 an urban concoction of words that had London\u2019s history of multiculturalism embedded in every intonation.

But with more and more US states passing extreme anti-abortion measures, she saw it as a responsibility.</p> <p>\u201cThere is power to being vocal about your experiences as a person because whether we like it or not, people lack empathy, they lack the ability to understand someone else\u2019s situation until they\u2019re really faced with it \u2013 until it\u2019s really shown to them,\u201d she tells me over the phone, cutting out to field texts from her husband and make arrangements for her daughter\u2019s hair appointment. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of value in sharing all of our stories and experiences in order to elicit change.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/08/actor-busy-philipps-abortion-condemns-georgia-six-week-ban\">Busy Philipps speaks about her abortion and condemns Georgia's six-week ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Historically speaking, she has a point.</p> <p>From the socialist-feminist demonstrators who spoke up about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/23/opinion/sunday/abortion-speakout-anniversary.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\">ending their pregnancies in 1969</a> to the 343 French influencers led by Simone de Beauvoir who signed a 1971 manifesto <a href=\"https://time.com/5459995/manifesto-343-abortion-france/\">testifying to their abortions</a>, all have helped pave the way to legal abortion.</p> <p>The former Glamour magazine editor Cindi Leive wrote last year about coming of age at a time when abortion stories were part of the public sphere in the 1980s and 1990s, only to see them all but disappear in the mid-aughts. \u201cAs the years passed, so did that urgency; my generation began to feel more secure \u2013 and perhaps less inclined to air our private business,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/30/opinion/sunday/abortion-kennedy-supreme-court.html\">wrote in the New York Times</a>.</p> <p>But as women stopped talking about it publicly, the anti-abortion movement gathered steam.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"092734e693dec3372d4d2ab256cdbd4b5d0d197f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/092734e693dec3372d4d2ab256cdbd4b5d0d197f/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Busy Philipps testifies about the threat to abortion rights before a House judiciary subcommittee.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Busy Philipps testifies about the threat to abortion rights before a House judiciary subcommittee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: c-span</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 2014, <a href=\"https://data.guttmacher.org/states/table?state=US&amp;topics=58&amp;dataset=data\">90% of American counties</a> had no abortion access, even though <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2017/abortion-common-experience-us-women-despite-dramatic-declines-rates\">one in four women</a> will have an abortion by the age of 45. And now, thanks to the addition of two ultra-conservative supreme court justices picked by Donald Trump, anti-abortion activists have launched a new spate of state laws they hope will lead the court to overturn Roe v Wade, the decision that has protected abortion rights for decades.</p> <p>That\u2019s what led Leive to write publicly about her abortion, and why the Washington congresswoman Pramila Jayapal penned an op-ed last week about her <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/opinion/pramila-jayapal-abortion.html\">\u201cexcruciating\u201d decision</a> to end a pregnancy. It\u2019s the political context that gave rise to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/22/i-set-up-shoutyourabortion-because-i-am-not-sorry-and-i-will-not-whisper\">#ShoutYourAbortion movement</a> in 2015.</p> <p>And it\u2019s why Busy Philipps is talking to me now.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve allowed the anti-abortion minority to be really loud and take up the space,\u201d Philipps says. \u201cAnd the truth of the matter is this is a women\u2019s health issue that affects millions and millions of American women, millions and millions and millions of women and people worldwide, and if we want to take control of the narrative we have to be willing to be loud about it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying you have to be,\u201d she adds. But, having seen the power of celebrity in advancing #MeToo, she wasn\u2019t about to sit this one out.</p> <p>\u201cWomen have held on to a lot of this shame having to do with their bodies and sexuality forever,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that most of us have reached the point where we\u2019re no longer willing to hold on to this to make someone else comfortable or prevent someone else from feeling uncomfortable.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dd34c3d2df3b0a964f4aa85a1d0081e5a176355\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dd34c3d2df3b0a964f4aa85a1d0081e5a176355/0_55_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An activist holds up her arm during a protest against recently passed abortion ban bills at the Georgia State Capitol building.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An activist holds up her arm during a protest against recently passed abortion ban bills at the Georgia state capitol building.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Philipps came up in Hollywood playing supporting roles in Freaks and Geeks and Dawson\u2019s Creek. More recently she played the best friend character in Amy Schumer\u2019s I Feel Pretty. But it turns out she plays no one as well as herself. Her star turn came on Instagram\u2019s stories feature, of all places, where she quickly racked up more than a million followers with video collages inviting people into the pleasures, struggles and banalities of celebrity life. Here, she is lifting weights in pink Spandex, her blond hair swept back. There, she\u2019s posted a poll asking her followers if a new necklace needs to be longer.</p> <p>The appeal of Busy being Busy landed her her own late-night talkshow on the channel E!, a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/how-busy-philipps-became-the-breakout-star-of-instagram-stories\">favorable profile in the New Yorker</a> and a book deal on a collection of essays. <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/This-Will-Only-Hurt-a-Little/Busy-Philipps/9781501184710\">This Will Only Hurt A Little</a> \u2013 which became an instant bestseller \u2013 is bubbly in tone, laced with plenty of F-bombs, and features Philipps on the cover in pink. But it\u2019s also dark and reads holistically \u2013 rather than in the tiny shreds more typically rendered by the internet \u2013 while providing a fairly devastating critique of masculinity and authority in America.</p> <p>There\u2019s the time her mouth fills with blood after being smacked across the face by her mom. And there\u2019s the trauma of her first sexual experience, how she found penetration painful and told the guy: \u201cI don\u2019t think this is gonna work.\u201d He didn\u2019t stop, slamming her against the carpet of his car so hard she would be left with a spine-length scab. \u201cI found a spot on the ceiling of his car and I sort of spun up to it and just focused on that until he shuddered and rolled off me,\u201d she writes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you\u2019re a public figure, a person, a celebrity or whatever such as I am myself, people do actually know you, or they think they do</p> <footer> <cite>Busy Philipps</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s also a story about James Franco taking one of her (relatively few) lines back when she got her breakout role and how, when she persisted in correcting him, the relationship went cold. \u201cHe was <em>not</em> cool to me at all,\u201d she writes, describing how he once lost his temper entirely, throwing her to the ground on set .</p> <p>That this brief anecdote about Franco\u2019s aggression garnered much of the media attention when the book was released didn\u2019t sit well with Philipps. \u201cThe Franco story is used to illustrate a larger point about the way women are treated in this business and in life. There are no \u2018allegations\u2019 and no \u2018accusations\u2019. It\u2019s a story that I have been telling for years,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BouOfNVhEDJ/\">wrote on Instagram</a>. He had apologized, she said, and she had accepted.</p> <p>Later she would sum it up: \u201cI\u2019m a woman in this industry who wrote a personal book about my experiences in life and in this industry, then the headlines were all about a man.\u201d</p> <p>At some point you might wonder if it isn\u2019t a coincidence that someone conventionally beautiful \u2013 tall, blonde, honey-skinned \u2013 has such a keen awareness of women\u2019s systematic disempowerment, though presumably her college coursework in women\u2019s studies didn\u2019t hurt.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a real double-edged sword,\u201d she says of the female body. \u201cI think culturally we have a really tricky relationship with women\u2019s bodies and women\u2019s sexuality and I\u2019m not sure if the origin is religious, puritanical \u2013 if, you know, we\u2019re going back to the Salem witch trials,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But whatever the origins, she adds, \u201cthese are things that exist and permeate the culture and I think part of allowing ourselves to try to free ourselves from that, from that shame, is by talking about our own unique biology and biological functions, starting with periods, breasts and nipples and destigmatizing all women\u2019s healthcare\u201d.</p> <p>This is exactly what feminists have long been famous for: using insights born of personal experience to speak up on the politics of the day.</p> <p>When Dr Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate judiciary committee that she had been sexually assaulted by the now supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh, Philipps posted on Instagram about her own teenage rape, an act she says she didn\u2019t come to identify as rape until years later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BoPDmUYB1XE/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The age I was raped. It&#39;s taken me 25 years to say those words. I wrote about it in my book. I finally told my parents and sister about it 4 months ago. Today is the day we are silent no more.

      "bodyText": "Busy Philipps\u2019 big dreams for the stage never included testifying before Congress about why she got an abortion at age 15. But with more and more US states passing extreme anti-abortion measures, she saw it as a responsibility. \u201cThere is power to being vocal about your experiences as a person because whether we like it or not, people lack empathy, they lack the ability to understand someone else\u2019s situation until they\u2019re really faced with it \u2013 until it\u2019s really shown to them,\u201d she tells me over the phone, cutting out to field texts from her husband and make arrangements for her daughter\u2019s hair appointment. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of value in sharing all of our stories and experiences in order to elicit change.\u201d Historically speaking, she has a point. From the socialist-feminist demonstrators who spoke up about ending their pregnancies in 1969 to the 343 French influencers led by Simone de Beauvoir who signed a 1971 manifesto testifying to their abortions, all have helped pave the way to legal abortion. The former Glamour magazine editor Cindi Leive wrote last year about coming of age at a time when abortion stories were part of the public sphere in the 1980s and 1990s, only to see them all but disappear in the mid-aughts. \u201cAs the years passed, so did that urgency; my generation began to feel more secure \u2013 and perhaps less inclined to air our private business,\u201d she wrote in the New York Times. But as women stopped talking about it publicly, the anti-abortion movement gathered steam. By 2014, 90% of American counties had no abortion access, even though one in four women will have an abortion by the age of 45. And now, thanks to the addition of two ultra-conservative supreme court justices picked by Donald Trump, anti-abortion activists have launched a new spate of state laws they hope will lead the court to overturn Roe v Wade, the decision that has protected abortion rights for decades. That\u2019s what led Leive to write publicly about her abortion, and why the Washington congresswoman Pramila Jayapal penned an op-ed last week about her \u201cexcruciating\u201d decision to end a pregnancy. It\u2019s the political context that gave rise to the #ShoutYourAbortion movement in 2015. And it\u2019s why Busy Philipps is talking to me now. \u201cWe\u2019ve allowed the anti-abortion minority to be really loud and take up the space,\u201d Philipps says. \u201cAnd the truth of the matter is this is a women\u2019s health issue that affects millions and millions of American women, millions and millions and millions of women and people worldwide, and if we want to take control of the narrative we have to be willing to be loud about it. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you have to be,\u201d she adds. But, having seen the power of celebrity in advancing #MeToo, she wasn\u2019t about to sit this one out. \u201cWomen have held on to a lot of this shame having to do with their bodies and sexuality forever,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that most of us have reached the point where we\u2019re no longer willing to hold on to this to make someone else comfortable or prevent someone else from feeling uncomfortable.\u201d Philipps came up in Hollywood playing supporting roles in Freaks and Geeks and Dawson\u2019s Creek. More recently she played the best friend character in Amy Schumer\u2019s I Feel Pretty. But it turns out she plays no one as well as herself. Her star turn came on Instagram\u2019s stories feature, of all places, where she quickly racked up more than a million followers with video collages inviting people into the pleasures, struggles and banalities of celebrity life. Here, she is lifting weights in pink Spandex, her blond hair swept back. There, she\u2019s posted a poll asking her followers if a new necklace needs to be longer. The appeal of Busy being Busy landed her her own late-night talkshow on the channel E!, a favorable profile in the New Yorker and a book deal on a collection of essays. This Will Only Hurt A Little \u2013 which became an instant bestseller \u2013 is bubbly in tone, laced with plenty of F-bombs, and features Philipps on the cover in pink. But it\u2019s also dark and reads holistically \u2013 rather than in the tiny shreds more typically rendered by the internet \u2013 while providing a fairly devastating critique of masculinity and authority in America. There\u2019s the time her mouth fills with blood after being smacked across the face by her mom. And there\u2019s the trauma of her first sexual experience, how she found penetration painful and told the guy: \u201cI don\u2019t think this is gonna work.\u201d He didn\u2019t stop, slamming her against the carpet of his car so hard she would be left with a spine-length scab. \u201cI found a spot on the ceiling of his car and I sort of spun up to it and just focused on that until he shuddered and rolled off me,\u201d she writes. There\u2019s also a story about James Franco taking one of her (relatively few) lines back when she got her breakout role and how, when she persisted in correcting him, the relationship went cold. \u201cHe was not cool to me at all,\u201d she writes, describing how he once lost his temper entirely, throwing her to the ground on set . That this brief anecdote about Franco\u2019s aggression garnered much of the media attention when the book was released didn\u2019t sit well with Philipps. \u201cThe Franco story is used to illustrate a larger point about the way women are treated in this business and in life. There are no \u2018allegations\u2019 and no \u2018accusations\u2019. It\u2019s a story that I have been telling for years,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. He had apologized, she said, and she had accepted. Later she would sum it up: \u201cI\u2019m a woman in this industry who wrote a personal book about my experiences in life and in this industry, then the headlines were all about a man.\u201d At some point you might wonder if it isn\u2019t a coincidence that someone conventionally beautiful \u2013 tall, blonde, honey-skinned \u2013 has such a keen awareness of women\u2019s systematic disempowerment, though presumably her college coursework in women\u2019s studies didn\u2019t hurt. \u201cIt\u2019s a real double-edged sword,\u201d she says of the female body. \u201cI think culturally we have a really tricky relationship with women\u2019s bodies and women\u2019s sexuality and I\u2019m not sure if the origin is religious, puritanical \u2013 if, you know, we\u2019re going back to the Salem witch trials,\u201d she says. But whatever the origins, she adds, \u201cthese are things that exist and permeate the culture and I think part of allowing ourselves to try to free ourselves from that, from that shame, is by talking about our own unique biology and biological functions, starting with periods, breasts and nipples and destigmatizing all women\u2019s healthcare\u201d. This is exactly what feminists have long been famous for: using insights born of personal experience to speak up on the politics of the day. When Dr Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate judiciary committee that she had been sexually assaulted by the now supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh, Philipps posted on Instagram about her own teenage rape, an act she says she didn\u2019t come to identify as rape until years later. \u201cHaving written the story for my book and having it put into the world publicly in the fall I think really prepared me for this moment, because I do think that I went through all of the fear of retaliation when my book was coming out and I had moved through all of those emotions,\u201d she says. The book also chronicled the experience culminating in her abortion at age 15, how little she knew about sex and sexuality, and how the default \u2013 silence \u2013 meant being pressured to submit to penile pleasure. \u201cMy mom was so cool about so much, but she was also raised very Catholic and it wasn\u2019t ever discussed in a real way. We had the where-do-babies-come-from conversation when I was little, but sex was just something that I knew was shameful,\u201d she writes. It was also all about pleasing men. \u201cI derived no pleasure from it really,\u201d she writes of the unprotected sex she had with her then boyfriend. \u201cI was just happy to be that close to him and to give him what I knew he wanted.\u201d Though names were changed in the book, her personal account \u2013 which the Guardian has not independently verified \u2013 offers something that boilerplate political statements cannot: how blurry the lines are around sexual consent, how often young women are coaxed and cajoled into unprotected penetrative sex for men\u2019s satisfaction and how often they shoulder blame and consequences afterwards. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve gotten yourself into quite a situation, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Philipps recalled the mom of her then boyfriend saying, before launching into a lecture on how she wouldn\u2019t let Philipps \u201cmurder a baby\u201d. Philipps doesn\u2019t write that her life now would have been impossible without the abortion she got at age 15, but she doesn\u2019t have to. When abortion bans started moving through the states this year, Philipps knew she wanted to use her platform to talk about it \u2013 specifically, she wanted to talk about it on her show, which it had recently been announced, was going to be canceled. So she did. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re sitting there thinking, \u2018I don\u2019t know a woman who would have an abortion,\u2019\u201d she told viewers on Busy Tonight. \u201cWell, you know me.

      "bodyText": "Alice on Tom What were you hoping for? To meet the love of my life. But on a more realistic level, a free meal with someone tall, kind and nice, who could use chopsticks. First impressions? Tall, friendly face, maybe a little awkward (possibly just nerves). What did you talk about? Blind dates, how competitive we both were, our different levels of hatred of London, and our mutual appreciation that neither of us was vegan. Any awkward moments? Me stepping on him when getting to my seat. Him flinging his chopsticks on to the floor a second time. Good table manners? It quickly descended into chaos. I ate with my hands but he had chopsticks flying everywhere, so I think we were even. Best thing about Tom? His enthusiasm about trying the weirder things on the menu (kid goat momos and rabbit wonton), and his appreciation of Wetherspoons. Would you introduce him to your friends? Yeah, he seems easy enough to get along with. Describe Tom in three words Poor chopstick game. What do you think he made of you? Awkward and talked too much. Did you go on somewhere? We tried to find a \u2019spoons, but Google Maps snaked us and we ended up in a Greene King. And... did you kiss? Nuh-uh. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? We should\u2019ve ordered more cocktails. Marks out of 10? Where 1 is being on a date with an actual rock, and 10 is leaving your knickers at a house party: 7. Would you meet again? We\u2019ve been messaging, so who knows. Tom on Alice What were you hoping for? A fun and memorable evening. First impressions? Attractive and much, much cooler than me. What did you talk about? Trashy TV shows, who should get the last chicken momo, and what not to mention in these answers. Any awkward moments? I dropped the chopsticks on the floor\u2026 twice. Made much more embarrassing by the fact I showed off with them earlier. Good table manners? Wonderful. Best thing about Alice? She was very comfortable taking the lead, which made up for my inability to make decisions. Would you introduce her to your friends? Definitely. Describe Alice in three words Intelligent, confident, refreshing. What do you think she made of you? I\u2019m not sure I was her type, but I think we both enjoyed the evening. Did you go on somewhere? Yes, an incredibly classy establishment that certainly does not have a reputation for cheap drinks (and rhymes with Breene King). And... did you kiss? As romantic as tube station lighting can be, we did not. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I wish I had read up on chopstick etiquette. Marks out of 10? 9. Would you meet again? Absolutely. \u2022 Alice and Tom ate at Fatt Pundit, London W1. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com.

      "body": "<p>Sam Khalaf and his son Riyadh used to call themselves the two musketeers. When Riyadh was growing up in Bray, south of Dublin, they were inseparable. Like twins or best friends, they say. So the Iraqi-born, Irish citizen remembers keenly the moment when he realised his eldest child had drifted from him.</p> <p>\u201cWe used to go everywhere together,\u201d 54-year-old Sam recalls. \u201cEvery weekend we\u2019d go to a tropical fish shop and pick out which koi carp to go into our pond. The first time Riyadh didn\u2019t come with me, he was about 15. And the lad who worked there said: \u2018Where\u2019s your mate?\u2019 I said, \u2018He\u2019s grown up now, he\u2019s out with his friends.\u2019 It was a shock to the system.\u201d</p> <p>The bigger shock was yet to come. Riyadh had stopped hanging out with his dad because he realised he was gay \u2013 a revelation he did not think his Muslim father, a garage owner with a passion for football and cars, would take well.</p> <p>He was right: it took him another year, and when Riyadh came out to his dad, Sam says it \u201ccame like a fast train, it hit me very hard. Those couple of words didn\u2019t register. I was going, \u2018Shit, is he? Fuck, fuck!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The coming-out drama forms part of a new book by Riyadh, an Irish YouTuber and broadcaster, whose bright, conversational guide to being a young gay man \u2013 Yay! You\u2019re Gay! Now What? \u2013 offers salient advice on topics from gender identity to anal sex. There is also a necessary chapter written from the parents\u2019 perspective, by Sam and Riyadh\u2019s mother, Lorraine.</p> <p>We meet in Riyadh\u2019s flat in London. Both men are as candid as the book, particularly with each other. Riyadh, 28, recalls that he was flamboyant as a child. In his book, he writes that, \u201cI was king of the sissy boys, growing up. I loved running around the house in my mother\u2019s pink silk nightgown, black stilettos and anything I could find that sparkled.\u201d At seven, his father told him to start acting like a boy. \u201cI was worried he was too gentle, I needed to toughen him up,\u201d Sam says now. When Riyadh was in his early teens, in addition to hiking or fishing, his dad took him to karate. \u201cI thought, he was going to get the shit beaten out of him, so I wanted him to toughen up. I saw him as soft.\u201d</p> <p>Riyadh read this as a judgment. \u201cWe\u2019d been buddies so closely until that point and then, all of a sudden, I wasn\u2019t enough. I hadn\u2019t got enough masculinity in me to match what you saw as normal or acceptable,\u201d he says, addressing his father directly. \u201cI knew you were doing it because you were worried about my safety in the big, bad world. But it was damaging because I couldn\u2019t live up to the expectation. It wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Riyadh told his father over dinner one evening, writing 'I\u2019m gay' on a piece of paper and handing it over</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sam had toughed it out himself. Born in southern Iraq, he lived in Baghdad until 1982, when an error on a reissued birth certificate (three years were knocked off his age by mistake) gave him a window of time to escape the country before military service beckoned. \u201cFriends of mine lost arms and legs. Some died,\u201d he says of the Iraq-Iran war of the time. \u201cYou walked down every street, and there was a funeral.\u201d</p> <p>He had always hoped to go to Europe (\u201cI loved the way people could live freely\u201d) and on his second attempt he reached England, where he met Lorraine, a Catholic woman from the east coast of Ireland. They fell in love, married and moved to the seaside town of Bray, where they had their first son, Riyadh, two years later.</p> <p>At 16, he came out to his mother after she found gay porn on the family computer. She kept her son\u2019s secret from his father for nine months. \u201cShe was my shelter and my confidante,\u201d Riyadh says. She was also adept at making his sexuality the new normal. Driving around in the car together, she used to point to a good-looking man and ask: \u201cWould you?\u201d</p> <p>During this time, Riyadh\u2019s relationship with his father soured. \u201cI hated him for what he didn\u2019t already know,\u201d Riyadh says. Lorraine told her son to tell his father over dinner one evening. Riyadh wrote down \u201cI\u2019m gay\u201d on a piece of paper and handed it over. Sam was bewildered. \u201cMy head was like a washing machine,\u201d he says now. \u201cI was acting, pretending I was OK. I always try to fix things if something is broken.\u201d</p> <p>Now he couldn\u2019t find a fix. He decided on drastic action. \u201cI got up and sat in the back garden at 3am. My head was absolutely wrecked. I searched the house for tablets.\u201d He pauses, and his son asks him about those suicidal thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you not do it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find them.\u201d</p> <p>Riyadh was also in a terrible state. He worried that his father \u2013 whom he describes as \u201coutrageously heterosexual\u201d \u2013 would instigate an honour killing or arranged marriage, or force his son into gay conversion therapy. In his book, Riyadh frames this lightly, as his own \u201csuper-dramatic thinking\u201d. But he wasn\u2019t far off the mark: Sam\u2019s response was to put his faith and honour first.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"860b2f308200003e65c55d3dc4af40fdd463b4d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/860b2f308200003e65c55d3dc4af40fdd463b4d7/0_1022_3803_3289/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Riyadh (standing) and his father Sam Khalaf (seated), May 2019, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"865\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Wake up,\u2019 Riyadh\u2019s mother told his father. \u2018I know you love your son, so show your love.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Chilvers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI thought of family,\u201d Sam says, \u201cwhich is really stupid, because I left Iraq so long ago.\u201d He breaks down at this, upset by the conflict his son\u2019s confession exposed. Riyadh explains that his father spoke to a family member, and that it did not go well. \u201cThey asked, \u2018How come your son is like this? You should change him,\u2019\u201d continues Sam, still in tears. \u201cThey said we could help Riyadh: bring him to Syria and treat him there with conversion therapy.\u201d</p> <p>Then Riyadh\u2019s mother stepped in. \u201cLorraine said, \u2018Wake up,\u2019\u201d Sam recalls. \u201c\u2018I know you love your son, so show your love.\u2019\u201d She asked a neighbour who had two gay sons to talk to Sam. \u201cA lovely man,\u201d he says. \u201cAn absolute gentleman. He said, \u2018Look, son, the family is you. Forget about what they [the wider family] think.\u201d</p> <p>He decided to rebuild the relationship with his son. Riyadh and his younger brother had been raised in a multi-faith household: they were brought up Catholic, like their mother, but also attended mosque with their father at weekends. Now the family began to reassess their relationship with faith. They made a collective decision to stop practising religion altogether and redefine themselves as humanists.</p> <p>Riyadh stresses that he does not believe it\u2019s impossible to reconcile sexuality with faith. For his family, it was a simple decision. \u201cWe as a family found it quite easy to step away from all religion because we were never very faith-led in the first place.

      "bodyText": "Sam Khalaf and his son Riyadh used to call themselves the two musketeers. When Riyadh was growing up in Bray, south of Dublin, they were inseparable. Like twins or best friends, they say. So the Iraqi-born, Irish citizen remembers keenly the moment when he realised his eldest child had drifted from him. \u201cWe used to go everywhere together,\u201d 54-year-old Sam recalls. \u201cEvery weekend we\u2019d go to a tropical fish shop and pick out which koi carp to go into our pond. The first time Riyadh didn\u2019t come with me, he was about 15. And the lad who worked there said: \u2018Where\u2019s your mate?\u2019 I said, \u2018He\u2019s grown up now, he\u2019s out with his friends.\u2019 It was a shock to the system.\u201d The bigger shock was yet to come. Riyadh had stopped hanging out with his dad because he realised he was gay \u2013 a revelation he did not think his Muslim father, a garage owner with a passion for football and cars, would take well. He was right: it took him another year, and when Riyadh came out to his dad, Sam says it \u201ccame like a fast train, it hit me very hard. Those couple of words didn\u2019t register. I was going, \u2018Shit, is he? Fuck, fuck!\u2019\u201d The coming-out drama forms part of a new book by Riyadh, an Irish YouTuber and broadcaster, whose bright, conversational guide to being a young gay man \u2013 Yay! You\u2019re Gay! Now What? \u2013 offers salient advice on topics from gender identity to anal sex. There is also a necessary chapter written from the parents\u2019 perspective, by Sam and Riyadh\u2019s mother, Lorraine. We meet in Riyadh\u2019s flat in London. Both men are as candid as the book, particularly with each other. Riyadh, 28, recalls that he was flamboyant as a child. In his book, he writes that, \u201cI was king of the sissy boys, growing up. I loved running around the house in my mother\u2019s pink silk nightgown, black stilettos and anything I could find that sparkled.\u201d At seven, his father told him to start acting like a boy. \u201cI was worried he was too gentle, I needed to toughen him up,\u201d Sam says now. When Riyadh was in his early teens, in addition to hiking or fishing, his dad took him to karate. \u201cI thought, he was going to get the shit beaten out of him, so I wanted him to toughen up. I saw him as soft.\u201d Riyadh read this as a judgment. \u201cWe\u2019d been buddies so closely until that point and then, all of a sudden, I wasn\u2019t enough. I hadn\u2019t got enough masculinity in me to match what you saw as normal or acceptable,\u201d he says, addressing his father directly. \u201cI knew you were doing it because you were worried about my safety in the big, bad world. But it was damaging because I couldn\u2019t live up to the expectation. It wasn\u2019t me.\u201d Sam had toughed it out himself. Born in southern Iraq, he lived in Baghdad until 1982, when an error on a reissued birth certificate (three years were knocked off his age by mistake) gave him a window of time to escape the country before military service beckoned. \u201cFriends of mine lost arms and legs. Some died,\u201d he says of the Iraq-Iran war of the time. \u201cYou walked down every street, and there was a funeral.\u201d He had always hoped to go to Europe (\u201cI loved the way people could live freely\u201d) and on his second attempt he reached England, where he met Lorraine, a Catholic woman from the east coast of Ireland. They fell in love, married and moved to the seaside town of Bray, where they had their first son, Riyadh, two years later. At 16, he came out to his mother after she found gay porn on the family computer. She kept her son\u2019s secret from his father for nine months. \u201cShe was my shelter and my confidante,\u201d Riyadh says. She was also adept at making his sexuality the new normal. Driving around in the car together, she used to point to a good-looking man and ask: \u201cWould you?\u201d During this time, Riyadh\u2019s relationship with his father soured. \u201cI hated him for what he didn\u2019t already know,\u201d Riyadh says. Lorraine told her son to tell his father over dinner one evening. Riyadh wrote down \u201cI\u2019m gay\u201d on a piece of paper and handed it over. Sam was bewildered. \u201cMy head was like a washing machine,\u201d he says now. \u201cI was acting, pretending I was OK. I always try to fix things if something is broken.\u201d Now he couldn\u2019t find a fix. He decided on drastic action. \u201cI got up and sat in the back garden at 3am. My head was absolutely wrecked. I searched the house for tablets.\u201d He pauses, and his son asks him about those suicidal thoughts. \u201cWhy did you not do it?\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t find them.\u201d Riyadh was also in a terrible state. He worried that his father \u2013 whom he describes as \u201coutrageously heterosexual\u201d \u2013 would instigate an honour killing or arranged marriage, or force his son into gay conversion therapy. In his book, Riyadh frames this lightly, as his own \u201csuper-dramatic thinking\u201d. But he wasn\u2019t far off the mark: Sam\u2019s response was to put his faith and honour first. \u201cI thought of family,\u201d Sam says, \u201cwhich is really stupid, because I left Iraq so long ago.\u201d He breaks down at this, upset by the conflict his son\u2019s confession exposed. Riyadh explains that his father spoke to a family member, and that it did not go well. \u201cThey asked, \u2018How come your son is like this? You should change him,\u2019\u201d continues Sam, still in tears. \u201cThey said we could help Riyadh: bring him to Syria and treat him there with conversion therapy.\u201d Then Riyadh\u2019s mother stepped in. \u201cLorraine said, \u2018Wake up,\u2019\u201d Sam recalls. \u201c\u2018I know you love your son, so show your love.\u2019\u201d She asked a neighbour who had two gay sons to talk to Sam. \u201cA lovely man,\u201d he says. \u201cAn absolute gentleman. He said, \u2018Look, son, the family is you. Forget about what they [the wider family] think.\u201d He decided to rebuild the relationship with his son. Riyadh and his younger brother had been raised in a multi-faith household: they were brought up Catholic, like their mother, but also attended mosque with their father at weekends. Now the family began to reassess their relationship with faith. They made a collective decision to stop practising religion altogether and redefine themselves as humanists. Riyadh stresses that he does not believe it\u2019s impossible to reconcile sexuality with faith. For his family, it was a simple decision. \u201cWe as a family found it quite easy to step away from all religion because we were never very faith-led in the first place. We were, by default, following what we\u2019d been told to follow from a young age. My coming out was a catalyst for us to stand back and look at those beliefs and ask, \u2018Do they represent us as a family, or not?\u2019\u201d Riyadh asks his father if this was difficult for him. \u201cNo. No. As long as I\u2019m a nice person,\u201d Sam says. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m not going to hurt people or do bad things, I am just happy with that.\u201d Sam then cut ties with his wider family. \u201cThere is no relationship now. Because of Riyadh I have lost family members, but it is fine with me, honestly,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce my two boys, my wife and I are happy in our home, I don\u2019t care what is going to happen out on the street.\u201d Since Riyadh came out, Sam has been to gay clubs and on Pride marches and made new LGBTQ friends. But perhaps the most dramatic shift is in their relationship with each other: they are remarkably close, comfortable sharing anything. There was no hesitation on Sam\u2019s part when Riyadh asked him to help with the book. Riyadh\u2019s involvement in the marriage equality campaign in Ireland had been crucial: \u201cI could see my son going on the TV and radio, trying to help the Yes vote. You realise that he is actually saving lives and doing good. Now who wouldn\u2019t like something like this?\u201d Getting involved with his son\u2019s activism \u2013 appearing together in YouTube videos, on Irish television, in the book \u2013 was a no-brainer. \u201cThis book \u2013 even if it saves one life, it would be worth a great deal,\u201d Sam says. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to help stop one parent or one father like me from considering suicide, it\u2019s worth doing.\u201d The first LGBTQ event the Khalafs attended as a family was a Dublin rally for marriage equality in Ireland. \u201cWe were standing side by side.

With a full 23 players available \u2013 for the first time all tournament \u2013 such has been the Jekyll and Hyde nature of the Matildas\u2019 performances thus far there\u2019s a sense that we\u2019ve not yet seen the best this squad has to offer. For all his emphasis on the importance of Elise Kellond-Knight in the heart of his midfield, we\u2019re yet to see Milicic employ the technical No 6 in her preferred role. Should the 2015 World Cup All-Star team nominee start in the screening role it would trigger a domino effect, with Emily van Egmond possibly shifting further forward, leaving the impressive Chloe Logarzo and Tameka Yallop both fighting for one position. This internal competition \u2013 something sorely missing during recent matches where Australia boasted only one specialised fully-fit centre back \u2013 could be the key to overturning adverse psychological conditions surrounding this match. Win here though and the conditions in which the Matildas most thrive will present themselves. But first they have to get through Norway in Nice.",

The electorate is not cohesive at all. It\u2019s all over the shop.\u201d</p> <p>The second point goes to the heart of the Coalition arrangements around three-cornered contests. Is the Coalition ban disenfranchising voters by not offering choice in every election?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>\u201c[The Nationals] are very parochial about country seats, they see them as their birthright.\u201d</p> <footer> <cite>Serge Petrovich</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Serge Petrovich, the Liberals candidate for Mallee, says the National party has treated country seats as a \u201cbirthright\u201d.

      "bodyText": "It was passing strange that the last seat to be declared in the 2019 federal election was the Victorian seat Mallee, one of the safest held by the National party. Andrew Broad\u2019s old seat was eventually won by the Nationals candidate and sociologist, Anne Webster, but not before the party lost 28% of their primary vote to a Melbourne Cup field of 13 candidates. Webster won 66-34 on a two-party preferred basis, though that result belied the complex nature of the count. While Webster won 28% of the primary vote, Liberal candidate Serge Petrovich picked up 19%. Three independents Jason Modica (9%), Ray Kingston (9%) and Cecilia Moar (3%) won a total of 21% of the primaries, also putting a significant dent in the Coalition\u2019s vote. Broad first contested the seat in 2013 which is the last time the Liberals were allowed to run under the three-cornered contest rules. Then, candidate Chris Crewther picked up 27% of the primaries while Broad won 38%. So overall, the 2019 Coalition vote dropped on the last three-cornered contest though at that time, the tide was coming in for the Abbott election compared with the uphill battle and the Broad saga this time around. Webster puts the swing down to a large field, including a Liberal candidate and the hangover from the Broad scandal, which was raised by both voters and National party grass roots members. \u201cThere was disappointment in the National party itself, and questions about how we get over it among ordinary grass roots members early on,\u201d Webster said. \u201cThere was a history, that I was seeking to put behind us. The result also showed that people didn\u2019t want [Bill] Shorten and did want [Scott] Morrison, so we put a percentage down to that.\u201d There are two points to make about Mallee. Firstly, when offered choice, rural voters can shift, notwithstanding the result in New England that handed Barnaby Joyce a slight swing on 2016. \u201cThe idea that votes blindly go to Nats is wrong,\u201d says Kingston, a climate-concerned farmer from Yarriambiack. \u201cThe story is if there are credible alternatives that vaguely fit your world view, people will change. The electorate is not cohesive at all. It\u2019s all over the shop.\u201d The second point goes to the heart of the Coalition arrangements around three-cornered contests. Is the Coalition ban disenfranchising voters by not offering choice in every election? Serge Petrovich, the Liberals candidate for Mallee, says the National party has treated country seats as a \u201cbirthright\u201d. He has called for the Coalition agreement on three-cornered contests to be reviewed because he believes voters are being disenfranchised. Petrovich is a former policeman, a barrister, a former member of the party\u2019s administrative committee and a member the Liberal party for nearly 30 years. He was asked to run in Mallee after Andrew Broad retired in the wake of the sugar baby scandal. \u201cWe are definitely disenfranchising people,\u201d Petrovich said. \u201cAs a member of administrative committee, I did wonder whether the staunch Coalition rule that prevents three-cornered contests serves either of us well. \u201cI have [questioned the agreement] and others have, not necessarily to end the Coalition agreement or three-cornered rules, it\u2019s more about thinking carefully about the agreement.\u201d He said his interest stemmed from growing up in country Victoria near Bendigo even though he is no longer local. Petrovich believes that by banning either Coalition party from running against sitting members, local party infrastructure is denuded and members drift away, which means when there is an opportunity to stand, there are no longer the party volunteers to do so. \u201c[The Nationals] are very parochial about country seats, they see them as their birthright,\u201d he said. He suggested results showed Liberal voters return preferences to the Nationals but Nationals voters do not return the favour, often supporting other candidates over the Liberals to ensure seats are not locked up by the Liberals. \u201cThey spend a lot of time telling people they are not Libs,\u201d Petrovich said. \u201cIf the Libs go out, 80% of the Liberals\u2019 vote goes to the Nats, but the proportion of Nats vote to Liberals is only 30-40%.\u201d He said the Nationals were \u201cdirty as hell\u201d when the former Liberal MP Sharman Stone took the seat of Murray (renamed Nicholls at the last election) from the Nationals and then held it for 20 years before retiring in 2016. (It then went to the Nationals\u2019 Damian Drum.) \u201cWhen Sharman took that Nationals seats of Murray, the Nats members drifted away,\u201d said Petrovich. \u201cThey go to Lions or Probus or Rotary. Branch members are generally good community members, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same with Labor as well.\u201d Petrovich, who does a lot of legal work in the Mildura, watched the election of independent Ali Cupper on her third attempt in the state seat of Mildura. He said if the Liberals had been allowed to run, the Mildura Nationals MP Peter Crisp would have held it with the help of Liberal preferences but the seat fell to independent Ali Cupper, a former Labor candidate. \u201cOften if you\u2019ve got Labor and the Greens, it helps for us to have a running partner,\u201d said Petrovich. \u201cOtherwise it\u2019s everyone against the incumbent. It worked in the Nats\u2019 favour in Mallee. Peter Crisp would have won against Ali Cupper.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "President Trump responded to allegations from journalist E Jean Carroll that he had raped her in a dressing room by claiming he had never met her (despite pictures that prove the contrary) and raising questions about whether she was working with the Democratic Party. Cities braced for Trump\u2019s planned immigration raids, with mayors in many of the cities believed will be targeted Sunday coming out in support of their communities rather the federal government. President Trump sat down for an interview with Chuck Todd of \u201cMeet the Press\u201d to talk about his decision to call off the retaliatory strike against Iran. President Trump sat down for an interview with Chuck Todd of \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d talking about his decision to call off the retaliatory strike against Iran. \u201cI thought about it for a second and I said, you know what, they shot down an unmanned drone, plane, whatever you want to call it, and here we are sitting with a 150 dead people that would have taken place probably within a half an hour after I said go ahead,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t like it, I didn\u2019t think, I didn\u2019t think it was proportionate.\u201d New York Mayor Bill de Blasio retweeted this message in response to Trump\u2019s planned immigration raids: Here\u2019s Denver weighing in on this Sunday\u2019s planned immigration raids: Chicago responds to the planned immigration raids this Sunday: California, the self-fashioned \u201cresistance\u201d state, is on high alert following reports that President Trump has directed US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers to conduct a mass roundup of migrant families that have received deportation orders - an operation likely to start early Sunday. Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore told the Los Angeles Times that there are about 140 individuals targeted in Southern California. In his statement about E Jean Carroll, President Trump alluded to Julie Swetnick, one of the women who came forward during the confirmation process for Justice Brett Kavanaugh and accused him of inappropriate behavior. Here\u2019s a reminder of what went down all those months ago in Fall 2018. Dr Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez came forward to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct during his high school and college years in the early 1980s. In a sworn statement, Swetnick joined in on their allegations, accusing Kavanaugh and his friend, Mark Judge, of engaging in lewd behavior with young women at high school parties and placing drugs or alcohol in punch in order to inebriate women so they could be \u201cgang raped\u201d by other partygoers. She was excluded from the FBI investigation, but it was never determined why. The president claimed that Swetnick \u201cfalsely accused\u201d Kavanaugh. That has never been proven. What she has alleged also has never been proven - there had been no opportunity for her to do so. It\u2019s unclear why the president singled her out in all this. President Trump just issued a statement that he had never met E Jean Carroll, the journalist who accused him of assaulting her in a dressing room. Well. Here\u2019s a statement from President Trump, regarding the account of journalist and Elle advice columnist E Jean Carroll that Trump allegedly assaulted her in a dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store: \u201cRegarding the \u2018story\u2019 by E Jean Carroll, claiming she once encountered me at Bergdorf Goodman 23 years ago: I\u2019ve never met this person in my life. She is trying to sell a new book \u2014 that should indicate her motivation. It should be sold in the fiction section. \u201cShame on those who make up false stories of assault to try to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda \u2014 like Julie Swetnick who falsely accused Justice Brett Kavanaugh. It\u2019s just as bad for people to believe it, particularly when there is zero evidence. Worse still for a dying publication to try to prop itself up by peddling fake news \u2014 it\u2019s an epidemic. \u201cMs. Carroll and New York Magazine: No pictures? No surveillance? No video? No reports? No sales attendants around?? I would like to thank Bergdorf Goodman for confirming they have no video footage of any such incident because it never happened. \u201cFalse accusations diminish the severity of real assault. All should condemn false accusations and any actual assault in the strongest possible terms.\u201d \u201cIf anyone has information that the Democratic Party is working with Ms. Carroll or New York Magazine, please notify us as soon as possible. The world should know what\u2019s really going on. It is a disgrace and people should pay dearly for such false accusations.\u201d The Supreme Court ruled today that a white Mississippi prosecutor violated the Constitution by excluding black jurors from the sixth trial of Curtis Flowers, a black man who was convicted of killing four in 1996, the New York Times is reporting. Curtis Flowers was convicted and sentenced to death three times for the murders of four people in Mississippi furniture store. Each time, his conviction was overturned by the Mississippi Supreme Court, which found that the prosecutor, Doug Evans, used all 36 of his peremptory challenges to strike black potential jurors in those three trials. Flowers was tried twice more, but those cases ended in mistrial. The sixth trial resulted in his conviction in 2010, but the Supreme Court overturned that conviction today. \u201cThe state\u2019s actions in the first four trials necessarily inform our assessment of the state\u2019s intent going into Flowers\u2019s sixth trial,\u201d Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote. \u201cWe cannot ignore that history. We cannot take that history out of the case.\u201d The case got nationwide attention after it was covered by the In the Dark podcast. Hey there, Vivian Ho taking over for Lauren Gambino. Happy Friday, everybody. Presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard defends Joe Biden in a series of tweets calling out her rivals for criticizing him. It\u2019s been a busy day in Washington. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far: The US military was \u201ccocked and loaded\u201d to launch a retaliatory strike against Iran but Trump reversed course with minutes to spare after a general informed him the action would result in 150 deaths. Trump said the response was not \u201cproportionate\u201d to Iran\u2019s attack on an unmanned US drone. Missouri declined a license to the state\u2019s last remaining abortion clinic, leaving its fate in the hands of the courts. Journalist and advice columnist E Jean Carroll said she was sexually assaulted by Donald Trump in a department store dressing room more than two decades ago. He has been accused of harassment and misconduct by at least 16 women. US immigration officers are preparing to launch a wave of raids targeting migrant families in major US cities. Donald Trump has tweeted this video: More information is coming out about the immigration raids expected to begin on Sunday in major US cities. Apparently the first target will be Miami, where many of the 2020 candidates will be in town for the first presidential primary debate. California congresswoman Judy Chu is sharing advice for immigrants if they are swept up in the forthcoming raids. Republicans on Capitol Hill seem to have received some talking points: Harris has notched the high-profile endorsement of South Carolina organizer Bernice Scott ahead a jam-packed campaign weekend in the state. But in an interview with NBC ahead of Clyburn\u2019s fish fry on Friday night, the influential Democrat wonders why Harris isn\u2019t \u201csurging\u201d. NBC News\u2019s indefatigable Vaughn Hillyard sat down with Roy Moore, who is making a second run for the Senate in Alabama after he lost to Democrat Doug Jones amid a campaign marred by accusations of sexual misconduct with minors. Moore blames the Republican \u201cestablishment\u201d for influencing Trump\u2019s public request that he not run for Senate. Read more of their exchange here: There\u2019s a lot of candidates and only so many flights, but even so, what are the odds that Elizabeth Warren gets the seat directly behind Bernie Sanders? Calls for impeachment get louder as another swing district Democrat comes out in favor: The Washington Post is reporting that Trump has directed US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers to \u201cconduct a mass roundup of migrant families that have received deportation orders, an operation that is likely to begin with predawn raids in major US cities on Sunday.\u201d The report, based on interviews with three US officials with knowledge of the plans, said the raids are intended to target as many as 2,000 families in Houston, Chicago, Miami, Los Angeles and among other cities with a large migrant population. Trump revealed the operation in a tweet on Monday night that said US immigration agents were planning to make mass arrests starting \u201cnext week\u201d. According to the Post, Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan had pushed for a narrower operation that targeted a smaller number of families who had dropped out of the legal process. McAleenan also warned that the operation could result in more family separations if agents raid a home or workplace while the children are not there. Officials told the Post that agents would detain parents and children in hotel rooms until they the entire family can be deported together. House Judiciary chairman Jerry Nadler repeatedly referred to former White House aide Hope Hicks as \u201cMs. Lewandowski\u201d during a closed door hearing last week. The chairman told CNN it was an honest blunder and that he apparently hadn\u2019t meant to imply she was in a relationship with Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Hicks did not correct Nadler on the first two occasions but when he called her for a third time, \u201cMs. Lewandowski\u201d she interrupted him \u201cMy name is Ms. Hicks.\u201d Alyssa Farah, the spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence, called the error \u201csexist garbage\u201d. Texas governor Greg Abbott announced that the state will deploy 1,000 National Guard troops to the US-Mexico border. He said the troops will \u201cprovide assistance at temporary holding facilities\u201d in the Rio Grande Valley and El Paso and also help at ports of entry, according to the Texas Tribune. Meanwhile, Abbott said Texas will the federal government the bill for the entire cost of deploying 1,000 National Guard troops to the border. Prominent African American lawmakers are rallying to the defense of Joe Biden amid criticism over comments the former vice president made about working with Southern segregationist senators to underscore a point about civility in politics. Congressman John Lewis, a veteran of the civil rights movement, told reporters that he did not find Biden\u2019s remarks to be offensive. Congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, the House majority whip who is hosting the 2020 candidates this weekend in Columbia, said he too was forced to work with segregationist senators. \u201cIf I had only worked with people who opposed segregation, I never would have worked with people who were not my color,\u201d Clyburn said, who is 78 and was first elected to Congress at the age of 52. In his remarks, Biden said then-senator James Eastland of Mississippi, who once called black people \u201cflesh eaters,\u201d never called him a \u201cboy.\u201d The comment was denounced by several of the Democrats running for president, including senator Cory Booker, who called on him to apologize. The former vice president struck back: Apologize for what?\u201d he asked reporters, suggesting that it is Booker who should apologize. Biden called Booker later that evening to calm tensions. According to Politico, Biden didn\u2019t apologize but they had a polite conversation. That might have been the end of the story, but Biden\u2019s campaign further inflamed the issue by sending talking points to his campaign surrogates that highlighted his opponents work with controversial lawmakers and officials, including former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. (Booker testified against Sessions, then his colleague in the Senate, at his confirmation hearing.) \u201cI find it remarkable that the surrogate talking points they were sending around, as they were trying to contain this, include no mention of the language the vice president used and instead tried to spin that the vice president is being criticized for working with people he disagreed with,\u201d a Booker aide told Politico. \u201cThat\u2019s nonsense and speaks volumes to what they know is true, which is, he should be apologizing for what he said.\u201d In a cover story for New York magazine, published on Friday, journalist and Elle advice columnist E Jean Carroll recounts an incident more than two decades ago in which Donald Trump, then\u2013real-estate executive, allegedly assaulted her in a dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store. In late 1995 or early 1996, Carroll said Trump recognized her at the Bergdof Goodman in midtown Manhattan as \u201cthat advice lady\u201d. Trump told her that he was there to buy a gift for a \u201cgirl\u201d. She says Trump suggested a \u201clace bodysuit\u201d and urged her to try it on. When they reached the dressing rooms, she said Trump shoved her against the wall, pulled down her tights and \u201cforcing his fingers around my private area, thrusts his penis halfway \u2014 or completely, I\u2019m not certain \u2014 inside me.\u201d New York magazine confirmed that Carroll told two friends about the incident after it happened. One advised her to go to the police and the other said to forget the encounter, warning that his legal team would \u201cbury\u201d her. In the cover photo, Carroll is wearing the Donna Karan coat-dress that she had on that day, which she said \u201cstill hangs on the back of my closet door.\u201d It is the first time she has worn the dress since the incident. A senior White House official told the magazine in a statement, \u201cThis is a completely false and unrealistic story surfacing 25 years after allegedly taking place and was created simply to make the President look bad.\u201d Carroll is at least the 16th woman to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct. In the the piece, she describes a series of other episodes of assault, including one involving the former CEO of CBS, Les Moonves, who was forced out amid multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. A representative told New York that Moonves \u201cemphatically denies\u201d Carroll\u2019s allegation. Anticipating that she would be asked why she waited so long to come forward, Carroll writes: \u201cReceiving death threats, being driven from my home, being dismissed, being dragged through the mud, and joining the 15 women who\u2019ve come forward with credible stories about how the man grabbed, badgered, belittled, mauled, molested, and assaulted them, only to see the man turn it around, deny, threaten, and attack them, never sounded like much fun. Also, I am a coward.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was at the White House yesterday for a classified briefing in the Situation Room, said in a new statement on Friday: \u201cWe are in an extremely dangerous and sensitive situation with Iran. We must calibrate a response that de-escalates and advances American interests, and we must be clear as to what those interests are.\u201d During the meeting, Pelosi said Democratic leaders stressed to the president that \u201chostilities must not be initiated without the approval of Congress.\u201d \u201cWe have no illusions about the dangerous conduct of the Iranian regime,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis is a dangerous, high-tension situation that requires a strong, smart and strategic approach.\u201d This afternoon Trump will have lunch with secretary of state Mike Pompeo, just hours after he cancelled an airstrike against Iran. Pompeo is a former member of Congress and a staunch hawk on Iran. Read our latest coverage of the standoff between Washington and Iran. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has released a Summer Playlist on Spotify to mark the first day of the season, \u00e0 la Obama who started the tradition while in the White House. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer that we all need to find the time to dance, to sing and to bop our heads a little, so I\u2019m sharing the songs I\u2019m listening to in the car out on the campaign trail this summer,\u201d senator Harris told Bustle. \u201cWhether we\u2019re driving from Sacramento to Reno or Dubuque to Chicago, this playlist always lifts me up.\u201d The list, which her campaign said was \u201cpersonally curated\u201d by the Senator, includes songs by artists like Mary J. Blige, Cardi B, Lizzo, Kendrick Lamar and Nipsey Hussle. Listen here and let us know what you think. Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, yes, has a new plan. Her new plan would ban private prisons and detention facilities, prohibit contractors from charging service fees for essential services like phone calls, bank transfers and healthcare. \u201cHere\u2019s what this all comes down to,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe government has a basic responsibility to keep the people in its care safe \u2014 not to use their punishment as an opportunity for profit.\u201d Plan by plan, Warren has built moment \u2013 but is it enough to overcome the roadblocks posed by her chief rivals, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden? For the first time since the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Roe v Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, a US state may not have a single abortion clinic. Missouri on Friday rejected the license application of a Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis, which is the only remaining abortion provider in the state, according to the Kansas City Star. In a statement, Planned Parenthood action fund said the healthcare center has not yet been closed and is still providing abortions. \u201cThe preliminary injunction issued by the Missouri State Circuit Court remains in effect, so the fate of abortion access in Missouri now hangs in the balance until further notice from the court,\u201d the group said. Missouri is one of several states across the country where access to reproductive healthcare has been dramatically restricted since Trump appointee Brett Kavanaugh joined the Supreme Court, consolidating a conservative majority. Antiabortion activists are pushing a bevy of state laws and federal action designed to trigger a Supreme Court case that could dismantle Roe. This weekend, 20 of the 24 candidates running for the Democratic presidential nomination will participate in a first-of-its-kind forum on reproductive rights hosted by Planned Parenthood Action Fund in South Carolina. \u201cThis is really the moment for the candidates to make clear where they stand on the full range of reproductive healthcare, including abortion,\u201d said Kelley Robinson, the group\u2019s executive director told the Guardian. \u201cWhoever wants to lead the United States and serve in the office of the president is going to have to be clear and accountable to voters on this issue.\u201d Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, it\u2019s business as usual ... which is to say more subpoenas related to Trump\u2019s association with Russia. The House intelligence committee on Friday said it will subpoena Moscow-born business executive Felix Sater after he did not appear for a scheduled interview Friday. Who is Felix Sater, you might be asking yourself. Let us refresh your memory. The Supreme Court on Friday overturned the murder conviction of a Mississippi man on death row in a case about the role of race in jury selection. According to the Washington Post, the court \u201cthrew out the most recent conviction of a Mississippi man who has been tried an extraordinary six times for a quadruple murder in 1996, finding that a zealous prosecutor once again had improperly kept African Americans off the jury.\u201d The inmate, Curtis Flowers, who is black, argued that the jury selection in his case violated the Constitution. The prosecutor, District Attorney Doug Evans, is white. Democrats are alarmed by the escalation and warned the White House that only Congress has the power to authorize war. (This power has been steadily undermined by the executive branch since the attacks on 9/11. ) And 2020 presidential candidates were quick to weigh in. Former vice president Joe Biden called Trump\u2019s approach to Iran a \u201cself-inflicted disaster\u201d. Senator Bernie Sanders stayed on message, reminding voters that it \u201cwon\u2019t be the kids of billionaires who get killed in a war with Iran.\u201d (Sanders led the charge in Congress to claw back war-making powers from the executive branch. Trump vetoed the resolution.) Senator Kamala Harris said Trump\u2019s \u201csaber-rattling\u201d was making the US \u201cweaker and less safe\u201d. Senator Elizabeth Warren reminded Trump of his promise to stop \u201cendless wars\u201d. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, whose running for president to \u201cbend the arc of history away from war and toward peace\u201d, said she doubts Trump can resist war with Iran ... and also please contribute to my fledgling campaign. More details are emerging about the dramatic moments leading up to Trump\u2019s decision not to launch strikes against three sites in Iran. Reuters reported that Trump sent Tehran a warning that a \u201cUS attack on Iran was imminent\u201d but stressing that he did not want to escalate the standoff and preferred to launch talks on a range of issues. \u201cIn his message, Trump said he was against any war with Iran and wanted to talk to Tehran about various issues,\u201d an Iranian official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe gave a short period of time to get our response but Iran\u2019s immediate response was that it is up to Supreme Leader (Ayatollah Ali) Khamenei to decide about this issue.\u201d A second Iranian official told the agency: \u201cWe made it clear that the leader is against any talks, but the message will be conveyed to him to make a decision. \u201cHowever, we told the Omani official,\u201d who delivered the message from the US, \u201cthat any attack against Iran will have regional and international consequences.\u201d Trump has confirmed that the US military was \u201ccocked and loaded\u201d to launch retaliatory strikes against Iran on Thursday night but pulled with just 10 minutes to spare after a general was informed him that \u201c150 people\u201d would die. He said such an action was \u201cnot proportionate\u201d to Iran\u2019s attack on an unarmed US done. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of what is already a busy day in Washington DC, where nerves are jittery and tensions are high after news broke over night that the Donald Trump had \u201capproved military strikes against Iran in retaliation for downing an American surveillance drone, but pulled back from launching them on Thursday night,\u201d according to the New York Times. The paper reported, citing an unnamed official that: \u201cPlanes were in the air and ships were in position, but no missiles had been fired when word came to stand down.\u201d \u201cIt was not clear whether Mr. Trump simply changed his mind on the strikes or whether the administration altered course because of logistics or strategy,\u201d write Michael Shear, Eric Schmitt, Michael Crowley, and Maggie Haberman. \u201cIt was also not clear whether the attacks might still go forward.\u201d Trump, however, is at the moment occupied by a longtime grievance against the paper. Elsewhere, nearly all of the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls will head to South Carolina tonight for the state\u2019s annual Blue Palmetto Dinner and congressman Jim Clyburn\u2019s \u201cWorld Famous Fish Fry\u201d. Both events will give Democrats running for the party\u2019s presidential nomination an opportunity to woo influential party members and local officials whose endorsements could boost their odds in the \u201cfirst in the South\u201d primary.",
