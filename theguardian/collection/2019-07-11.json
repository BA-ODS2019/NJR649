Enzo Franchini Oliveros is accused over the death of Orlando Jos\u00e9 Figuera, 21, who was beaten, stabbed, doused in petrol and set on fire during street clashes on 20 May 2017. Franchini was arrested on Monday in a town near Madrid, according to a Spanish national police spokesperson. Venezuela\u2019s top prosecutor, Tarek William Saab, made the arrest public on Wednesday, accusing Franchini of crimes including \u201cattempted murder and terrorism\u201d. Protests against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro rocked Venezuela for several months in 2017, prompting a brutal response from security forces. More than 130 people died in the unrest and thousands were injured \u2013 most of them anti-government protesters caught in the crackdown. Venezuela\u2019s government has insisted Figuera was the victim of a political hate crime, who was targeted for supporting the government. But the country\u2019s top chief prosecutor at the time of the incident, Luisa Ortega D\u00edaz, concluded that Figuera was stabbed after an altercation over a job application. Figuera\u2019s assailant then accused him of being a thief; he was beaten, doused with petrol and set alight. Ortega now lives in exile, having broken with Maduro\u2019s government in August that year. The conditions that led to the 2017 protests continue today, as Maduro fends off challenges to his power from opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, who is recognised as the legitimate leader by the US and most of the world\u2019s democracies. The United Nations\u2019 refugee agency estimates that 4 million Venezuelans have left the country to escape food shortages, insecurity and economic collapse. Last week, the UN\u2019s human rights chief accused Maduro\u2019s security forces of committing a series of \u201cgross violations\u201d against Venezuelan dissenters, including more than 5,000 extrajudicial executions.",

      "bodyText": "Faced with a defeat in court and few viable options, Donald Trump on Thursday backed off his effort to place a question about citizenship on the next US census while announcing executive action by his administration to collect information on its own. Trump ordered federal agencies to turn over records on the number of citizens, non-citizens and undocumented immigrants living in the US. \u201cThe only people that are not proud to be citizens are the ones who are fighting us all the way about the word \u2018citizen\u2019,\u201d Trump said in the Rose Garden. Legal advocates have vowed to fight any executive action on the census in court. The executive order, released on Thursday evening, directs government agencies, including the state department and several agencies in the department of homeland security, to provide records relating to citizenship to the commerce department. It also ordered the establishment of an interagency working group to improve access to administrative records. The order argued the administration needs data on the number of citizens and non-citizens in the country to re-evaluate immigration policy, implement and evaluate policy, including concerning benefits and generate a \u201cmore reliable\u201d count of the number of people living in the country undocumented.

Despite having been appointed when Hillary Clinton was thought likely to win the presidency, Darroch threw himself into courting Trump\u2019s inner circle, \u201cflooding the zone\u201d of people in Trump\u2019s orbit, hoping to gain influence through showing up and cultivating contacts. He also worked hard to court well-connected American journalists so he could benefit from their insights.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In July 2019, Darroch resigned as ambassador, after a series of leaked diplomatic messages revealed that he had described the administration as \"inept\" and \"clumsy\". This led to a vocal Twitter outburst from Trump. Darroch could never have imagined that his distinguished 40-year diplomatic career would end with a US president publicly volleying insults&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/09/donald-trump-calls-theresa-may-foolish-as-diplomatic-row-escalates\">his way, calling him \u201ca very stupid guy\u201d, \u201cwacky\u201d and \u201cpompous fool\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason\"><b>Rowena Mason</b></a>&nbsp;<i>in London</i> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith\"><b>David Smith</b></a>&nbsp;<i>in Washington</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Asked why he had been less willing to offer such clear public backing before Darroch felt moved to resign, Johnson said: \u201cI must say that I think there has certainly been an attempt to politicise this issue and to take the career prospects of Sir Kim and turn them into an issue in the Conservative leadership contest. I notice that.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat I will say is that I don\u2019t think that should happen and, as I said in the debate, I don\u2019t think that issues of personnel in our civil service should become footballs in political conversations and just as the advice that civil servants give to ministers should be sacrosanct and ministers should not reveal it and should not betray it.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the background, there is also a fierce wrangle over who should replace Darroch in Washington and, crucially, whether the decision should be taken by May or her successor.</p> \n<p>At an urgent Commons question about the affair, a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/11/tory-mps-condemn-boris-johnson-over-kim-darroch-resignation\">Tory MPs lined up to criticise Johnson</a>, who repeatedly refused to back Darroch after Trump insulted the ambassador <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/09/donald-trump-calls-theresa-may-foolish-as-diplomatic-row-escalates\">in a series of tweets</a> and said he would no longer deal with him.</p> \n<p>One Conservative backbencher, David Morris, said Johnson, a former foreign secretary, should make a formal apology to parliament. \u201cDo you not feel that it is incumbent on every member of parliament in this place to back up our excellent diplomats and civil servants, and the honourable member for Uxbridge should come to the house and apologise?\u201d he asked.</p> \n<p>Adding to the likely discomfort of the Johnson camp, the Foreign Office minister tasked with responding to the urgent question was Sir Alan Duncan, who had the day before accused Johnson of throwing Darroch \u201cunder the bus\u201d.</p> \n<p>Johnson has praised Darroch but stayed otherwise silent after declining several times during a Tory leadership TV debate on Tuesday night to offer support, something friends of Darroch said was a key element in the ambassador\u2019s decision to resign the next day.</p> \n<p>One of Johnson\u2019s leading allies, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, spoke up for him on Thursday, telling a journalists\u2019 lunch that while she did not like overseas leaders such as Trump \u201cslagging off\u201d the UK, she agreed with the US president\u2019s criticism of May\u2019s Brexit deal.</p> \n<p>On the timing for appointing a new ambassador, Truss predicted this would take months and so it would be a job for the next prime minister.</p> \n<p>On Thursday evening, Johnson talked up the importance of the maintaining a working relationship with Washington, but insisted that there were circumstances in which he would publicly criticise Trump.</p> \n<p>He pointed to his response to Trump\u2019s claim in 2015 that some parts of London were \u201cso radicalised that police are afraid for their own lives\u201d. At the time, Johnson noted, he had replied that the \u201conly reason I wouldn\u2019t go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump\u201d.</p> \n<p>That came after other Tories had been openly critical of him. During the urgent question, one Conservative MP, Roger Gale, told the Commons: \u201cThe failure of the former foreign secretary to leap to the defence of Sir Kim shows a lack of leadership that is lamentable.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, was less direct, but made his feelings known, saying the loss of Darroch after Trump\u2019s comments amounted to the UK being bullied.</p> \n<p>Tugendhat said the government should \u201calways stand up for those we send abroad, military or civilian, and will back them to the point that is necessary in the interests of the British people, and no one else\u201d.</p> \n<p>The only support for Johnson in parliament came from the veteran Tory backbencher Peter Bone, who said: \u201cThe attacking of colleagues is completely wrong and people should be ashamed of themselves when they\u2019ve done that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The urgent question was tabled by Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden, who said the decision of Darroch to resign, despite having the full support of Theresa May and her cabinet, was \u201ca dark moment for our democracy and for the standing of the United Kingdom\u201d.</p> \n<p>McFadden said Johnson\u2019s lack of support for the envoy was \u201can appalling abandonment of someone in the firing line\u201d. He added: \u201cReal leaders protect their people, they don\u2019t throw them to the wolves because they can sniff a prize for themselves. His actions are a chilling warning of what is to come if he becomes prime minister.\u201d</p> \n<p>Duncan said he would not be responding to such views on Johnson: \u201cI hope the house will understand if I hold back today from making any further comment on the right honourable friend the member for Uxbridge. I said enough yesterday to make my position entirely clear.\u201d</p> \n<p>Duncan nonetheless managed to reiterate his condemnation of Johnson several times in ways varying from the coded to the open. Responding to one question, he replied: \u201cIt is everyone\u2019s duty, and everyone in this house\u2019s duty, to defend our ambassadors. They are our ambassadors doing our duty. If they do something terribly wrong or break all the rules, that\u2019s altogether different.\u201d</p> \n<p>Duncan later drew laughter after the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Jo Swinson, cited his description of Johnson\u2019s actions as \u201cthe behaviour of an utter wimp\u201d. \u201cI seem to recall that was one of the kinder words I used yesterday,\u201d he told MPs, adding: \u201cI think what I would rather do is concentrate on the specific details of the question put, the merits of Sir Kim Darroch rather than the \u2026 merits of anyone else.\u201d</p> \n<p>Predictions about who will fill the role have already begun, with names mentioned including Sir Mark Sedwill, the head of the civil service.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b0115b8b-d38a-4720-a024-170cb8bcfed3\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Sir Mark Sedwill became Britain\u2019s most powerful civil servant in autumn 2018, after it became clear that predecessor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/04/lord-heywood-of-whitehall-obituary\">Sir Jeremy Heywood</a> was terminally ill.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Hunt has implored British diplomats to continue \u201cspeaking truth to power and standing up for British interests\u201d as the fallout from the resignation of the UK ambassador to Washington became a key battleground in the fight to succeed Theresa May. In a message to all Foreign Office staff that will be seen as a coded rebuke to Boris Johnson, Hunt praised the departing ambassador, Sir Kim Darroch, hailing him and his diplomatic colleagues as \u201cthe best of Britain\u201d. \u201cThe twin roles you perform of speaking truth to power and standing up for British interests have never been more vital,\u201d wrote Hunt, the foreign secretary, on Thursday. \u201cPlease keep speaking up without fear or favour, remembering that the UK government alone will determine appointments based on our national interest alone.\u201d He added: \u201cI want you to know that you will always get all the support you need to carry out your vital work. I will ensure you get it.\u201d The reassuring missive was released after a day in which Johnson, the clear favourite to become the new prime minister, faced intense criticism from Conservative party colleagues over his perceived abandonment of Darroch. At a Tory leadership hustings on Thursday evening, Johnson claimed he fully supports Darroch, despite his previous repeated public refusals to do so. He told the audience: \u201cI rang Kim, I think yesterday, and said how much I regretted his resignation, which indeed I do. He, I think, was the victim of a very unpleasant stunt by somebody who tried to \u2013 and succeeded in \u2013 leaking his confidential diptels [diplomatic communications], which are intended to guide ministers and the government about his thoughts about what\u2019s going on in Washington. \u201cAnd I think it was absolutely disgraceful that those diptels were leaked and I think it is vital \u2013 and as I said to Kim and I say to everybody \u2013 that all our civil servants, all great ambassadors such as Sir Kim, should feel free to speak without fear or favour to their political masters and then it is up to their political masters to decide what to do with it. And I think whoever leaked that, those diptels, deserves to be hunted down and prosecuted.\u201d Asked why he had been less willing to offer such clear public backing before Darroch felt moved to resign, Johnson said: \u201cI must say that I think there has certainly been an attempt to politicise this issue and to take the career prospects of Sir Kim and turn them into an issue in the Conservative leadership contest.

      "bodyText": "The wealthy San Francisco residents who launched a crowdfunding campaign to block construction of a new homeless shelter in their waterfront neighborhood are employing a new tactic: arguing that homeless people are bad for the environment. In a lawsuit filed against the city of San Francisco and the California State Lands Commission, the residents called for the project to undergo an environmental review before breaking ground. \u201cThis project will have a significant effect on the environment due to these unusual circumstances, including by attracting additional homeless persons, open drug and alcohol use, crime, daily emergency calls, public urination and defecation, and other nuisances,\u201d the lawsuit states. Opponents of infrastructure and affordable housing projects often call upon the California Environmental Quality Act as a stalling ploy to delay construction. The law requires developers to explore any environmental effects a project might have, and take steps to reduce them. Attorneys for the residents, paid for by the more than $102,000 raised through the GoFundMe campaign, argued in the lawsuit that the project did not undergo a full environmental review process. The city has argued that the project \u2013 a 200-bed temporary homeless shelter \u2013 is exempt was from such reviews. \u201cI question if this a legitimate concern or a last-ditch attempt to block the shelter by any means necessary,\u201d said Kelley Cutler, the human rights organizer for the Coalition on Homelessness. \u201cMethane emissions are bad for the environment, and this smells like bullshit.\u201d The residents\u2019 fight against this homeless shelter comes as San Francisco\u2019s homeless population surged, with city officials tallying more than 8,000 during the last homeless count. More than 1,400 wait for temporary shelter spots to open up each night, and the city has promised to increase the number of shelter beds by 1,000. Homelessness in San Francisco has reached the level of a humanitarian crisis, fueled in part by the tech boom supercharging the housing market. Opponents of the shelter have long said that their ultimate concern is public safety, a point that homeless rights advocates have argued was bigoted and dehumanizing. In addition to the environmental concerns, the lawsuit states that the project is \u201clikely to decrease the fair market value\u201d for any future projects in that location. The city is reviewing the lawsuit, said John Cot\u00e9, a spokesman for the city attorney Dennis Herrera, but the project has already undergone all required environmental review and the Board of Supervisors has denied several appeals under the California Environmental Quality Act. \u201cSan Francisco has a homeless crisis on its hands,\u201d Cot\u00e9 said. \u201cThe city is ready to put roofs over people\u2019s heads and get them indoors. Others are filing baseless lawsuits to keep people out in the cold. Rather than trying to shift the problem to someone else\u2019s backyard, everyone needs to do their part.\u201d",

As for Madagascar, they make a single change, Ilaimaharitra returning to the mifield following suspension.</p> <p><strong>Madagascar</strong>: Adrien; M\u00e9tanire, Razakanantenaina, Fontaine, Mombris; Amada, Anicet, Nomenjanahary; Andriatsima, Carolus, Lalaina.</p> <p><strong>Tunisia</strong>: Hassen; Kechrida, Bronn, Meriah, Haddadi; Chaalali, Skhiri, Sassi; Khazri, Msakni, Khenissi</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong>: A Alioum (Cameroon) &amp; Var </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d2785918f08cf92bb76e236\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-11T18:54:14.490Z\">7.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Algeria 1-1 Ivory Coast (4-3 on pens) Algeria advance to the semi-final</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>They will play the Super Eagles of Nigeria.

We are gathered here today to see whether Madagascar can spring yet another wonderful surprise. The team who began this tournament ranked 108<sup>th</sup> in the world have lit up the show with a marvellous spirit, canny defending and vibrant attacking. They\u2019ve been beautiful! Today, Tunisia stand in their way. </p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who we\u2019re up against, we\u2019re not worried about that!\u201d blared Malgasy midfielder Lalaina \u201cBolida\u201d Nomejanahary by way of preview for this match. \u201cWe approach every game with a winning mentality.\u201d That\u2019s the spirit! Still, let\u2019s remind ourselves of what Tunisia (world ranking: 25) will be bringing to this party. Far more experience than Madagascar, for a start, but also some nimble tricksters and a more open disposition than is suggested by a record of four draws from four matches so far. Youssef Msakni, Wahbi Khazri and Naim Sliti have not been at their best so far in this tournament (and Khazri and Sliti did not start the last game) but if they get it together, they could lead Madagascar on a merry dance. Both these teams are technically slick and fond of open and enterprising games so this could be a belter. Senegal will be paying close attention because they will meet the winner in the semi-final. You, too, should tune in. It\u2019s on! At 8pm BST.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-11T17:58:36.316Z\">at 6.58pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Madagascar glorious run reaches an emphatic end, as Tunisia deservedly advance to a semi-final showdown with Senegal. After an evenly-balanced first half Alain Giresse\u2019s men needed a big stroke of luck to to break the deadlock early in the second, after which the islanders did not look like recovering, though they tried valiantly. A couple of quality goals crowned a happy evening for Tunisia. They will go into the semi-final with fresh confidence. Madagascar will go home as heroes. Tunisia kill the game on the counter after a Malagasay corner. Khazri drew the last defender before slipping in Sliti, who dinked it past Adrien and into the net. 89 min: Amada sends over a freekick from the let as Madagascar seek a consolation goal. But Tunisian defenders aren\u2019t the sentimental type and they bang the ball back down the other end of the pitch. 87 min: Nicolas Dupuis continues to bestride the sideline. He and his team will leave this tournament with their heads held high. They\u2019ve brought joy. Next stop for the manager? Back to Fr\u00e9jus in the French second division. 85 min: Anicet booked for a comping into Khenssi in the centre circle. 82 min: Madagascar are drifting towards the exit, but through no lack of effort or rigour. They\u2019ve been undone by a slice of awful luck and the absence of creative sharpness up front. Tunisia substitution: Aouadhi on, Sassi off Madagascar substitution: Njiva on, Ihlamaharitra off. 80 min: Lovely interplay by Tunisia releases Haddadi. but adrien runs out to confront him, making a good save to prevent the left-back from making it 3-0. 78 min: Mombris goes down after copping Khazri\u2019s elbow in the mush. That\u2019s going to make Madagascar\u2019s defeat all the more painful in the morning. \u201cI do not know to what ends, sinister or not, you want to know President Andry Rajoelina\u2019s twitter account, but it is here https://twitter.com/se_rajoelina,\u201d reveals Kari Tulinius. Don\u2019t worry, I have no intention of being an abusive blowhard on twitter, I just wanted to see if he\u2019s anything like that (other president). Sure enough, he\u2019s not. Tunisia substitution: Drager on, Chaaleli off. 72 min: Tunisia are happy to let Madagascar have the ball around mid-way, confident the islanders won\u2019t find the ingenuity required to infiltrate a generally well-drilled defence. Madagascar need inspiration from somewhere... 69 min: Meriah fails to cut out a long ball forward, and that gives Andrea a chance to run on to it and into the box. Meriah charges back in a self-rescue bid and does enough to put off the attacker, who flings himself to the ground in a desperate bid for a penalty. Not in a million years. 66 min: Up in the VIP box, the Malagasy president, so jubilant at previous matches, looks thoroughly peeved. Anyone know if he uses twitter? Tunisia substitution: Sliti on, Msakni on. The captain, who is a yellow card away from suspension, can start resting up for the semi-final against Senegal. Unless Madagascar can spring their biggest shock yet ... Madagascar substitutions: Morel and Voavy on, Razak and Lalaina off. 63 min: There\u2019s renewed urgency to the way Madagascar are passing now but Tunisia have their measure. They keep them at bay cannily an step in to steal the ball at the first opportunity. Tunisia stream through them again. Adrien parries an 18-yard shot from Khazri but Msanki pounces on the rebound, glides last one defender and places the ball in the bottom corner despite falling as he shoots. Nice goal. The dream is dying for Madagascar. 58 min: Another vicious delivery by Khazri. Lalaina heads it clear for a corner on the far side. In fairness to Madagascar, they have dealt with those well so far, unlike in previous games. They back up that point by heading Khazri\u2019s latest attempt clear, too. 55 min: Madagascar are having more of the ball now and looking keenly for openings, but Tunisia are being real stingy. The islanders have 35 minutes to find a way to make them give up their lead. 53 min: Khazri curls a vicious inswinging freekick from the left. Adrien punches it to safety. Terrible misfortune for Madagascar! A tame shot by Sassi from the edge of the area takes a huge deflection off Fontaine\u2019s backside and spins past the nonplussed keeper. 50 min: A fine crossfield ball finds Mombris on the left. He curls in a lovely delivery. Andriatsima stoops to try to get his head on it but misses, and the ball flies across the face of goal and out of play on the far side. 47 min: GOAL? Tunisia are celebrating after Khazri takes down a long pass and stabs the ball past the keeper. The officials seem set to allow it but eventually decide to consult Var, which reveals, as expected, that Khazri was a couple of yards offside. 46 min: We go again. Tunisia resume their patient building. It\u2019s been tidy, tense and not nearly as open as hoped. Senegal are no closer to knowing who they will face in the semi-final. Something has go to give in the sometime, possibly in the second half, which is coming right up... 45+1 min: A feint and a dart from Msakni and then a dinky shot from 23 yards. But straight at the Adrien. 44 min: Amada tries to replicate his stunning goal against DR Congo but doesn\u2019t catch the ball as sweetly this time. Still, his drive bounces just in front of Hassen and demands a save. 43 min: A 25-yards snapshot from Chalaali forces Adrien to plunges to hist left and tip it around the post! The replay shows it was going just wide but the keeper was taking no chances. 41 min: Kechrida races down the right, injecting speed into a patient buildup. Then he pings a low cross to the near post. Khenissi beats the defender to it and tries to flip it into the net, but finds only the sidenetting. 38 min: Tunisia are having most of the play now, and a lot of it in the Madagascan half. But the underdogs are making it very tough for them to pick a way through. 35 min: Msakni dodges his way between two defenders in the box and then goes down theatrically. Thank fig he doesn\u2019t get a penalty for that. 34 min: M\u00e9tanire hasn\u2019t found his crossing range yet. But his latest overhit effort nearly catches out the keeper, who has to backpedal frantically before realising it\u2019s going to drift over his bar. 33 min: Khazri whips the ball over the wall and towards the top corner ... but Adrien gets both hands on it and pushes it out for a corner. Andriatsima clears that at the near post. 32 min: Dangere here. Raak hauls down Msakni to concede a freekick just outside the D. That\u2019s Khazri territory... 30 min: More top defending, this time by Meriah, who eased Andriatsima off the ball in the Tunisian box before carrying it clear. 29 min: Fontaine rushes over to the left to cut out a ball that Khazri looked like collecting. Top covering by the centreback. 27 min: Nifty fee by Khazri at the edge of the Malagasy box. After dancing past two, however, he is crowded out. Madagascar sure do make teams work hard for room in open play. 25 min: Alain Giresse was a wonderful player, but I\u2019m not seeing what he has brought to this Tunisian team... 22 min: Tunisia usually have most of the possession but Madagascar have passed the ball better than them so far: they are more in tune with each other, and slicker. Not by much, however. 19 min: The ref allows play to continue after Mombirs is chopped down. The ball runs through to Andriatsima, who has a go from an improbable angle 18 yards out. He finds the target but his shot never looked likely to beat the keeper. 17 min: Freekick to Madagascar 30 yards out and central. Tunisia put up a three-man wall, and Fontaine rams it into them. 16 min: M\u00e9tanire bombs down the right but then botches his cross. 14 min: Mskani fizzes a low pass from the let to Sassi, who takes it beautifully at the edge of the area, spinning past his marker with one artful touch and then bending a shot just beyond the far post. 12 min: Tunisia are starting to find their patient passing rhythm. Madagascar are chasing them diligently, hunting for a chance to launch one of their buccaneering counter-attacks. 10 min: Bad defending setpieces has been Madagascar\u2019s one glaring weakness in this tournament so far, but they have just dealt admirably with a dangerous corner from Khazri. 8 min: Khenissi tumbles in the box under a strong challenge by Razak. No foul. 7 min: Madagascar work Mombris into a crossing position down the left. He picks out Lalaina beyond the far post, but Lalaina can\u2019t beat two defenders to get off a shot. Still, that was a nice move: there\u2019s real crispness to Madagascar\u2019s play. 5 min: Andriatsima, willing as always, recovers a lofted pass into the channel and then spins and looks for support. It arrives fast but a bit too eagerly - freekick to Tunisia at the edge of their own area. 3 min: It\u2019s been an encouragingly brisk start, with both teams eager to moved forward with tidiness and speed. For a moment Chalali had a shooting opportunity from 20 yards but he hesitated and that was enough for the ever-dynamic Malgasy to close him down. 1 min: And they\u2019re off! Tunisia, clad all in white, get the game going at a promising pace. So let\u2019s have a recap of the lineups. The first thing to note is that Hassen starts in goal for Tunisia, having been forgiven for the strop he threw after being replaced just before the shootout in the last game, against Ghana. Khazri is also brought back into the starting XI after impressing off the bench in that game. As for Madagascar, they make a single change, Ilaimaharitra returning to the mifield following suspension. Madagascar: Adrien; M\u00e9tanire, Razakanantenaina, Fontaine, Mombris; Amada, Anicet, Nomenjanahary; Andriatsima, Carolus, Lalaina. Tunisia: Hassen; Kechrida, Bronn, Meriah, Haddadi; Chaalali, Skhiri, Sassi; Khazri, Msakni, Khenissi Referee: A Alioum (Cameroon) &amp; Var They will play the Super Eagles of Nigeria. Before that, Madagascar and Tunisia are about to get it on in the last of the quarter-finals. stay tuned! MISS! Serey Die hits the exact same spot of the post as Belaili did - and that spells victory for Algeria! MISS! Belaili kisses the ball and then smacks it against the butt of the post! A reprieve for the Elephants! Algeria 4-3 Ivory Coast GOAL! Gradel rams it into the net Algeria 4-3 Ivory Coast GOAL! Ounas rifles into the bottom corner. Algeria 4-2 Ivory Coast SAVE! Bony\u2019s tame shot is beaten away by Rais Algeria 3-2 Ivory Coast GOAL! Delort nets in style though Gbohouo went the right way. Algeria 3-2 Ivory Coast GOAL! Cornet sidefoots it past the keeper, who went the other way. Algeria 2-2 Ivory Coast GOAL! Slimani sends the keeper the wrong way. Algeria 2-1 Ivory Coast GOAL! Kessie does the business coolly Algeria 1-1 Ivory Coast GOAL! Bensebaini\u2019s shot creeps into the bottom corner via the goalkeper\u2019s hands and a post! Algeria 1-0 Ivory Coast Algeria win the toss and choose to take the first penalty ... ET 120+3: Delort does take the freekick ... and he curls it around the wall and just wide! A fine effort. But we\u2019re headed to a shootout ... ET 120+1 min: Before the freekick can be taken Algeria introduce Delort for Feghouli, presumably just in case this does go to penalties. Or maybe he\u2019s going to take the free? ET 120 min: Comora dives late into a tackle on Ounas, the player who was introduced for Mahrez. The defender gets a booking and Algeria get a freekick right at the edge of the area. Can they win it now and spare themselves a shootout? ET 116 min: Gradel swings in a freekick from the left. Comara leaps high but heads higher, sending the ball over from eight yards. ET 113 min: This is a good spell by Algeria. Some tidy interplay down the left culminates with Bennacer hanging up a useful cross for Zeffane, who nods wide under pressure. ET 111 min: Slimani runs on a delicious cross to power a header towards the far corner, but Gbohuou denies him with a super save! ET 108: Ivory Coast have been the better side in extra-time. Mahrez, since you ask, was withdrawn in the 86th minute. ET 106 min: Cornet has been excellent since his introduction and has just skinned Benlamru down the left before flashing the ball across the face of goal. A defender nearly turned it into his own goal but was relieved to see it squirm past the post for a corner. The teams are in for Madagascar-Tunisia. Behold: Madagascar: Adrien; M\u00e9tanire, Razakanantenaina, Fontaine, Mombris; Amada, Anicet, Nomenjanahary; Andriatsima, Carolus, Lalaina. Tunisia: Hassen; Kechrida, Bronn, Meriah, Haddadi; Chaalali, Skhiri, Sassi; Khazri, Msakni, Khenissi. ET 105 min: An Ivorian corner provokes a kinghell stramash in the Algerian box, and Zeffane clears off the line! There was also what looked like a handball by Feghouli but Var is not being consulted. So Algeria make it to half-time in extra-time on level terms. ET 102 min: Bennacer curls a freekick beyond the far post and there\u2019s Slimani, racing on to it at speed. But from a difficult angle he can\u2019t direct his first-time shot on target. ET 100 min: Slimani is putting himself about up front for Algeria but they haven\u2019t been able to provide him with a clear chance yet. ET 7 min: The Ivorian subs almost make the desired impact, as Bony and Cornet combine before Guedioura flings himself in front of the latter\u2019s shot to save Algeria! Var checks to see whether it hit his hand but it didn\u2019t. From the resultant corner, Cornet goes close again, chipping just over from the edge of the area. ET 5 min: Kodjia is off now too, replaced by Bony. After a terrific second half, extra-time hasn\u2019t yet caught fire. Both teams are wary of making a fatal mistake ... ET 2 min: Zaha, who had a decent game despite one bad miss, is withdrawn for Cornet. Meanwhile, Bounedjah was replaced by Slimani shortly after his penalty miss but is still distraught. The camera keeps panning to him in the dugout, where he is shaking his head and seemingly on the verge of tears. You\u2019d almost want Algeria to go on and win here just to save him from further distress. Before we tuck into the main feast (see below), let\u2019s enjoy the conclusion to the first quarter-final, which is turning out to be a corker. Algeria led through a first-half goal by Sofinae Feghouli and had a chance to increase that lead, only for Baghdad Bounedjah to smash a penalty against the crossbar. Then Jonathan Kodjia equalised for Ivory Coast and since then it\u2019s been a thrilling, helter-skelter affair, with highlights including Riyad Mahrez having a shot cleared off the line brilliantly by Mamadou Bagayoko, and Wilfried Zaha shaking a golden chance high and wide for the Elephants. A highly entertaining game is about to reach its climax, as extra-time begins momentarily... Hello. We are gathered here today to see whether Madagascar can spring yet another wonderful surprise. The team who began this tournament ranked 108th in the world have lit up the show with a marvellous spirit, canny defending and vibrant attacking. They\u2019ve been beautiful! Today, Tunisia stand in their way. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who we\u2019re up against, we\u2019re not worried about that!\u201d blared Malgasy midfielder Lalaina \u201cBolida\u201d Nomejanahary by way of preview for this match. \u201cWe approach every game with a winning mentality.\u201d That\u2019s the spirit! Still, let\u2019s remind ourselves of what Tunisia (world ranking: 25) will be bringing to this party. Far more experience than Madagascar, for a start, but also some nimble tricksters and a more open disposition than is suggested by a record of four draws from four matches so far. Youssef Msakni, Wahbi Khazri and Naim Sliti have not been at their best so far in this tournament (and Khazri and Sliti did not start the last game) but if they get it together, they could lead Madagascar on a merry dance. Both these teams are technically slick and fond of open and enterprising games so this could be a belter. Senegal will be paying close attention because they will meet the winner in the semi-final. You, too, should tune in. It\u2019s on! At 8pm BST.",

He said that there were reasons to believe Britain\u2019s relationship with the United States was the \u201csingle most important strategic fact of our times\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has claimed he fully supports the outgoing UK ambassador to the US, Sir Kim Darroch, a day after it was reported that his previous repeated and public refusals to do so had convinced the diplomat he had no choice other than to resign. Darroch chose to step down as the country\u2019s envoy in Washington on Wednesday amid a diplomatic row over leaked diplomatic cables that showed him criticising Donald Trump. Johnson, a former foreign secretary, was accused of throwing Darroch \u201cunder the bus\u201d after he refused to say he would leave him in place if he became prime minister during a Tory leadership debate on Tuesday. At a Tory leadership hustings on Thursday evening, Johnson claimed he fully supports Darroch, saying he had spoken to him to convey his regret, adding that the former envoy had been the \u201cvictim of a very unpleasant stunt\u201d in the leaking of his memos. Asked about his refusal to offer such effusive support before Darroch chose to step down, Johnson said he did not think that \u201cissues of personnel in our civil service should become footballs in political conversations\u201d. Earlier he was heavily criticised by fellow Tory MPs over his role Darroch\u2019s decision to resign, with one backbencher saying the frontrunner in the Conservative leadership contest should come to the Commons to apologise. An urgent question in the Commons about Darroch\u2019s departure resulted in repeated condemnation of Johnson, and only one Conservative MP came to his defence. The criticism was based on Johnson\u2019s choice of language in Tuesday\u2019s debate, even as his leadership rival, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said he would expect the ambassador to stay in post until his planned retirement. In a shock move that prompted the senior civil servant at the Foreign Office to call an all-staff meeting to reassure \u201cshaken\u201d diplomats, Darroch announced on Wednesday morning that he could no longer continue in his role in the wake of the leak. Adding to the likely discomfort for Johnson, the Foreign Office minister sent out to respond to the urgent question for the government was Sir Alan Duncan, who on Wednesday accused him of \u201cthrowing Darroch under the bus\u201d. Asked about Duncan\u2019s comments at the Maidstone hustings, Johnson said: \u201cThere has certainly been an attempt to politicise this issue and to take the career prospects of Sir Kim and turn them into an issue in the Conservative party leadership contest, I notice that. I don\u2019t think that should happen \u2026 I don\u2019t think that issues of personnel in our civil service should become footballs in political conversation.\u201d In the hustings on Thursday, Johnson was also forced on to the defensive over whether he was too deferential to Trump. He said that there were reasons to believe Britain\u2019s relationship with the United States was the \u201csingle most important strategic fact of our times\u201d. But he said he had criticised Trump before and would do so again if needed. \u201cI criticised him as foreign secretary,\u201d he said. Earlier, in the Commons, the most vehement criticism came from David Morris, the Conservative MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, who condemned Johnson for failing to fully back Darroch. Darroch is understood to have made the decision to resign after watching Johnson repeatedly declining to offer his support in the Tuesday\u2019s debate. \u201cDo you not feel that it is incumbent on every member of parliament in this place to back up our excellent diplomats and civil servants, and the honourable member for Uxbridge should come to the house and apologise?\u201d Morris asked. Other Conservatives expressed similar views, with Roger Gale telling the Commons: \u201cThe failure of the former foreign secretary to leap to the defence of Sir Kim shows a lack of leadership that is lamentable.\u201d The Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, was less direct, but made his feelings known, saying the loss of Darroch after Trump\u2019s comments amounted to the UK being bullied. Tugendhat said the government should \u201calways stand up for those we send abroad, military or civilian, and will back them to the point that is necessary in the interests of the British people, and no one else\u201d. The only support for Johnson came from the veteran Tory backbencher Peter Bone, who said: \u201cThe attacking of colleagues is completely wrong and people should be ashamed of themselves when they\u2019ve done that.\u201d The urgent question was tabled by Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden, who said the decision of Darroch to resign, despite having the full support of Theresa May and her cabinet, was \u201ca dark moment for our democracy and for the standing of the United Kingdom\u201d. McFadden said Johnson\u2019s lack of support for the envoy was \u201can appalling abandonment of someone in the firing line\u201d. He added: \u201cReal leaders protect their people. They don\u2019t throw them to the wolves because they can sniff a prize for themselves. His actions are a chilling warning of what is to come if he becomes prime minister.\u201d Duncan said he would not be responding to such views on Johnson: \u201cI hope the house will understand if I hold back today from making any further comment on the right honourable friend the member for Uxbridge.

This is not a professional sportsman encumbered by doubt or tortured mental processes. It is a genuine gift in itself. Plenty of athletes spend their careers trying to pare things back, to fade out the white noise.

He had killed the chase, though, with 85 out of 147, and five sixes to go with nine fours. These were match-sealing runs too, runs at the sharp end of the day, of the tournament and of his own international career.</p> \n<p>There is a suggestion Roy will also play Test cricket this summer. It is a bit of a gamble. But then there is also something about unignorable talent, about players who must simply be allowed to play. The red ball will swing and pitches will be trickier. But Roy\u2019s technique is good, his method is simple, those hands describe an easy arc.</p> \n<p>Before then there is, of course, a final to play. It has been breathless to this point. No doubt Roy will approach Lord\u2019s the same way, with that same feeling of a man operating outside the occasion and leading fearlessly, carelessly from the front.</p>",

And not for Roy who must on this form \u2013 85 here made it five scores of 50 or more in six World Cup innings \u2013 be considered the most beautifully destructive one-day opener in the world right now. All the best strikers of a ball seem to have an area where their talent resides, a part of the body from which it springs. With Roy it is the forearms, the way he simply hurls them through the ball like a Mexican featherweight unloading another whip-crack combination. Here that assured aggression was all the more remarkable because at the halfway point the feeling was that Australia had posted a challenging total. England might have blinked. Early on Starc hit Roy in the stomach as he tried to pull. The next ball was defended, bat, chest, heart, spleen, guts, head all in behind the line. And from there he was off. There was a pair of dreamy cover drives, the ball fizzing and fading as it skimmed the grass, drawing the first of those luxurious cheers from the afternoon crowd. At 71 for no wicket the Bairstow-Roy partnership pushed its average score up past 70, miles ahead of any other pair in the history of ODIs. Another bravura cover drive took Roy to 53 off 50 balls. Marcus Stoinis came on to bowl. Time to have a look? Again, Lol. Roy came walking, ambling, sashaying down the pitch and produced a one-legged flamingo whip to midwicket. Those who know him say that Roy is, in the best possible sense, quite straightforward in his mental approach. This is not a professional sportsman encumbered by doubt or tortured mental processes. It is a genuine gift in itself. Plenty of athletes spend their careers trying to pare things back, to fade out the white noise. What a rare and hugely underrated talent to be able walk out and forget yourself, to see only the moment. Roy eventually went for 85 off 65 balls, and in an ugly way too, openly disputing an incorrect decision on a catch behind. He had killed the chase, though, with 85 out of 147, and five sixes to go with nine fours. These were match-sealing runs too, runs at the sharp end of the day, of the tournament and of his own international career. There is a suggestion Roy will also play Test cricket this summer. It is a bit of a gamble. But then there is also something about unignorable talent, about players who must simply be allowed to play. The red ball will swing and pitches will be trickier. But Roy\u2019s technique is good, his method is simple, those hands describe an easy arc. Before then there is, of course, a final to play. It has been breathless to this point. No doubt Roy will approach Lord\u2019s the same way, with that same feeling of a man operating outside the occasion and leading fearlessly, carelessly from the front.",

He said: \u201cObviously we want to stop oil getting to President Assad, although probably he can get all the oil he wants from Russia. Are we not supposed to be on the same side as the Iranians on the question of nuclear proliferation and control? Can we have a firm assurance that we did this not just at the say-so of the US?\u201d</p> \n<p>Lady Goldie, for the government, insisted the request to intercept the ship came from the government of Gibraltar, but Foreign Office officials in the past have indicated the biggest factor in play was pressure from the US.</p> \n<p>Speaking on the BBC, Nathalie Tocci, the special adviser to the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, put the UK decision in a wider political context. \u201cThe UK is feeling its own fragility and a fear of isolation as it tries to cut off its membership from the EU. There\u2019s a line connecting the Iran story and the UK ambassador to the US.\u201d</p> \n<p>Either way, once Grace 1 had been seized, UK shipping in the Gulf was in Iranian crosshairs. By the weekend, the British government was privately advising British flagged vessels not to carry oil through the Gulf, leading to an abrupt about-turn of a BP tanker, British Heritage, heading to collect oil in Basra.</p> \n<p>By Tuesday night the British government was lifting the code alert to level 3, the highest possible, and on Wednesday the giant British Heritage was interrupted by Iranian ships.</p> \n<p>Curiously, media briefing about British Heritage, and the intervention by HMS Montrose, which warded off the Iranian boats by aiming its guns at them, came originally from the US, and not the Ministry of Defence.</p> \n<p>The episode has highlighted the vulnerability of British shipping.

      "bodyText": "A chain of events has been triggered that is increasingly exposing the UK diplomatically and militarily in the Gulf. The UK has put British shipping on maximum alert in the Gulf, just as the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is forced to admit that \u2013 due to successive defence cuts \u2013 the UK does not have the resources to defend British vessels. Simultaneously, the UK is battling diplomatically to keep the nuclear deal with Iran alive \u2013 a path the US rejects. British officials insist there is no connection between freedom of navigation and the preservation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the deal is known. But the two issues are inextricably linked. British officials weighed the implications for the nuclear deal before British marines seized Grace 1, an Iranian-owned oil tanker, off the strait of Gibraltar following a request from the US. On one side of the ledger, the UK prides itself on upholding international law, including sanctions. The cargo was in breach of EU law because it was taking oil to Syria. But on the other side of the ledger, capturing Grace 1 would have little practical impact on Syria since it can still import oil from Russia. Moreover, if the UK went ahead with the seizure, it would be locked into a long legal battle, while British shipping in the Gulf would be vulnerable to Iranian reprisals and damage. The UK did not need another row with Iran just as the talks between Tehran, and the UK, France and Germany to rescue the nuclear deal reached their most sensitive stage. Tehran had for weeks been gradually reducing its commitments under the deal, in a calibrated effort to force Europe to do more to challenge US policy. Lord Howell, a former Conservative cabinet minister and chairman of the Lords international relations committee, asked his government on Thursday whether it \u201cwas such a good idea to raid the Iranian oil tanker in Gibraltar in the first place\u201d. He said: \u201cObviously we want to stop oil getting to President Assad, although probably he can get all the oil he wants from Russia. Are we not supposed to be on the same side as the Iranians on the question of nuclear proliferation and control? Can we have a firm assurance that we did this not just at the say-so of the US?\u201d Lady Goldie, for the government, insisted the request to intercept the ship came from the government of Gibraltar, but Foreign Office officials in the past have indicated the biggest factor in play was pressure from the US. Speaking on the BBC, Nathalie Tocci, the special adviser to the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, put the UK decision in a wider political context. \u201cThe UK is feeling its own fragility and a fear of isolation as it tries to cut off its membership from the EU. There\u2019s a line connecting the Iran story and the UK ambassador to the US.\u201d Either way, once Grace 1 had been seized, UK shipping in the Gulf was in Iranian crosshairs. By the weekend, the British government was privately advising British flagged vessels not to carry oil through the Gulf, leading to an abrupt about-turn of a BP tanker, British Heritage, heading to collect oil in Basra. By Tuesday night the British government was lifting the code alert to level 3, the highest possible, and on Wednesday the giant British Heritage was interrupted by Iranian ships. Curiously, media briefing about British Heritage, and the intervention by HMS Montrose, which warded off the Iranian boats by aiming its guns at them, came originally from the US, and not the Ministry of Defence. The episode has highlighted the vulnerability of British shipping. There are not that many large British oil or gas tankers in the region \u2013 50 or so out of 800 \u2013 but they are now targets, and not all of them can be protected. At the same time the British appear to be sceptical of US plans to form a multinational maritime protection force in the Gulf. The UK is awaiting the details of the US proposals, but at a briefing on Tuesday, Gen Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US military\u2019s joint chiefs of staff, said he wanted to ensure freedom of navigation. The US would provide \u201ccommand and control\u201d ships, leading surveillance efforts, he said. However, the aim would be for other countries to offer boats to establish patrols nearby, and escort commercial ships carrying their flags through the area. The UK has not rejected this plan, but seems to be nervous that the US, with a different political agenda towards Iran, should direct ships, including those flagged by countries that are not seeking a showdown with Tehran. The Foreign Office takes the view that a confrontation with Iran would be counter-productive, and is interested in developing a regional alliance to de-escalate the conflict, an initiative that has also attracted the United Arab Emirates. As the drama takes place on the high seas, the EU says it is making some progress on its controversial barter-type system to trade with Iran and get around US sanctions, part of its efforts to keep the nuclear deal alive. The EU foreign policy secretary general, Helga Schmid, said on Thursday that beyond the 10 EU nations that were already part of the system, \u201cwe now have seven more member states that have announced they will either join the shareholders or use Instex\u201d, she said, referring to the barter system. Schmid added that \u201cfrom consultations I had last week, I can share with you that more, also non-EU member states, will join\u201d. The EU still believes that the Iran deal can be saved, but the US wants it to fail. The risk is that, after failing to prise the UK away from its political support for the Iran nuclear deal, the US will gently prod its closest ally towards a naval bust-up in the Gulf that ends with the UK facing no option but to quit the deal and ally with the US.",

A report that year by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/jeremy-corbyn-sets-up-inquiry-into-labour-antisemitism-claims\">Shami Chakrabarti</a>&nbsp;exonerated the party of widespread antisemitism but reported an 'occasionally toxic atmosphere'.</p>\n    <p>Matters escalated in 2018 when it became evident that the party was receiving more and more complaints, to the extent that there was a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/20/jewish-labour-group-accuses-failing-act-antisemitism\">backlog of disciplinary cases</a>.

Then accusations of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/02/new-labour-party-row-over-antisemitism-jeremy-corbyn\">political interference in the complaints process</a>&nbsp;by aides close to Corbyn began to emerge earlier this year, which the party strongly denies.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>When did the complaints about antisemitism turn into a full-blown crisis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The resignations of some MPs and peers over antisemitism in February 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/28/labour-worst-day-shame-tom-watson-luciana-berger-resignation\">alarmed many Labour colleagues</a>.

However, many of his supporters in the party backed a campaign saying he had been vilified and badly treated.

Seumas Milne, one of Corbyn\u2019s closest aides, told officials the party was 'muddling up political disputes with racism' and must review processes. Jennie Formby, the general secretary, was accused of attempting to interfere in who sat on a panel examining the case of Jackie Walker, a high-profile activist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/labour-expels-jackie-walker-for-leaked-antisemitism-comments\">who was eventually expelled from the party</a>.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Labour\u2019s response to the BBC\u2019s Panorama?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Labour&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\">strongly denied the allegations</a>&nbsp;of political interference, and came out on the offensive, accusing the BBC of bias and calling for the documentary to be pulled.

The revelation comes after eight former members of staff went public in a BBC Panorama programme alleging consistent interference in the disputes process by senior Labour aides. Labour has complained about the programme to the highest level of the BBC, claiming the staff members were disaffected and motivated by political opposition to Jeremy Corbyn. But some members of Labour\u2019s governing national executive committee (NEC) fear the party is not doing enough to prepare for a pending investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), while senior MPs have also called for a more transparent approach. Some members of the NEC raised serious concerns at a meeting on Tuesday that party chiefs had not shared the submission to the EHRC investigation with them, making it impossible for them to respond credibly to the watchdog\u2019s eventual findings. One source close to the committee said: \u201cThe party has not grasped the consequences of how serious this investigation is if Labour is found guilty.

The shadow cabinet and NEC need to know what you have sent to the EHRC in our party\u2019s name, and we need to know urgently. \u201cEvery member of these two bodies is bound by a moral and political responsibility to eradicate antisemitism from the party and restore our standing with the Jewish community.\u201d Keir Starmer, a shadow cabinet member, said the party should show it was ready to \u201cthrow open the books and say you have got access to anything\u201d. Watson also said he was concerned by emails revealed by Panorama, which appeared to suggest Formby had deleted messages and also used an external email account at the Unite trade union for private communications. Watson released an email from Formby in which she assured him she was preserving all emails for the EHRC to examine. A Labour source said Formby had offered to meet Watson to provide him with the party\u2019s response to the EHRC. \u201cThis week Jennie Formby took time out of her chemotherapy treatment to update the shadow cabinet on this. Tom Watson was present but did not ask any questions on this,\u201d the source said. The Labour source also said Formby had written to Watson in March asking him not to personally criticise Labour staff. Claudia Webbe, a member of the NEC and the chair of Labour\u2019s disputes committee, hit back at Watson, saying Formby should not be targeted while undergoing chemotherapy and suggested he should resign. She said Watson had \u201cengaged in public attacks on the Labour party\u2019s general secretary despite your clear knowledge she is receiving chemotherapy treatment for cancer. This is not behaviour befitting of the office of deputy leader. You should consider your position.\u201d JLM said it had begun collecting statements since September 2018 to refer to the EHRC. The group, which is the party\u2019s oldest and only official Jewish affiliate, said it wanted to pay tribute to those who had come forward, particularly four who had already broken non-disclosure agreements. \u201cIn the face of legal action, they have demonstrated bravery and integrity in abundance. We\u2019d urge any party officer or staffer, past or present, to come forward now and tell us and the EHRC what you know,\u201d the spokesman said. One source suggested the Panorama documentary contained \u201caround 5%\u201d of the detail that had been collated to submit to the EHRC. The EHRC launched a formal investigation into whether Labour \u201cunlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people\u201d from the Jewish community in May, saying it had received a number of complaints about Labour\u2019s handling of allegations. The party has said it will cooperate fully with the investigation but rejected any suggestion that it did not handle complaints \u201cfairly and robustly, or that the party has acted unlawfully\u201d. A number of other former and current members of staff are expected to approach the EHRC directly, rather than through JLM\u2019s formal submission. Others may be compelled to come forward. A senior NEC source said they believed evidence given by those who were called by the EHRC could be the most damaging. \u201cThe documentary will prompt many more people to come forward, or to speak freely if they are compelled to give evidence to the EHRC,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt hit home when the whistleblowers said how when you try to do something about injustice but can\u2019t, you start to feel complicit.\u201d NEC members intend to raise the matter again at the meeting of the equalities committee next week and again at a full meeting the following week. A Labour spokesman said: \u201cOur records show that after Jennie Formby became general secretary, the rate at which antisemitism cases have been dealt with increased more than fourfold. \u201cComplaints about antisemitism relate to a small minority of our members. We have robust procedures for dealing with such complaints, which we are continuing to improve and we are cooperating fully with the EHRC.\u201d",

Mainly because \u201cshitshow\u201d might have been deemed unparliamentary. It did slowly dawn on Duncan that Darroch was actually still living and the Sydney Carton \u201cIt is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done\u201d was a touch premature. So he went on to express the hope that Darroch would go on to serve the UK as ambassador in some country that wasn\u2019t run by an inept, dysfunctional narcissist. Somewhere peaceful, somewhere quiet. North Korea would do. You could also sense him about to let rip. To say what he really thought. That Boris was an embarrassment and totally unfit to run an allotment, let alone the country. But somehow he managed to keep his mouth shut. Tom Tugendhat, chair of the foreign affairs select committee, drily observed that taking back control seemed to imply a state of servitude to the US, while Wes Streeting implored Duncan to ensure that a new ambassador was in place before Boris could get round to appointing an inappropriate stooge. That was above his pay grade, Duncan shrugged. Though he could assure the house that unlike some inquiries that were set up to make sure the guilty parties were never caught, this time the Foreign Office and the police meant business. Some people will be starting to get very sweaty. Was getting their man really worth two years inside? Finally, silence. The deplorathon was over for another day. Still, there was always next week.",

Three men were due to face trial in the NSW supreme court on Monday for the 2016 alleged killings of underworld figure Pasquale Barbaro and Mehmet Yilmaz. But the court was forced to vacate the four-month trial because the legal aid rates were woefully inadequate for suitable barristers to take on such a lengthy and complex case. The trial has now been put off for at least a year, forcing victims and witnesses to endure a longer wait for justice, wasting months of preparation by prosecutors and police, and playing havoc with scheduling in an already backlogged court system. On Thursday, the Law Council of Australia president, Arthur Moses, told Guardian Australia the case was a worrying example of chronic legal aid underfunding \u201cundermining the criminal justice system\u201d. He said the federal government had continually ignored the profession\u2019s pleas for more legal assistance funding. Private lawyers had been working on legal aid cases either at a loss or only just breaking even. \u201cFor too long they have relied on the goodwill of the profession, but there comes a point when that cannot continue,\u201d Moses said. \u201cWhat that will result in, as we have seen with this judgment \u2026 is that trials are vacated or delayed, which not only has an impact on the accused, but also on the victims and witnesses.\u201d \u201cPoliticians are badly mistaken if they think there is no votes in this, because this impacts on the whole community, both in terms of safety of community, and the interests of the victim and witnesses, as well as the accused.\u201d Legal Aid NSW, like its counterparts across the country, is funded by the commonwealth through the National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services. The legal profession and the Productivity Commission have all warned federal funding is hundreds of millions of dollars short of what is required to meet demand. In the lead-up to the last federal budget, the Law Council of Australia identified a minimum $310m a year shortfall in legal assistance funding. The federal government offered a $20m increase per year, increasing from $350.3 million in 2019-20 to $370m ongoing from July 2020. The Law Council slammed that increase at the time as \u201cabysmal\u201d. On Monday, the trial judge in the NSW supreme court, Desmond Fagan, said \u201curgent attention\u201d was needed to improve the legal aid situation. The trial will now not take place until late next year at the earliest. The men could not have properly defended themselves without barristers, Fagan said, and they will now languish on remand until the new trial begins. Fagan said witnesses and prosecutors had also wasted considerable time and effort preparing for Monday\u2019s start date, while the court had set aside four months of its time for the trial, which it will now struggle to fill with other cases. \u201cWhere inability to brief counsel for a long trial at Legal Aid rates forces an adjournment, the waste of public resources is enormous,\u201d Fagan said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Law Society of NSW president, Elizabeth Espinosa, said the hourly rates available for legal aid work had not increased in \u201cmore than a decade\u201d in the state. Espinosa said this was impacting those at the \u201clowest end of the poverty threshold\u201d. \u201cWe have the situation where solicitors are effectively treating legal aid work as pro bono work,\u201d Espinosa said. \u201cUnfortunately, if the lack of adequate remuneration for legal practitioners is not addressed, we will continue to see experienced solicitors reluctantly withdraw from legally aided matters, particularly in the regional and remote areas of the state.\u201d The shadow attorney general, Paul Lynch, said the state government had ignored the problem for \u201can eternity\u201d. Lynch said proper legal aid funding is an investment that saves the government money in the long term. \u201cThe failure by the government to increase the rates for over a decade is simply absurd,\u201d Lynch told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey have been happy for a crisis to develop.\u201d A spokesman for the NSW government told the Sydney Morning Herald a recent Legal Aid NSW review of fees was under consideration. The federal attorney-general, Christian Porter, was approached for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Christian Porter has sought to allay concerns that a federal religious discrimination bill could water down protections for LGBT people in state legislation. The attorney general told Guardian Australia the bill \u201cis not intended to displace state law nor will it import specific provisions of international law\u201d after LGBT advocates warned that it could undermine state protections against vilification or discrimination on the grounds of sex or sexuality. As Porter has begun a series of workshops with Coalition MPs to discuss the as yet unreleased bill and agreed to meet religious leaders such as the Sydney Catholic archbishop Anthony Fisher, advocates have demanded he meet with affected LGBT and women\u2019s groups and guarantee the bill will not wind back state regimes. That call was echoed by the Tasmanian Labor shadow attorney general, Ella Haddad, who has written to the entire federal Labor caucus asking for a commitment state laws \u201cwill not be adversely impacted\u201d \u2013 to which federal Labor is yet to commit. Concerns centre on laws in Tasmania, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory, which prohibit vilification on the basis of sexuality and \u2013 unlike New South Wales \u2013 do not provide a specific exemption for religious speech. Those states also prevent religious schools from expelling students based on sexuality, while Tasmania and the ACT provide the same protection to teachers. Equality Australia\u2019s director of legal advocacy, Lee Carnie, has warned that inconsistency between state and federal laws could allow litigants complaining of indirect religious discrimination to side-step state regimes. Equality Tasmania and Just Equal spokesman Rodney Croome said there was a \u201chigh risk\u201d of state and territory laws being overridden \u2013 particularly if the Coalition accepts the demands from faith groups to add a right to religious freedom contained in article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Porter\u2019s comments not to \u201cimport specific provisions of international law\u201d appear to rule this out, holding the line against Coalition conservatives calling for the remit of the bill to expand beyond making religion a protected attribute to granting a positive right to express religious beliefs. Carnie welcomed the attorney\u2019s claim the intention was not to override state regimes, while Croome warned the \u201cdevil will be in the detail\u201d. \u201cWe would add that we hope the religious discrimination bill would provide consistent protections for best practice anti-discrimination laws \u2026 [to] ensure people living in states with strong protections \u2013 such as Tasmania \u2013 would have consistent coverage against discrimination on all grounds,\u201d Carnie said. On 30 June, Haddad wrote to her federal Labor counterparts urging them \u201cnot to allow the balance our law strikes to be undermined by any federal legislation\u201d. \u201cThe rights of vulnerable people should guide Labor\u2019s policy-making when it comes to discrimination law,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore Labor makes any decision regarding religious discrimination or freedom legislation the Morrison government puts forward, it conducts a sweep of state and territory anti-discrimination statutes to ensure they will not be adversely impacted.\u201d Croome said LGBT people in Tasmania and around Australia \u201cwant commitments from Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese that they will not support any new law that weakens existing discrimination protections at a state and territory level\u201d. The acting shadow attorney general, Brendan O\u2019Connor, said that Labor \u201cbelieves in an inclusive society\u201d but stopped short of giving a commitment that LGBT people in states with more favourable regimes will not be worse off. \u201cWe will speak up for everyone\u2019s rights and freedoms,\u201d he said. \u201cThe debate should never be about pitting one group of Australians against another \u2013 it should be about moving towards a more accepting and respectful society for all Australians.\u201d The ACT attorney general, Gordon Ramsay, told Guardian Australia he would not support \u201cany attempts to use changes to the anti-discrimination framework to reverse the progress made towards a more equal and inclusive society achieved [by marriage equality]\u201d. \u201cThe Australian public\u2019s demand for equality and protections against discrimination for our LGBTIQ community has been made clear.\u201d Ramsay said the federal government should pursue a \u201cnational human rights framework that understands the necessary balancing between competing rights and responsibilities rather than a piecemeal effort appease their base\u201d.",

It is recruiting 30 palliative care patients to be treated with synthetic magic mushrooms aimed to ease the paralysing anxiety often associated with having a terminal illness. The trial is expected to start in six to eight weeks.</p> <p>\u201cWe urgently need to explore new treatment paradigms and the promise of psychedelic medicines in terms of alleviation of suffering cannot be under-estimated,\u201d St Vincent psychiatrist David Castle said.</p> <p>Liknaitzky emphasised the treatment was more than just about pills and going on a trip \u2013 there was also an important element of talk therapy involved.</p> <p>\u201cThe particular way participants are prepared and supported matters a lot,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Liknaitzky noted overseas follow-up studies had found 80% of participants using magic mushroom therapy to treat smoking addiction had successfully quit and the use of MDMA therapy for PTSD had a 70% success rate.</p> <p>PTSD will affect one in 13 Australians in their lifetimes.</p> <p>Liknaitzky said psychedelic therapy had the potential to save the health system a lot of money in the long term compared to conventional treatments. He said between one to three sessions can be effective.</p> <p>He estimated the therapy could be approved in Australia in about five years.</p> <p>There was a flurry of research into psychedelic therapy treatments in the 1950s and 1960s but then US president Richard Nixon launched a crackdown in 1971, classifying all psychedelics as prohibited substances. This was in the context of concern over growing recreational use of hallucinogenic drugs and the youth anti-Vietnam war protest movement.</p> <p>\u201cWe owe it to every person suffering with mental illness and their families to not be held hostage by historical prejudices and to identify the best solutions available to alleviate the increasing suffering in our community,\u201d Liknaitzky said.</p> <p>American retired US army sergeant Jonathan Lubecky, who suffered crippling PTSD, has penned a letter about his experience with psychedelic therapy to the Victorian royal commission.</p> <p>Lubecky was deployed to the Iraq war in 2005 and was on a military base that was mortared thousands of times. Within 60 days of returning to the US, he made five suicide attempts.</p> <p>\u201cThe effect this treatment has had on my life has been nothing short of a miracle,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy suicidal ideation slowed and then stopped. My depression also improved greatly over time. I now lead a full and rich life.\u201d</p> <p>The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists president, John Allan, is cautious about psychedelic therapy.</p> <p>\u201cThey are quite potent drugs and they have a history of causing quite a lot of trouble when they have been used recreationally in the past,\u201d Allan told the Guardian. \u201cThere\u2019s a very low evidence base. It\u2019s still experimental and the exact treatment protocols have not been decided. It\u2019s very, very, very early days.\u201d</p> <p>Allan said the royal commission should not recommend that public funding be spent on psychedelic therapy research because there were more important spending priorities in mental health. \u201cThis is a luxury item,\u201d he said.</p> <p><em>* In Australia, crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: <a href=\"http://www.lifeline.org.au/\">Lifeline</a> 13 11 14; <a href=\"http://www.suicidecallbackservice.org.au/\">Suicide Call Back Service</a> 1300 659 467; <a href=\"http://www.kidshelp.com.au/\">Kids Helpline</a> 1800 55 1800; <a href=\"http://www.mensline.org.au/\">MensLine Australia</a> 1300 78 99 78; <a href=\"https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\">Beyond Blue</a> 1300 22 4636.

      "bodyText": "Psychedelic therapy involving magic mushrooms or MDMA to treat mental illnesses could be five years away from regulator approval in Australia and the Victorian government is being urged to make the state a research leader in the field. The US Food and Drug Administration recently designated the treatment as \u201cbreakthrough therapies\u201d following successful medical trials. International trials are finding synthetic magic mushroom therapy is effective in treating depression, anxiety and addiction while MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine) therapy is helping post-traumatic stress disorder sufferers. The treatment could receive US regulatory approval as early as 2021. The UK, Canada, Europe and Israel are also active research hubs. In a submission to Victoria\u2019s mental health royal commission, Mind Medicine Australia \u2013 which lobbies for psychedelic-assisted treatments for mental health \u2013 urges the state government to chip in funding to establish a centre for excellence in psychedelic medicine. It would conduct research and develop best practice and training for therapists. Mind Medicine Australia executive officer Dr Paul Liknaitzky said the stigma around the therapy has been lifting globally in the past 15 years and there was an opportunity to play catch up. \u201cAustralia has been pretty slow in the uptake,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. In an Australian-first, St Vincent\u2019s hospital in Melbourne announced in January a psychedelic medicine trial will start this year. It is recruiting 30 palliative care patients to be treated with synthetic magic mushrooms aimed to ease the paralysing anxiety often associated with having a terminal illness. The trial is expected to start in six to eight weeks. \u201cWe urgently need to explore new treatment paradigms and the promise of psychedelic medicines in terms of alleviation of suffering cannot be under-estimated,\u201d St Vincent psychiatrist David Castle said. Liknaitzky emphasised the treatment was more than just about pills and going on a trip \u2013 there was also an important element of talk therapy involved. \u201cThe particular way participants are prepared and supported matters a lot,\u201d he said. Liknaitzky noted overseas follow-up studies had found 80% of participants using magic mushroom therapy to treat smoking addiction had successfully quit and the use of MDMA therapy for PTSD had a 70% success rate. PTSD will affect one in 13 Australians in their lifetimes. Liknaitzky said psychedelic therapy had the potential to save the health system a lot of money in the long term compared to conventional treatments. He said between one to three sessions can be effective. He estimated the therapy could be approved in Australia in about five years. There was a flurry of research into psychedelic therapy treatments in the 1950s and 1960s but then US president Richard Nixon launched a crackdown in 1971, classifying all psychedelics as prohibited substances. This was in the context of concern over growing recreational use of hallucinogenic drugs and the youth anti-Vietnam war protest movement. \u201cWe owe it to every person suffering with mental illness and their families to not be held hostage by historical prejudices and to identify the best solutions available to alleviate the increasing suffering in our community,\u201d Liknaitzky said. American retired US army sergeant Jonathan Lubecky, who suffered crippling PTSD, has penned a letter about his experience with psychedelic therapy to the Victorian royal commission. Lubecky was deployed to the Iraq war in 2005 and was on a military base that was mortared thousands of times. Within 60 days of returning to the US, he made five suicide attempts. \u201cThe effect this treatment has had on my life has been nothing short of a miracle,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy suicidal ideation slowed and then stopped. My depression also improved greatly over time. I now lead a full and rich life.\u201d The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists president, John Allan, is cautious about psychedelic therapy. \u201cThey are quite potent drugs and they have a history of causing quite a lot of trouble when they have been used recreationally in the past,\u201d Allan told the Guardian. \u201cThere\u2019s a very low evidence base. It\u2019s still experimental and the exact treatment protocols have not been decided. It\u2019s very, very, very early days.\u201d Allan said the royal commission should not recommend that public funding be spent on psychedelic therapy research because there were more important spending priorities in mental health. \u201cThis is a luxury item,\u201d he said. * In Australia, crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636.

      "body": "<p> Rack up another win for the machines. An artificial intelligence called Pluribus has emerged victorious from a marathon 12-day poker session during which it played five human professionals at a time.</p> <p>Over 10,000 hands of no-limit Texas hold\u2019em, the most popular form of the game, Pluribus won a virtual $48,000 (\u00a338,000), beating five elite players who were selected each day from a pool who agreed to take on the program. All of the pros had previously won more than $1m playing the game.</p> <p>What counts as a beating for humanity ranks as a milestone for AI. No computer program has ever achieved superhuman performance against multiple poker players. A forerunner of Pluribus named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/30/libratus-poker-artificial-intelligence-professional-human-players-competition\">Libratus</a> made its name two years ago by trouncing top human players, but that program only played one-on-one.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first time AI has achieved superhuman performance in a multiplayer game,\u201d said Tuomas Sandholm, who developed Pluribus with his PhD student Noam Brown at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. The ability to beat five players at a time in such a complex game of bluff and hidden information opened up new opportunities for AI to tackle real world problems, he said.</p> <p>According to Sandholm, the algorithm has potential in applications ranging from investment banking and negotiation strategies to wargaming and deciding how much US political candidates should spend advertising in various media in different states. In his laboratory, research is underway to use the algorithm in treatment plans that marshall precise populations of immune cells to fight specific diseases. The work was part-funded by the US Army Research Office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"592c4e58614c21659ac922ccb2a8c149afb26555\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/592c4e58614c21659ac922ccb2a8c149afb26555/0_2_1848_1109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A round of Texas hold\u2019em in which the AI program Pluribus competed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A round of Texas hold\u2019em in which the AI program Pluribus competed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To master Texas hold\u2019em Pluribus adopted some surprising, and distinctly non-human, strategies which have already been adopted by the professionals it played. It used wildly differing bet sizes, a strategy humans seem to find hard to do. And while humans usually avoid so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.pokerstrategy.com/strategy/fixed-limit/standard-lines-donk-bet/\">donk betting</a>\u201d \u2013 the practice of ending the first round of betting with a call and opening the next with a bet \u2013 Pluribus embraced the tactic. The received wisdom in poker is that donk betting is a weak move that rarely makes sense. Pluribus found otherwise. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it, but Pluribus understands it,\u201d said Sandholm.</p> <p>In another computer v human challenge, the program beat two professionals, Darren Elias, who holds the record for the most World Poker Tour titles, and Chris Ferguson, who has won six World Series of Poker tournaments.

      "bodyText": "Rack up another win for the machines. An artificial intelligence called Pluribus has emerged victorious from a marathon 12-day poker session during which it played five human professionals at a time. Over 10,000 hands of no-limit Texas hold\u2019em, the most popular form of the game, Pluribus won a virtual $48,000 (\u00a338,000), beating five elite players who were selected each day from a pool who agreed to take on the program. All of the pros had previously won more than $1m playing the game. What counts as a beating for humanity ranks as a milestone for AI. No computer program has ever achieved superhuman performance against multiple poker players. A forerunner of Pluribus named Libratus made its name two years ago by trouncing top human players, but that program only played one-on-one. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time AI has achieved superhuman performance in a multiplayer game,\u201d said Tuomas Sandholm, who developed Pluribus with his PhD student Noam Brown at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. The ability to beat five players at a time in such a complex game of bluff and hidden information opened up new opportunities for AI to tackle real world problems, he said. According to Sandholm, the algorithm has potential in applications ranging from investment banking and negotiation strategies to wargaming and deciding how much US political candidates should spend advertising in various media in different states. In his laboratory, research is underway to use the algorithm in treatment plans that marshall precise populations of immune cells to fight specific diseases. The work was part-funded by the US Army Research Office. To master Texas hold\u2019em Pluribus adopted some surprising, and distinctly non-human, strategies which have already been adopted by the professionals it played. It used wildly differing bet sizes, a strategy humans seem to find hard to do. And while humans usually avoid so-called \u201cdonk betting\u201d \u2013 the practice of ending the first round of betting with a call and opening the next with a bet \u2013 Pluribus embraced the tactic. The received wisdom in poker is that donk betting is a weak move that rarely makes sense. Pluribus found otherwise. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it, but Pluribus understands it,\u201d said Sandholm. In another computer v human challenge, the program beat two professionals, Darren Elias, who holds the record for the most World Poker Tour titles, and Chris Ferguson, who has won six World Series of Poker tournaments. The defeats came after each played 5,000 hands against five copies of the AI. \u201cPluribus is a very hard opponent to play against,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to pin him down on any kind of hand.\u201d Artificial intelligence has already surpassed humans at games such as chess and Go, but in these games players can see the positions of all of the pieces; there is no information that is hidden from them. In poker, players have only partial information and a cast of potentially bluffing opponents, making it a far tougher AI challenge. Pluribus learned poker by playing copies of itself. Starting from scratch, and playing randomly at first, the program steadily improved its performance. After eight days, it had devised a \u201cblueprint strategy\u201d, which it uses for the first round of betting. For subsequent rounds, Pluribus looks ahead to hone its strategy. It aims to be unpredictable to wrongfoot its opponents. The program runs on two Intel Haswell processors and uses a modest 128GB during play. In games against itself, Pluribus takes about 20 seconds to play a hand, making it twice as fast as a typical professional, the scientists write in the journal Science. Sean Ruane, one of the players who took on Pluribus, found the program a tough opponent. \u201cIn a game that will, more often than not, reward you when you exhibit mental discipline, focus, and consistency, and certainly punish you when you lack any of the three, competing for hours on end against an AI bot that obviously doesn\u2019t have to worry about these shortcomings is a gruelling task.\u201d",

Roy reaches for it and whips it, but with a helicopter swish of the wrists, like taking Dhoni\u2019s stroke but then rotating it 45 degrees past point rather than long-on. It\u2019s entirely casual, barely seeming to connect.

Four runs to start the over is a big help though, and when Starc overcorrects Roy finds a couple more to midwicket. Starc gets it right thereafter, keeping the batsman guessing on off stump, mixing up the length. But it\u2019s the last ball of the over where Roy really takes control. Not a bad ball at all, but he stands up on the back foot and <strong>punches through extra cover for four.</strong> That\u2019s just asburd.

Conceding maidens to the opening bowlers from the other team just gives them too much control.

Clean straight drive in the air from Plunkett. The batsmen trade singles, then Plunkett slips in a wide.

The ball isn\u2019t turning, his confidence is low and so far he has been milked with ease. England have six bowlers so they aren\u2019t as reliant on him as they might be. An overthrow from Stokes gives Smith an extra run. It\u2019s not exactly unravelling for England, but a couple of loose threads have emerged in the last half an hour.

Smith then flashes Plunkett <em>this </em>far short of Stokes at backward point. It wasn\u2019t a chance, although Stokes\u2019s face suggests he\u2019s annoyed at his inability to dive forward five yards, extend a telescopic arm and clutch it with his little finger.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn 1984, the Demon of Frome, Colin Dredge, was Somerset\u2019s leading wicket taker against Warwickshire in the Benson &amp; Hedges\u2019 Cup,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cI\u2019m fairly confident that Colin\u2019s mum would have called it Dredgebaston that day, even though Somerset lost and his figures were 2 for 66 off 11.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d2719658f08cf92bb76dc04\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-11T11:12:40.790Z\">12.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>22nd over: Australia 87-3 (Smith 37, Carey 30) </strong>England\u2019s success has been built on Rashid and Plunkett taking wickets in the middle overs, and they could use one now. Carey, who is an excellent player of spin, sweeps off middle stump for a couple, and a handful of singles make it a decent over for Australia. I wonder if Morgan is tempted to give Archer a two-over burst. It\u2019s probably too early.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe ground has filled up but still a good many empty seats,\u201d says David Malcolm. \u201cPoor for such a critical match. Ground only has a capacity of 24000. Would not happen in any other sport where stadiums are much larger. Goes to show how much the Indian fans have boosted attendances. I think it fair to say there has only been a lukewarm response to the tournament in UK. Just look at the very limited media coverage.

Or would his natural game be outmoded today? Does he even have a legacy now? His role as a finisher without being a biffer doesn\u2019t seem to be suitable for study.

It could come down to three things: the toss, the battle of the opening partnerships and how England respond to adversity. They are probably the better side, but Australia are probably the tougher side. They have won all seven World Cup semi-finals (if you\u2019re into the whole pedantry thing, they\u2019ve won six and tied one) and have fought back to win a few games in this tournament. </p> \n  <p>England got themselves out of a hole to quality for the semi-finals, and were enormously impressive in doing so. But they haven\u2019t really come from behind to win a match at this tournament. They are formidable front-runners, and the ideal scenario is that they bat first, are 100 for nought after 15 overs and control the game throughout. It\u2019s not going to be like that. If I had to pick the deciding factor in this game, it\u2019s how England cope if they are 10 for two or Australia are 100 for nought.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-11T08:47:24.381Z\">at 9.47am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d26f35c8f08d0b6ca52e595\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-11T08:39:00.299Z\">9.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The toss </strong>Guardian exclusive: whoever wins it will bat first. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d26f51c8f08cf92bb76da3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-11T08:38:55.857Z\">9.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Australia hammered England in the league match two weeks ago. </strong>The margin of victory \u2013 64 runs \u2013 isn\u2019t huge, but trust me, it was a doing.

Glad you\u2019ve logged on \u2013 you\u2019ve obviously heard there\u2019s a cricket match today. It\u2019s Australia v England, for the right to play New Zealand in the World Cup final on Sunday. This game is almost too big to function. It\u2019s England most important since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/sep/13/ashes2005.ashes10\">September 2005</a>, Australia\u2019s since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/29/australia-new-zealand-world-cup-final\">March 2015</a>. For both countries, defeat is so unthinkable that it hurts trying not to think about it. </p> \n  <p>There\u2019s a rare old Royal Rumble of feeling and emotions this morning/evening: hope, fear, nervousness, anticipation, fear, curiosity, fear, fear, greed, nostalgia, pride - and I suppose, if I\u2019m being brutally honest, there\u2019s also a soup\u00e7on of fear. But most of all, as Eoin Morgan said yesterday, there is excitement about what might be achieved. In one hemisphere or another, a lot of grandchildren are going to hear about the events of 11 July 2019. </p> \n  <p>There was no way England \u2013 <em>England \u00ad\u2013 </em>were going to be allowed to win a World Cup without beating Australia en route. Only one side, West Indies in 1979, has ever done so. This is England\u2019s World Cup but it\u2019s also Australia\u2019s trophy, which they have lifted in four of the last five tournaments. And one of them has got to go. Deep down, we always knew it would be like this.</p> \n  <p><strong>The match starts at 10.30am BST, 7.30pm ACT.</strong></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-11T08:19:26.061Z\">at 9.19am BST</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for our semi-final blog. It\u2019s quite hard to make sense of what we watched today. England have marmalised Australia in a World Cup semi-final. You have to feel for this Australian team, especially their admirable captain Aaron Finch. It\u2019s no consolation, not to a country of serial winners, but they have come so far in the last year. England have travelled even further in the last four years. They are one win away from immortality. Trouble is, so are New Zealand. It\u2019s all quite emotional - especially if you\u2019re a member of Generation FFS, that hardy, masochistic, downright odd group of England supporters who have followed every ODI their team has lost played in the last 27 years. Thanks for your company and emails. I\u2019ll leave you with a match report from Edgbaston, and there will be plenty of features on the site in the next few hours as well. Goodnight! \u201cSunday is the perfect chance for England to complete the circle, isn\u2019t it?\u201d says David Hopkins. \u201cThis New England ODI started in that terrific series against NZ and now they can top it off against them. If they do win, should Morgan\u2019s first words to Kane be \u2018thank you\u2019?\u201d I suppose Brendon McCullum, who was NZ captain back then, was Morgan\u2019s biggest inspiration. It\u2019s not just that series in 2015, either; that astonishing shellacking at the World Cup a few months earlier was the moment Morgan decided enough was enough. \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Tom Hopkins. \u201cFollowing on from Geoff\u2019s commitment to get Marina Hyde on the OBO, can I request that if Rachel Gray\u2019s date isn\u2019t already the subject of Saturday\u2019s Blind Date column that it be made so as a matter of urgency?\u201d Andrew Strauss, who started all this with the appointment of Trevor Bayliss and the retention of Eoin Morgan, is chatting on Sky \u201cI found myself getting quite emotional today. All we wanted four years ago was for England to go out and play a different style \u2013 we didn\u2019t know where it would lead us but we thought that was England\u2019s best chance of winning a World Cup. One more hurdle to overcome, and the only thing I\u2019d ask of that team is: please play the same way. I know they will, and the pot of gold is there at the end of the rainbow.\u201d \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Will. \u201cSo you want euphoric + OTT, how about this\u2026 Seriously, where do you think that performance stands in British sporting history? Taking the importance of the occasion and the quality of the opposition into account, it must be top 10? Scenes after the third consecutive six off Smith, the sound off the bat was ungodly.\u201d I suppose it depends on how broadly you define sport. You should have seen Phil Taylor and Adie Lewis in the 2013 darts World Cup! It\u2019s certainly one of the most brutal performances I\u2019ve seen by an England team in a World Cup match. \u201cI have a date with an Australian this evening,\u201d says Rachel Gray. \u201cIt was of course going to be following our victory over India, then I saw it as an opportunity to appear gracious after a close defeat, but I am utterly unequipped to deal with this. How do I get through the evening without being totally insufferable?\u201d You can\u2019t, so the next best thing is to get so paggered on Victory Juice that you won\u2019t remember being insufferable, which means you weren\u2019t. Shane Warne is feeling funky He says that, if Bairstow is injured, England should open with Jos Buttler on Sunday. You know, he might be onto something. He usually is. He also wants Roy and Bairstow to open in the Test team, which, despite being an affront to 142 years of English opening batsmanship, is an increasingly persuasive idea. \u201cRe: the earlier query about big-screen options for Sunday,\u201d says David Hopkins. \u201cI believe there\u2019s a Fanzone with a big screen in Trafalgar Square. Good old Sadiq!\u201d It\u2019s Coming Home department \u201cI\u2019m trying not to even think it, never mind type it, Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to admire about both teams heading to Lord\u2019s on Sunday, but you know the three little words to which I refer...\u201d Enough, McMahon. (NB: clip contains adult language.) \u201cDespite England\u2019s surge to ODI dominance over the past few years, this is the most excited I\u2019ve ever been about England\u2019s cricket prospects,\u201d writes Bex. \u201cLikeable players who dominate with their play, whatever happens in the final we\u2019ve got the best damn side we could hope for. And WTF what that amazing Roy helicopter shot? Move aside, Maxwell, we have Royball now!\u201d I\u2019m still high on that innings. Nothing will ever top watching Kevin Pietersen playing one of his JFK innings, but Roy produced a helluvan homage. Jonny Bairstow may be doubtful for the final. He has a groin problem and will be assessed over the next couple of days. I suppose if he might be doubtful that means he is doubtful. \u201cHaha, amazing!\u201d says Richard. \u201cAssuming we don\u2019t have tickets for Lord\u2019s &amp; fancy an experience, are there any official venues in London for enjoying the atmosphere on a big screen?\u201d There will be, although I\u2019m not sure where. You\u2019re welcome! \u201cI remember listening to the last World Cup semi-final on my Walkman in my A level Geography class,\u201d says Nick Errington. \u201cMrs Sansom asked me if I could stop listening during the lesson. I explained it was either I listen quietly or leave the lesson. We agreed I could keep one ear on her and one on TMS. It was the right choice. Sometimes sport is more important. Just like today.\u201d You must have been a very naughty boy \u2013 that game was on a Sunday. (I jest; you meant the final, right?) \u201cIs it too late,\u201d says Adam Hirst, \u201cto change the final venue to Edgbaston?\u201d Anyone out there? We\u2019ll keep the blog going for a while, so feel free to email euphoric thoughts. Jeez, England were good today. They are such merciless front-runners. \u201cFrom ball two of the game,\u201d says Joe Rooy on Sky, \u201cwe were outstanding.\u201d That was their best display of the World Cup, by a mile, and you could argue it\u2019s the finest performance in their ODI history. I\u2019m probably getting carried away, but what the hell. Jofra Archer is being interviewed on Sky \u201cI feel bad about Alex Carey. He\u2019s coming to Sussex in a few weeks, so we\u2019ll have something to talk about! It stopped swinging pretty early so I just went to the cross- and quarter-seam balls to get something off the wicket. It nipped more than it swung. Today was the best wicket to bowl a knuckle ball on; I\u2019ve never had that much reaction off the pitch, ever. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I\u2019d be playing in a World Cup final.\u201d Channel 4 has signed a deal to show the World Cup final live on free-to-air television, with the broadcaster showing Sky\u2019s coverage from 9am onwards. However, because Channel 4 is already planning to show the Formula 1 British Grand Prix, the cricket coverage will shift to More4 from 1.15pm onwards - meaning most of the match will be tucked away on the more obscure channel. Here\u2019s Eoin Morgan \u201cI\u2019d like to thank the fans \u2013 we\u2019ve had unbelievable support. Edgbaston has always been very kind to us, but our support today has been exemplary. We took a lot of confidence from the last two group games. We set the tone from ball one, and when we got on top we made Australia pay a little bit. \u201cI\u2019m extremely happy [for Chris Woakes to get POTM]. He\u2019s a cool customer, he goes about his business exceptionally. Today was his day. Him and Jofra up front were absolutely outstanding \u2013 that was one of our best new-ball performances over the last four years. \u201cJason and Jonny are quite imposing when they get themselves in. Personally I think they\u2019re in the form of their life. They set the tone for how we want to play and that\u2019s important. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity for us on Sunday. Everybody in that changing-room should take a huge amount of credit for what we\u2019ve achieved in the last four years. Making the most of the opportunity on Sunday would be fantastic, but getting there alone is awesome.\u201d The thoroughly likeable Aaron Finch speaks \u201cWe were totally outplayed today. The way they set the tone with the ball in the first 10 overs was a huge part in the game. They bowled a great length, hitting the stumps a lot. Still a lot of positives to take out of the World Cup campaign from our point of view. We\u2019ve come a long way from where we were this time last year in England. \u201c[Do you look at this campaign as a success?] You always wanna win. You come here thinking you can win the tournament. But there have definitely been some positives in this campaign, and over the last six months or so. I\u2019m really proud of how the group has progressed. But it still hurts. \u201cWe tried to change it up as much as we could [against Bairstow and Roy] but they played exceptionally well. We know how dynamic and dominating they are when they get on top. We didn\u2019t quite execute as well as we could have, and when that happens you get hurt by a very, very good cricket team.\u201d What a staggering turnaround we have witnessed from England\u2019s ODI side. No, not the last four years; I\u2019m talking about the last two weeks. After they were hammered by Australia at Lord\u2019s they were facing a career-defining humiliation; since then they have beaten their three biggest rivals through performances of ever-increasing majesty. Chris Woakes is the Player of the Match \u201cI\u2019m speechless. It was an incredible performance from the whole team. There were some nerves this morning but I think that\u2019s natural. The way we produced the goods shows how good we are and where we\u2019re at as a team. I don\u2019t think it was a bad wicket by any means, but I think we found the right length and when they lost early wickets we were able to keep the pressure on. [How old were you when England last played in a World Cup final?] I was three years old! It hasn\u2019t really sunk in that we\u2019re in a World Cup final, but hopefully we can go all the way. To win this in the fashion we have, against a good Australian side \u2013 on the best ground in the world, may I say - means we\u2019re really looking forward to Sunday.\u201d It is now pouring down at Edgbaston. English TV department If you don\u2019t have Sky, the highlights are on Channel 4 at 10pm tonight. And there were some serious highlights, especially when Jason Roy was batting. I hope his petulance doesn\u2019t detract from an innings of Pietersenian genius and audacity. Here\u2019s our match report from Edgbaston Root ended with 49 from 46 balls, Morgan with 45 from 39. Mitchell Starc, who destroyed England at Lord\u2019s along with Jason Behrendorff, ended with grisly figures of 9-0-70-1. Australia\u2019s players all congratulate Root and Morgan. They usually take defeat with a lot of class, and today is no exception. There\u2019s such a great atmosphere around Edgbaston. England owe South Africa a big thank you for this, because playing Australia at this ground was perfect. The crowd have been wonderful. We didn\u2019t come up with a name for the ground, but it has certainly been England\u2019s Gabbatoir today. 32.1 overs: England 226-2 (Root 49, Morgan 45) Eoin Morgan clouts Behrendorff down the ground for four to complete a glorious victory. England will play New Zealand in the World Cup final at Lord\u2019s on Sunday! 32nd over: England 222-2 (Root 49, Morgan 41) Glenn Maxwell, a proud fielder to the last, takes the game into the 33rd over with a spectacular stop at backward point. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Anil Haji. \u201cSitting at my desk reading the OBO with a smile on my face, feeling calm and positive about the final we\u2019re going to be in. What\u2019s wrong with this picture? If I\u2019d tried this back in the 90s, I\u2019d have been laughed out of the England Cricket Supporters\u2019 Union (Pray For Rain branch).\u201d 31st over: England 216-2 (Root 44, Morgan 40) Root swats Behrendorff through midwicket for four more. I wondered about England\u2019s ability to come from behind within a game; they haven\u2019t had to do so, unless you count when Australia were 4-0 after one ball. It\u2019s been an awesome performance, a surgical dismantling of a superb Australian side. \u201cI\u2019m convinced,\u201d says Damo, \u201cthat the umpire forgot England had used their review and took the safe (bottled it) option.\u201d I think you might be right. Roy had certainly forgotten; he signalled for a review before misplacing his rag. 30th over: England 210-2 (Root 39, Morgan 40) Morgan batters Lyon to the cover boundary to take England past 200, and then Root reverse sweeps cheekily for four more. This is a pasting for the ages. Lyon, a potential matchwinner, has figures of 5-0-49-0. \u201cSo here we are,\u201d whispers Harkarn Sumal. \u201cPolishing off our drinks, undressing each other with our eyes; the deal is sealed. We\u2019re in the Clooney/Lopez \u2018Out of Sight\u2019 zone, aren\u2019t we? Grab your coat, Thomas Lord. You\u2019ve pulled. See you Sunday.\u201d 29th over: England 197-2 (Root 33, Morgan 33) A brilliant slower bounce from Behrendorff hoodwinks Morgan, who waits and waits and waits and still misses his attempted pull stroke. A maiden. It\u2019s only bloody time for a Powerade Hydration Break. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cJust back from my morning walk. Don\u2019t tell me, Australia made 350, and England are 120-5 after 25 overs in reply, right?\u201d 28th over: England 197-2 (Root 33, Morgan 33) Morgan gets down on one knee to drag Lyon round the corner for four, and makes room to bash the next delivery to the cover boundary. He has gone straight from first gear to fifth; six from his first 12 balls, 27 from the next 16. \u201cRequired run rate less than two an over,\u201d says Siraj Khan, who incidentally predicted a New Zealand victory over England at Lord\u2019s before the semi-finals. \u201cThis can change radically if Steve Smith brings himself on.\u201d 27th over: England 186-2 (Root 32, Morgan 23) A lucky escape for Morgan, who mistimes a drive off Behrendorff\u2019s slower ball. It teases Finch at mid-off before dropping just out of reach. Morgan is keen to get this done, and later in the over he pulls witheringly behind square for four. This has been a savage performance from England. Easy to get carried away, but given the moment (given the batsman, etc), I doubt there has been a better performance in their one-day history. \u201cCould Umpire Dharmasena have sent his own decision to DRS with a soft \u2018Out\u2019 signal?\u201d asks Rob Mildren. No, he\u2019s not allowed to do that. The umpires can refer a few things \u2013 run-outs, stumpings, low catches \u2013 but they can\u2019t go upstairs to see whether the ball has been edged unless one of the teams review. 26th over: England 178-2 (Root 31, Morgan 16) Lyon returns to the attack and is reverse swept jauntily over backward point for four by Morgan. \u201cI think the comparison of Roy to Pietersen is an unfair one,\u201d says Chris Parker. \u201cHe\u2019s much better than that.\u201d Are you sure? Kevin Pietersen is, by some distance, the biggest genius I\u2019ve had the privilege to watch play for England. (Just my opinion, etc.) 25th over: England 171-2 (Root 30, Morgan 10) This is Starc\u2019s eighth over. Root, who has quietly played a lovely little innings, flicks a low full toss to fine leg for four. He has 30 from 29 balls, and England need 53 from 25 overs. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t ENGLAND\u2019S fault, Rob (over 21),\u201d says Tom Adam. \u201cIt was Bairstow\u2019s fault \u2013 it was a ridiculous review since the only way he wasn\u2019t out was if he\u2019d hit it and he should have known he hadn\u2019t. Bairstow has real form for this \u2013 he\u2019s the Broad of batting reviews, but Broad\u2019s manageable since he has to consult the committee of keeper and skipper. Bairstow has the power to do it himself. We should give a standing instruction to the umpires that no Bairstow signal for a review counts unless he gets the non-striker to sign it off in duplicate.\u201d True, but there is a culture of indulgent, almost petulant reviews. I also think Roy told him to review, though I couldn\u2019t be sure as they chucked me out of the WhatsApp group when they realised I wasn\u2019t actually Zafar Ansari. 24th over: England 166-2 (Root 25, Morgan 10) Australia are bombing Morgan, who grits his teeth and takes one on the glove from Cummins. He is struggling with the short ball when Australia get their line right; there have been a few poorly directed deliveries as well. When Cummins tries to sucker him with a fuller delivery, Morgan drives confidently over mid-off for four. Lovely shot. \u201cWhat are the chances Roy will miss the final?\u201d says Dave Brown. \u201cHe really threw his toys out the pram when given out. Is that more than just a fine?\u201d I haven\u2019t swotted up on the Code of Conduct in the last few decades, but I suspect it\u2019s very unlikely. Although he was out of order, I have plenty of sympathy in the circumstances. He was playing the innings of his life, he was palpably not out, and Dharmasena\u2019s shaky raise of the finger suggested he might have responded to the vigour of Australia\u2019s appeal. 23rd over: England 158-2 (Root 23, Morgan 5) With Starc bowling to Morgan, Finch has placed himself in a catching position ... at long stop. Imaginary CricViz stats show his field registers 9.9 on the funkfieldometer. Starc does bounce Morgan, but it\u2019s a bit too wide and Morgan is able to slap it over point for a one-bounce four. \u201cJudging by the unbridled optimism of over 19,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201cI think the OBO has already been taken over by Marina Hyde.\u201d There\u2019s some light rain at Edgbaston, and the groundstaff are poised. England are 75 or so runs ahead on DLS. 22nd over: England 153-2 (Root 22, Morgan 1) This is Australia\u2019s last, last, last chance, which is why their best bowlers are on. If Cummins or Starc can bounce Morgan out, we might just have Mohali: The Sequel. With the required rate below three an over, Morgan is able to ignore a series of short balls. When Cummins gets his line a bit tighter, Morgan gloves the ball awkwardly at his feet. That was a beautiful delivery. 21st over: England 151-2 (Root 21, Morgan 0) Thanks Geoff. While Geoff was handing over the baton, Mitchell Starc bowled six balls to Joe Root, off which four runs were scored. Now, Jason Roy. It was an unjust end to a stunning innings, but it\u2019s England\u2019s fault for an indulgent review earlier in the innings. They\u2019ve done that a few times in the tournament. That innings, though. It touched the parts Kevin Pietersen used to reach, and there are few higher compliments, if any. 20th over: England 147-2 (Root 17, Morgan 0) I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine, England fans. It will be fine. Morgan is in the middle. A good solid English name, Eoin Morgan. But just in case, I\u2019ll leave you in the hands of Rob Smyth from now on. Happy hunting. Look, this really isn\u2019t a big deal. There\u2019s nothing to worry about. It\u2019s just one wicket. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. Roy is out! But he\u2019s not out. But he is. I\u2019ll explain. Roy hooks at Cummins down the leg side. Cummins appeals, and appeals, and appeals. Finally, after that appeal has gone to the full bench of the Supreme Court, Umpire Dharmasena raises a shaky hesitant finger. Roy expostulates, and immediately makes the review signal. And so does Dharmasena. But England don\u2019t have any reviews left! The umpire is flustered and has forgotten. Eventually the bad news comes down that they can\u2019t check the video. He relays this to Roy, who is still furious. He has to go. The replays show, as expected, the ball missed the glove by a few millimetres. Tough business, umpiring. 19th over: England 141-1 (Roy 84, Root 12) Roy pulls Stoinis, and Smith at midwicket gets a horrible bounce that leaves him partly unsighted and wrongfooted. The ball gets through for a boundary. This is England\u2019s day alright, they\u2019re romping into the World Cup final. Don\u2019t get all self-deprecating with your nervous emails about jinxes from here. Kick back on the banana lounge and open up a pi\u00f1a colada. 18th over: England 136-1 (Roy 79, Root 12) Starc gets the wicket second ball. Is this his moment? It absolutely is not. He bowls a snorter, a horrible delivery for a batsman, leaping at the ribs from a left-arm-over line, and somehow in a flailing fend Joe Root manages to shovel it through fine leg for four. Starc bowls fuller but too leg stump two balls later and Root glances that for four. Starc gets short and wide of off next, and Root cuts that for four. The sedate Test captain has 12 from 4 balls, strike rate of 300 thanks very much. Finally something goes the way of the Australians, but surely this is too late. Starc has had two spells that haven\u2019t worked out, but this third one does. Pace, into the pads, the old recipe. Bairstow nearly gets a nick on it but it beats his inside edge, and when Bairstow reviews it the technology proves as much. Bang in front. 17th over: England 124-0 (Roy 79, Bairstow 34) Stoinis nearly bowls a tidy over with his little mediums, but no one can manage it today. His sixth ball is a wide, and his seventh has Roy advancing and playing a swat-pull through midwicket for four. 16th over: England 116-0 (Roy 73, Bairstow 33) Steve Smith to bowl. This is gamble time. When Misbah-ul-Haq equalled the record for the fastest Test ton, half the runs came off two Steve Smith overs. Brace yourself. Roy takes a single. Bairstow drills a straight drive, but Maxwell puts in an incredible diving save coming across from long-on. Keeps them to one. Smith is about to wish that it had gone for four. Six, goes Roy with one that hangs in the air for a while and brings Maxwell into the frame. The Australian leaps at the right time but it clears him by a metre or two. Six, goes Roy with a dead straight hit, low and flat, between the two men down the ground and into the boundary boards. SIX, GOES ROY with the biggest of the lot, a bleeping ENORMOUS STRIKE that hits the top tier of the grandstand on the full! I\u2019m up in the media centre and it wasn\u2019t just coming to me as hyperbole, it was actually coming to me, at my height on the fourth floor, before fading to my right and hitting the Skyline Terrace on the full! That is absolute madness! And as it bounced back into play from four floors up, Glenn Maxwell casually catches the rebound off the building in one hand. That\u2019s out, in backyard cricket. 21 from the over. 15th over: England 95-0 (Roy 54, Bairstow 32) Finch knows he needs wickets yesterday. \u201cThe film Yesterday but I\u2019m the only who remembers when Australia could take wickets.\u201d So he brings back Starc. We mentioned not coming to the party. Starc is still doing laps on various freeway turn-offs and can\u2019t work his GPS. Three times he bowls half-volleys, and each batsman gets a chance to belt off-drives for four. That\u2019s drinks, while a truly awful rendition of I Am Australian is squeezed out by a couple of escapees from a ZZ Top cover band that got lost in deepest Alabama for 30 years. 14th over: England 80-0 (Roy 45, Bairstow 27) Australia just haven\u2019t shown up to the party today. Even Cummins, their best so far, has had his blemishes. Here\u2019s another, a short(crust pie) down leg that Roy can easily pull for four. A leading edge nearly carries to mid-off but (spoiler) it doesn\u2019t. 13th over: England 76-0 (Roy 41, Bairstow 27) Lyon nearly gets the breakthrough but Jonny gets the runs. A big swing, big edge, flying away for four. Hypocaust has the best numbers on the web. This is a very basic one by his standards. Tells a story though, even if 25 of those sixes came in a day against Afghanistan. 12th over: England 71-0 (Roy 40, Bairstow 23) Cummins does the Starc trick, losing a ball down leg side to concede five wides in one fell swoop. A bouncer that ran free, it could not be tamed. Then Bairstow runs his double and has his massage break. He limps through the over thereafter. A long delay in the 12th over while Jonny Bairstow gets treatment. Hamstring, groin, cramp? He seized up sprinting back for a second run and has been down on the ground since. He lost his footing a bit turning for a second, and things can break in these highly tuned athletes when that happens. After a long break with 14 medical staff, he\u2019s back on his feet. 11th over: England 63-0 (Roy 39, Bairstow 21) \u201cI will say emphatically,\u201d says Reg Gorczynski emphatically, \u201cthank God Vince isn\u2019t (wasn\u2019t) out there. Roy\u2019s recovery unquestionably saved England\u2019s World Cup, no matter what happens from now.\u201d I can verify from time stamps that he sent this before Roy casually smites Nathan Lyon\u2019s first ball for six. Dead straight, front leg out of the way, a golf swing through the line of a full ball. Pow. A few singles later, and a reverse sweep hit as hard as one can hit them, along the ground for four. The over costs 13. England\u2019s top pair are doing it again. 10th over: England 50-0 (Roy 27, Bairstow 20) They\u2019re starting to work Behrendorff around a bit more comfortably now, with Roy driving a couple through the covers amongst some singles. If you think I\u2019m wrong about Roy, look at this. The one on the right was that whip shot. 9th over: England 44-0 (Roy 23, Bairstow 18) Pat Cummins nearly bowls a maiden. Almost bowls a maiden. Deserves to bowl a maiden. Saws Roy in half at one stage. Pings a bouncer past his scone. Locks him up on the stumps. But from the final ball Roy somehow manages to flick it away square, and finds a gap for four. He\u2019s going to take England to this total. I\u2019m calling it now. 8th over: England 40-0 (Roy 19, Bairstow 18) Behrendorff is trying to sneak through onto the pads, and gives the appeal everything he has when it finally works. He throws his arms out wide and nearly blocks Roy from getting through for a leg bye. Not out. Bairstow responds with a fierce straight drive that scorches back past the bowler and under his attempt to field. Four. \u201cBearing in mind that there\u2019s been the possibility of some rain around 5pm are there any run marks or scenarios England have to be aware of if the game is curtailed or are we past that point now with a reserve day? Or are the mathematics just way too Zaltzman-esque to be bothered with? Yours anxiously, John Norris.\u201d John, as long as we get 20 overs in then we have a match, and there\u2019s no need to come back tomorrow. I don\u2019t have the DLS score in front of me but England would be well ahead of it at zero wickets down. It\u2019s not as simple as required rate, but they\u2019re ahead of the required rate anyway. They could be behind it and still ahead of DLS given they have ten wickets in hand. The DLS rate will skip upward as wickets are lost, but not much for the first couple of wickets, and increasingly sharply for wickets five, six, and beyond. 7th over: England 33-0 (Roy 19, Bairstow 12) There\u2019s a contrast. Cummins bowls his first over, tight on the stumps and giving no room to swing at anything. Throws in a good short ball as well that has Bairstow tap-dancing. The only runs come from the last ball, pushed through cover for two. Warner gets some pepper from the crowd as he fields back towards the rope. 6th over: England 31-0 (Roy 19, Bairstow 10) It... what... huh? I don\u2019t know how to describe that. There isn\u2019t exactly a shot that we know of that looks like it. Starc bowls outside leg stump. Roy reaches for it and whips it, but with a helicopter swish of the wrists, like taking Dhoni\u2019s stroke but then rotating it 45 degrees past point rather than long-on. It\u2019s entirely casual, barely seeming to connect. But the ball soars out over deep backward, and there\u2019s no short boundary today, but it flies over the man in the deep and beyond the second row of fences. That was... extraordinary. And considering Bairstow had already lashed the first ball of the over for four with a cut shot, very profitable. 5th over: England 19-0 (Roy 13, Bairstow 5) England even warier against Behrendorff than against Starc. Both batsmen are very watchful for the inswinger, playing straight and just nudging him to leg where they can for a run or two. \u201cPersonally I don\u2019t think we should even try to get 224,\u201d emails Kim Thonger. \u201cBetter to have a good solid unbeaten opening partnership of 150+ using the full allotted 50 overs as a statement of Ashes intent.\u201d It does feel very Ashes today, coloured kit notwithstanding. Grey cloudy skies, a full Hollies in good voice, a bit of swing, quality fast bowlers making life hard for everybody. 4th over: England 16-0 (Roy 11, Bairstow 4) That\u2019s more like it from Roy, though Starc fed him a full ball that was easily driven through the covers. Four runs to start the over is a big help though, and when Starc overcorrects Roy finds a couple more to midwicket. Starc gets it right thereafter, keeping the batsman guessing on off stump, mixing up the length. But it\u2019s the last ball of the over where Roy really takes control. Not a bad ball at all, but he stands up on the back foot and punches through extra cover for four. That\u2019s just asburd. Back of a length, 90 miles an hour, yet he\u2019s timed it away with what seems complete ease. What a difference a Jason Roy makes. 3rd over: England 6-0 (Roy 1, Bairstow 4) Hmm, this is the bit I\u2019m not sure about. It\u2019s a good over by Behrendorff, and Bairstow is beaten once, but he also lets it pass by without really looking to score. Conceding maidens to the opening bowlers from the other team just gives them too much control. It\u2019s a fine line, of course, but it feels like England\u2019s best chance of avoiding any mishaps is for this pair to start in the confident manner that they\u2019ve done so well in the past. 2nd over: England 6-0 (Roy 1, Bairstow 4) The Australians have been being mentored by Steve Waugh, and now Mitchell Starc has a red towel hanging out the back of his trousers. Coincidence? You decide. Starc is the one for Australia, if they can rescue this match. He starts bang on target, left-arm over to Roy and in tight on the stumps for the first four balls. The fourth cuts Roy in half and bashes into his back thigh. The fifth slides down leg for a wide. It\u2019s the only score from the over. 1st over: England 5-0 (Roy 1, Bairstow 4) And so, let the chase begin. Jason Behrendorff has the ball at the City End. He took five wickets against England only a couple of weeks ago, hooping one through James Vince to start his day. But Jason Roy is the opponent now, and after a couple of testing deliveries that move a fraction, Roy squeezes a run out to third man. Bairstow gets width and crashes it through cover. Bright start. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve had more emails about today: that you want Marina Hyde to do an OBO, or that Liam Plunkett is Irish. Both have been a deluge. You wouldn\u2019t have thought that the Irish could feel underrepresented in Eoin Morgan\u2019s team, but there you go. Look, fine \u2013 by the end of this summer we\u2019ll have Marina do an OBO live in Cork, if that will keep you wolves from the door. They\u2019ve done the job, the home side. Half of it, any rate. It doesn\u2019t look that difficult to bat out there, but they just got early wickets and put the squeeze on Australia, and despite a couple of excellent partnerships in defiance, the batting side were always coming from too far back. Smith was the core of that resistance with 85, and built beautifully with Carey (46), entertainingly with Maxwell (22), and desperately with Starc (29). England though made the running, with Woakes and Archer immaculate early and returning for valuable later spells, while Rashid came through the middle and struck three telling blows. Woakes had 3 for 20, Archer 2 for 32, and Rashid 3 for 54, while Wood picked up a bonus wicket at the end. So, what happens? Do England go after this total in their usual ebullient style? You\u2019d hope so. They\u2019ll let themselves in for trouble if they get too careful. But low chases can play tricks on batting teams, where a par score might leave them clearer in their minds. Australia\u2019s big hope is Mitchell Starc. He\u2019s been devastating in the second innings of matches, and guess what Australia bowled out England for a couple of weeks ago? 221. Different time, different place, but this chase won\u2019t be easy. 49th over: Australia 223-10 (Lyon 1) It\u2019s all over! Full, straight, good enough. Behrendorff plays about one third each of four different shots at that ball, and none of them were the shot required. Wood lights up the stumps like a celebratory cigar. 48th over: Australia 218-9 (Lyon 1, Behrendorff 0) Nearly another run out, as Lyon just hits and runs towards point, but Archer misses with the throw. That\u2019s the only score from an over that also brought two wickets. Woakes has 3 for 20 from eight. I\u2019m being schooled in the emails by Ruairi O hEithir, who on name alone I would never dare disagree with on any matters Gaelic. \u201cWhen the Normans came to Ireland in the 12th century some of them were named \u2018Blanchet\u2019 and \u2018Plunkett\u2019 was the best the Irish could do in pronouncing it. This means Cate Blanchett\u2019s name is really Catriona Plunkett...\u201d Lovely bowling, Ruairi. Two in two balls! Is Buttler on a hat-trick? Starc took the strike during that run out. He aims another huge drive, but only tickles it as it angles across him. Both members of Australia\u2019s resistance have gone. Brilliant work from Buttler behind the stumps. Smith drops the ball away near his feet and starts running. Buttler tears in from behind the stumps, picks it up, and throws down the non-striker\u2019s stumps with an inch to spare! No century for Australia\u2019s former captain today. Fine fielding. 47th over: Australia 217-7 (Smith 85, Starc 29) Smart batting from Starc, knocking Wood out into the deep to leg a couple of times and getting back for two. 46th over: Australia 210-7 (Smith 83, Starc 24) Chris Woakes returns to try to close out the the innings. A few more singles and this partnership swells to 44. The last ball of the over hits Smith on the pad, close, zipping in from an angle outside off and beating the edge to hit him above the knee roll. England review the not out, and the reconstruction says that it\u2019s umpire\u2019s call, with the ball possibly grazing or going over the bails. 45th over: Australia 206-7 (Smith 82, Starc 22) A big wind-up from Starc, and he goes down the ground for six! That\u2019s one way to start the over. Clean straight drive in the air from Plunkett. The batsmen trade singles, then Plunkett slips in a wide. Starc flicks square and bails out of the second run, but just as well because Smith goes back early, sets up for the slower ball, and pounds it through midwicket for four. A lot of people are complaining in the emails that this bowler does not have an English name, he has an Irish one. I was thinking of the Plunkett bit rather than the Liam bit. I can\u2019t hear it in anything but a Yorkshire accent. But anyway, we settler Australians can\u2019t tell our Scots from our Welsh from our Dutch. It\u2019s all part of the white colonial hodgepodge. 44th over: Australia 192-7 (Smith 77, Starc 14) There\u2019s the boundary! Starc loves to drive straight, so when Wood pitches up he does exactly that. Mid-off is up, and the ball streaks inside his line and down to the fence. Starc hits an on-drive just as sweetly next ball, but this time it goes straight to midwicket inside the circle. There\u2019s a wide, then a single as Starc digs out a full ball and Smith is live to the opportunity. This partnership worth 26 now. 43rd over: Australia 186-7 (Smith 77, Starc 9) Plunkett to Starc, who pulls for a run. Smith belts through for a scrappy single and could have been run out at the non-striker\u2019s end, but Root\u2019s throw from midwicket misses. Smith is trying to find a method against Plunkett\u2019s slower balls, and eventually cocks his wrists to place a lovely back-cut past backward point. But England\u2019s field is well set and the man in the deep gets around to stop it. The last boundary came from Maxwell in the 34th over. 42nd over: Australia 181-7 (Smith 74, Starc 7) Wood to Starc, and Smith is instant in calling for a run when the ball cannons off Starc\u2019s thigh pad. Finally Smith has strike back. But he can only get a leg bye himself in similar fashion. The pair get a few singles going. Australia battling to make 200 at this rate. 41st over: Australia 176-7 (Smith 73, Starc 5) Liam Plunkett, such a solid English name and such a solid English over. Starc hits the field a couple of times, misses the swish a couple of times, and blocks one on his stumps. Finally skews an edge away for a run from the last ball. \u201cSpeaking of crossover OBOs,\u201d writes Abhinav Dutta, \u201cthis one goes beyond Guardian\u2019s offices and into the territory of the sublime or the perverse, depending on what mood Zizek is in. It would be nice to read hairy bear Slavoj sniffling after every over while traipsing through Hegel, Lacan and Marx. Wonder when or what he would deem fit as pure negation in cricket. Glenn Maxwell\u2019s breezy knocks straddle both the sublime and the perverse; which I hazard Zizek will turn into an exegesis on the cricket industry\u2019s hype factory.\u201d Wonder if we can tie this in with our correspondent from the Guggenheim earlier. Cricket\u2019s art and philosophy. Yuzvendra Chagall, anyone? 40th over: Australia 175-7 (Smith 73, Starc 4) Here\u2019s Mark Wood. He\u2019s not as hard to hit as Archer has been, and Smith stands up tall to drive a couple off the back foot straight of sweeper cover, then tucks a single away. Starc guides a run to third man easily enough. The Australian No9 won\u2019t hold back too much longer, I wouldn\u2019t imagine. 39th over: Australia 171-7 (Smith 70, Starc 3) Smith is happy to give Starc plenty of strike against Archer, taking singles as they arise. Starc edges on his own, then later clips two runs square. Good shot. Can bat. Holds the record for the most sixes in a Test innings at the MCG, actually. Seven, I think it was? Archer bowls out with 2 for 32 from his ten. Hopefully David Murray is feeling better than he was quarter of an hour ago, when he wrote \u201cI can\u2019t bear this. I know we\u2019re doing well but even if we get one of these guys out (Smith or Maxwell) I just know Cummins and Lyon will come in and get runs. The England team won\u2019t like me for it but I\u2019m prepared to make a deal with the powers that be: let us win today and the nice Kiwi boys can have the final. Can you please forward my offer to the appropriate channels.\u201d Offer rescinded? Smith is still out there... 38th over: Australia 166-7 (Smith 68, Starc 0) Adil Rashid. He hasn\u2019t had the best tournament, has looked uncomfortable at times with his shoulder, but has put together the most telling performance here today. With the number 95 on his back, one can only assume in tribute to Tino Best, he bowls to Starc, foxing him utterly with a googly that spins past edge and off stump. Then again, with the same result, the left-hander going right back on his stumps and trying to defend them. There it goes! The extinguishing comes not from Archer, but Rashid! The leggie kicks another one out. Cummins backs away looking to cut, but only gets a little top edge straight to slip. Turn and bounce. 37th over: Australia 165-6 (Smith 67, Cummins 6) Morgan keeps Archer on, looking to extinguish this Australian innings now. Good captaincy. Don\u2019t let them build a rearguard. But Cummins handles Archer pretty well, steering a couple of runs, glancing a couple, and playing softly enough that a leading edge doesn\u2019t carry back to the bowler from a slower ball. 36th over: Australia 161-6 (Smith 67, Cummins 2) Right then. It\u2019s Smith and Cummins. Remember, the pair that ground England into submission in the Brisbane Test not so long ago? Cummins won\u2019t mind having a long time to bat, that\u2019s more his style than crash-bang. They collect four singles from Rashid. I\u2019ll tell you what, the Marina Hyde OBO is getting wild support. My email inbox has gone into meltdown. Somebody ring Kath Viner and tell her what the people want. We can make a separate subset of the Guardian supporters\u2019 model and launch when it reaches a target. 35th over: Australia 157-6 (Smith 65, Cummins 0) Archer got the chance to take that wicket because he bowled two very high bouncers in a row that were called wide. If that was setting up Maxwell to expect a full-pace ball, then it worked. Clever bowling. It\u2019s been a frustrating World Cup for Maxwell and for those who love his work. Lots of glimpses, never a full picture, after his excellent few months leading into this tournament. Archer 2 for 23 off eight. Archer gets his man! Not in the way you might have expected. Back of a length, and Maxwell is trying to do the sensible thing with the over nearly gone, defending off the back foot. But Archer bowls a smart off-cutter, and it sticks in the pitch substantially, slowing up. Maxwell is through his shot early and the ball loops off the splice to cover. Oh, dear. 34th over: Australia 152-5 (Smith 63, Maxwell 21) Lovely shot from Maxwell! He\u2019s got such bat speed when he goes at the ball. Smacks Rashid over midwicket, but a routinely sensational piece of boundary fielding from Bairstow saves two runs. Rashid though doesn\u2019t meet the challenge well, dragging down and letting Maxwell pummel a more violent shot squarer for four! Then he cuts, hard, through cover but again the sweeper saves. Maxwell loving the spin, or taking the chance to get as many as he can while he can. 33rd over: Australia 144-5 (Smith 62, Maxwell 14) Archer resumes, and I don\u2019t know if its deliberate but Smith takes up the first five balls of the over. Can\u2019t beat the field a couple of times, and Archer beats the edge another time. Maxwell again plays sensibly and takes a single off his one delivery. \u201cIs it possible to get a Marina Hyde OBO?\u201d asks Ravikiran Ramakrishnan. Or at least an MBM? Imagine her doing the MBM for that England Cameroon game, or even the USA semis...\u201d I\u2019ll tell you what, I hope so. I\u2019m going to kick this up the chain of command. I saw Marina in the Guardian lobby a couple of weeks ago but was too starstruck to say hello. Can I just advise that during the drinks break, Test Match Special\u2019s young and talented producer Henry Moeran has got himself a go on the cricket bat guitar by the sideline. It turns out he can play guitar as well, as he shreds a power solo before flipping his hair back into place and going back upstairs to keep the radio commentary on track. Talented people, hey? 32nd over: Australia 142-5 (Smith 61, Maxwell 13) Rashid to Smith. Teases him once. Teases him twice. Lots of loop. A googly. Smith eventually works a single fine. Maxwell on strike, and he goes downtown for six! Didn\u2019t skip down to that one, just saw the length was full enough and got a big stride in, and with mid-on up in the circle, had no hesitation giving that ball everything he has. It soars over the fence. Then Maxwell proves his temperament by defending the last two balls. Drinks. 31st over: Australia 135-5 (Smith 60, Maxwell 7) Here we go, here we go. Immediately Morgan brings back Archer to bowl to Maxwell. They want to target him with the short ball once again. A couple of normal length, then the first shorter one. Maybe a slower ball? Maxwell picks it and nails it for four! Pulled through midwicket. Back goes Archer to bowl again. Wheels on that one! It sizzles through at helmet height, and Maxwell ducks early and ducks often. This is some game of cricket today. 30th over: Australia 130-5 (Smith 59, Maxwell 3) Rashid bowls and it\u2019s edged! Suddenly the leg-spinner is whirring down pure terror. Maxwell\u2019s edge goes low and grounded past slip for a couple, then there\u2019s a similar shot for a single. \u201cAn inspired piece of captaincy there, making that switch,\u201d writes Robin Hazlehurst. \u201cRob was obviously flagging a little after that great start to the innings, but you get brought on and immediately a double breakthrough. Obviously makes sense to keep you on for now, but I wonder if the skipper should consider giving a couple of overs to someone from left field to break this partnership if it looks dangerous. Emma John, say? Any idea what the strategy will be in the second innings?\u201d What would the equivalent of Matthew Wade bowling be for the OBO? George Monbiot? Can we get Charlie Brooker back? I\u2019ll tell you what, I would subscribe for a decade to read Marina Hyde\u2019s over-by-over. 29th over: Australia 127-5 (Smith 58, Maxwell 1) Smith takes a brace then a single. Hearts in mouths for Maxwell fans the world over, but he eases early fears by taking a sober and sensible single off his pads from Stokes. On strike, Steve Smith decides to up the tempo himself with a glorious cover drive for four. Rob Smyth has just sent me through a Yellow Warning from the Met Office, which sounds dire. 28th over: Australia 118-5 (Smith 50) Smith brought up his half-century amongst all that chaos. Glenn Maxwell is coming to the middle after the last ball of the over. Rashid was battling, being hit, but suddenly he has 2 for 31 from five overs. He\u2019s been given! Huge appeal from Rashid, that was a performance like Les Miserables just before the intermission. He spun around, then ran towards the umpire and knelt down before Dharmasena, pleading. Marius to Cosette. A slider that skidded on and hit Stoinis bang in front. A touch high but the replay says yes on umpire\u2019s call. Australia had no review to challenge it anyway. Rashid gets the breakthrough! One that England were thirsting for. The worry was rising with each passing over at the ground. I was getting sotto voce complaints about [adjective] Australians from passing colleagues. But here it is. Carey advances to Rashid, and for reasons best known to himself, tries a big loft over the leg side with men out in the deep. Vince is substituting on the field and steadies himself under it at deep midwicket for a simple enough take. 27th over: Australia 118-3 (Smith 48, Carey 46) Stokes carries on from the city end for a quiet over. Smith glides a single to third man to raise the fifty partnership, then Carey pulls a couple of runs hard through the leg side. He\u2019s played so well. 26th over: Australia 113-3 (Smith 47, Carey 44) That\u2019s right folks, today it\u2019s Rob and I with the old roshambo. In my mind that means a sort of dance where we take turns, but then I wasn\u2019t sure and googled it and apparently it\u2019s a game where two people take turns kicking each other in the crotch. I hope that the next 50 overs will be more enjoyable than that. Poor Adil Rashid is rather roshamboed by Carey on the sweep shot out to deep midwicket for four. Throw in a single every other ball plus a wide from the first, and that\u2019s a double-figure over for Rash. 25th over: Australia 103-3 (Smith 44, Carey 38) A wide from Plunkett takes Australia in to three figures. They have, almost by stealth, got themselves right back in this game. England are still on top, but only just. That\u2019s it from me. Geoff Lemon will be with you for the next few hours \u2013 please email him on Geoff.Lemon@theguardian.com or tweet @GeoffLemonSport. See you later for England\u2019s squeaky run-chase. 24th over: Australia 98-3 (Smith 42, Carey 37) I\u2019m not sure about Rashid today. The ball isn\u2019t turning, his confidence is low and so far he has been milked with ease. England have six bowlers so they aren\u2019t as reliant on him as they might be. An overthrow from Stokes gives Smith an extra run. It\u2019s not exactly unravelling for England, but a couple of loose threads have emerged in the last half an hour. That said, Australia\u2019s response to a crisis - and, in Carey\u2019s case, a mangled jaw - has been so impressive. \u201cI\u2019m at the Peggy Guggenheim in Venice, the Jean ARP exhibition talks about how \u2018the rhapsodic evocation of a creaturely art with a life of its own\u2019,\u201d says Tim Woollias. \u201cIt\u2019s as if he knew the disappointment of a Smith/Carey rebuild after three early wickets.\u201d 23rd over: Australia 92-3 (Smith 37, Carey 36) Carey laces Plunkett through extra cover for four, a glorious shot from a player who has been a revelation at this tournament. Smith then flashes Plunkett this far short of Stokes at backward point. It wasn\u2019t a chance, although Stokes\u2019s face suggests he\u2019s annoyed at his inability to dive forward five yards, extend a telescopic arm and clutch it with his little finger. \u201cIn 1984, the Demon of Frome, Colin Dredge, was Somerset\u2019s leading wicket taker against Warwickshire in the Benson &amp; Hedges\u2019 Cup,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cI\u2019m fairly confident that Colin\u2019s mum would have called it Dredgebaston that day, even though Somerset lost and his figures were 2 for 66 off 11.\u201d 22nd over: Australia 87-3 (Smith 37, Carey 30) England\u2019s success has been built on Rashid and Plunkett taking wickets in the middle overs, and they could use one now. Carey, who is an excellent player of spin, sweeps off middle stump for a couple, and a handful of singles make it a decent over for Australia. I wonder if Morgan is tempted to give Archer a two-over burst. It\u2019s probably too early. \u201cThe ground has filled up but still a good many empty seats,\u201d says David Malcolm. \u201cPoor for such a critical match. Ground only has a capacity of 24000. Would not happen in any other sport where stadiums are much larger. Goes to show how much the Indian fans have boosted attendances. I think it fair to say there has only been a lukewarm response to the tournament in UK. Just look at the very limited media coverage. A big problem for English cricket that this has failed to attract interest beyond existing fans.\u201d New fans are so next year. (Plus, in the interest of balance, the ECB would disagree.) 21st over: Australia 80-3 (Smith 35, Carey 26) Plunkett replaces Wood, who bowled a scruffy spell of 4-0-20-0. A misfield from Stokes gives Smith a single and Stokes a zap of self-loathing. Two singles from the over. 20th over: Australia 78-3 (Smith 34, Carey 25) Adil Rashid replaces Liam Plunkett, who is more of a 150 for three bowler than 50 for three. Rashid has had a poor tournament, but he has a good record on this ground \u2013 including a matchwinning four-for against Australia in the Champions Trophy two years ago. Carey drives uppishly but between mid-off and extra cover for four. It looked like a chance but I\u2019d say he had the placement under control. Make no mistake, Australia are right back in this game. Meanwhile, here\u2019s our star columnist Max Rushden on the possible impact of a free-to-air World Cup final. If if if. 19th over: Australia 72-3 (Smith 33, Carey 20) Smith pulls Wood round the corner for four, another authoritative stroke. He has done the bulk of the scoring in the last few overs, with Carey \u2013 who has scored 12 from his last 31 balls - looking secure but strokeless. He\u2019s got plenty in his locker when he decides it\u2019s time. \u201cVery impressed by Carey, not just his courage, but his ability with the bat,\u201d says John Jones. \u201cLooks a top-class player to me and surely must play in the Ashes. As for Handscombe, was there anything more predictable than his embarrassing effort today? Was delighted when he was selected. Walking wicket.\u201d Carey\u2019s first-class record isn\u2019t great (he averages 29), but it\u2019s hard to reconcile that with what we\u2019ve seen in this tournament. He looks a brilliant all-round batsman. With Handscombe, so much depends on conditions. 18th over: Australia 66-3 (Smith 28, Carey 19) Four from Plunkett\u2019s over, which means Australia have scored 38 from the last six. They\u2019re having a good spell, and a single from Smith brings up an excellent fifty partnership. I was going to say \u2018clear-headed\u2019 but I doubt Carey\u2019s head feels too clear. \u201cMany reasons why England should win,\u201d says Krishnamoorthy V. \u201cWe will have a new winner of the World Cup - like 2010 FIFA when Spain met the Netherlands. Will be a much-needed boost to the English who went on an \u2018It\u2019s coming home\u2019 whole of last summer Will be nice to see two gentlemanly teams in the final - like two Japanese trying to out bow each other. Eff all that, I can\u2019t stand Australia.\u201d 17th over: Australia 62-3 (Smith 27, Carey 16) Wood has changed ends and replaces Stokes. Smith jumps across to work a short ball for two and then scythes a drive behind square for four. England are letting this drift a bit, although Australia with a lot of intelligence and mental strength \u2013 and, in Carey\u2019s case, extraordinary courage. 16th over: Australia 55-3 (Smith 21, Carey 15) Liam Plunkett replaces Mark Wood. Smith, who looks much better after a jittery start, drives his first ball crisply whence it came for four. Carey does likewise later in the over, and a half-stop from Roy at mid-off saves one run. Australia have recovered impressively from that traumatic first 10 overs. The upside of such a bad start is that, if Australia do win, it will feel infinitely sweeter. The reverse is true for England. \u201cRob,\u201d says Romeo. \u201cRather than Kumble, Carey makes me think of another Aussie with a jaw problem, Rick McCosker, who was a bit of a hero in the Centenary Test of 1977.\u201d 15th over: Australia 47-3 (Smith 16, Carey 12) The commentator Mel Jones makes the point that Handscomb will probably keep wicket for Australia. Carey\u2019s injury looks really nasty, with the swelling increasing by the over, and I\u2019m slightly surprised he\u2019s continuing. That\u2019s drinks. \u201cIf....and it\u2019s a big if.....Archer and Woakes continue to bowl as they\u2019ve done all tournament, then is the big loser poor Stuart Broad?\u201d says Kevin Wilson. \u201cArcher must play in the Ashes and Woakes will find nibble and contribute nicely with the bat. Assuming Mo is the sole spinner at eight, surely Broad is sweating on Anderson\u2019s injury?\u201d I never thought I\u2019d say this about the Ashes, but who cares? (A-hem. It\u2019s all about rotation these days so I think he\u2019ll play at least two or three of the Tests. And Stuart Broad is almost as dangerous as Jonny Bairstow when he has a point to prove.\u201d 14th over: Australia 45-3 (Smith 15, Carey 11) Carey received more treatment at the end of the previous over, and now he has a full wraparound bandage like Anil Kumble all those years ago. It looks like his jaw is swelling up, yet he could barely look more composed at the crease. He really has got something about him. His partner, Smith, gets his first boundary by dragging a short ball from Stokes through midwicket. England\u2019s intensity has dropped since the double bowling change, and they need to be a bit careful about allowing Australia to build a partnership. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Elliot Carr-Barnsley. \u201cHow do we assess Michael Bevan (who played in that semi-final) nowadays? Considered the eminent ODI player of his generation, how would he fare today? He batted low in a team that won often (Not Out in 67 of 196 innings), scoring only 6 hundreds at a strike rate of 74, with 21 sixes. Would that extrapolate up to conform to the modern game? Or would his natural game be outmoded today? Does he even have a legacy now? His role as a finisher without being a biffer doesn\u2019t seem to be suitable for study. (BTW I love him and it\u2019s worth noting that he\u2019s a statistically perfect all-rounder in every form of the game).\u201d I think he\u2019s the greatest finisher of all time along with MS Dhoni. (I know it sounds a bit pretentious but I\u2019d classify Virat Kohli as a run-chaser, as his role is different.) Bevan\u2019s game as was wouldn\u2019t work today, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019d have adapted. The same is true of other great finishers like Neil Fairbrother, Allan Lamb and the rest. 13th over: Australia 36-3 (Smith 7, Carey 10) Mark Wood replaces the brilliant Chris Woakes (6-0-16-2). \u201cHe should really enjoy this surface,\u201d says Ian Bishop, a millisecond before Wood spears a first-ball wide outside off stump. He beats Carey for pace later in the over, before brilliant fielding from Woakes at fine leg and then Stokes at backward point saves a total of five runs. Wood\u2019s over, a mixed bag, includes three wides - but he finishes by zipping one past Smith\u2019s outside edge. 12th over: Australia 28-3 (Smith 6, Carey 9) Ben Stokes replaces Jofra Archer, who bowled a majestic opening spell of 5-0-11-1. Smith drives a single through the covers, which gives Stokes three balls at Carey. This guy is a dangerous customer, and he has played beautifully since wearing that bouncer from Archer. For now he is happy to build an innings rather than counter-attack, and those three deliveries are all dots. \u201cEngland have home conditions, better players and now a dream start,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cIf they don\u2019t get this over the line, we\u2019ll never win this thing.\u201d When England are bowled out for 12, chasing 371, Gary Naylor\u2019s address will be available on an honesty-box basis. 11th over: Australia 28-3 (Smith 5, Carey 9) Woakes\u2019 sixth over, probably the last of this spell, yields just a single to Smith. England will surely keep hunting wickets, having watched Australia recover from abysmal starts with the bat to beat both West Indies and New Zealand earlier in the tournament. Never give a sucker an even break. 10th over: Australia 27-3 (Smith 4, Carey 9) The game is starting to settle down after that eye-widening start. Smith works a short ball from Archer off the hip for a single, his fourth from 24 balls. That scoring rate is fine in the circumstances. \u201cHalf empty ground for a World Cup semi-final,\u201d says David Malcolm. \u201cI know this is because Indian fans bought up most of the tickets thinking their side would play at Edgbaston but it does not look good.\u201d Really? It doesn\u2019t look half empty on TV. And it certainly doesn\u2019t sound half empty. If you\u2019re into the whole optimism/pessimism thing, Australia have also won a World Cup semi-final from 39 for six \u2013 and it was against England. But they were chasing a target of 94. 9th over: Australia 24-3 (Smith 2, Carey 8) Carey is fine to continue, and he crunches a cover-drive for four off Woakes. He has started really impressively. \u201cThe narrative for this game,\u201d says Alex Netherton, \u201chas been thrown into stark disarray.\u201d Wait till you what it\u2019s done to the tactics board. 8th over: Australia 19-3 (Smith 2, Carey 4) Carey punches Archer down the ground for three, an impressively assured stroke. He doesn\u2019t look so assured when Archer draws blood with a brutal bouncer. It hit Carey on the grille, knocking his helmet off and cutting him just above the chin. There will be a break in play while he receives treatment \u201cThere was near-unanimous agreement among cricket commentators that losing Khawaja mightn\u2019t be such a bad thing,\u201d says Joe Roberts. \u201cHow much are they missing him now? Seems like just the man for this job.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s an excellent point. I suppose we envisaged Handscomb coming in at 120 for two at 23 overs. In these circumstances, he looked a walking wicket. 7th over: Australia 15-3 (Smith 1, Carey 2) Alex Carey, who has quietly been one of the players of the tournament, has been promoted to No5. He edges his first ball on the bounce to second slip. Australia have won a World Cup semi-final from the depths of 15 for four, so they will know there\u2019s a way out of this. But at the moment they are in oodles of trouble. Woakes and Archer have bowled with forensic skill. That was lovely bowling from Woakes, especially to a creasebound player like Handscomb. It was full and shaped back in, and all Handscomb could do was inside-edge a drive onto the stumps. Chris Woakes has knocked him over with a ripper! 6th over: Australia 14-2 (Smith 1, Handscomb 4) Archer beats Handscomb with a sensational delivery that seams past the outside edge. He is bowling outrageously well, and the next ball holds its line to beat the bat once more. Archer\u2019s figures of 3-0-4-1. \u201cTypo?\u201d asks Boris Starling. \u201cI like \u2018Jonny Bairstow took the match\u2019 rather than \u2018took the catch\u2019..... (in fairness, you did say the first 10 overs might decide this either way.)\u201d Aaaaach, sorry. I do hope that wasn\u2019t Freudian hubris. 5th over: Australia 13-2 (Smith 1, Handscomb 3) Handscomb survives another huge LBW appeal from Woakes. There might have been an inside-edge. Woakes wants to review but Morgan and Buttler overrule him. It\u2019s the right decision, becuse replays show there was a late inside edge. Australia are hanging on for dear life. But if there\u2019s one team that can win after such a torrid start, it\u2019s them. 4th over: Australia 12-2 (Smith 1, Handscomb 2) Smith flashes and misses at Archer, who then sends down a blistering bouncer that Smith avoids. He has started very nervously, although he often does. If he gets through this opening spell, he won\u2019t care how many false strokes he plays. 3rd over: Australia 11-2 (Smith 1, Handscomb 1) \u201cSure, Mr. Alt-J wrote in,\u201d sniffs Mac Millings, \u201cbut I\u2019ve written in many times, and you\u2019ve *not once* mentioned that I was in Glistening Mother. We played two shows (in China - long story). The band collapsed after three of us (we were a five-piece) didn\u2019t turn up to the second gig, and of the two who did, I was far too drunk to sing.\u201d I\u2019m sensing the great lost Netflix documentary. Blimey. This is extraordinary stuff. That would have been another golden duck for Australia. Replays showed it was just hitting the top of the stumps, which means England keep their review. This looks incredibly close. This is an awesome start for England. Warner had dumped the previous ball back over Woakes\u2019s head, a shot of spectacular disdain. Woakes followed up with a sharp back-of-a-length delivery that Warner could only fence to first slip, where Warner\u2019s mate Jonny Bairstow took the match with unashamed glee. David Warner has gone! Test Match Special link Go here, and click \u2018Listen Live\u2019 2nd over: Australia 6-1 (Warner 5, Smith 1) Steve Smith is the new batsman. It\u2019s Warner and Smith v England, yet again. Archer greets Smith with a bouncer, and then induces an inside-edge into the leg side. This is a scorching start from Archer, who bowled so poorly against Australia at Lord\u2019s. Smith gets off the mark with a quick single, and then Warner tucks a short ball off the hip for another. That Finch review looks a poor one, because he missed the ball by a fair way, but Michael Clarke makes the point that his bat thumped into his pad and the combination of sound and sensation probably made him think he might have inside-edged it. \u201cAnd I thought Gus Unger-Hamilton was an anagram!\u201d says Steve Hudson. \u201cJust spent half an hour trying to decode it.\u201d He\u2019s out! Aaron Finch has gone for a golden duck! It was a beautiful inswinger from Jofra Archer, and it was hitting the top of middle. Australia lose their captain - and their review. Oh my. It might have been bat then pad. If not, he\u2019s in trouble. 1st over: Australia 4-0 (Warner 4, Finch 0) Now that\u2019s how you set a tone. David Warner leans into the first ball of the match, which is a bit too full from Woakes, and times it thrillingly through extra cover for four. Whatever you think of him as a man, he is the most magnificent cricketer. Woakes pulls his length back thereafter, and the remainder of the over - five dot balls - is excellent. \u201cHow about the Bruminator?\u201d says Brian Withington. Hmm, doesn\u2019t that sound a bit like a groundbreaking toilet brush? There have been two opening partnerships of note against England in this tournament, and they lost both games. There\u2019s a credible scenario whereby this first 10 overs decides the game. David Warner is heartily booed on the field, which is a bit tedious, and probably counter-productive. Chris Woakes will bowl the first over, and things are about to get exceedingly real. Edgbaston nickname \u201cJust \u2018the Edge\u2019,\u201d says Jane Evans. \u201cIf it works for pretentious rock musicians ... As the game progresses, I will be on edge. Or at the edge of reason.\u201d A few of you have also suggested \u2018Edgbastard\u2019, which is kind of catchy, if slightly problematic for the host broadcaster. The Million There has been a lot of talk about the visibility of this World Cup, but this is a nice story from our friends at the ECB: Ahead of England\u2019s World Cup semi-final clash against Australia, England &amp; Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and International Cricket Council (ICC) celebrated the impact that the ICC Men\u2019s Cricket World Cup has had in inspiring young people \u2013 with over one million children aged five-12 connecting with the sport. The milestone was celebrated at Yorkmead Primary School in Birmingham with ambassadors Jonathan Trott and Danielle Hazell in attendance alongside local schoolchildren who will join the players on the pitch for the national anthems at the hotly anticipated fixture at Edgbaston tomorrow. The achievement comes as a result of the plan to use the ICC Men\u2019s Cricket World Cup to connect with children and young people - a key aim of the ECB\u2019s plan to grow the game. To help inspire the next generation to fall in love with cricket, partners and stakeholders across the game have worked on initiatives including Cricket World Cup Club Family Days, the Cricket World Cup Schools Programme and fan zone activations. You can read more here. Thanks for all your emails. I have approximately 0.00 per cent chance of reading them all during the game, but please keep them coming! Also, I\u2019m disappointed that none of you noticed that Mr Alt-J emailed this morning (or somebody with the same name). The pitch is bald and dry, which suggests Nathan Lyon and Adil Rashid could play a big part in the game. But a lot of the pitches at this tournament have been bald-faced liars, so we shouldn\u2019t assume too much. Play starts in 15 minutes. I\u2019m off to procure a dangerously strong coffee. And then it will be time for Australia v England, the World Cup semi-final. \u201cG\u2019day Rob,\u201d says Seb Prowse. \u201cA shout out from my no. 19 tram in Melbourne to any Aussies supporting the opposition today. Of course, it\u2019s hard to get behind the Poms with real enthusiasm. But the alternative \u2014 creaming NZ in the final to complete the rehabilitation of Warner, Smith and Cricket Australia \u2014 doesn\u2019t bear thinking about. Carn the Kiwis.\u201d \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Nick Parish. \u201cDefeat is unthinkable? Blimey. And there was me thinking you were a long-suffering England supporter. Defeat couldn\u2019t be more thinkable. I\u2019ve been thinking about it non-stop ever since Saturday evening.\u201d My point exactly. Painful statgasm Seventeen of the last 21 matches at this tournament have been won the team batting first. England will point to the fact it\u2019s a fresh pitch, and they loved chasing before the tournament. It\u2019s an excellent toss for Australia to win, though, NQAT. A shock move from England, who have recalled Sir Ian Botha- sorry, let\u2019s try that again. England are unchanged. Australia bring in Peter Handscomb for Usman Khawaja, which is surely a good thing, especially as it means Steve Smith will go up to No3. This is Handscomb\u2019s World Cup debut. He\u2019s got nothing on Ned Larkins, who made his international debut for England in the 1979 semi-final. Australia Finch (c), Warner, Smith, Handscomb, Stoinis, Maxwell, Carey (wk), Cummins, Starc, Lyon, Behrendorff England Roy, Bairstow, Root, Morgan (c), Stokes, Buttler (wk), Woakes, Plunkett, Rashid, Archer, Wood. Well that was fun while it lasted. Eoin Morgan says he\u2019s \u201cnot really bothered\u201d but that he would have batted first. The toss is a couple of minutes away. And it looks a pretty good one to win. A few of you have suggested \u2018Edgbastion\u2019 as England\u2019s answer to the Gabbatoir. \u201cNot exactly fear-inducing,\u201d says Richard Hart, \u201cbut I think it has a pleasing and understated Englishness about it.\u201d Why don\u2019t we just call it the Melbourne Cricket Ground and make Australia feel even more comfortable? Today\u2019s soundtrack \u201cHi from Singapore,\u201d says Honor Harger. \u201cSo without wanting to tempt fate or anything: when was the last time Australia won a match at Edgbaston again?\u201d It was when Tim Henman was a Wimbledon semi-finalist. A while ago, then. \u201cDear Rob,\u201d writes Gus Unger-Hamilton. \u201cLong time follower, first time emailer. I\u2019m just thinking, seeing as England supposedly love playing at Edgbaston so much, don\u2019t we need a fear-inducing nickname for it, \u00e0 la the Gabbattoir? Perhaps people have some ideas better than Sledgbaston, which is terrible.\u201d It\u2019s not that good. Any suggestions? Never mind the cricket, there\u2019s enough ebb and flow in the weather forecast. We are now promised sunny intervals changing to cloudy at lunchtime. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI\u2019m off out for a bracing walk. It\u2019s good for your mental health. Be back in eight hours...\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just a cricket match,\u201d says Jane Evans. Only cricket. Not important. Just a cricket match. Just cricket. Only cricket ...\u201d I\u2019m sure you know the story of England\u2019s last World Cup semi-final, the rain-affected farce against South Africa in 1992. What I really want to know is: has this poor chap recovered yet? There are infinite possibilities today, with so many matchwinners on both sides. It could come down to three things: the toss, the battle of the opening partnerships and how England respond to adversity. They are probably the better side, but Australia are probably the tougher side. They have won all seven World Cup semi-finals (if you\u2019re into the whole pedantry thing, they\u2019ve won six and tied one) and have fought back to win a few games in this tournament. England got themselves out of a hole to quality for the semi-finals, and were enormously impressive in doing so. But they haven\u2019t really come from behind to win a match at this tournament. They are formidable front-runners, and the ideal scenario is that they bat first, are 100 for nought after 15 overs and control the game throughout. It\u2019s not going to be like that. If I had to pick the deciding factor in this game, it\u2019s how England cope if they are 10 for two or Australia are 100 for nought. The toss Guardian exclusive: whoever wins it will bat first. Australia hammered England in the league match two weeks ago. The margin of victory \u2013 64 runs \u2013 isn\u2019t huge, but trust me, it was a doing. England have rationalised it as a hangover from the Sri Lanka fiasco, which is a clever move, if they genuinely believe it. I suspect they do. But I wouldn\u2019t want to go fishing round their subconscious without a protective suit. If the match ends in a tie - like the last World Cup semi-final on this ground - the match will go to a Super Over, and we\u2019ll all be reduced to wibble. Breakfast reading The weather It\u2019s beautiful at Edgbaston this morning, although the Met Office are forecasting thunderstorms for early evening. That means DLS could be a factor in this match. There is a reserve day scheduled, but I think the match will finish today as long as 20 overs have been bowled in the second innings. There\u2019s a strong whiff of potential farce and controversy there. But the playing conditions have a level of clarity usually reserved for mudheaps, so I might be wrong. Hello again. Glad you\u2019ve logged on \u2013 you\u2019ve obviously heard there\u2019s a cricket match today. It\u2019s Australia v England, for the right to play New Zealand in the World Cup final on Sunday. This game is almost too big to function. It\u2019s England most important since September 2005, Australia\u2019s since March 2015. For both countries, defeat is so unthinkable that it hurts trying not to think about it. There\u2019s a rare old Royal Rumble of feeling and emotions this morning/evening: hope, fear, nervousness, anticipation, fear, curiosity, fear, fear, greed, nostalgia, pride - and I suppose, if I\u2019m being brutally honest, there\u2019s also a soup\u00e7on of fear. But most of all, as Eoin Morgan said yesterday, there is excitement about what might be achieved. In one hemisphere or another, a lot of grandchildren are going to hear about the events of 11 July 2019. There was no way England \u2013 England \u2013 were going to be allowed to win a World Cup without beating Australia en route. Only one side, West Indies in 1979, has ever done so. This is England\u2019s World Cup but it\u2019s also Australia\u2019s trophy, which they have lifted in four of the last five tournaments. And one of them has got to go. Deep down, we always knew it would be like this. The match starts at 10.30am BST, 7.30pm ACT.",

He is charged with five criminal counts based on alleged rape and sexual misconduct incidents involving two women, with one alleged victim dating from 2006 and another from 2004.</p> <p>Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and has denied all claims of non-consensual sex with dozens of women who have come forward with allegations that have made him the poster boy of the #MeToo movement that exploded into life in October 2017 with the revelation of allegations against him.</p> <p>His previous lawyers include Benjamin Brafman, a respected New York defense attorney, who claimed after Weinstein\u2019s arrest in May last year that the producer \u201cdid not invent the casting couch in Hollywood\u201d and claimed \u201cbad behavior is not on trial in this case\u201d. The pair parted ways after reported <a href=\"https://lawandcrime.com/celebrity/harvey-weinsteins-lawyer-wants-to-leave-his-case-after-raucous-fights-over-defense-strategies-sources-say/\">\u201craucous fights\u201d</a> over strategy.</p> <p>Another, Jose Baez, was given permission to leave the case on Thursday after complaining that Weinstein communicated with him only through other lawyers and had failed to meet his fees.</p> <p>Baez had been criticized by one of Weinstein\u2019s accusers, the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/rose-mcgowan\">Rose McGowan</a>, for taking the Weinstein case after defending her in a drug case last year. McGowan called it a \u201cmajor conflict of interest\u201d.</p> <p>Weinstein, who looked haggard and walked with a limp as he entered court, signaled to the judge he was now \u201ccomfortable\u201d with his representation.</p> <p>But his latest legal team, led by two Chicago-based criminal defense lawyers, Rotunno and Damon Cheronis, are already courting controversy.</p> <p>In a previous interview Rotunno told <a href=\"https://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/February-2018/The-Defender/\">Chicago </a><a href=\"https://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/February-2018/The-Defender/\">magazine</a> that the #MeToo movement had done a disservice to women. \u201cI\u2019m not a woman who has ever subscribed to it,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe women are responsible for the choices that they make.\u201d</p> <p>She later <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/weinstein-brings-on-new-lawyers-for-sex-crimes-trial-11561675452?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1\">told the Wall Street Journal</a> that by representing the movie producer, she hoped to encourage women to take responsibility for their actions, \u201cand say to women: \u2018Maybe don\u2019t go to the hotel room, maybe we are having a different conversation\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>Rotunno, a former prosecutor who specializes in representing men accused of sex crimes, also controversially described her gender as an asset and said her look is \u201ccarefully calibrated to convey both strength and femininity\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI have the ability to get away with a lot more in a courtroom cross-examining a female than a male lawyer does,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cHe may be an excellent lawyer, but if he goes at that woman with the same venom that I do, he looks like a bully. If I do it, nobody even bats an eyelash. And it\u2019s been very effective.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not this advocate where men should be able to do whatever they want.

      "bodyText": "Harvey Weinstein introduced his third set of defence lawyers to a New York court on Thursday ahead of the start of his trial on rape and sexual harassment charges. The new legal team includes a powerful female Chicago attorney specializing in defending men in sexual harassment cases, Donna Rotunno. She has previously argued that the #MeToo movement had done a disservice to women and that she can get away with more \u201cvenom\u201d when cross-examining alleged victims because of her gender. With less than two months to prepare, Weinstein\u2019s newest and latest defence team had been expected to ask Judge James Burke for another delay in the start of the disgraced producer\u2019s trial. But the judge confirmed on Thursday that the trial will go ahead with jury selection on 9 September, after it had been postponed from its original spring 2019 opening. Weinstein has already parted ways with more than half a dozen lawyers. He is charged with five criminal counts based on alleged rape and sexual misconduct incidents involving two women, with one alleged victim dating from 2006 and another from 2004. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and has denied all claims of non-consensual sex with dozens of women who have come forward with allegations that have made him the poster boy of the #MeToo movement that exploded into life in October 2017 with the revelation of allegations against him. His previous lawyers include Benjamin Brafman, a respected New York defense attorney, who claimed after Weinstein\u2019s arrest in May last year that the producer \u201cdid not invent the casting couch in Hollywood\u201d and claimed \u201cbad behavior is not on trial in this case\u201d. The pair parted ways after reported \u201craucous fights\u201d over strategy. Another, Jose Baez, was given permission to leave the case on Thursday after complaining that Weinstein communicated with him only through other lawyers and had failed to meet his fees. Baez had been criticized by one of Weinstein\u2019s accusers, the actor Rose McGowan, for taking the Weinstein case after defending her in a drug case last year. McGowan called it a \u201cmajor conflict of interest\u201d. Weinstein, who looked haggard and walked with a limp as he entered court, signaled to the judge he was now \u201ccomfortable\u201d with his representation. But his latest legal team, led by two Chicago-based criminal defense lawyers, Rotunno and Damon Cheronis, are already courting controversy. In a previous interview Rotunno told Chicago magazine that the #MeToo movement had done a disservice to women. \u201cI\u2019m not a woman who has ever subscribed to it,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe women are responsible for the choices that they make.\u201d She later told the Wall Street Journal that by representing the movie producer, she hoped to encourage women to take responsibility for their actions, \u201cand say to women: \u2018Maybe don\u2019t go to the hotel room, maybe we are having a different conversation\u2019\u201d. Rotunno, a former prosecutor who specializes in representing men accused of sex crimes, also controversially described her gender as an asset and said her look is \u201ccarefully calibrated to convey both strength and femininity\u201d. \u201cI have the ability to get away with a lot more in a courtroom cross-examining a female than a male lawyer does,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cHe may be an excellent lawyer, but if he goes at that woman with the same venom that I do, he looks like a bully. If I do it, nobody even bats an eyelash. And it\u2019s been very effective. \u201cI\u2019m not this advocate where men should be able to do whatever they want. But we are stepping on to a very large, very dangerous slippery slope when we say every allegation is considered rape,\u201d she said. Outside the Manhattan court, Rotunno said that Weinstein has been \u201crailroaded\u201d by the #MeToo movement and brushed off questions about the high turnover in his legal team. \u201cJust as if he were casting a movie, this is a circumstance where he has picked the right lawyers. This type of case requires the right lawyer,\u201d Rotunno said. \u201cI think a woman standing there is going to make a difference.\u201d Gloria Allred, the victims\u2019 rights lawyer representing one of Weinstein\u2019s alleged victims, Mimi Haleyi, and another unnamed witness, told reporters that she agreed that women are responsible for their choices but that Weinstein had removed his victim\u2019s ability to make them. \u201cNo woman should be shamed into thinking a sexual assault was her fault or her choice,\u201d she said. Many of Weinstein\u2019s accusers had reason to believe that he genuinely wanted to talk to them about business when he invited them to his hotel suite, she said. \u201cThey did not have reason to believe he wasn\u2019t telling the truth and when a woman goes to a man\u2019s hotel room that doesn\u2019t give him license to rape.\u201d But Allred warned Rotunno that going after victims of sexual harassment on the witness stand with \u201cvenom\u201d could backfire. \u201cIf this is Ms Rotunno\u2019s strategy and she believes she can get away with it because she is a woman, she may find that a New York jury will be turned off by that tactic and they may not agree with her. \u201cA venomous attack on a victim who alleges she has undergone traumatic sexual assault is simply not acceptable,\u201d Allred added. \u201cA bully is a bully regardless of their gender.\u201d",

I question, however, the use of the word \u201cbecoming\u201d in the article\u2019s headline.</p> <p>The UK has been the lapdog of the US for a long time. \u201cRAF\u201d Menwith Hill in beautiful Nidderdale, North Yorkshire, is occupied and controlled by the US visiting forces and their agencies. Three more satellite dishes (radomes) are to be constructed, bringing the total to 37. This base has many questionable roles and was crucial in the disastrous illegal war in Iraq and the dangerous mess that followed in the Middle East. The \u201cspecial relationship\u201d is so special that they do what they like, whether legal or not, and all our security is put at risk.<br><strong>Lindis Percy</strong><br><em>Co-founder</em><em>, </em><em>Campaign for the Accountability of American Bases </em><em>(CAAB)</em></p> <p>\u2022 Could the Darroch affair be a blessing in disguise? Even when Eisenhower pulled the plug on Suez in 1956, Britain still could not see that the special relationship had been peculiar to the second world war. By continuing to make that relationship the cornerstone of foreign policy, this country failed to face up to its much reduced circumstances and the limits of its power when it ought to have pursued a strategy of adjusting to reality by rebuilding itself within a European framework. Britain, the EU and, I believe, the US would have been the better for it. While remaining an ally of the US, now is the time to begin steadily to erase the word \u201cspecial\u201d from our relationship with it.<br><strong>John Smith</strong><br><em>Lindfield, West Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Martin Kettle quotes British diplomatic officials as stating that there is no precedent for what Trump has done, in seeking to have Kim Darroch removed from his post as the UK\u2019s ambassador to the US. In fact it is common practice for countries to deny granting consent and also to withdraw consent once granted in regard to the presence of foreign diplomatic officials who are not \u2013 or who are no longer \u2013 wanted. This has been codified as established practice by the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations (1961).</p> <p>Historically, the most famous such case was when the pope refused to grant credentials to the ambassador <a href=\"https://www.bartleby.com/268/7/48.html\" title=\"\">designated by the German empire</a> in 1872.<br><strong>Seth Barrett Tillman</strong><br><em>Maynooth, County Kildare, Ireland </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Re Martin Kettle\u2019s excellent article (After Darroch, Britain risks becoming a vassal of the US, Journal, 11 July), it is shocking what has happened to this fine diplomat \u2013 down to the unbelievable unthinking behaviour and loose tongues of the leaker, Donald Trump and Boris Johnson. I question, however, the use of the word \u201cbecoming\u201d in the article\u2019s headline. The UK has been the lapdog of the US for a long time. \u201cRAF\u201d Menwith Hill in beautiful Nidderdale, North Yorkshire, is occupied and controlled by the US visiting forces and their agencies. Three more satellite dishes (radomes) are to be constructed, bringing the total to 37. This base has many questionable roles and was crucial in the disastrous illegal war in Iraq and the dangerous mess that followed in the Middle East. The \u201cspecial relationship\u201d is so special that they do what they like, whether legal or not, and all our security is put at risk. Lindis Percy Co-founder, Campaign for the Accountability of American Bases (CAAB) \u2022 Could the Darroch affair be a blessing in disguise? Even when Eisenhower pulled the plug on Suez in 1956, Britain still could not see that the special relationship had been peculiar to the second world war. By continuing to make that relationship the cornerstone of foreign policy, this country failed to face up to its much reduced circumstances and the limits of its power when it ought to have pursued a strategy of adjusting to reality by rebuilding itself within a European framework. Britain, the EU and, I believe, the US would have been the better for it. While remaining an ally of the US, now is the time to begin steadily to erase the word \u201cspecial\u201d from our relationship with it. John Smith Lindfield, West Sussex \u2022 Martin Kettle quotes British diplomatic officials as stating that there is no precedent for what Trump has done, in seeking to have Kim Darroch removed from his post as the UK\u2019s ambassador to the US. In fact it is common practice for countries to deny granting consent and also to withdraw consent once granted in regard to the presence of foreign diplomatic officials who are not \u2013 or who are no longer \u2013 wanted. This has been codified as established practice by the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations (1961). Historically, the most famous such case was when the pope refused to grant credentials to the ambassador designated by the German empire in 1872.

      "bodyText": "British ships operating in the Gulf have been put on the highest state of alert amid fears that UK-flagged commercial vessels are vulnerable to attack by Iranian gunboats. The British government changed the alert to level 3 on Tuesday, a day before a Royal Navy warship trained its guns on Iranian gunboats that tried to disrupt the passage of an Isle of Man-flagged vessel. Level 3 is described as equivalent to the domestic security classification of critical in which there is an imminent risk of an incident. The alert is for the 15-30 large British-owned vessels that travel through the Gulf every day. The UK said the commercial ship British Heritage was in disputed waters claimed by Iran when it was challenged by three Iranian vessels and ordered to move north. HMS Montrose then intervened, aiming its guns at the Iranian boats to ward them off. The UK, keen to de-escalate the crisis and preserve the international nuclear deal with Tehran, is reluctant to release the video of the incident, which was first reported by the US late on Wednesday night. \u201cIt seems that the Brits and the French and the Germans are coming around to the idea that the Iranians are up to no good!\u201d President Trump tweeted on Thursday. Britain has one warship, HMS Montrose, and three minesweepers operating in the area and so lacks the capacity to escort all British-linked ships moving through the Strait of Hormuz. Defence officials said that the British deployment is kept under constant review, but it was not possible to escort every ship travelling in Gulf waters. British officials promised the Royal Navy \u201cwill be resolutely defending British maritime interests in the Gulf, but has no interest in escalating the situation\u201d. The threat to British shipping in the Gulf follows the seizure by Royal Marine commandos of an Iranian-flagged vessel, Grace 1, off the Strait of Gibraltar last Thursday, that prompted Tehran to threaten reprisals. The tanker is suspected of breaching European Union sanctions by carrying a shipment of Iranian crude oil to Syria. The Indian captain of the ship and its chief officer were formally arrested on Thursday by Gibraltarian authorities after a week-long investigation. The ship remains detained and Iran has denounced the actions as piracy. Documents and electronic equipment was seized from the vessel, a spokesperson said. British Heritage had been due to collect oil in Basra, Iraq, but abruptly turned round on Saturday on the basis of British government advice. It was seeking to go through the crowded waters without a load when it faced an Iranian instruction to go clearly into Iranian waters. The waters in which British Heritage was accosted are claimed by Iran and by the United Arab Emirates. It is not possible for British shipping to go through the straits without entering Iranian waters. Speaking about the latest confrontation, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement: \u201cContrary to international law, three Iranian vessels attempted to impede the passage of a commercial vessel, British Heritage, through the strait of Hormuz.\u201d HMS Montrose was \u201cforced to position herself between the Iranian vessels and British Heritage and issue verbal warnings to the Iranian vessels, which then turned away,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are concerned by this action and continue to urge the Iranian authorities to de-escalate the situation in the region.\u201d Iran has rejected the claims.

Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps also issued a statement denying involvement. The UK is waiting to hear detailed proposals from the US about a new international maritime security operation across the Gulf but ministers appear to be nervous about the implications of the plans, pointing to the existing 33-nation coalition on shipping. The US proposal is likely to include a requirement for Asian countries to do more financially to subsidise the security operation, with Washington pointing out that a huge proportion of oil travelling through the Gulf is destined for Asian markets. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, appeared to recognise the difficulty the UK faced in protecting its maritime shipping due to successive defence budget cuts. He tweeted: \u201cLatest incident with Iranian boats in the Gulf shows exactly why we must invest more in defence. We have run down our Navy too much and this must now be urgently reversed. We need to show confidence in the world by putting our money where our mouth is!\u201d Tehran has been accused of sabotaging oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz in an attempt at economic retaliation against the US after Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear agreement and imposed crippling sanctions on Iran. Washington and Tehran came close to direct military conflict last month, when Iran shot down a US drone and Trump ordered retaliatory airstrikes, only to call them off minutes beforehand. The UK and other European countries have been trying to save the deal, in which Tehran agreed to limits on its nuclear programme in exchange for relief from international sanctions. Russia and China, both signatories to the nuclear agreement along with the UK, France and Germany, called for restraint. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said \u201cfreedom of navigation should be ensured in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz\u201d.",

Yet that is what both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have agreed to countenance after this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/09/tory-leadership-hunt-and-johnson-roll-through-familiar-lines-in-itv-debate\" title=\"\">leadership debate</a>.</p> <p>I have attended Brexit seminars, briefings and rallies over the past two years, and am baffled by the absence of any remotely positive case for it \u2013 other than on the softest of single market models.

This is quite apart from the millions, approaching billions, now being diverted from other uses to prepare companies and individuals for a <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/europe/whats-cost-preparing-brexit/\" title=\"\">no-deal Brexit</a>, a blatant reneging on Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/21/theresa-mays-new-brexit-deal-point-by-point-analysis\" title=\"\">frictionless border pledge</a>.</p> <p>Preparations for no deal outlined <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0006nzb/panorama-nodeal-brexit-are-we-ready\" title=\"\">by the BBC</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/no-deal-brexit-preparations\" title=\"\">Institute for Government</a> have examined scenarios varying from extreme disruption to genuine chaos: chaos at the ports, chaos in food and medicine distribution, chaos in care staff recruitment and chaos as financial markets shift to the EU.

Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/04/northern-ireland-boris-johnson-jeremy-hunt-tory-leadership\" title=\"\">fluffs all questions</a> on the subject, seeking comfort in the bonkers faction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/23/james-dyson-brexiteer-elite-brexit-rees-mogg\" title=\"\">James Dyson</a> and Wetherspoon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/jan/25/owen-jones-meets-tim-martin-wetherspoons-no-deal-brexit-poverty-wages-dont-ask-childish-questions-video\" title=\"\">Tim Martin</a>.</p> <p>Yet ask Johnson\u2019s small band of more sophisticated no-dealers, and a different justification begins to emerge.

      "bodyText": "Imagine chaos. Dream disruption. Think of a hundred Kim Darrochs as the Boris Johnson moment approaches. Tear up the script. Shout \u201cno deal\u201d. Laugh with Johnson, cry with him. Welcome to anarchy hall. Even as a stubborn Eurosceptic, I can see no conceivable benefit in Britain leaving Europe\u2019s economic area on 31 October, least of all without any sort of customs deal. For a nation to initiate controls on border movement and trade with its adjacent continent is mindless self-harm, in this case driven by populist machismo. Yet that is what both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have agreed to countenance after this week\u2019s leadership debate. I have attended Brexit seminars, briefings and rallies over the past two years, and am baffled by the absence of any remotely positive case for it \u2013 other than on the softest of single market models. Even hardened Brexit economists such as Patrick Minford and Gerard Lyons acknowledge some \u201cshort-term\u201d disruption. This is quite apart from the millions, approaching billions, now being diverted from other uses to prepare companies and individuals for a no-deal Brexit, a blatant reneging on Theresa May\u2019s frictionless border pledge. Preparations for no deal outlined by the BBC and the Institute for Government have examined scenarios varying from extreme disruption to genuine chaos: chaos at the ports, chaos in food and medicine distribution, chaos in care staff recruitment and chaos as financial markets shift to the EU. No one seems to have a clue how the Northern Ireland border will operate. Johnson fluffs all questions on the subject, seeking comfort in the bonkers faction of James Dyson and Wetherspoon\u2019s Tim Martin. Yet ask Johnson\u2019s small band of more sophisticated no-dealers, and a different justification begins to emerge. It lies in the theories of creative disruption espoused by the postwar economist Joseph Schumpeter and his followers. To them, occasional bouts of chaos are necessary. As during wars, recessions and Thatcherism, Britain needs a therapeutic shock to jolt it into a new karma, a new inner greatness. To these no-dealers, sheep farmers and fishermen are the lackeys of Euro-protectionism. UK manufacturers have become slaves to Euro-conglomerates, forced to import bits of cars and planes because they can no longer fashion their own. They should get real. Likewise, it is humiliating that Britain should have Bulgarians picking its fruit, Poles building its houses, Portuguese staffing its clinics and care homes. Of course no deal will be painful in the short-term, but the short-term is for economic snowflakes.

Schumpeter posited just such a \u201cgale of creative destruction \u2026 a process of industrial mutation that revolutionises the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one.\u201d That is no-deal Brexit to a T.

In his budget in 1988, he cut the top rates of tax \u2026 What it led to is an economic revolution in our country and we have to be prepared to make those arguments.\u201d</p> \n<p>Truss, who at one point referred to herself as \u201cthe Truss\u201d, stuck closely to Johnson\u2019s script on Brexit and said Theresa May\u2019s deal was a \u201cdead duck\u201d, despite having voted for it three times and Johnson having voted for it once.</p> \n<p>The senior Treasury minister was an early backer of Johnson and joked that if Jacob Rees-Mogg were to get her current job then she would leave him a note saying: \u201cI\u2019ll be just down the corridor\u201d \u2013 implying that she would be promoted to chancellor.</p> \n<p>Truss\u2019s main rival for the role of chancellor is thought to be Sajid Javid, the former leadership hopeful, who is heavily rumoured to have done a deal with Johnson for the job. However, Johnson\u2019s campaign team repeatedly insist that he has not promised anyone any job.</p> \n<p>At the same time, Rudd, one of the leading cabinet opponents of hard Brexit, publicly ditched her opposition to no deal on Thursday in a move that appeared designed to show she would be willing to serve with Johnson as prime minister.</p> \n<p>Rudd had previously joined with her cabinet colleagues David Gauke and Greg Clark to force Theresa May to take no deal off the table and stop the UK crashing out at the end of March.</p> \n<p>But with Johnson on the brink of No 10, she has changed her mind, telling TalkRadio on Thursday morning: \u201cBoth candidates have said that no deal is part of the armoury going forward, and I have accepted that.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe situation is that we are leaving at the end of October but it would be so much better to get a deal. What we really need is for everybody\u2019s effort to go into trying to get a deal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Friends of Rudd said she would like to keep her job as work and pensions secretary in a Johnson cabinet and it was better to be around the cabinet table as an influence than on the backbenches.</p> \n<p>Rudd is supporting Johnson\u2019s rival for the leadership, Jeremy Hunt, who is also holding out the possibility of no deal.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Senior backers of Johnson believe he will create a cabinet mostly of Brexit \u201ctrue believers\u201d who are prepared to hugely increase spending on no-deal preparations.</p> \n<p>Johnson has had at least one conversation with Michael Gove and is thought to be considering burying the hatchet by offering him a cabinet-level job and Dominic Raab, another former leadership rival, will also be angling for a senior role.</p> \n<p>One MP involved in Johnson\u2019s campaign said they thought Priti Patel would have to get a big job as he is short of senior Brexit-supporting women and that it would be difficult to move Penny Mordaunt from her post as defence secretary.</p> \n<p>The MP also said Johnson had a \u201cGavin Williamson problem\u201d as Williamson would expect a senior role but was not popular with colleagues and could not be allowed in a role involved with security as Theresa May sacked him as defence secretary over suspicions he leaked information from the national security council.</p> \n<p>Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, is understood to be open to a big cabinet job after chairing Johnson\u2019s campaign and keeping Eurosceptics on side.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has begun receiving very public job applications from would-be cabinet ministers, with Liz Truss pitching to be a tax-slashing chancellor and Amber Rudd ditching her opposition to a no-deal Brexit in a bid to stay on as work and pensions secretary. With Johnson on the brink of No 10, senior Tories have begun laying out their credentials for positions in his potential cabinet \u2013 some with more hope than others. Truss told journalists on Thursday that she wanted to be in the \u201cengine room of the economy\u201d driving growth, citing as her favourite chancellor Nigel Lawson \u2013 a Thatcherite Brexit supporter who denies climate science. She praised Lawson for cutting the top rate of tax to 40% in 1988, and set out her view that the Conservatives must not be afraid to reduce taxes for higher earners, claiming this would contribute to economic growth. Asked by the Guardian to respond to Jeremy Hunt\u2019s criticism that Johnson\u2019s plan for lowering the higher rate of tax threshold made them seem like the party of the rich, she said: \u201cIf we are never, ever prepared to cut taxes for people earning \u00a360,000 I think that is a problem \u2026 I mentioned Nigel Lawson earlier. In his budget in 1988, he cut the top rates of tax \u2026 What it led to is an economic revolution in our country and we have to be prepared to make those arguments.\u201d Truss, who at one point referred to herself as \u201cthe Truss\u201d, stuck closely to Johnson\u2019s script on Brexit and said Theresa May\u2019s deal was a \u201cdead duck\u201d, despite having voted for it three times and Johnson having voted for it once. The senior Treasury minister was an early backer of Johnson and joked that if Jacob Rees-Mogg were to get her current job then she would leave him a note saying: \u201cI\u2019ll be just down the corridor\u201d \u2013 implying that she would be promoted to chancellor. Truss\u2019s main rival for the role of chancellor is thought to be Sajid Javid, the former leadership hopeful, who is heavily rumoured to have done a deal with Johnson for the job. However, Johnson\u2019s campaign team repeatedly insist that he has not promised anyone any job. At the same time, Rudd, one of the leading cabinet opponents of hard Brexit, publicly ditched her opposition to no deal on Thursday in a move that appeared designed to show she would be willing to serve with Johnson as prime minister. Rudd had previously joined with her cabinet colleagues David Gauke and Greg Clark to force Theresa May to take no deal off the table and stop the UK crashing out at the end of March. But with Johnson on the brink of No 10, she has changed her mind, telling TalkRadio on Thursday morning: \u201cBoth candidates have said that no deal is part of the armoury going forward, and I have accepted that. \u201cThe situation is that we are leaving at the end of October but it would be so much better to get a deal. What we really need is for everybody\u2019s effort to go into trying to get a deal.\u201d Friends of Rudd said she would like to keep her job as work and pensions secretary in a Johnson cabinet and it was better to be around the cabinet table as an influence than on the backbenches. Rudd is supporting Johnson\u2019s rival for the leadership, Jeremy Hunt, who is also holding out the possibility of no deal. However, this is her clearest statement yet that she could be prepared to serve in the cabinet of a prime minister with an explicit no-deal policy. Johnson and Hunt have said they want to avoid no deal and believe it is unlikely, but they need to keep it as an option if the EU will not offer changes to the Irish backstop. Critics of the backstop say it could trap the UK indefinitely in a customs union. One of Johnson\u2019s most senior Eurosceptic backers told the Guardian that the sight of centrist Tories falling over themselves to praise Johnson and saying \u201cpick me, pick me\u201d was now \u201cembarrassing\u201d. He singled out Matt Hancock, a former leadership candidate, for mockery, saying he was behaving like an \u201cannoying younger brother\u201d on Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign with excessive keenness and volunteering. Johnson is reported to have told cabinet hopefuls to stop \u201cpeacocking\u201d in their desperation to show their fitness for top jobs. Hancock had suggested that public sector workers needed to be shown \u201csome love\u201d with pay rises, and other top backers had put their names to a plan for merging government departments. Senior backers of Johnson believe he will create a cabinet mostly of Brexit \u201ctrue believers\u201d who are prepared to hugely increase spending on no-deal preparations. Johnson has had at least one conversation with Michael Gove and is thought to be considering burying the hatchet by offering him a cabinet-level job and Dominic Raab, another former leadership rival, will also be angling for a senior role. One MP involved in Johnson\u2019s campaign said they thought Priti Patel would have to get a big job as he is short of senior Brexit-supporting women and that it would be difficult to move Penny Mordaunt from her post as defence secretary. The MP also said Johnson had a \u201cGavin Williamson problem\u201d as Williamson would expect a senior role but was not popular with colleagues and could not be allowed in a role involved with security as Theresa May sacked him as defence secretary over suspicions he leaked information from the national security council. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, is understood to be open to a big cabinet job after chairing Johnson\u2019s campaign and keeping Eurosceptics on side. Others who could be rewarded include Grant Shapps, who prepared a hugely detailed spreadsheet to help Johnson keep track of support among MPs, and those who have gone out to bat for him in the media such as Johnny Mercer, James Cleverly and Michael Fallon. He may also remember old allies such as Ben Wallace, Jake Berry and Conor Burns when it comes to putting together his ministerial team. A string of Tories have hardened their Brexit positions or put aside doubts about his no-deal stance in recent weeks in order to back Johnson. George Freeman, a Tory moderate, was asked by his former colleague Heidi Allen whether he had \u201ctaken leave of his senses\u201d by coming out strongly for Johnson. He replied: \u201cCouldn\u2019t be more serious. We are, tragically, in a terrible mess: as a government, parliament and party.

      "body": "<p>Arthur Ryan was scarcely a household name in the UK but his products \u2013 and brown paper shopping bags \u2013 are visible everywhere. Ryan, who has died aged 83, was the man who cut a swathe through the British high street by inventing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/primark\" title=\"\">Primark</a>. The low-price clothing retailer upended such well-known chains as Marks &amp; Spencer, and hastened the demise of others, establishing a new pattern of marketing that chimed with millennials and cost-conscious older generations alike. It brought fashion to a mass market alongside accusations of encouraging the \u201cthrowaway society\u201d.</p> <p>The formula is clear: simple pricing, with low-cost suppliers often in the developing world, a keen eye on fashion shows and trends, with virtual lookalikes on sale at a fraction of the price of the real thing, and rapid reaction to what sells or does not.</p> <p>As Ryan put it: \u201cNo gimmicks.

      "bodyText": "Arthur Ryan was scarcely a household name in the UK but his products \u2013 and brown paper shopping bags \u2013 are visible everywhere. Ryan, who has died aged 83, was the man who cut a swathe through the British high street by inventing Primark. The low-price clothing retailer upended such well-known chains as Marks &amp; Spencer, and hastened the demise of others, establishing a new pattern of marketing that chimed with millennials and cost-conscious older generations alike. It brought fashion to a mass market alongside accusations of encouraging the \u201cthrowaway society\u201d. The formula is clear: simple pricing, with low-cost suppliers often in the developing world, a keen eye on fashion shows and trends, with virtual lookalikes on sale at a fraction of the price of the real thing, and rapid reaction to what sells or does not. As Ryan put it: \u201cNo gimmicks. You like it or you don\u2019t. And they\u2019ll tell us soon enough. If we don\u2019t like it, we get rid of it. We don\u2019t have annual sales because we don\u2019t hang around waiting for January if we get a problem in October.\u201d The retailer has not been without controversy. In 2013 its purchasing policies were called into question after 1,134 people died when the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka collapsed. About half of them were working for a Primark contractor. The company responded quickly with its managing director flying out, a review of its Bangladesh contracts and nine months\u2019 wages for workers affected. But like others in the industry its practices remain under scrutiny. Critics have attacked the company for the environmental impact of selling clothes so cheaply that they can be worn once then thrown away. In response it has introduced recycling bins at some of its stores, encouraging customers to recycle old clothes, and a new denim range made from sustainable cotton. The brand was conceived in 1969 as Penneys, when Ryan, along with his finance director, Paddy Prior, and backed by the powerful British-Canadian Weston family, established the first store in Mary Street, Dublin. As the business expanded, with the addition of Seamus Halford and, later, Breege O\u2019Donoghue, to become the retail \u201cgang of four\u201d, Ryan recalled in a rare interview, \u201cwe worked in the store all day, then the deliveries would come in in the evening and we would allocate the goods to the branches. Then at night we cleaned the stores, as we couldn\u2019t afford cleaners.\u201d The flat management structure stayed a feature of the company, while in the tradition of other successful fashion retailers, Ryan remained hands-on; as one colleague later put it, \u201cknowing Primark down to the finest detail, every item, its price, the people who design it, the people who make it, the people who buy it and the people who sell it\u201d. Ryan claimed to have told the Westons, whose Associated British Foods company gets about a third of its profits from Primark, that he was not interested in running a local business and that he would take Penneys to Britain. When he did so in 1973, the first store in Derby was under the new name of Primark, as Penneys\u2019 resemblance to the US store chain JC Penney had caused legal difficulties. He would visit the UK stores as often as once a week, as well as checking out his rivals along the high street. Expansion was rapid, assisted by a muted response from the big high street chains.

The moves follow the publication last month of a Guardian/ITV News undercover investigation, which posed questions about the business interests of the entrepreneur, who has raised more than \u00a380m from private investors for care homes and leisure projects but whose firms have a multimillion-pound \u201cblack hole\u201d. A high court judge ruled last week that the financier\u2019s business model appeared to be \u201cthoroughly dishonest\u201d as temporary administrators were appointed to run four of Woodhouse\u2019s businesses.

On Sunday, Woodhouse lost control of his main firm, Northern Powerhouse Developments (NPD), after Philip Duffy and Sarah Bell of the insolvency firm Duff &amp; Phelps were appointed interim managers of the business.

The Guardian and ITV News also understand that, as of December 2018: \u2022 NPD executives were expressing concern about the solvency of the group directly to Woodhouse. \u2022 Woodhouse\u2019s personal company, Woodhouse Family Ltd, had taken loans of more than \u00a32m out of NPD. \u2022 Woodhouse\u2019s wife, Charlotte, was being paid a salary by NPD of \u00a375,000 a year. \u2022 NPD already owed around \u00a32m in unpaid returns to investors and was behind in payments to suppliers and agents.

Not to prang you out, but Amazon is recording every single one of those screams and will play them back to you, in a megamix, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/apr/14/amazon-fines-depot-workers-driver\" title=\"\">in the Amazon hospital in which you will inevitably die</a>) and then a load of weird crap it is trying to shift off the shelves (\u201c46% off K\u00e4rcher Window Vac WV5 Premium!\u201d) to make space for more, I don\u2019t know, worker tents. Anyway, that\u2019s Prime Day.</p> <p>Why am I sullying your precious celebrity-gossip column about what is in essence a glorified summer sale? Well. Prime Day, sadly, has bubbled and bloated and become so grotesque over the past few years that it is now a star-studded mega-festival of capitalism. By that I mean, obviously, that Taylor Swift is involved. The annual Prime Day Concert aired last night, featuring Swift, Dua Lipa, SZA and Becky G, and was hosted by \u2013 just checking my notes, here \u2013 ah yes, the \u201cPE teacher from the show Glee\u201d. The concert was exclusive to Prime subscribers, which everyone pretends they\u2019re not but actually are, but was probably watched by next to no one because the interface of the streaming website is horrible. Still, it\u2019s nice, and more than a little dystopian, that they tried.</p> <p>Celebrities announcing sales in shops is nothing new. Who can forget when the Argos in Chesterfield opened, and Wolf from Gladiators turned up in store to sign copies of the catalogue, for a queue that snaked all the way outside town towards the Wilko at the bottom of the high street? As a man who still owns a spring/summer 1996 Argos catalogue signed: \u201cLove, Wolf\u201d, I cannot. But this feels a few steps beyond that.</p> <p>It\u2019s not hard to envision a future in which we are all locked in the prison of Amazon and only a few outlaws \u2013 ie people with morals who deliberately buy their books from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/07/amazon-25th-birthday-jeff-bezos\" title=\"\">companies that pay a significant share of tax</a> \u2013 rove around the now sand-blasted desert country, Bezopotamia, in roaring vehicles made of scavenged rusted car parts (the caravan is heading towards that rarest of treasures, glimmering like a diamond on the distant horizon: a Big Waterstones). If we zoom out and really look at what Amazon is already \u2013 in 2019, a year with the planet on the precipice; we\u2019ll look back at this from our slum cities and laugh \u2013 then it\u2019s already a bit out of control. It has got drones, it knows where we live, and it has about five years from cleaving society into two classes or sects: those with Amazon Prime next-day delivery and those who work in warehouses serving those who do. Are we really so far from fitting employees with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/apr/14/amazon-fines-depot-workers-driver\" title=\"\">pedometers that explode if you fulfill an order incorrectly</a>? Are we really so far from the property market collapsing indefinitely and the only viable, affordable option left to us all is to order on Amazon something so big that we can feasibly live in the box it came in, like a cat? No, we are not. And as smooth, immoveable faces of the oncoming social collapse-cum-takeover by a megacorporation go, you could do worse than pick Taylor Swift.</p> <p>Swift, as you know, is involved in a blood feud (\u2019twas ever thus!) and album trail combo, with the particulars of this one being \u201cthe music manager Scooter Braun, he of Justin Bieber fame\u201d and \u201cthe album Lover, due 2019\u201d. The story is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2019/jul/01/taylor-swift-is-furious-at-the-sale-of-her-master-tapes-but-shes-luckier-than-most\" title=\"\">Braun bought up Swift\u2019s old masters catalogue</a> as some sort of shit-eating-grin mega-flex on her; she released a statement about it on Tumblr ; and Braun\u2019s stable of popstars came out in honour of him, etc etc etc. The latest bit is that, at the Prime Concert we all streamed and enjoyed, Swift sang the line: \u201cJust think, while you\u2019ve been getting down and out about the liars and dirty, dirty cheats of the world / You could have been getting down to this sick beat\u201d with exactly enough venom for people to think it was about Braun, and for people to write headlines about it, and for beef to be reignited, amen. And me, here, now, overanalysing things when I\u2019m on the clock and I\u2019ve got 20 more packages to fulfil before the hour is over. God, you do have to respect the girl, don\u2019t you. She always knows what she\u2019s doing.</p> <p>This just all feels a little bit like a recurring nightmare, though, doesn\u2019t it? A glossy, multibillion-pound corporate party (the vibe of the entire concert is very \u201cWe threw you an extremely lavish Christmas party so that\u2019s why no one is getting a raise this year\u201d); Swift being mad at someone; the fact that the line \u201cdirty cheats of the world\u201d is supposedly about Braun and not, I don\u2019t know, the mega-corp that doesn\u2019t pay tax and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/08/amazon-jeff-bezos-unionize-working-conditions\" title=\"\">denies fulfil</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/08/amazon-jeff-bezos-unionize-working-conditions\" title=\"\">ment centre unions</a> and gets away with working conditions so bad employees sleep nearby in tents just to make shift every morning, and also that there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/08/amazon-warehouse-workers-prime-day-strike/\">a planned worker strike on Prime Day because it\u2019s so bad</a>, and, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m quite sure Braun has his faults, but I think in this case, he is possibly only the third- or fourth-biggest bastard in the mix; the gloss at the top skimmed over the darkness at the bottom. It just feels like this is one instance of what we will see, for ever and ever, as Amazon\u2019s tendrils slowly choke the world, until the police are weaponised to shoot non-Prime customers with Tasers, until we are ordered by the state to watch the Prime Day Concert, Swift front and centre, again. If you want a vision of the future, log on to Prime and watch it play out, now. If you want a vision of the future, imagine Taylor Swift in a tasselled rainbow stiletto, stamping on a human face \u2013 for ever.</p> <h2><strong>Jeremy Renner, rock\u2019s jacket potato</strong></h2> <p>I always feel as if I\u2019m the victim of an elaborate prank when I consider the career of Jeremy Renner.

      "bodyText": "Disgraced American financier Jeffrey Epstein has asked a federal judge to release him on bail and allow him to remain under house arrest as he awaits trial on charges of sex trafficking underage girls as young as 14 years old. In a filing in federal court in Manhattan on Thursday, Epstein\u2019s lawyers argued that home confinement, along with electronic monitoring, surveillance and a bond secured by a mortgage on his $77m Manhattan mansion, would be enough to ensure he does not flee the country. His lawyers said Epstein has been \u201ca law-abiding citizen\u201d following his 2008 guilty plea to state-level prostitution charges. Prosecutors said at a court hearing on Monday they will oppose Epstein\u2019s release on bail, saying he poses \u201cextraordinary risk of flight\u201d because of his wealth, private planes and significant international ties. Epstein, 66, was arrested on Saturday evening at Teterboro airport in New Jersey, where he had returned on his private plane from Paris. He pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and conspiracy. He is accused of sexually exploiting and abusing dozens of underage girls from 2002 to 2005 at his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida. The indictment charges that Epstein \u201centiced and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, minor girls\u201d to \u201cengage in sex acts with him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars in cash\u201d. Prosecutors said authorities encountered \u201can extraordinary volume\u201d of photographs showing nude and partially nude young women or girls while searching his home following his arrest. The Manhattan case comes more than a decade after allegations that Epstein sexually abused minors spurred local and federal criminal investigations and civil suits. In 2008, Epstein and the Miami US attorney\u2019s office, led by Alexander Acosta, now the US labor secretary, reached a deal that ended a federal investigation involving at least 40 teenage girls. Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges, served 13 months in jail and registered as a sex offender. Acosta has faced considerable scrutiny for his role in the plea deal, prompting him to defend it in a press conference this week. On Thursday, Epstein\u2019s lawyers argued for bail, claiming that \u201cduring the years since his release from incarceration in connection with his Florida guilty plea, Mr Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal misconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy\u201d. They also said: \u201cMr Epstein respectfully submits that his conduct over the past 14 years proves that he poses no risk of flight or threat to the safety of the community.\u201d Epstein\u2019s lawyers said that any risk of flight could be lessened with home detention as the case progresses, plus GPS monitoring. They also said Epstein could put up a \u201csubstantial personal recognizance bond\u201d backed by a mortgage on his $77m Upper East Side mansion and that \u201cMr Epstein\u2019s private jet can be pledged as further collateral\u201d. \u201cMr Epstein\u2019s current notoriety minimizes any conceivable risk of flight even further,\u201d his lawyers also said. The Manhattan US attorney\u2019s office is expected to file papers on Friday opposing Epstein\u2019s bail request. In February, the Department of Justice opened an inquiry into the 2008 plea deal. Acosta has defended his role in abandoning a more than 50-page indictment, saying in May: \u201cThis matter was appealed all the way up to the deputy attorney general\u2019s office. And not because we weren\u2019t doing enough, but because the contention was that we were too aggressive.\u201d Epstein, a well-connected financier, was known for socializing with politicians and royalty, with friends who have included Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and, according to court papers, Prince Andrew. None of those people was mentioned in the indictment. \u201cI\u2019ve known Jeff for 15 years,\u201d Trump said in a 2002 New York magazine article. \u201cTerrific guy. He\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d Trump has since tried to distance himself from Epstein. Clinton also said in a statement on Monday that he \u201cknows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he had been recently charged in New York\u201d. On Monday, Epstein\u2019s attorney Reid Weingarten said the fresh allegations were \u201cancient stuff\u201d, dealt with in prior proceedings. \u201cTo us,\u201d he said, \u201cthis indictment is essentially a do-over.\u201d Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this report",

While the government stressed that the vast majority of MPs did not abuse employees, an official report by barrister Gemma White QC recommended that parliament adopt new employment measures to better protect staff. One of White\u2019s findings was that former members of staff with grievances should be allowed to make historical complaints against members of parliament. The current system only covers events after the 2017 general election. Following the publication of the report the leader of the Commons, Mel Stride, announced a debate and vote next Wednesday on modifying the remit of the new Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS). He said one of the proposed changes would be to extend the system to earlier complaints, which was also recommended by a report into bullying and harassment in parliament by Dame Laura Cox last year. White\u2019s 55-page report concluded that employees of MPs are in a vulnerable position because they are directly employed and consider any form of complaint as \u201ccareer suicide\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Perhaps until this week, you\u2019d forgotten that Westminster has been plagued by questions about its working culture. It would be understandable: between Brexit, Trump and the implosion of the Labour party, it takes something exceptional for news editors to care again about gropy MPs or bullying lords (\u201cIt\u2019s too much of a 2017 story,\u201d an editor friend sighed to me about a harassment case her boss chose not to cover).</p> <p>This week, two more major reports about harassment in Westminster have been published: one by Naomi Ellenbogen QC into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/house-of-lords-staff-too-scared-to-complain-about-harassment\" title=\"\">bullying and harassment of House of Lords\u2019 staff</a>, the other by Gemma White QC into that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/11/westminster-bullying-and-harassment-is-significant-problem\" title=\"\">of MPs\u2019 staff</a>. Perhaps some of the content will still shock you: 20% of Lords staff have been bullied in the past year, before you even add sexual harassment into the stat; MPs\u2019 staff repeatedly use the word \u201ccareer suicide\u201d when discussing why they don\u2019t make complaints. But to those of us who have made complaints, it is all too familiar.</p> <p>The report from the Lords, in particular, sounds like a summary of behaviour at a public school that only recently admitted girls to its sixth form (Ellenbogen notes that the membership of the Lords is 75% male). The report suggests improvements that would cause outrage from the Daily Mail if they were needed to protect girls at a comprehensive school: CCTV in \u201chotspot\u201d areas that lords favour for groping women, offices rearranged to make it harder for lords to look down the shirt of a female employee. There is plenty of bullying reported here that does not constitute sexual harassment, and plenty of same-sex sexual harassment in Westminster, as well as harassment by women of men. But the peculiarly male nature of the House of Lords is clearly part of the problem, as is the routine belittling in both houses of those with working-class accents or from racial minorities. You can keep installing CCTV until the Lords looks like a borstal in Texas \u2013 this behaviour won\u2019t change until its membership changes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Ambition' is a dirty word, a tag for people who invite consequences</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We\u2019ve seen many reports already, across political parties and parliamentary bodies (the Labour party has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47414453\" title=\"\">refused to publish</a> the findings of the independent report it commissioned from Karen Monaghan QC \u2013 one wonders why). They have all made suggestions about structural change, especially to grievance processes. What we haven\u2019t yet found is a way to change the culture. That is a particularly difficult task when society has low expectations of Westminster \u2013 and when, since the expenses scandal and with rising levels of abuse hurdled at MPs themselves, parliamentarians in turn have developed a deep siege mentality.</p> <p>One standout quote from White\u2019s report that is getting a lot of air is from a young political staffer who says: \u201cAs long as getting political jobs in parliament are dependent on who you know and who you\u2019re related to, sexual harassment will be a necessary evil for ambitious young people like me who will choose our careers over our comfort every time.\u201d It\u2019s a line that disturbs, but will also delight some news editors, because it reinforces prejudices about victims.</p> <p>During my <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/kate-maltby-damian-green-you-probably-have-no-idea-how-awkward-i-felt-j2kk88frj\" title=\"\">encounter with Damian Green</a>, it was clear that keeping quiet was an expected part of getting help with my career \u2013 something that became even clearer when I talked to friends to seek their advice. But look at the phrase this complainant uses to describe their situation: \u201ca necessary evil for ambitious young people\u201d. Those of us who have made public complaints, particularly women, have all been criticised for our perceived \u201cambition\u201d. It\u2019s a dirty word, a tag for people who invite consequences.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/01/mp-expenses-violence-misogyny-harassment-recall-commons\">You can expel your MP for fiddling expenses \u2013 but not violence or misogyny.

Ambitious to make an impact on the world; to promote the causes we care about; and yes, often for personal recognition, too. That\u2019s true of perpetrators and victims. It doesn\u2019t mean it is acceptable to work in a field where we\u2019re expected to giggle politely at groping bosses. Nor is it constructive when it encourages those of us with integrity to take our perfectly healthy ambitions elsewhere.</p> <p>Neither the Ellenbogen nor the White inquiries name names \u2013 even though the latter speaks of hearing allegations \u201cwhich can only be described as very serious sexual assault\u201d. Their scope is to expose the culture \u2013 and in reports such as these, anonymity protects complainants as well as perpetrators. But to make real change, that is never enough.

      "bodyText": "Perhaps until this week, you\u2019d forgotten that Westminster has been plagued by questions about its working culture. It would be understandable: between Brexit, Trump and the implosion of the Labour party, it takes something exceptional for news editors to care again about gropy MPs or bullying lords (\u201cIt\u2019s too much of a 2017 story,\u201d an editor friend sighed to me about a harassment case her boss chose not to cover). This week, two more major reports about harassment in Westminster have been published: one by Naomi Ellenbogen QC into bullying and harassment of House of Lords\u2019 staff, the other by Gemma White QC into that of MPs\u2019 staff. Perhaps some of the content will still shock you: 20% of Lords staff have been bullied in the past year, before you even add sexual harassment into the stat; MPs\u2019 staff repeatedly use the word \u201ccareer suicide\u201d when discussing why they don\u2019t make complaints. But to those of us who have made complaints, it is all too familiar. The report from the Lords, in particular, sounds like a summary of behaviour at a public school that only recently admitted girls to its sixth form (Ellenbogen notes that the membership of the Lords is 75% male). The report suggests improvements that would cause outrage from the Daily Mail if they were needed to protect girls at a comprehensive school: CCTV in \u201chotspot\u201d areas that lords favour for groping women, offices rearranged to make it harder for lords to look down the shirt of a female employee. There is plenty of bullying reported here that does not constitute sexual harassment, and plenty of same-sex sexual harassment in Westminster, as well as harassment by women of men. But the peculiarly male nature of the House of Lords is clearly part of the problem, as is the routine belittling in both houses of those with working-class accents or from racial minorities. You can keep installing CCTV until the Lords looks like a borstal in Texas \u2013 this behaviour won\u2019t change until its membership changes. We\u2019ve seen many reports already, across political parties and parliamentary bodies (the Labour party has refused to publish the findings of the independent report it commissioned from Karen Monaghan QC \u2013 one wonders why). They have all made suggestions about structural change, especially to grievance processes. What we haven\u2019t yet found is a way to change the culture. That is a particularly difficult task when society has low expectations of Westminster \u2013 and when, since the expenses scandal and with rising levels of abuse hurdled at MPs themselves, parliamentarians in turn have developed a deep siege mentality. One standout quote from White\u2019s report that is getting a lot of air is from a young political staffer who says: \u201cAs long as getting political jobs in parliament are dependent on who you know and who you\u2019re related to, sexual harassment will be a necessary evil for ambitious young people like me who will choose our careers over our comfort every time.\u201d It\u2019s a line that disturbs, but will also delight some news editors, because it reinforces prejudices about victims. During my encounter with Damian Green, it was clear that keeping quiet was an expected part of getting help with my career \u2013 something that became even clearer when I talked to friends to seek their advice. But look at the phrase this complainant uses to describe their situation: \u201ca necessary evil for ambitious young people\u201d. Those of us who have made public complaints, particularly women, have all been criticised for our perceived \u201cambition\u201d. It\u2019s a dirty word, a tag for people who invite consequences. But everyone in politics or media is ambitious. Ambitious to make an impact on the world; to promote the causes we care about; and yes, often for personal recognition, too. That\u2019s true of perpetrators and victims. It doesn\u2019t mean it is acceptable to work in a field where we\u2019re expected to giggle politely at groping bosses. Nor is it constructive when it encourages those of us with integrity to take our perfectly healthy ambitions elsewhere. Neither the Ellenbogen nor the White inquiries name names \u2013 even though the latter speaks of hearing allegations \u201cwhich can only be described as very serious sexual assault\u201d. Their scope is to expose the culture \u2013 and in reports such as these, anonymity protects complainants as well as perpetrators. But to make real change, that is never enough. Those of us who named names in 2017 did so because we knew that change only happens when individual politicians are held accountable in public. It is too early to see the long-term impact of the #MeToo movement. But one clue that change may not come as quickly as many of us originally hoped is the lack of consequence and accountability for men who stand accused of harassment. It was heartbreaking to read Ellenbogen\u2019s contributors describe the \u201cchilling effect\u201d of the Lords\u2019 refusal to punish their colleague Lord Lester, after its privileges and conduct committee found he tried to pressure a woman into having sex with him by promising to make her a baroness. Meanwhile Michael Fallon mysteriously resigned in 2017, a few days before we began to learn about harassment allegations against him. Yet over the past two days, Fallon has been doing the media rounds to defend Boris Johnson, with a cabinet return mooted as a reward. I find it hard to imagine Johnson would make such a political blunder.

The regulator acknowledged that there were positive signs that the higher education sector had begun to tackle the issue, and said it would take time for change to take effect. Susan Lapworth, director of competition and registration at the Office for Students, warned however: \u201cWorries about grade inflation threaten to devalue a university education in the eyes of employers and potential students. So it is essential we regain and maintain public confidence in the reliability of degree classification.\u201d The OfS is now planning to contact universities with the highest unexplained increases in degree classifications. \u201cWe will ask them to provide further information to help us understand how they account for these increases.\u201d said Lapworth. \u201cIn seeking this additional information, we recognise that there are factors that could explain the increases \u2013 for example, improvements in learning and teaching \u2013 that we have not been able to measure in our analysis.\u201d Chris Hale, director of policy at Universities UK, the umbrella organisation that represents universities, said the sector was committed to protecting its world-leading reputation. \u201cStudents deserve to have qualifications which they can take pride in, and employers and the wider public need to have confidence in the results students achieve. \u201cThis commitment was shown by the overwhelming support for the recent sector-wide statement of intent which maps out a framework for action, and we know that institutions are already taking action to review their processes and data. \u201cIt is important not to forget that students working harder, improvements in teaching, investment in academic support and widening participation initiatives are also all leading to legitimate grade improvement, and such improvements are to be celebrated.\u201d",

It\u2019s a typical first key day at the Tour: the time gaps should be a bit less than in other years as we are still in the opening week but the chances are only 10 or a dozen riders will be in with a shout after this one.

      "bodyText": "Geraint Thomas took precious seconds out of several fellow GC contenders, as Belgium\u2019s Dylan Teuns won his maiden Tour de France stage and Julian Alaphilippe lost the yellow jersey. Apologies to Dylan Teuns: In a previous post I may have renationalised him and referred to him as a German. The 27-year-old Bahrain-Merida man is, of course, as Belgian as Hercule Poirot, Abbaye D\u2019Auine Blond 6% beer and getting lost in Liege. What a stage: Belgian rider Dylan Teuns won his first stage in the Tour de France at the end of a brutal climb, prevailing by about seven or eight bike lengths from Giulio Ciccone, who was practically at a standstill. He managed to keep going and looked gutted as he crossed the line, but he got rewarded for his effort with the not inconsiderable consolation prize of a yellow jersey. Xander Meurisse promptly finished third, whereupon Geraint Thomas put in a fine come from behind effort to pass Julian Alaphilippe on the final ramp. He finished fourth, just in front of Alaphilippe and Thibaut Pinot. Alaphilippe has lost the yellow jersey!!! Once the bonus won by Ciccone on the penultimate climb has been factored in, he takes the yellow (and white) jersey and leads this year\u2019s Tour by six seconds. Correction: Xander Meurisse finished third. Aliphilippe attacks! Warren Barguil crosses the line in third. Desperate not to lose his yellow jersey, Julian Aliphilippe gets out of the sadde, with Geraint Thomas on his wheel. Thomas passes him and crosses the line a couple of lengths clear of Julian Aliphilippe and Thibaut Pinot, who are almost at a standstill. Has Alaphilippe done enough to keep yellow? I think so. 500km to go: There\u2019s a camera bike getting in the way throwing up a cloud of dust as Teuns leads Ciccone up the ridiculously steep climb. Teuns wins it. 1.5km to go: Dylan Teuns and Giulio Ciccone enter the agonisingly difficult knockings of the stage, with Movistar\u2019s Mikel Landa in hot pursuit. Ciccone looks the strongest as they enter a final kilometre of uphill, gravel strewn hell. 2.4km to go: Warren Barguil attacks the yellow jersey group and is followed by Mikel Landa, who overtakes him. 3.3km to go: Ciccone could take the yellow jersey today, but only if he finishes 1min 44sec or more clear of Julian Alaphilippe, who is four from the front of the group of favourites, with three riders from Team Ineos in front of him. 3.5km to go: Dylan Teuns and Giulio Ciccone have pulled clear and are pedalling along wearing their best poker faces. Back in the pack, Thibaut Pinot stands up in his pedals, tries to launch an attack and immediately thinks better of it. Sit down, Thibaut. 4.4km to go: Tim Wellens is struggling and there\u2019s a noticeable gap between him and his three fellow leaders. Teuns and Ciccone are also pulling away from Meurisse. 4.7km to go: The four leaders stop playing silly buggers, presumably on the orders of their Directeurs Sportifs, who will be watching from the team cars and barking orders accordingly. The gap is 3min 07sec - it should be enough as long as they don\u2019t start cat-and-mousing again. 5.5km to go: Movistar\u2019s Marc Soler hammers out the rhythm as the yellow jersey group continue to try to hunt down the four leaders. I think they\u2019re going to get caught, as they\u2019ve stopped working together and are already playing cat-and-mouse with a long way to go. The gap is 3min 20sec. 6km to go: Movistar continue to lead the chase, with the gap down to 3min 50sec. 6km to go: The road ramps up significantly for our four leaders. Giulio Ciccone of Trek-Segafredo is leading the way, with Wellens on his wheel. 7km to go: Teuns, Ciccone, Wellens and Meurisse lead the stage. Ciccone is probably the pick of the bunch in terms of climbing but he is having angry words with Wellens, in the polka dot jersey, for not doing his share of the work. 10km to go: With a lead of four minutes, the four leaders pass under the kite telling them have 10 kilometres left to travel, seven up them which will cause them no end of pain and anguish Have they a big enough lead? \u201cIf I was a betting man, I wouldn\u2019t put too much on the breakaway group staying clear,\u201d says Sean Kelly on Eurosport. 12km to go: Our four leaders are descending, as is the yellow jersey group behind them. Thibaut Pinot is prominent towards the front of the chasing pack and apparently did as many as 10 training climbs at today\u2019s finish during the spring. 15km to go: In his world Champion\u2019s jersey, Movistar\u2019s Alejandro Valverde leads the yellow jersey group along. It\u2019s about 30 strong now as they go over the top of the penultimate climb and begin their own descent. The gap is 4min 10sec. 19km to go: Wellens, Teuns, Ciccone and Meurisse continue to lead the stage with a gap of 4min 02sec separating them from the yellow jersey group. The leaders have just gone over the top of the Col Des Chevreres and are on the descent. They have one climb left and just look at how difficult it is. FYI: that ramp with the 24% gradient right at the top is covered in gravel. 20km to go: Thomas De Gendt can barely stay upright, so steep is the climb he\u2019s currently tackling. He\u2019s almost at a standstill as he hits the wall and is caught and passed by Wellens, Teuns, Ciccone and Meurisse. Back in the yellow jersey group, which Movistar continue to tow along, Team Ineos rider Wout Poels has been dropped. 21km to go: De Gendt continues to lead, while the original breakaway has shed several members. Back in the yellow jersey group, Peter Sagan is talking to his team-mate Marcus Burghardt, who is wearing race number No13. As is customary, in the name of superstition, it is upside down to avoid incurring bad luck. Here\u2019s Burghardt enduring some bad luck 12 years ago ... 21km to go: Thomas De Gendt pedals onwards, ready to tackle the penultimate climb of the day, the catefgory two Col des Chevreres. It\u2019s 3.5km in length, 914km to the top at a gradient of 9.5%. 25km to go: Nils Politt is dropped from what was the breakaway group before Thomas De Gendt decided to try to make today all about him. The gap from De Gendt to the the \u201cbreakaway\u201d he was once part of is 31 seconds. He\u2019s 5min 14sec clear of the yellow jersey group. 28km to go: Thomas De Gendt has attacked off the front of the breakaway and has opened a lead on his former travelling companions. 31km to go: Andre Greipel is caught by the big boys as they climb Col Des Croix, led by Nairo Quintana\u2019s Movistar, with Vincenzo Nibali\u2019s Bahrain-Merida and Geraint Thomas/Egan Bernal\u2019s Ineos tucked in behind them. 37km to go: \u201cIt\u2019s still very much in the balance at the minute, for the breakaway,\u201d says Eurosport pundit and Irish cycling legend Sean Kelly, upon being asked to assess their chances of producing the winner of the stage. 37km to go: Bora Hansgrohe and Movistar are leading the peloton, which has split in two, at a ferocious lick. The gap is 6min 42sec as the breakaway group head up the short category three Col Des Croix. An email: \u201cMy question is: Does it look like Team Ineos will attack and how does GT look today?\u201d asks Ryan. My answer is: no and a vision in burgundy. See for yourself. 42km to go: The gap is 7min 07sec as the breakaway and peloton continue their respective descents. Tim Wellens has guaranteed himself another day in the polka dot jersey, as long as he finishes today\u2019s stage. 50km to go: The peloton is about to crest the Ballon D\u2019Alsace and begin their descent. 55km to go: There\u2019s a closely fought sprint to the top of the Ballon D\u2019Alsace, which is won by Tim Wellens, ahead of an eight kilometre descent. Back in the bunch, Movistar have taken over at the front. Edet abandons! Ah, this just in \u2013 Nicolas has stepped off his bike and quite the race. He looked exceptionally green around the gills when an unsympathetic cameraman pulled up beside him earlier this afternoon. Get well soon, Nic. Hopefully it\u2019s just a 24-hour bug. 60km to go: I am becoming obsessed with the plight of Nicolas Edet, who is suffering from an intestinal complaint and has now gone from 30th on GC today to virtual Lanterne Rouge on the road. He\u2019s lost 25 minutes on the field today. 60km to go: The breakaway are five kilometres from the top of the climb with a gap of 8min 10sec to the bunch, which is still being led by three of Julian Alaphilippe\u2019s team-mates. Team Ineos are lined up behind them, dpoing none of the work. Assorted members of Movistar are tucked in behind them. Edet watch: By my reckoning, the 31-year-old Cofidis rider has already lost over 20 minutes so far today and still has a world of hurt to endure. The men in front: Shorn of Herr Greipel, these are the 13 in the breakaway: Beno\u00eet Cosnefroy (AG2R-La Mondiale), Dylan Teuns (Bahrain-Merida), Serge Pauwels (CCC), Julien Bernard and Giulio Ciccone (Trek-Segafredo), Nikias Arndt (Sunweb), Natnael Berhane (Cofidis), Thomas De Gendt and Tim Wellens (Lotto-Soudal), Fabien Grellier (Total Direct Energie), Nils Politt (Katusha-Alpecin), Xandro Meurisse and Andrea Pasqualon (Wanty-Groupe Gobert). 63km to go: Andre Greipel has been dropped from the breakaway group, which is now making its way up the hill to the Ballon D\u2019Alsace. The gap is 8min 24sec. It\u2019s looking increasingly likely that one of the 13 members of the escape party will win this stage. Increasingly likely but by no means certain, yet. Feed zone: The riders in the main bunch having some lunch and your reporter is going to grab an energy bar, ahead of the business end of the stage. Back in five. Watch this, from the Global Cycling Network, while I\u2019m away. The gap is now out to 8min 11sec, incidentally. An email: \u201cGreipel quite regularly gets involved at the front on non-sprint stages, it\u2019s one of the reasons why he is such a likeable racer,\u201d writes Simon Thomas. \u201cIt may be that he\u2019s just acting as a bridge in the event of an attack by one of his team mates or that he was trying to pick up intermediate sprint points (or stop someone else getting them). Or maybe he just fancied a crack at something different.\u201d 72km to go: The gap between the breakaway and the bunch is two seconds shy of eight minutes. The riders are on the descent at the moment and their next climb is up the Ballon D\u2019Alsace. It\u2019s a category one, 11 kilometres in length to a point 1,173m above sea level. The gradient is 5.8%. Edet watch: The stricken Nicolas is currently 18min 06sec behind the stage leaders and travelling at 15km/h. Hats off to him for carrying on but I suspect he will miss the time cut. 82km to go: The gap from the breakaway to the bunch is 7min 21sec. Julian Alaphilippe\u2019s teammate Kasper Asgreen is at the front of the peloton and is getting no help from any other team. If they don\u2019t get any help to close this gap, Trek-Segafredo rider Giulio Ciccone could finish the day in yellow. He\u2019s 1min 43sec behind Alaphilippe on GC. A lot will hinge on whether or not Team Ineos try to win today\u2019s stage or decide to keep their powder dry for another day. They have no reason to try to go for the stage win today but might fancy doing so anyway. An email: \u201cDo you have any insights into why Andre Greipel is hanging with the breakaway?\u201d asks Zach DeBruine. \u201cIt seems like he\u2019s hanging on for dear life. Is he worried about missing the time cut-off at the end of the stage?\u201d Anyone? My guess is he didn\u2019t want to be at the back of the field, downwind of Nicolas Edet. 85km to go: Natnael Berhane is first over Col Du Hundsruck, followed by Tim Wellens. 86km to go: Cracking maths there on my part. That\u2019s six different groups. 87km to go: Going by the official Tour tracker, the field appears to be split into seven different groups: the breakaway, the group of GC contenders, three different groups of stragglers and Nicolas Edet. 88km to go: Spare a thought for Nicolas Edet, who is visibly ill and already 14min 30sec and 10 kilometres off the pace being set by the breakaway. 89km to go: The 14 men of the breakaway are on their way uphill again. The category two Col Du Hundsruck is next on the itinerary. It\u2019s 748m above sea level, 5.3km in length and has a gradient of just shy of 7%. The gap to the peloton is 7min 31sec. 96km to go: Total Direct Energie rider Anthony Turgis goes wide on a turn and almost goes off the road, but manages to stay upright. Now traditional crash as soon as I abandon my post: Warren Barguil hit the deck near the summit of Grand Ballon, but has got a bike change and is away rolling again. There\u2019s a bit of damp on the road and this descent is technical and difficult. Not a time for risks. 109km to go: The breakaway group head over the short but steep second climb of the day, the category three Grand Ballon. De Gendt is first over, followed by Giulio Ciccone, who was King of the Mountains at the Giro. There\u2019s a serious descent to come, so your reporter is going to hope nobody falls and take this opportunity to attend to collect a couple of bidons from the Guardian team car. Back in five! 113km to go: The peloton is about to crest the summit of Le Markstein having been led all the way up by Deceuninck-Quick Step rider Kasper Asgreen. A couple of wheels back, the riders of Team Ineos are enjoying an impromptu spot of lunch after Gianni Moscon went back to the team car to fetch a musette of energy bars and gels. 116km to go: Already in the polka dot jersey, Tim Wellens is first over Le Markstein. Today\u2019s favourites: Egan Bernal is the favourite to win today\u2019s stage and is followed in the betting by Giulio Ciccone, Thibaut Pinot, Adam Yates, Alejandro Valverde, Geraint Thomas, Dylan Teuns, Dan Martin, Jakob Fugslang, Michael Woods, and Warren Barguil. 118km to go: There are two kilometres to go to the summit of Le Markstein and then it\u2019s onwards and upwards to the Grand Ballon, another category one climb. The gap between the breakaway and the bunch is 6min 49sec. 120km to go: A motorcycle cameraman pulls up alongside a very forlorn looking Nicolas Edet. The Cofidis rider has been dropped from the main bunch and has just been receiving treatment from the medical car. He is unwell today and is apparently suffering from a stomach complaint. It\u2019s going to be a long, long day for the poor sod. 123km to go: The gap from the breakaway to the peloton is now 7min 09sec. Deuceuninck-Quick Step rider Kasper Asgreen is leading the peloton along, as he has been since the breakaway formed. 125km to go: It\u2019s uphill for the foreseeable future as the race tackles Le Markstein, the first category one climb of this Tour. It\u2019s summit is 1,183m above sea level, the climb is 10.8km in length and the gradient is 5.4%. Intermediate sprint result 1. Andrea Pasqualon: 20 points 2. Nils Politt: 17 3. Andr\u00e9 Greipel: 15 4. Nikias Arndt: 13 5. Thomas De Gendt: 11 6. Dylan Teuns: 10 7. Fabien Grellier: 9 8. Giulio Ciccone: 8 9. Natnael Berhane: 7 10. Xandro Meurisse: 6 11. Serge Pauwels: 5 12. Beno\u00eet Cosnefroy: 4 13. Tim Wellens: 3 14. Julien Bernard: 2 And at 6min 55sec: 15. Michael Matthews: 1 127km to go: Deep in conversation with Elia Viviani, Peter Sagan gets caught napping by Michael Matthews in the race for the final intermediate sprint point. He gives chase to the Australian, but is unable to catch him. The pair roll over the line, with Matthews turning to share a laugh with his rival. 128km to go: The gap is out to 6min 35sec, while Team Deceuninck-Quick Step continue to lead what passes for the charge behind them. At some point, one would expect the Skybots from Team Ineos to grab today\u2019s stage by the scruff of the neck and squeeze tightly. Egan Bernal is many people\u2019s idea of today\u2019s winner. Intermediate sprint: Andrea Pasqualon wins the intermediate sprint and is followed over the line by Nils Politt and Andre Greipel in second and third. The 11 other riders in the breakaway follow them, meaning there\u2019s just one point left up for grabs for a peloton that is now over six minutes behind them. 133km to go: The gap between the 14-man breakaway and the peloton is out to 5min 46sec and the weather has become inclement. It\u2019s raining, but not heavily. Mitchelton Scott\u2019s stage five diary: Matteo Trentin could not have asked for a better leadout from his teammates yesterday, but ultimately the Italian was unable to get his nose in front of Peter Sagan and had to settle for second place. There\u2019s no shame in that. 139km to go: The riders of Team Ineos are lined up behind their colleagues from Quick Step at the front of the bunch. 140km to go: Giulio Ciccone (Trek-Segafredo) is ther highest placed GC contender in the breakaway in 42nd at 1min 43sec. He\u2019s currently the virtual leader of this Tour and on Eurosport, the commentary team have said he\u2019s capable of winning today\u2019s stage. 142km to go: The gap goes out to 4min 23sec with Deceuninck-Quick Step at the front of the main peloton. Your breakaway: Beno\u00eet Cosnefroy (AG2R-La Mondiale), Dylan Teuns (Bahrain-Merida), Serge Pauwels (CCC), Julien Bernard and Giulio Ciccone (Trek-Segafredo), Nikias Arndt (Sunweb), Natnael Berhane (Cofidis), Thomas De Gendt and Tim Wellens (Lotto-Soudal), Fabien Grellier (Total Direct Energie), Nils Politt (Katusha-Alpecin), Xandro Meurisse and Andrea Pasqualon (Wanty-Groupe Gobert) and Andr\u00e9 Greipel (Ark\u00e9a-Samsic) have 1\u201945\u2019\u2019 lead after 10km. The gap to the bunch is already 2min 44sec and rising. 152km to go: One rider after another is being spat out the front of the bunch, trying to bridge the gap to the escape party of 14. Ciccone, Meurisse, Teuns, Politt, Bernard, De Gendt, Pasqualon, Berhane, Wellens, Cosnefroy, Arndt, Pauwels, Grellier and Greipel are the men in the getaway car and the bunch seem content to let them go. 155km to go: Tim Wellens, currently in the polka dot jersey, is also in the breakaway attempt. Will they get away? They\u2019re racing! The start of today\u2019s race has been semaphored and a group of six riders have attacked off the front of the bunch. They\u2019re joined by another five or six who bridge the gap. Thomas De Gendt, it should go without saying, is among the early pace-setters. Serge Pauwels and Andre Greipel are there too. Happy birthday! Lotto Soudal sprinter Caleb Ewan is celebrating his 25th birthday. Out! We have our first abandonment of this year\u2019s Tour. Team CCC\u2019s Kiwi rider Paddy Bevan has quit the race, having felt unable to continue because of two fractured ribs he suffered in a crash on stage four. The field is down to 175 riders. Today\u2019s roll-out: The neutralised zone is a 10 kilometres long today and the field is over halfway through it, bunched behind the red Skoda carrying race director Christian Prudhomme. They\u2019re going at a fair old lick, a state of affairs that would suggest there\u2019ll be a number of riders anxious to attack from the gun. Today\u2019s intermediate sprint is at Linthal, around 30 kilometres into today\u2019s stage, 15 kilometres from the first classified climb of the day, the category one Le Markstein. La Planche des Belles Filles: Legend has it that during the Thirty Years War (1618 to 1648), young women from Plancer-les-Mines fled into these mountains to escape Swedish mercenaries, who they feared might rape and murder them. Trapped on the mountain top where today\u2019s stage concludes, they opted to take their own lives by jumping from the summit into the lake below, rather than surrender. One of the soldiers promptly engraved an epitaph for \u201cthe beautiful girls\u201d into a wooden board and left it as a memorial. Hence the name of today\u2019s brutal final climb: La Planche des Belles Filles (The Board of the Beautiful Girls). The Move: Lance Armstrong is not a Eurosport presenter, but he is also hosting a daily pod in which he, his former teammate George Hincapie and their pal JD give their own piping hot takes on the latest action. GO straight to the six-minute mark to skip past the adverts. The Breakaway: Eurosport presenter Orla Chennaoui is hosting a daily podcast in which she and assorted guests pick over the bones of the day\u2019s action and looks ahead to the following day\u2019s stage. You can catch yesterday\u2019s offering below. Stage five report: Jeremy Whittle was in Colmar to see Peter Sagan secure the 12th Tour de France stage win of his career, while Julian Alaphilippe stayed in the yellow jersey. From William Fotheringham\u2019s stage-by-stage guide: Short and intense over four brutal climbs culminating with the ascent where Chris Froome won in 2012. The main action will come in the final 20km over the very narrow and steep Col des Chevr\u00e8res, which hits 18%, and the finish climb which goes to 20%. It\u2019s a typical first key day at the Tour: the time gaps should be a bit less than in other years as we are still in the opening week but the chances are only 10 or a dozen riders will be in with a shout after this one. Local boy Thibaut Pinot might be the best bet to win the stage and steal an early march.",

The crowd then marched to Parliament Square where police intervened after journalists were threatened and verbally abused, before some congregated near the offices of the attorney general, who had taken the application to have Robinson committed to prison. A 50-year-old man was arrested outside Westminster Abbey for offences of affray alleged to have been committed outside the Old Bailey last Friday when Robinson was convicted. Two other men and two women were also arrested on Thursday in connection with alleged offences last week. Passing sentence on Thursday, Dame Victoria Sharp said of Robinson: \u201cHe has lied about a number of matters and sought to portray himself as the victim of unfairness and oppression. \u201cThis does not increase his sentence, but it does mean that there can be no reduction for an admission of guilt, or for contrition or for remorse.\u201d Robinson, 36, from Luton in Bedfordshire, had denied breaching a reporting ban by livestreaming footage of defendants arriving at court.

      "bodyText": "Geraint Thomas reversed the narrative in the Tour de France, leading home the main contenders with a resurgent performance in the first summit finish of the 2019 race on the gravel road to La Planche des Belles Filles in the Vosges mountains. It was a show of strength that suggested the defence of the Welshman\u2019s Tour title is very much alive. After overhauling a late attack from Julian Alaphilippe, the defending champion took back the time he had lost in Monday\u2019s finish in Epernay and leapfrogged his Colombian team mate Egan Bernal in the overall standings by nine seconds to reassert himself in the Team Ineos hierarchy. Reminded that most pundits had tipped his 22-year-old team-mate to win the stage, Thomas replied: \u201cI don\u2019t listen to tips. I felt pretty good. I thought the steep climbs weren\u2019t my cup of tea. I was expecting others \u2013 Nairo Quintana, Egan, Richie Porte, Adam Yates - would jump up there. It was a decent day in the end. \u201cIt is one of those climbs where you have to patient. When Alaphilippe went clear at 800 metres to go, I had the confidence to let him go and ride my own tempo and drive it all the way to the line.\u201d Ahead of him an exhausted Giulio Ciccone, already a stage winner in this year\u2019s Girod\u2019Italia, took the maillot jaune from Alaphilippe\u2019s shoulders to lead the Tourby six seconds, despite being beaten to the line for the stage win by breakaway companion Dylan Teuns of Belgium.

Bardet, who lost a minute to his rivals in Sunday\u2019s team time trial, is now over two minutes behind Thomas. \u201cI was not at the best level today which feels bitter,\u201d the Frenchman said. \u201cI\u2019m still very motivated for this Tour but I have to try to understand what happened and why I was stuck like that.\u201d However, Thomas is separated by only 35 seconds from Adam Yates, with Bernal, Pinot, Michael Woods, Rigoberto Uran, and Fuglsang all sandwiched between them.

The important thing to remember is that Northern Ireland\u2019s devolved assembly was set up for a dynamic that doesn\u2019t exist anywhere else in the UK: two broadly equal-sized populations, diametrically opposed on their biggest issue. So, like toddlers divvying up chores, one got to wash, and the other dried. One got first minister, the other deputy \u2013 and all symbols, flags, anthems and holidays were to be given equal respect, as two clearly defined, but resolutely immiscible, halves. This incentivised immoderation, since whichever party espoused the most assertive and intransigent arguments for its community stood a better chance of wielding influence.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s an odd time for the DUP. Having spent the past two years backing the government on a Brexit that a majority of Northern Irish citizens voted against, it now finds support for Irish reunification at its highest ever level in Northern Ireland, the Irish Republic and, crucially, among their supposed ideological fellow-travellers in the Conservative party. More pressingly still, MPs this week voted to extend crucial human rights to Northern Ireland, direct from Westminster, paving the way for the decriminalisation of abortion and the implementation of marriage equality, in line with the rest of the UK. How did a party as frothingly opposed to liberal social change as it is to Irish reunification end up presiding over a reality in which both are more likely than they have been in decades? Explaining any aspect of Northern Irish politics in depth is a bit like giving a friend an update on all those operations that your dog has just had \u2013 it\u2019s obviously sad, complicated, and painful, but without ever actually being interesting, which means that the second you begin speaking, your pal is only half-listening, and merely waiting for a polite moment to change the subject. Nevertheless, here is an attempt. The important thing to remember is that Northern Ireland\u2019s devolved assembly was set up for a dynamic that doesn\u2019t exist anywhere else in the UK: two broadly equal-sized populations, diametrically opposed on their biggest issue. So, like toddlers divvying up chores, one got to wash, and the other dried. One got first minister, the other deputy \u2013 and all symbols, flags, anthems and holidays were to be given equal respect, as two clearly defined, but resolutely immiscible, halves. This incentivised immoderation, since whichever party espoused the most assertive and intransigent arguments for its community stood a better chance of wielding influence. This \u2013 not some inherent tactical genius on the part of either party \u2013 is how Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP swiftly overpowered the more moderate SDLP and UUP, and now hold every single Northern Irish seat in Westminster bar one, and 61% of seats in the Stormont assembly itself. Having gained their position through inflexibility rather than political savvy, it\u2019s not surprising that deadlock is so common.

The ship, believed to be in breach of EU sanctions on Syria, remains in British possession. Rouhani was quoted by the Iranian official IRNA news agency calling the seizure of the Iranian oil ship \u201cmean and wrong\u201d. During a cabinet meeting he warned London: \u201cYou are an initiator of insecurity and you will understand its repercussions.\u201d Last week a former leader of the Revolutionary Guard said the Islamic Republic should consider seizing a British oil tanker in response. Mohsen Rezaei, who led the Guard during Iran\u2019s 1980s \u201ctanker war\u201d in the Gulf, made the comments the day after nearly 30 Royal Marines were deployed to impound Grace 1. \u201cIf England does not release the Iranian oil tanker, the duty ... [of Iran] is to respond and seize one English oil tanker,\u201d Rezaei said on Friday. Tehran has been accused of sabotaging oil tankers in the strait of Hormuz in an attempt at economic retaliation against the US after Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear agreement and imposed crippling sanctions on Iran. Washington and Tehran came as close as ever to direct military conflict last month, when Iran shot down a US drone and Trump ordered retaliatory air strikes, only to call them off minutes before impact. The UK and other European countries have been trying to save the deal, in which Tehran agreed to limits on its nuclear programme in exchange for relief from international sanctions. Tehran\u2019s recent decision to ramp up uranium enrichment together with European powers\u2019 inability to meet Iranian demands for economic assistance, however, makes it unlikely to survive. \u201cIt seems that the Brits and the French and the Germans are coming around to the idea that the Iranians are up to no good!\u201d, president Trump tweeted on Thursday. Russia and China, both signatories to the nuclear agreement along with the UK, France and Germany, called for restraint. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said \u201cfreedom of navigation should be ensured in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz.\u201d The US is hoping to enlist its allies in a coalition to monitor the Iranian presence in the crucial waterway and off the coast of Yemen, Pentagon officials said this week. Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he discussed the matter on Tuesday with acting secretary of defence Mark Esper and secretary of state Mike Pompeo. \u201cWe\u2019re getting ready now to move out,\u201d he told reporters at Fort Myer, Virginia. \u201cWe have a pretty clear concept of what we want to do.\u201d In recent months, the US has sent thousands of additional troops, an aircraft carrier, B-52 bombers and advanced fighter jets to the region.",

Obstinate, even.</p> <p>For the sake of its own sanity, rather than take a deep dive into everything from Thai <em>tod mun pla-krai</em> to Danish <em>fiskefrikadeller</em>, How to Eat (HTE) will restrict itself here to what is broadly understood as the soft, potato-based, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/jun/16/how-to-cook-perfect-fishcakes\">British-style fish cake</a>.</p> <h2><strong>But what is the British-style fishcake?</strong></h2> <p>A patty ranging in diameter from an ice-hockey puck to a 7in single and no thicker than the average Le Carr\u00e9 paperback (the internationally recognised unit of fishcake measurement). Ideally prepared in a 45:55 potato-to-fish ratio (too much fish and it will lack a smooth, soothing texture), the fishcake should be shallow-fried.

Merely flouring the cakes and, particularly, chilling the mixture and frying uncoated lumps of it in a pan, is scandalous. In many ways, the fishcake is all about the crumb: that moment when you take a knife and crack its carapace with an audible snap, the sight of steam gently venting from that new fissure sharpening the appetite and waking the senses with anticipation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a12120624909d1082a98e0da01530ae92a3765d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a12120624909d1082a98e0da01530ae92a3765d1/275_387_3425_4278/801.jpg\" alt=\"A stack of salmon fishcakes.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A stack of salmon fishcakes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Diana Miller/Getty/Cultura RF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In terms of the fishcake\u2019s contents, its endless flexibility, its ability to harmoniously reconcile anything from naturally smoked haddock to tinned tuna, is its greatest strength. You would not fritter away pricy, delicately flavoured scallops or white crab meat in there (would you?), but otherwise, all bets are off. Or on. The differentiations in taste and texture between mashed potato and two or three types of (smoked) fish, are what make this dish sing.</p> <p>If you are using fillets of cod or such (get you!), then make larger cakes so that you can retain pieces of the flaked fish in the mix, rather than reducing it to a fibrous mush. In that way, smaller cakes are better suited to tinned fish and lesser, gelatinous cuts, the texture of which it is less important to retain. Do not stuff your cakes with dense, squidgy hot-smoked salmon, which tends to be a little dry if it is allowed to dominate.</p> <p>Beyond potato and fish, additions to the cake mix should be no more than seasoning. For instance, a few scattered capers or spring onions, a hint of grated horseradish or lemon zest. These should be a little tweak, a spritz, a vinegary tickle at the periphery. Ultimately and indeed, at times rather blandly, your fishcakes should taste most prominently of potato and fish.</p> <p>Other common additions are too assertive (boiled egg is too rich, gherkins too sharp), while adding grated vegetables to the fish cakes \u2013 salmon and courgette, mackerel and beetroot \u2013 is baffling. It ends up blurring and muffling the flavour of both fish and vegetable. Serve any vegetables on the side. You want their flavours to retain a clear, individual presence.</p> <h2><strong>The triangle of taste</strong></h2> <p>The correct formula for perfect fishcakes is: fishcakes + sauce + one vegetable side = ultimate pleasure.</p> <p>The sauce (think: similar viscosity to hollandaise) is essential because, without it, your fishcake will often be too dry. You cannot pack your cake with butter or creme fraiche or it will not hold together in the pan. Frequently it needs saucing, liberally. Like the chosen vegetable \u2013 fresh and sweet, earthy, metallic, clean \u2013 the sauce should add a layer of flavour that is, at once, complementary and distinct. It is a supporting actor working diligently to elevate the star of the show, the fishcake.</p> <p>Within that triangle of taste there is endless possibility for variation: from a classic cod-salmon fish cake with steamed spinach and a silky, chive-flecked beurre blanc; via mackerel-forward cakes served with roasted beetroot and a warm horseradish cream; to tuna cakes with a loose and oily salsa verde and smoky, grilled courgettes.</p> <p>Indeed, it is probably easier to discuss what patently does not work with fishcakes:</p> <p><strong>More carbs</strong> Chips, fries, mash, no. Too much of a good thing. This dish is already circa 50% potato (more if the pub kitchen is economising). See also, rice, couscous, bread.</p> <p><strong>Mushy peas</strong> With a fishcake? That is a whole lot of clag.</p> <p><strong>Parsley sauce </strong>From 1980s school canteens to the freezer aisle, an unholy pallid gunk.</p> <p><strong>Lemon wedges </strong>If you feel your fishcake needs a splash of lemon, work it carefully into the mix as a seasoning, rather than leaving people to haphazardly jet-wash patches of their plate with citrus.</p> <p><strong>Tartare sauce </strong>Yes, it makes sense, in its flavours. But the fish cake is a much drier beast than fish and chips, where the glossy batter lubricates each mouthful. Tartare is too thick a condiment to work here.</p> <p><strong>Tomato-based sauces </strong>HTE fully concedes that in southern France or Campania, there are probably people who can combine fish, onions, fresh tomatoes, garlic and olive oil in ways that would blow its tiny mind. But sadly, HTE was born in Manchester not Marseille, and early experiences of tired, mealy frozen cod in awful, flatly under-seasoned tomato stews have left it with a deep mistrust of the fish-tomato interface.</p> <p>This is further compounded by the fact that, just as tartare is too thick for fishcakes, cooked tomato sauces are often too thin and watery. Sit your fishcake in a moat of tomato sauce, rather than beurre blanc or hollandaise, and its bottom will become unappetisingly soggy. See also: tomato salsas, anything with a red pepper base, in fact any (gloopy, ill-defined) cooked sauce on the whole ratatouille-piperade flavour axis.</p> <p><strong>Pesto </strong>Again, too thick (unless deployed in a cream of some sort) and too, well, <em>pesto-y</em>. The dominant flavour of any food involving pesto is pesto \u2013 and fantastic as that often is, it feels reductive here.</p> <p><strong>Baked beans </strong>Grow up.</p> <p><strong>\u201cHot sauce\u201d</strong> Not everything needs chilli heat. Fishcakes, least of all.</p> <p><strong>Cold salads </strong>Not only does pairing a fishcake with a cold salad create a potentially jarring jumble of flavours, but it is one of British food\u2019s great fallacies that eating a cold salad alongside a warm main component is a desirable situation.

Prosecutors in Milan have opened an inquiry into possible charges of international corruption in the case. The inquiry follows an investigation by L\u2019Espresso magazine (reported by the Guardian in February) which alleged there was an arrangement by Russian representatives, close to Vladmir Putin\u2019s government, to sell 3m tons of diesel fuel to an Italian oil company. The inquiry was launched by magistrates in February but its existence was announced only on Thursday. Milan\u2019s chief prosecutor, Francesco Greco, told ANSA news agency: \u201cWe are carrying out investigations to understand if there are crimes or not.\u201d According to L\u2019Espresso, on 18 October 2018 a member of Salvini\u2019s entourage, Gianluca Savoini, met two Italians and three Russians in Moscow\u2019s hotel Metropol to discuss a deal that would divert profits to the League before the European electoral campaign in May. On Wednesday, BuzzFeed News published an audio recording which it said was of that meeting \u201cin which a close aide of [Salvini] and the other five men can be heard negotiating the terms of a deal to covertly channel tens of millions of dollars of Russian oil money to Salvini\u2019s party, the League\u201d. It alleged that such a deal would represent \u201ca breach of Italian electoral law, which bans political parties from accepting large foreign donations\u2019\u2019. Reached by the Guardian in February, Savoini, described as the League\u2019s emissary in Moscow, in an email declined to comment on the \u201cfake news\u201d. The League has denied the reports in L\u2019Espresso and Buzzfeed, and on Wednesday Salvini threatened legal action. \u201cI have already sued for libel in the past, I\u2019ll do it again today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow,\u2019\u2019 he said. Although L\u2019Espresso admitted it had no evidence that the deal was ever executed, the claims raised questions about the relationship between the Kremlin and the anti-immigrant party, which is in a coalition government with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. Giovanni Tizian, a journalist from L\u2019Espresso, said: \u201cWe have documented that the meeting between Savoini and the Russians at the Metropole hotel in Moscow is just the outcome of a series of meetings held in June and July 2018 where Savoini was pushing for a deal with the Russians.\u201d Tizian, along with the investigative journalist Stefano Vergine, co-authored a book entitled The Black Book of the League. Opposition parties described the claims as worrying and urged immediate explanation. \u201cRubles from Russia to the League? Salvini has to immediately clarify to parliament,\u201d said Nicola Zingaretti, the centre-left Democratic party\u2019s leader.",

Halep doesn\u2019t take it but gets a <strong>second chance at her advantage</strong>. Svitolina squeezes a forehand deep to Halep\u2019s backhand wing and the Romanian nets. Deuce. Another net cord and <strong>another set point</strong>. This time Halep double faults. <strong>A fourth set point</strong>. Svitolina swats away a return winner off a tame serve! <strong>A break point is then followed by a fifth set point</strong>. Another seemingly endless game to add to one at 1-0. <strong>A <em>sixth</em> set point</strong>. And this time Halep decides enough is enough, as she takes it with a forehand winner down the line!

While week one was about the coming of Coco, as the newest face in tennis announced herself to Wimbledon and the world in some style, week two has gained a rather more familiar feel, as the four most recognisable and rewarded names in the game seek to further enhance their greatness.</p> \n  <p> Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal\u2019s procession to the semi-finals has seemed almost inevitable, such has been their domination amid the early decimation of the likes of Stefanos Tsitsipas, Alex Zverev and Dominic Thiem, but Serena Williams\u2019s progress to this stage has been anything but certain. Playing much of this season with an injured knee and much of the past 12 months with the look of a woman who has the weight of history on her mind as she remains one win away from Margaret Court\u2019s all-time record of 24 grand slam singles titles, Williams arrived here seriously short of match practice and without a major victory since the 2017 Australian Open when she was two months pregnant. The 37-year-old even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/09/serena-williams-naomi-osaka-us-open-final-tennis-umpire\">admitted this week</a> she sought therapy and apologised to Naomi Osaka for her behaviour after last year\u2019s infamous US Open final. </p> \n  <p>However Serena has seemed, well, more serene this fortnight, apparently playing pain-free again and surely boosted by the fun she\u2019s had as one half of Murena/SerAndy/why didn\u2019t someone come up with something less daft? and, while their courtship came to an end with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/10/andy-murray-serena-williams-out-wimbledon-mixed-doubles-bruno-soares-nicole-melichar\">defeat in the mixed doubles yesterday</a>, Williams still has a date with destiny in the singles. </p> \n  <p>This afternoon the seven-times champion meets the unseeded Barbora Strycova, a lesson in perseverance if ever there was one. The crafty Czech is appearing in the last four at a major for the first time in 53 attempts and, at 33, is the oldest grand slam semi-final debutant in the Open era. Strycova will be confident after accounting for Johanna Konta in the quarter-finals but of course Williams \u2013 if she is fully firing \u2013 is an entirely different proposition. While Williams has been inconsistent during matches, the way she stepped it up in the last few games of her quarter-final suggests her champion spirit is returning.<br></p> \n  <p>Williams and Strycova play second, after another match between a former grand slam winner and first-time semi-finalist, as the 2018 French Open champion and former world No 1 Simona Halep plays the Ukrainian eighth seed, Elina Svitolina. Halep reached this stage five years ago but says this is the first year she has learned to love the grass, while Svitolina feels at home here, given she used to live in London and has a British coach.</p> \n  <p>Let\u2019s say that makes Svitolina an honorary Brit, especially in Konta\u2019s absence. But then come to think of it Williams is too after her partnership with Murray. So there could be an all-British women\u2019s final of sorts on Saturday, which hasn\u2019t happened since 1961. Meanwhile the way the triumvirate of Djokovic, Federer and Nadal is going it\u2019ll probably be at least another 58 years before they let anyone else win a slam.</p> \n  <p><strong>Play begins at</strong>: 1pm BST. Bring your sun cream because it\u2019s going to be hot, hot, hot.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-11T11:25:57.699Z\">at 12.25pm BST</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Right it\u2019s time to call time on today\u2019s blog, somewhat earlier than expected after those dominant wins for Serena Williams and Simona Halep. Let\u2019s hope proceedings will go on for a little longer tomorrow when Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal meet for the first time here since the Greatest Match of All Time \u2122. Hopefully Kevin Mitchell\u2019s preview will keep you going until then \u2013 otherwise this definitely will if you can spare six hours. Thanks for your company today. Bye! A few other results to bring you from today. Wimbledon\u2019s 2010 marathon man Nicolas Mahut and his fellow Frenchman Edouard Roger-Vasselin are through to the men\u2019s doubles final, defeating Croatia\u2019s Ivan Dodig and Slovakia\u2019s Filip Polasek 6-2, 7-6 (7), 7-6 (2). They\u2019ll face the winners of the match just getting under way on Centre Court, between the Colombian second seeds, Juan Sebastian Cabal and Robert Farah, and South Africa\u2019s Raven Klaasen and New Zealand\u2019s Michael Venus. On No 1 Court, Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar, the top seeds in the mixed doubles and the villains of the piece yesterday when they did for Andy Murray and Serena Williams, could go the same way as Murena, trailing by a set in their quarter-final. And in the wheelchair events, there have been quarter-final singles defeats for Britain\u2019s Gordon Reid, Alfie Hewett and Jordanne Whiley, but victory for the two-time Paralympic silver medallist Andy Lapthorne, who has become the first Brit to reach a quad final at Wimbledon. The match is on Williams\u2019s racket and she\u2019ll be the strong favourite not only because of their head-to-head (which she dominates 9-1) but also because of their match-up. An attacking Williams should beat a defending Halep. But if Williams gets the jitters, Halep showed today that she\u2019s in the form to take advantage. One thing is certain: if Williams does win the title, at the age of 37, with no momentum coming into the tournament and given the pressure of the history she\u2019s chasing, it would be one of her best grand slam wins. And that\u2019s saying something. Here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell\u2019s match report: Two semi-finals. Four sets. A combined seven games won by the defeated. The crowd may feel short changed but they did get to see Williams at her best. Can she maintain that power, poise and precision against Halep or will the milestone of equalling Margaret Court\u2019s all-time grand slam record become a millstone as it did in the Wimbledon and US Open finals last year? And here are the thoughts of the victor: It\u2019s good, especially after my year. It feels good to be back in the final. I just needed some matches. Every match I\u2019m improving. Now I\u2019m feeling good I can do what I do best, and that\u2019s playing tennis. I wake up every morning and I get to be fit, play in front of crowds. Not everyone can do that. I love what I do, it\u2019s just a remarkable experience. [Halep is] tough. We always have tough matches. I look forward to it. Strycova prevails in a 14-shot rally on the first point. A final flourish? Perhaps, because Williams wallops her way to 15-all. But then Strycova decides to get in on the act. 15-30. Which becomes 30-all. Strycova loops long and it\u2019s match point. And Williams ends with yet another winner, sprinting forward to dispatch a cross-court forehand! Williams is through to her 11th Wimbledon final after a devastating display that lasted only 59 minutes and stands only one win away from that historic 24th grand slam title and her first since becoming a mother! Second set: *Williams 6-1, 5-2 Strycova (*denotes next server) Strycova is skating on very thin ice at 15-30 on her serve. Or stumbling on slightly worn grass, to be more accurate. The drop shot that served her so well against Konta again fails to come off here. 15-40, two break points that could leave Williams serving for the match. Strycova holds firm on the first, but inexplicably blazes a volley well into the tramlines on the second! Strycova screams before putting her face in her hands. It\u2019s almost checkmate for the Czech. Second set: Williams 6-1, 4-2 Strycova* (*denotes next server) In words that will probably put the curse on Williams, there are no signs she will get nervous closing this out. She\u2019s looking so assured. When she\u2019s nervous her footwork can be the first thing that goes, but she\u2019s moving so freely, unlike her opponent who appears to be struggling with a leg injury. Williams consolidates the break by holding to love. Second set: *Williams 6-1, 3-2 Strycova (*denotes next server) It\u2019s certainly fun watching the 5ft 5in Strycova digging out everything she has in her box of tricks to try to conjure a comeback against Williams, even though she is surely going to come up short. Williams rolls through another service game and then puts the pressure on Strycova\u2019s serve at 30-all. Strycova double faults, but I\u2019m not sure that can be called a fault given the way Williams was lurking within the baseline. And Strycova nets! Second set: *Williams 6-1, 1-2 Strycova (*denotes next server) As Tumaini says in his tweet, the mixed doubles has certainly helped Williams in the singles, but becoming an honorary Brit has also seen her lifted by the crowd more than perhaps in previous years. But the Centre Court patrons are cheering loudly for Strycova as the Czech underdog gets to game point. And Strycova is screaming even more loudly herself when she holds to win only her third game of the match. Second set: Williams 6-1, 1-1 Strycova* (*denotes next server) Strycova has defeated four seeds this fortnight, including Johanna Konta in the quarter-finals when she blew the Brit off course with her serve and volleying, low slice and liberal use of drop shots. But it\u2019s not enough to interrupt Williams\u2019s rhythm. While Strycova manages to hold serve at the start of the second set, Williams comes straight back at her with a hold to 15, though the highlight of the game was a stylish Strycova backhand winner which just clipped the line. But no, there\u2019s a possible twist to the tale as Strycova out of nowhere gets to 0-15, 0-30, 0-40 with a very fortunate net cord. The Czech needs all the luck she can get right now. But beware a riled Williams. The seven-times champion retaliates immediately, saving all three break points for deuce. A beautiful angled drop volley from Williams brings up set point. And the set is sealed with her third ace. First set: *Williams 5-1 Strycova (*denotes next server) Williams\u2019s serve is such a weapon and the free points she gets on it quickly puts so much pressure back on her opponent when they\u2019re serving. Having returned a man\u2019s 138mph serve in the mixed doubles for a clean winner on Tuesday, Strycova\u2019s serve is batting practice for Williams right now. 15-40, two points for the double break. Strycova sends a backhand wide and this set could be over very soon. First set: Williams 4-1 Strycova* (*denotes next server) Williams whistles through on serve, to love. She\u2019s looking like the woman who has won the title seven times before. First set: *Williams 3-1 Strycova (*denotes next server) Williams sends a little message to Strycova that any weak serves will be punished by rattling a return winner. 15-all. She then gives the Czech something else to think about as she crashes down the smash. 30-all. A Strycova second serve is inviting for Williams, but she bludgeons the backhand long, before letting out an anguished scream. 40-30. Deuce. Advantage Williams, when Strycova rushes the drop shot. Strycova decides to serve and volley \u2013 you can\u2019t criticise her for the tactic \u2013 but Williams is on to it, and pulls off the passing winner for the break! Williams is looking ominously strong. First set: Williams 2-1 Strycova* (*denotes next server) Sam Smith points out on the BBC commentary that Williams had played only 12 matches this year coming into Wimbledon, adding up to around 20 hours on court. She may have been underdone coming here but she\u2019s cooking on gas on serve here, and a hold to 30 allows her to nudge ahead once more. Both players seem settled from the off. First set: *Williams 1-1 Strycova (*denotes next server) Williams looks furious with herself after an errant forehand gives Strycova game point at 40-15. Another unforced error and Strycova starts her serve with a comfortable hold. But Williams is already pushing here, trying to dictate the play, which could be ominous for the Czech who is appearing in her first grand slam semi-final at the age of 33. First set: Williams 1-0 Strycova* (*denotes next server) Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Williams won the toss and will serve first. Sorry, make that Williams, what with Wimbledon finally stepping into the 21st century and no longer using marital status when saying the name of female players. But I digress. Williams gets to 30-all. Strycova checks the champion\u2019s charge for 30-all. But Williams takes the next two points \u2013 finishing with the overhead \u2013 and that\u2019s the opening game. Williams says: \u201cThis is the first time since Australia that I actually felt good. It\u2019s been a really, really long year for me already, and hard year, because I\u2019m usually not typically injured. Now that I feel good, I can actually focus on training and technique and practice, something that I just literally haven\u2019t been able to do a lot of.\u201d Strycova says: \u201cOf course, I don\u2019t have as much power as Serena, but I have other weapons. I have really nothing to lose. When you go out there, you just focus on yourself and you focus how to beat that opponent, the way you want to beat her. So I am not really scared to play her. I just really will try my best and I will fight as much as I can.\u201d Tik! Tok! Tik! Tok! They\u2019re warming up, the 5ft 10in Williams against the 5ft 5in Strycova. Williams leads the head-to-head 3-0, which includes their 2012 match at Wimbledon. This is a real contrast in styles between the power of Williams and the serve-volleying and slicing and dicing of the crafty Czech. And here comes Serena into the Wimbledon arena. After the SerAndy/Murena partnership ended in defeat yesterday, she\u2019s back to being just Serena this afternoon, but with seven Wimbledon titles and 23 grand slam singles titles to her name, that\u2019s the way she likes it. However will that quest for a record-equalling 24th major weigh too heavily on her shoulders today, as it did in last year\u2019s Wimbledon and US Open finals? It\u2019s an intriguing sub-plot to today\u2019s match. And more musings on that semi-final: News on tomorrow\u2019s order of play, including Roger v Rafa XL: Fancy a match report already? Sure you do. Well that was rather an anti-climax. A match that promised so much, especially after those first two games took 20 minutes, was all over in an hour and 12 minutes. Halep was rewarded for being the more aggressive player and, having won her first slam at the French Open last year, seemed to be playing with less pressure than Svitolina. On that form she\u2019ll be extremely tough for Williams on Saturday sorry Williams or Strycova on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing feeling,\u201d says a beaming Halep. \u201cI\u2019m really excited and also nervous. It\u2019s one the of the best moments of my life. It was not as easy as the score shows. I fought really hard to win this match. I played the right tactic and was very strong mentally and physically. I have more experience, I\u2019m positive on court, I\u2019ve learned many things. I\u2019m trying to be the best version of myself every time I step on to court. It doesn\u2019t matter who I play. It\u2019s the final of Wimbledon, I cannot ask for more.\u201d Halep has been known to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory at times during her career, including the 2017 French Open final, but there are no signs of that happening here. 0-15. 15-all. 15-30. 15-40, after another unforced error from Svitolina. Two match points. Svitolina nets her first serve but lands her second, Halep is in control of the point, sending Svitolina scampering around the grass, but Halep then nets! Perhaps there are some nerves, after all. Halep doesn\u2019t look as if she wants to get involved in a long rally on the second match point, sending back a probing return which Svitolina nets! Halep is into her first Wimbledon final, where she\u2019ll face either Serena Williams or Barbora Strycova! Second set: Svitolina* 1-6, 3-5 Halep (*denotes next server) Halep decides it\u2019s time to get serious. 15-40, two break points, and Svitolina swats out. Svitolina will be kicking herself after trying so hard to get back into this. Halep is now potentially two games away from her first Wimbledon final, make that one, when she holds to 15 with a rare ace. Second set: Svitolina* 1-6, 3-3 Halep (*denotes next server) However while Svitolina is managing to hold serve in this second set, she\u2019s making no inroads into Halep\u2019s games. The Romanian hasn\u2019t dropped a point on serve in this set and that record doesn\u2019t change here as she charges through again in double quick time. Second set: Svitolina 1-6, 3-2 Halep* (*denotes next server) The crowd, it has to be said, have been quite quiet so far. But they\u2019re gasping when Svitolina lives dangerously at deuce, with her overhead clipping the net before skidding over and bamboozling Halep. Halep hoiks wide at Svitolina\u2019s advantage. Cue a steely Svitolina fist pump, which suggests she thinks this is very much game on. Second set: Svitolina* 1-6, 2-2 Halep (*denotes next server) Svitolina is the daughter of a wrestler, and credit to her for the way she\u2019s scrapping here after the disappointment of losing that first set. A solid hold from Svitolina \u2013 but again Halep comes through her own serve to love. Four breaks in the first set have been followed by four consecutive holds in the second. Second set: Svitolina* 1-6, 1-1 Halep (*denotes next server) Svitolina starts the second set by doing something she didn\u2019t manage in the whole of the first: holding her serve. Given that Halep is a better version of herself, she\u2019s not going to win this match by simply staying in rallies from the back of the court, and some more aggressive hitting gets her the game. Halep\u2019s response? A hold to love. From 30-all, Halep is slightly fortunate with a net cord, but she makes the most of her luck and a couple of shots later biffs away a backhand winner. Svitolina really needs to mix up the play here; she\u2019s not winning enough of these longer rallies. So it\u2019s 40-30, set point. Halep doesn\u2019t take it but gets a second chance at her advantage. Svitolina squeezes a forehand deep to Halep\u2019s backhand wing and the Romanian nets. Deuce. Another net cord and another set point. This time Halep double faults. A fourth set point. Svitolina swats away a return winner off a tame serve! A break point is then followed by a fifth set point. Another seemingly endless game to add to one at 1-0. A sixth set point. And this time Halep decides enough is enough, as she takes it with a forehand winner down the line! A 6-1 set but the scoreline really doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. First set: Svitolina 1-5 Halep* (*denotes next server) Halep is hurtling towards the first set now. 0-15, 0-30, 0-40. Three points for the double break. And Halep takes it in some style, showing tremendous court coverage to charge to the short ball before clubbing it away for a forehand cross-court winner. First set: Svitolina* 1-4 Halep (*denotes next server) But then no sooner does Svitolina break than she is broken back, to 30. She\u2019s yet to hold to hold serve in her first grand slam semi-final and looks dejected. Halep then backs up the break, also to 30, before striding purposefully to her chair safe in the knowledge she\u2019s now looking in control of this first set. First set: Svitolina* 1-2 Halep (*denotes next server) However from the never-ending game to one that barely begins, as Halep is broken to love! Two loose forehands from Halep combined with Svitolina striking out with a winner give the Ukrainian three break points, and she\u2019s not in the mood to hang around after that arduous start. We\u2019re back on serve. First set: Svitolina 0-2 Halep* (*denotes next server) Svitolina is a big fan of Anthony Joshua, with her intense fitness regime inspired by the British heavyweight, but there\u2019s no sign of him in the Royal Box today. Instead she\u2019s got to make do with David Beckham, along with Jim Courier, Richard Branson, Chris Evans, Claire Foy, Cliff Richard and Maggie Smith, among others. Svitolina shows her own fighting qualities to fend off two break points at 30-40 and then Halep\u2019s advantage, but after a fifth deuce Halep gets another chance to break after the longest rally of the match is settled at the net. And Halep finally breaks when Svitolina sends an errant effort wide! Nearly 20 minutes in, there\u2019s only two games on the board. The Centre Court crowd are already shifting slightly uncomfortably in their seats. First set: Svitolina* 0-1 Halep (*denotes next server) Ladies and gentlemen, Halep will serve first. However she promptly drags a backhand wide before dumping another into the net. The camera pans to Svitolina\u2019s boyfriend, Gael Monfils, for the first of probably 173 times this afternoon. Halep steadies herself for 30-all, after a lengthy exchange in which both players hit cleanly without showing any willingness to pull the trigger. 40-30. Deuce. Already we\u2019ve seen several draining rallies. Advantage Svitolina, a first break point in the first game. Halep hits deep. Deuce. Advantage Svitolina. Deuce. Advantage Halep. Deuce. Advantage Svitolina. And Halep breathes a huge sigh of relief when her forehand catches the outside of the line! The way these two are going it\u2019ll be nightfall by time Serena Williams makes it on to court. But Halep then decides to get down to business. The former world No 1 takes the next two points to hold, but that was an almighty opening scrap. Expect an intense physical baseline battle between two of the best athletes in the game. Svitolina leads their head-to-head 4-2 but will want to forget their only other meeting at a grand slam. The Ukrainian lost to the Romanian in the 2017 French Open quarter-finals, holding a match point in the second set before being thumped 6-0 in the third. \u201cI think I\u2019m a little bit different player now,\u201d says Svitolina. \u201cI\u2019m playing free, I\u2019m playing decent tennis. It\u2019s the first time that we play in a semi-final, it\u2019s going to be interesting for both of us.\u201d Meanwhile Halep says her 2014 Wimbledon semi-final defeat to Eugenie Bouchard will not be on her mind. \u201cI\u2019m a different person,\u201d says last year\u2019s French Open champion. \u201cEverything changed. \u201cI have a lot of experience now. I\u2019m more confident. I love grass \u2013 it\u2019s first time that I have said that. I think it\u2019s a big challenge for me, the next match. But I will take it like I took every match since I\u2019m here. I\u2019m relaxed. I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m motivated to win.\u201d As the clock strikes one here they come, Elina Svitolina just ahead of Simona Halep. Disappointment for Britain\u2019s Anton Matusevich in the boys\u2019 singles. The 18-year-old defeated the top seed yesterday but has been soundly beaten by Japan\u2019s Shintaro Mochizuki, 6-3, 6-3, in the quarter-finals. And some reading to throw your way: They\u2019re gone! Murena/SerAndy was fun while it lasted. Let\u2019s hope they hook up again sometime. Here are the highlights of their defeat along with the rest of yesterday\u2019s action: It\u2019s on! Nadal is out practising ahead of tomorrow\u2019s semi-final with Federer, their first meeting here since that 2008 final. If you can\u2019t wait until tomorrow, hopefully this will keep you going: Centre Court 13:00: (8) Elina Svitolina (Ukr) v (7) Simona Halep (Rom), (11) Serena Williams (USA) v Barbora Zahlavova Strycova (Cze), (3) Raven Klaasen (Rsa) &amp; Michael Venus (Nzl) v (2) Juan Sebastian Cabal (Col) &amp; Robert Farah (Col) No 1 Court 13:00: (11) Nicolas Mahut (Fra) &amp; Edouard Roger-Vasselin (Fra) v Ivan Dodig (Cro) &amp; Filip Polasek (Svk), (1) Bruno Soares (Bra) &amp; Nicole Melichar (USA) v Matwe Middelkoop (Ned) &amp; Zhaoxuan Yang (Chn), Robert Lindstedt (Swe) &amp; Jelena Ostapenko (Lat) v (12) Franko Skugor (Cro) &amp; Raluca Olaru (Rom) No 2 Court 11:00: Jeremy Bates (Gbr) &amp; Andrew Castle (Gbr) v Wayne Ferreira (Rsa) &amp; Mark Woodforde (Aus), Anne Keothavong (Gbr) &amp; Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario (Spa) v Iva Majoli (Cro) &amp; Magdalena Maleeva (Bul), (5) Wesley Koolhof (Ned) &amp; Kveta Peschke (Cze) v Artem Sitak (Nzl) &amp; Laura Siegemund (Ger), Mansour Bahrami (Irn) &amp; Chris Wilkinson (Gbr) v Jonas Bjorkman (Swe) &amp; Todd Woodbridge (Aus) No 3 Court 11:00: Anton Matusevich (Gbr) v (8) Shintaro Mochizuki (Jpn), (1) Emma Navarro (USA) v (6) Natsumi Kawaguchi (Jpn), Nicolas Alvarez Varona (Spa) &amp; Juan Bautista Torres (Arg) v (2) Shintaro Mochizuki (Jpn) &amp; Holger Vitus Nodskov Rune (Den), (3) Natsumi Kawaguchi (Jpn) &amp; Adrienn Nagy (Hun) v Polina Kudermetova (Rus) &amp; Giulia Morlet (Fra) Court 5 11:00: Arthur Fery (Gbr) &amp; Toby Samuel (Gbr) v Taha Baadi (Can) &amp; Filip Cristian Jianu (Rom), Savannah Broadus (USA) &amp; Abigail Forbes (USA) v Weronika Baszak (Pol) &amp; Martyna Kubka (Pol), Eliot Spizzirri (USA) &amp; Tyler Zink (USA) v Jacob Fearnley (Gbr) &amp; Connor Thomson (Gbr), Holly Fischer (Gbr) &amp; Matilda Mutavdzic (Gbr) v (7) Chloe Beck (USA) &amp; Emma Navarro (USA) Court 6 11:00: Linda Fruhvirtova (Cze) &amp; Kristyna Lavickova (Cze) v (2) Alina Charaeva (Rus) &amp; Anastasia Tikhonova (Rus), Funa Kozaki (Jpn) &amp; Amarissa Kiara Toth (Hun) v Carlota Martinez Cirez (Spa) &amp; Ane Mintegi Del Olmo (Spa), Flavio Cobolli (Ita) &amp; Dominic Stephan Stricker (Swi) v Brandon Nakashima (USA) &amp; Valentin Royer (Fra), Cannon Kingsley (USA) &amp; Alexander Zgirovsky (Bel) v (6) Shunsuke Mitsui (Jpn) &amp; Keisuke Saitoh (Jpn) Court 8 11:00: Polina Kudermetova (Rus) v Daria Snigur (Ukr), Dalibor Svrcina (Cze) v Carlos Gimeno Valero (Spa), (1) Jonas Forejtek (Cze) &amp; Jiri Lehecka (Cze) v Tristan Schoolkate (Aus) &amp; Dane Sweeny (Aus), (8) Hurricane Tyra Black (USA) &amp; Shavit Kimchi (Isr) v Aubane Droguet (Fra) &amp; Selena Janicijevic (Fra) Court 12 11:00: (4) Martin Damm (USA) v (10) Carlos Alcaraz Garfia (Spa), (10) Alexa Noel (USA) v Priska Madelyn Nugroho (Ina), (3) Martin Damm (USA) &amp; Toby Kodat (USA) v Andrew Paulson (Cze) &amp; Eric Vanshelboim (Ukr), Kamilla Bartone (Lat) &amp; Oksana Selekhmeteva (Rus) v Robin Montgomery (USA) &amp; Maria Camila Osorio Serrano (Col) Court 18 11:00: (17) Harold Mayot (Fra) v Illya Beloborodko (Ukr), Elsa Jacquemot (Fra) v (4) Diane Parry (Fra), (7) Liam Draxl (Can) &amp; Govind Nanda (USA) v Baptiste Anselmo (Fra) &amp; Loris Pourroy (Fra), Valentina Ryser (Swi) &amp; Alexandra Vecic (Ger) v (4) Joanna Garland (Tpe) &amp; Sohyun Park (Kor) Good afternoon and welcome to our coverage of the women\u2019s semi-finals. While week one was about the coming of Coco, as the newest face in tennis announced herself to Wimbledon and the world in some style, week two has gained a rather more familiar feel, as the four most recognisable and rewarded names in the game seek to further enhance their greatness. Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal\u2019s procession to the semi-finals has seemed almost inevitable, such has been their domination amid the early decimation of the likes of Stefanos Tsitsipas, Alex Zverev and Dominic Thiem, but Serena Williams\u2019s progress to this stage has been anything but certain. Playing much of this season with an injured knee and much of the past 12 months with the look of a woman who has the weight of history on her mind as she remains one win away from Margaret Court\u2019s all-time record of 24 grand slam singles titles, Williams arrived here seriously short of match practice and without a major victory since the 2017 Australian Open when she was two months pregnant. The 37-year-old even admitted this week she sought therapy and apologised to Naomi Osaka for her behaviour after last year\u2019s infamous US Open final. However Serena has seemed, well, more serene this fortnight, apparently playing pain-free again and surely boosted by the fun she\u2019s had as one half of Murena/SerAndy/why didn\u2019t someone come up with something less daft? and, while their courtship came to an end with defeat in the mixed doubles yesterday, Williams still has a date with destiny in the singles. This afternoon the seven-times champion meets the unseeded Barbora Strycova, a lesson in perseverance if ever there was one. The crafty Czech is appearing in the last four at a major for the first time in 53 attempts and, at 33, is the oldest grand slam semi-final debutant in the Open era. Strycova will be confident after accounting for Johanna Konta in the quarter-finals but of course Williams \u2013 if she is fully firing \u2013 is an entirely different proposition. While Williams has been inconsistent during matches, the way she stepped it up in the last few games of her quarter-final suggests her champion spirit is returning. Williams and Strycova play second, after another match between a former grand slam winner and first-time semi-finalist, as the 2018 French Open champion and former world No 1 Simona Halep plays the Ukrainian eighth seed, Elina Svitolina. Halep reached this stage five years ago but says this is the first year she has learned to love the grass, while Svitolina feels at home here, given she used to live in London and has a British coach. Let\u2019s say that makes Svitolina an honorary Brit, especially in Konta\u2019s absence. But then come to think of it Williams is too after her partnership with Murray. So there could be an all-British women\u2019s final of sorts on Saturday, which hasn\u2019t happened since 1961. Meanwhile the way the triumvirate of Djokovic, Federer and Nadal is going it\u2019ll probably be at least another 58 years before they let anyone else win a slam. Play begins at: 1pm BST. Bring your sun cream because it\u2019s going to be hot, hot, hot.",

      "body": "<p>While being far more than a one-hit wonder, Martin Charnin, who has died aged 84, is indelibly associated with one particular show, the high-spirited musical Annie (1977), which he conceived and directed and for which he also wrote the lyrics.</p> <p>Charnin did so only after securing the reluctant participation of the composer <a href=\"http://www.charlesstrouse.com/\" title=\"\">Charles Strouse</a> and the librettist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/theater/thomas-meehan-dead-tony-winner-hairspray.html\" title=\"\">Thomas Meehan</a>, the latter of whom asked why he should write a musical he would not want to go and see. But as the project grew and backers such as the great director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/nov/20/mike-nichols\" title=\"\">Mike Nichols</a> came on board, so the momentum proved unstoppable. </p> <p>Strouse\u2019s score to Charnin\u2019s lyrics was robustly melodic, with half a dozen knockout numbers, including Hooverville, Hard Knock Life, Easy Street and Annie\u2019s signature song, Tomorrow, which was soon established as a much-recorded standard of optimism and open-hearted get-up-and-go.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6313604187a2a45c7bc056bea4278b50808218f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6313604187a2a45c7bc056bea4278b50808218f4/0_0_2843_4086/696.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea McArdle as Annie and Reid Shelton as Daddy Warbucks in the original Broadway production of Annie, 1977.\" width=\"696\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrea McArdle as Annie and Reid Shelton as Daddy Warbucks in the original Broadway production of Annie, 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The show, which was based on a long-running American comic strip and was about the tribulations of an 11-year-old orphan in the US of the Depression, won seven Tony awards and initially ran for six years on Broadway and for three in the West End.</p> <p>It is constantly revived and there have been three film versions, the first made in 1982 by John Huston, the second by Disney in 1999 and the third, a curious hip-hop reconception, in 2014. Charnin stayed close to the show all his life, directing the 1998 London revival starring Lesley Joseph and <a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/2018/obituary-kevin-colson-tony-award-nomination-for-aspects-of-love/\" title=\"\">Kevin Colson</a>, two Broadway revivals and two unsuccessful off-Broadway sequels, as well as 42 US touring productions. </p> <p>He was born in New York, the son of William Charnin, who sang in the chorus of the Metropolitan Opera, and his wife, Birdie (nee Blakeman). He studied at the city\u2019s High School of Music and Art, and later at the Cooper Union, spending a holiday at a summer theatre in the Adirondack mountains acting, writing revue sketches and painting scenery.</p> <p>There he also discovered that he could sing and so he responded to an audition call for \u201cjuvenile delinquents\u201d in the 1957 Broadway premiere of West Side Story. He won the part of Big Deal, one of the Jets ranged in gang warfare against the Sharks, staying in the show from the opening night through more than 1,000 performances. </p> <p>Charnin\u2019s experience of working at close quarters with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/17/leonard-bernstein-memories\" title=\"\">Leonard Bernstein</a>, Stephen Sondheim and Jerome Robbins developed his enthusiasm for being a powerful presence behind the scenes. He was soon a complete man of the theatre, directing off-Broadway revues and nightclub shows for Shirley Jones, Leslie Uggams, Dionne Warwick and Nancy Wilson.</p> <p>In 1959 he appeared in The Girls Against the Boys, starring Bert Lahr and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/27/obituaries/nancy-walker-69-of-rhoda-and-tv-commercials-is-dead.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=28370423FE84D2A26C81BA96FA1D62A7&amp;gwt=pay\" title=\"\">Nancy Walker,</a> and he was a waiter in a sketch with Dick Van Dyke.</p> <p>He wrote lyrics for an ill-received Judy Holliday vehicle, Hot Spot, in 1963, and for a version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/nov/01/federico-fellini-dies-film-italy\" title=\"\">Federico Fellini\u2019</a>s movie La Strada (1969) which closed on its opening night.

      "bodyText": "While being far more than a one-hit wonder, Martin Charnin, who has died aged 84, is indelibly associated with one particular show, the high-spirited musical Annie (1977), which he conceived and directed and for which he also wrote the lyrics. Charnin did so only after securing the reluctant participation of the composer Charles Strouse and the librettist Thomas Meehan, the latter of whom asked why he should write a musical he would not want to go and see. But as the project grew and backers such as the great director Mike Nichols came on board, so the momentum proved unstoppable. Strouse\u2019s score to Charnin\u2019s lyrics was robustly melodic, with half a dozen knockout numbers, including Hooverville, Hard Knock Life, Easy Street and Annie\u2019s signature song, Tomorrow, which was soon established as a much-recorded standard of optimism and open-hearted get-up-and-go. The show, which was based on a long-running American comic strip and was about the tribulations of an 11-year-old orphan in the US of the Depression, won seven Tony awards and initially ran for six years on Broadway and for three in the West End. It is constantly revived and there have been three film versions, the first made in 1982 by John Huston, the second by Disney in 1999 and the third, a curious hip-hop reconception, in 2014. Charnin stayed close to the show all his life, directing the 1998 London revival starring Lesley Joseph and Kevin Colson, two Broadway revivals and two unsuccessful off-Broadway sequels, as well as 42 US touring productions. He was born in New York, the son of William Charnin, who sang in the chorus of the Metropolitan Opera, and his wife, Birdie (nee Blakeman). He studied at the city\u2019s High School of Music and Art, and later at the Cooper Union, spending a holiday at a summer theatre in the Adirondack mountains acting, writing revue sketches and painting scenery. There he also discovered that he could sing and so he responded to an audition call for \u201cjuvenile delinquents\u201d in the 1957 Broadway premiere of West Side Story. He won the part of Big Deal, one of the Jets ranged in gang warfare against the Sharks, staying in the show from the opening night through more than 1,000 performances. Charnin\u2019s experience of working at close quarters with Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim and Jerome Robbins developed his enthusiasm for being a powerful presence behind the scenes. He was soon a complete man of the theatre, directing off-Broadway revues and nightclub shows for Shirley Jones, Leslie Uggams, Dionne Warwick and Nancy Wilson. In 1959 he appeared in The Girls Against the Boys, starring Bert Lahr and Nancy Walker, and he was a waiter in a sketch with Dick Van Dyke. He wrote lyrics for an ill-received Judy Holliday vehicle, Hot Spot, in 1963, and for a version of Federico Fellini\u2019s movie La Strada (1969) which closed on its opening night. But there was more kudos, and more success, when he collaborated with the composer Richard Rodgers on Two by Two (1970), a Noah\u2019s ark musical based on a Clifford Odets play and starring Danny Kaye on his return to Broadway after 30 years away; it ran to 350 performances. After Annie he followed up with an adept and charming production of Bar Mitzvah Boy \u2013 based on Jack Rosenthal\u2019s 1976 television play, with lyrics by Don Black and music by Jule Styne \u2013 in which young Eliot Green flees the synagogue on the brink of his barmitzvah. The show played 78 performances at Her Majesty\u2019s. A second show with Rodgers, I Remember Mama (1979), one of Rodgers\u2019 weakest, was a flop, despite starring Liv Ullmann, and a polite veil also had to be drawn over The First (1981), about Jackie Robinson, the man who broke the colour barrier in major league baseball, on which he doubled again as lyricist and director. In addition, a 1989 comedy revue starring Sid Caesar had to close after five performances. One of my favourite revues, however, was his Upstairs at O\u2019Neal\u2019s (1982), above a restaurant on 43rd Street in New York, which collated many songs by former collaborators, as well as by Marvin Hamlisch and Sheldon Harnick. One of its many literate and punchy numbers was a spoof on the fad for short names, invoking Uma, Uta, Ulu, Ava and Oona in a single couplet.

Some of that material surfaced in a less effective version, The 9 \u00bd Quid Revue (1999), at the King\u2019s Head in Islington, while he was in London reviving Annie. Charnin\u2019s first three marriages \u2013 to the actors Lynn Ross and Genii Prior, both of whom appeared in West Side Story, and the fashion journalist Jade Hobson \u2013 ended in divorce. He is survived by his fourth wife, the actor Shelly Burch, and by a son, Randy, from his first marriage, a daughter, Sasha, from his second marriage, three stepchildren, three grandchildren and his sister, Rena Mueller. \u2022 Martin Jay Charnin, theatre director and lyricist, born 24 November 1934; died 6 July 2019",

Preliminary data had already given interesting results \u2013 while the reverberation time for high- and mid-frequency sounds appeared similar to results obtained from Maryhill, low-frequency sounds showed shorter reverberation times. \u201cIf you were to talk in a cinema, that is probably roughly the acoustic we are getting,\u201d said Cox.</p> <p>He added that as well as being visually striking the auditory environment of Stonehenge would have been unusual to prehistoric people of the time less familiar with reverberant spaces unless, for instance, experiencing such effects in a cave. \u201cThere would have been a sonic wonder in the past,\u201d he said.</p> <p>While the purpose of Stonehenge has fuelled much debate, Cox says he thinks the acoustics were a byproduct of the structure which were then exploited. \u201cIf you were going to hold a ceremony, and you had a lot of people to talk to, doing it outside the stones would be a lot harder than if you did it inside the stones [circle],\u201d he said.</p> <p>At about 40cm high, the model megaliths are almost exactly the same size as the Lilliputian props featured in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAXzzHM8zLw\">the famous Stonehenge scene </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAXzzHM8zLw\">in the film This Is Spinal Tap</a>.

While construction of the model could not compare with the building of the real Stonehenge, it was nonetheless a bit laborious, said the team. \u201cYou 3D print them and then you make silicon moulds out of them, and then you cast them in a plaster-polymer mix, and then you paint them in car paint,\u201d Cox said. \u201cI ruined my dining room floor.\u201d The team conducted tests with the model set inside an acoustic chamber, looking, for example, at speech intelligibility and air resonance. Preliminary data had already given interesting results \u2013 while the reverberation time for high- and mid-frequency sounds appeared similar to results obtained from Maryhill, low-frequency sounds showed shorter reverberation times. \u201cIf you were to talk in a cinema, that is probably roughly the acoustic we are getting,\u201d said Cox. He added that as well as being visually striking the auditory environment of Stonehenge would have been unusual to prehistoric people of the time less familiar with reverberant spaces unless, for instance, experiencing such effects in a cave. \u201cThere would have been a sonic wonder in the past,\u201d he said. While the purpose of Stonehenge has fuelled much debate, Cox says he thinks the acoustics were a byproduct of the structure which were then exploited. \u201cIf you were going to hold a ceremony, and you had a lot of people to talk to, doing it outside the stones would be a lot harder than if you did it inside the stones [circle],\u201d he said. At about 40cm high, the model megaliths are almost exactly the same size as the Lilliputian props featured in the famous Stonehenge scene in the film This Is Spinal Tap. They are also at similar risk of being crushed underfoot. \u201cYou have to be careful when you stand over this thing you don\u2019t kick the lintels off, which I have done once already,\u201d said Cox. Cox said plans for where the team\u2019s mini megaliths will end up remain unclear. \u201cIt would be nice to find a permanent home for it, maybe in a museum somewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThe boring answer is in the short term it will go back in boxes to be stored very carefully.\u201d",

He praised Darroch for the \u201cprofessionalism\u201d of his response to this affair. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The response of [Boris Johnson] was an appalling abandonment of someone in the firing line. Real leaders protect their people. They don\u2019t throw them to the wolves because they can sniff a prize for themselves. His actions were a chilling warning of what is to come if he becomes prime minister. How can the civil service be expected to do their jobs properly now? How can they operate if they fear leaks followed by abandonment by our political leaders?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Then he went on to make a wider point.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Those who welcome Kim Darroch\u2019s departure believe that we need a civil service of true believers. They are profoundly wrong. We do not need a civil service of true believers. We need a civil service able to do its job without fear or favour, and that has become much harder this week.</p> \n   <p>Does the minister share this concern that this attack on the civil service is part of the broader attack on institutions essential to the functioning of our democracy? Judges called enemies of the people. MPs called traitors to their country. Broadcasters vilified as having hidden agendas. Our democracy is under fire and those who value and cherish it must speak up and defend it.

The Tory MP <strong>Roger Gale</strong> has just said that Boris Johnson\u2019s failure to defend Darroch in the ITV Tory leadership debate on Tuesday was \u201clamentable\u201d. In response, Duncan said he did not want to say any more about Johnson today, because he made his position clear yesterday.</p> \n  <p>This caused some amusement, because yesterday Duncan did not exactly hold back. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/10/tory-leadership-latest-news-john-major-threatens-to-take-boris-johnson-to-court-to-stop-him-proroguing-parliament-for-no-deal-brexit-live-news?page=with:block-5d25d7618f08cf92bb76d08b#block-5d25d7618f08cf92bb76d08b\">He said that Johnson had thrown Darroch under the bus and that Johnson was guilty of \u201ccontemptible negligence\u201d.</a></p> \n  <p>Speaking for Labour, <strong>Liz McInnes,</strong> the shadow Foreign Office minister also launched a strong attack on Johnson.

He had the chance on Tuesday night, not just once, but six times, to defend Sir Kim and oppose Donald Trump. But he took an active choice instead to throw our man in Washington under the bus. It was the most craven and despicable act of cowardice I have seen from any candidate for public office, let alone from someone running to be prime minister. It sends the worst possible signal to our diplomatic service abroad and it should sent warning signs to the whole country that if we thought the current prime minister was bad when it came to her spineless attitude towards Donald Trump, then things are about to get a whole lot worse.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>McInnes also asked for an assurance that Theresa May would appoint a new ambassador to Washington before her successor takes office. Duncan said Darroch\u2019s replacement wold be appointed in the normal way, but he refused to say when that would be.</p> \n  <p>The urgent question was tabled by Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden who gave a very good mini-speech about how respect for institutions is being undermined.

The constant \u201cdrip, drip\u201d, as more than one contributor put it, eats away at the employee\u2019s self-confidence until they become anxious, exhausted and ill, incapable of performing their job and (often following a period of sickleave) resign or are dismissed. Well over half of the people who contributed to this inquiry described suffering significant mental and/or physical illness as a result of this type of bullying behaviour. Sexual harassment is also a problem, with staff being subject to unwanted sexual advances, often accompanied by touching, sometimes forceful. There is an unacceptable level of sexual \u201cbanter\u201d and unwelcome discussion of intimate sexual details. The majority of contributors described being bullied and harassed by their MP employer. A much smaller number described behaviour of fellow staff members but in some of those cases spoke also of their MP employer failing appropriately to address complaints. Some of the worst offenders are well known as such within the Parliamentary community but, other than the odd \u201cquiet word\u201d from a fellow MP or the relevant Whips office, action has rarely been taken to address their behaviour. In the words of one contributor, there has been a \u201cgeneral disregard for the dignity, wellbeing and employment rights of MPs\u2019 staff\u201d.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d26fe158f0845f89e30aeac\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-11T09:24:09.926Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Some staff working for MPs subject to 'unacceptable risk of bullying and harrassment', says report</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/Conduct%20in%20Parliament/GWQC%20Inquiry%20Report%2011%20July%202019_.pdf\">the Gemma White report (pdf)</a> into the bullying of staff working for MPs in the Commons.</p> \n  <p>And here are the conclusions.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Some staff of members of parliament are subject to an unacceptable risk of bullying and harassment, including sexual harassment, at work. Most members of parliament treat their staff with dignity and respect but the problem of bullying and harassment is sufficiently widespread to require an urgent collective response.</p> \n   <p>Recent steps taken by the House of Commons to address bullying and harassment across the parliamentary community do not engage sufficiently with the particular issues faced by members\u2019 staff, who are in a uniquely vulnerable position because they are directly employed by members of parliament. Many describe the idea of complaining about bullying and harassment under the new complaints procedure as \u201ccareer suicide\u201d. They also often have strong party and personal loyalties which constitute significant barriers to complaint. </p> \n   <p>To date, the group of MPs\u2019 staff who would be most likely to bring a complaint under the new Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme, namely former staff of MPs, have been denied the right to do so. This limitation must be removed so that they have the opportunity to hold MPs to account. They must also be permitted to complain about events which took place before June 2017 (the current cut-off date) as recommended by Dame Laura Cox. </p> \n   <p>Since few staff will complain in any event, other methods of tackling workplace bullying and harassment must be employed. Voluntary training is not the answer: only 34 out of 650 MPs and 135 out of 3200 MPs\u2019 staff have attended or booked onto the Valuing Everyone training designed to support the new behaviour code introduced in July 2018.</p> \n   <p>There must be a fundamental shift away from regarding members of parliament as \u201c650 small businesses\u201d with near complete freedom to operate in relation to their staff. Members of parliament must be required to adopt and follow employment practices and procedures which are aligned with those followed in other public sector workplaces.</p> \n   <p>This shift must be supported by a properly resourced and staffed department within the House of Commons. It should develop and implement a coherent and robust approach to members\u2019 employment practice and provide support to members and their staff. Any necessary enforcement mechanisms (such as imposing conditions related to good employment practice on MPs\u2019 entitlement to staffing expenditure) should be considered by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority in conjunction with the new department. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d26fbab8f0845f89e30ae8c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-11T09:05:51.191Z\">10.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For the record, here is <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/labour-party-response-panorama-programme/\">Labour\u2019s official response to the Panorama programme,</a> released last night after it was broadcast.

The first is anti-Israelism. Corbyn and his circle are undoubtedly anti-Israel, and a lot of this debate is really about at what point hostility towards the state of Israel becomes antisemitism. (At some point it certainly feels like antisemitism to Jews.) You could call this anti-Zionism, but that is not a particularly helpful term because Zionism means different things to different people. And the second is anti-Corbynism. There is an undoubted overlap between those in Labour who speak out most against the party\u2019s record on antisemitism and those who are critical of Corbyn generally, but that does not mean their complaints are contrived or insincere. For some, the antisemitism issue helps to explain their anti-Corbynism.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points from Tom Watson\u2019s interview.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Watson strongly criticised his own party for dismissing the former staffers who spoke out in the Panorama programme as \u201cdisaffected\u201d ex-employees with \u201caxes to grind\u201d. </strong>Watson said that claim was \u201cfalse\u201d. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I deplore the statement that was made about those people last night. You couldn\u2019t fail to be saddened and moved by the testimony, particularly of the young members who\u2019d had racist abuse in party meetings and on social media. And there was an array of young and old former members of staff from different wings of the party who I think showed great courage to speak out in the way they did ... To speak out about the party they love must have taken a great act of courage and to dismiss their testimony as in some way flawed I think was wrong.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In a statement issued late yesterday afternoon the Labour press office, which like the rest of the party machinery is under the control of the Corbyn faction in the party, not people like Watson, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It appears these disaffected former officials include those who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, worked to actively undermine it, and have both personal and political axes to grind. This throws into doubt their credibility as sources.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Interestingly, the long statement issued by the party press office after the Panorama was broadcast did not repeat this criticism of the interviewees.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Watson complained there was a perception of \u201calmost a permissive culture\u201d towards antisemitism in the party.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In the last four years, since Jeremy and I were elected leader and deputy leader of the party, there is a growing belief that there is a sickness in our party, that this kind of abuse has been in some way allowed. That there\u2019s almost a permissive culture that people can use anti-Jewish, racist language both in our meetings and to each other on social media and we\u2019ve failed to address that properly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Watson called for a rule change to \u201cauto-exclude\u201d party members against whom there was a prima facie case to answer about using antisemitic language or behaviour. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think we need to change the way we investigate these systems.</p> \n   <p>Not casting aspersions on the current people, but I think we need to take these cases away from them and have a full, independent system of investigating cases of anti-Jewish racism that involves representatives from the Jewish community of Britain of standing... </p> \n   <p>I think we need a rule change - and this has been argued by others like Keir Starmer<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jul/10/labour-needs-exclusion-rule-antisemitism-keir-starmer-denial\"> [here]</a> and Gordon Brown - that allows us to auto-exclude from the membership people who have a prima facie case to answer of using antisemitic behaviours and language within our own structures.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>9.30am:</em> Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> \n  <p><em>10am: </em>A new report on sexual intimidation and bullying of staff working in the House of Commons is published.</p> \n  <p><em>11am: </em>Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, holds a press conference following the publication of the bank\u2019s financial stability report.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been heavily criticised by fellow Tory MPs over his role in Sir Kim Darroch\u2019s decision to resign as the UK ambassador to Washington, with one backbencher saying the frontrunner in the Conservative leadershipcontest should come to the Commons to apologise. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has stepped up his criticism of Jeremy Corbyn over antisemitism in the party by backing calls for automatic exclusion of members accused of anti-Jewish racism. More than 30 whistleblowers including current Labour members of staff will submit evidence to the equalities watchdog about antisemitism in the party, the Guardian understands. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary and one of the leading cabinet opponents of hard Brexit, has publicly ditched her opposition to no deal as senior Tories jostle for position in a Boris Johnson cabinet. The Bank of England has sounded the alarm over the risks to City banks from no-deal Brexit, warning that companies across Europe could be cut off from their lenders overnight. A coroner has concluded that no official support was put in place for a prominent Welsh politician who took his own life four days after being sacked amid allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour towards women. Parliament must adopt a raft of new employment measures to ensure that MPs\u2019 staff are no longer subject to an unacceptable risk of bullying and harassment at work, an official inquiry has concluded. Police leaders have written to the two Conservative leadership candidates to say whichever of them becomes prime minister should make providing more money to police and youth services their first priority. Amber Rudd has announced a review of the benefits system for terminally ill claimants, in a challenge to the next prime minister to listen to demands for reform. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is a Guardian panel on the BBC Panorama programme, with contributions from Jonathan Freedland, Rachel Shabi, Jon Lansman and Keith Kahn-Harris. From Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary Maybe Jeremy Hunt has seen the ConservativeHome survey (see 2.48pm) and remembered he needs to post his ballot paper ... More than 30 whistleblowers including current Labour members of staff will submit evidence to the equalities watchdog about antisemitism in the party, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary and one of the leading cabinet opponents of hard Brexit, has publicly ditched her opposition to no deal, my colleague Rowena Mason reports. In an interview with ConservativeHome last month Boris Johnson said that anyone who wanted to serve in his cabinet would have to agree to support the UK leaving the EU with no deal on 31 October if necessary. The ConservativeHome website has published another of its regular surveys of Tory members, and it has concluded that Boris Johnson has already won the Tory leadership contest. We won\u2019t know for sure for another 12 days, but in the past these surveys have been a fairly reliable guide to how people vote in internal Tory elections. ConservativeHome is making the claim that Boris Johnson \u201chas won this contest already\u201d on the basis that 71% of respondents say they have already voted. Given that the survey also suggests that Johnson is beating Jeremy Hunt by 72% to 28%, that would mean, assuming those figures were correct, that if every new vote being cast from today were to go to Hunt, he still would not be able to catch up. A YouGov poll of Conservative members last week also gave Johnson an enormous lead over Hunt, only its was slightly bigger. In the Commons earlier Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, said Labour would support moves by John Major to take Boris Johnson to court if Johnson were to become PM and to prorogue parliament to try to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. During the business statement she quoted approvingly the Tory MP Dominic Grieve saying proroguing parliament in this way would be \u201cthe end of parliamentary democracy\u201d. Mel Stride, the leader of the Commons, played down the prospect of this happening. He replied: The government doesn\u2019t believe that [proroguing parliament] would be a desirable situation, not least it would put the monarch in an awkward position being involved in what is essentially a political decision given that it is prorogation based upon the advice of the pime minister but ultimately for the Queen to grant that. I would also say, as I think Mr Speaker you have suggested, that it seems inconceivable that parliament will not have its opportunity to ensure that it has appropriate time to debate at the appropriate time these very, very important matters for our country. These are from Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and Tory leadership contender. In an interview for today\u2019s Sun Boris Johnson rejected suggestions that he contributed to Sir Kim Darroch\u2019s decision to resign by not backing him in the ITV debate on Tuesday. Johnson told the paper: I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re trying to blame me for this. It seems bizarre to me. I\u2019m a great supporter of Kim\u2019s. I worked very well with him for years. I spoke to him just now to offer my good wishes. I think that he\u2019s done a superb job. I\u2019d be very surprised that\u2019s the construction placed on events. In an interview for Politico Europe\u2019s London Playbook Johnson also rejected claims that he undermined Darroch in the debate on Tuesday night. Commenting on his refusal to say that he would definitely keep Darroch in office if he became prime minister, Johnson said it would be \u201ctotally, totally wrong to drag the career prospects of a civil servant into a political debate\u201d. But he also cracked a joke about Darroch\u2019s plight. Here is the key paragraph from Jack Blanchard\u2019s interview. Why did he not voice more support for Kim Darroch in Tuesday night\u2019s TV debate? \u201cNo, I did,\u201d Johnson protests. \u201cI said I believe very strongly that civil servants should not have their views leaked.\u201d But you didn\u2019t say you\u2019d keep him in his job, I tell him. \u201cNo, but I think it\u2019s totally, totally wrong to drag the career prospects of a civil servant into a political debate,\u201d Johnson says. But maybe people want to see a leader sticking up for their own side? \u201cI made it very clear that under no circumstances would anybody else take a decision about who is going to represent the U.K. I was absolutely categorical about that. And for the record I am a long-standing admirer of Kim Darroch. And I say furthermore that if Donald Trump can make friends with Kim Jong Un, then he can make friends with Kim Dar-roch.\u201d Although there were various factors behind Darroch\u2019s decision to resign, as the Guardian reports the ambassador took the final decision after watching Johnson on Tuesday night repeatedly refusing to say he wanted him to stay. Towards the end of the urgent question on Kim Darroch the Conservative MP David Morris said Boris Johnson should apologise for not supporting Darroch in the ITV debate on Tuesday. He said: It is incumbent on every member of parliament in this place to back up our excellent diplomats and civil servants and [Johnson] should come to the house and apologise. Here are extracts from the mini speech that the Labour MP Pat McFadden gave as he asked his urgent question about the resignation of Sir Kim Darroch. The resignation of Sir Kim Darroch marks a dark moment for our democracy and for the standing of the United Kingdom. McFadden said Darroch was hugely respected, and was just doing his job. He praised Darroch for the \u201cprofessionalism\u201d of his response to this affair. He went on: The response of [Boris Johnson] was an appalling abandonment of someone in the firing line. Real leaders protect their people. They don\u2019t throw them to the wolves because they can sniff a prize for themselves. His actions were a chilling warning of what is to come if he becomes prime minister. How can the civil service be expected to do their jobs properly now? How can they operate if they fear leaks followed by abandonment by our political leaders? Then he went on to make a wider point. Those who welcome Kim Darroch\u2019s departure believe that we need a civil service of true believers. They are profoundly wrong. We do not need a civil service of true believers. We need a civil service able to do its job without fear or favour, and that has become much harder this week. Does the minister share this concern that this attack on the civil service is part of the broader attack on institutions essential to the functioning of our democracy? Judges called enemies of the people. MPs called traitors to their country. Broadcasters vilified as having hidden agendas. Our democracy is under fire and those who value and cherish it must speak up and defend it. Whipping up anger against one institution after another, and dressing it up as an attack on the establishment, is doing profound harm to the country and we must call it out for the insidious agenda that it is. Responding, Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister, praised McFadden for his wisdom and said his words should be \u201cpinned on every wall\u201d as an instruction to people how to act. And here are some tweets from notable Labour figures and organisations critical of the Panorama programme about antisemitism in the party. From Barry Sheerman MP From Claudia Webbe, a member of Labour\u2019s national executive committee From my colleague Owen Jones From Steve Howell, a former deputy communications chief for Jeremy Corbyn From Jewish Voice for Labour, a relatively small pro-Corbyn group, not to be confused with the Jewish Labour Movement, which issued a statement last night saying the programme showed the party was \u201cinstitutionally racist against Jews\u201d. In the Commons Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister, is responding to an urgent question about the resignation of Sir Kim Darroch. The Tory MP Roger Gale has just said that Boris Johnson\u2019s failure to defend Darroch in the ITV Tory leadership debate on Tuesday was \u201clamentable\u201d. In response, Duncan said he did not want to say any more about Johnson today, because he made his position clear yesterday. This caused some amusement, because yesterday Duncan did not exactly hold back. He said that Johnson had thrown Darroch under the bus and that Johnson was guilty of \u201ccontemptible negligence\u201d. Speaking for Labour, Liz McInnes, the shadow Foreign Office minister also launched a strong attack on Johnson. She identified many people she said were at fault, but she went on: But the biggest villain of all is the man about to become our next prime minister. He had the chance on Tuesday night, not just once, but six times, to defend Sir Kim and oppose Donald Trump. But he took an active choice instead to throw our man in Washington under the bus. It was the most craven and despicable act of cowardice I have seen from any candidate for public office, let alone from someone running to be prime minister. It sends the worst possible signal to our diplomatic service abroad and it should sent warning signs to the whole country that if we thought the current prime minister was bad when it came to her spineless attitude towards Donald Trump, then things are about to get a whole lot worse. McInnes also asked for an assurance that Theresa May would appoint a new ambassador to Washington before her successor takes office. Duncan said Darroch\u2019s replacement wold be appointed in the normal way, but he refused to say when that would be. The urgent question was tabled by Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden who gave a very good mini-speech about how respect for institutions is being undermined. I will post the quotes soon. Here is some reaction to the Panorama documentary from Labour MPs and other senior figures in the party. These are all tweets from people alarmed by the programmes revelations. Separately I will post a round-up of tweets critical of the programme, although I have seen far fewer of those from MPs and senior people in the party. From Jess Phillips MP From Tulip Siddiq MP From Lisa Nandy MP From Mary Creagh MP From Rachel Reeves MP From Stephen Kinnock MP From Yvette Cooper MP From Margaret Hodge MP From Emma Lewell-Buck MP From Stella Creasy MP From Thangam Debbonaire MP From Ben Bradshaw MP From Darren Jones MP From Wes Streeting MP From Pat McFadden MP From Ruth Smeeth MP From Ian Murray MP From John Mann MP From Glenys Thornton, a Labour peer From Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former communications chief (who was recently expelled from Labour for voting Lib Dem in the European elections) From Jude Kirton-Darling MEP From Andrew Adonis, a Labour peer From Johanna Baxter, a former member of Labour\u2019s national executive committee From Ayesha Hazarika, a former adviser to Ed Miliband and Harriet Harman And here is an extract from the Gemma White report. By far the most common form of offending behaviour described to me was of MPs who shout at, demean, belittle and humiliate their staff on a regular basis, often in public. The constant \u201cdrip, drip\u201d, as more than one contributor put it, eats away at the employee\u2019s self-confidence until they become anxious, exhausted and ill, incapable of performing their job and (often following a period of sickleave) resign or are dismissed. Well over half of the people who contributed to this inquiry described suffering significant mental and/or physical illness as a result of this type of bullying behaviour. Sexual harassment is also a problem, with staff being subject to unwanted sexual advances, often accompanied by touching, sometimes forceful. There is an unacceptable level of sexual \u201cbanter\u201d and unwelcome discussion of intimate sexual details. The majority of contributors described being bullied and harassed by their MP employer. A much smaller number described behaviour of fellow staff members but in some of those cases spoke also of their MP employer failing appropriately to address complaints. Some of the worst offenders are well known as such within the Parliamentary community but, other than the odd \u201cquiet word\u201d from a fellow MP or the relevant Whips office, action has rarely been taken to address their behaviour. In the words of one contributor, there has been a \u201cgeneral disregard for the dignity, wellbeing and employment rights of MPs\u2019 staff\u201d. Here is the Gemma White report (pdf) into the bullying of staff working for MPs in the Commons. And here are the conclusions. Some staff of members of parliament are subject to an unacceptable risk of bullying and harassment, including sexual harassment, at work. Most members of parliament treat their staff with dignity and respect but the problem of bullying and harassment is sufficiently widespread to require an urgent collective response. Recent steps taken by the House of Commons to address bullying and harassment across the parliamentary community do not engage sufficiently with the particular issues faced by members\u2019 staff, who are in a uniquely vulnerable position because they are directly employed by members of parliament. Many describe the idea of complaining about bullying and harassment under the new complaints procedure as \u201ccareer suicide\u201d. They also often have strong party and personal loyalties which constitute significant barriers to complaint. To date, the group of MPs\u2019 staff who would be most likely to bring a complaint under the new Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme, namely former staff of MPs, have been denied the right to do so. This limitation must be removed so that they have the opportunity to hold MPs to account. They must also be permitted to complain about events which took place before June 2017 (the current cut-off date) as recommended by Dame Laura Cox. Since few staff will complain in any event, other methods of tackling workplace bullying and harassment must be employed. Voluntary training is not the answer: only 34 out of 650 MPs and 135 out of 3200 MPs\u2019 staff have attended or booked onto the Valuing Everyone training designed to support the new behaviour code introduced in July 2018. There must be a fundamental shift away from regarding members of parliament as \u201c650 small businesses\u201d with near complete freedom to operate in relation to their staff. Members of parliament must be required to adopt and follow employment practices and procedures which are aligned with those followed in other public sector workplaces. This shift must be supported by a properly resourced and staffed department within the House of Commons. It should develop and implement a coherent and robust approach to members\u2019 employment practice and provide support to members and their staff. Any necessary enforcement mechanisms (such as imposing conditions related to good employment practice on MPs\u2019 entitlement to staffing expenditure) should be considered by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority in conjunction with the new department. For the record, here is Labour\u2019s official response to the Panorama programme, released last night after it was broadcast. Here\u2019s an extract. We completely reject any claim that Labour is antisemitic. We stand in solidarity with Jewish people, and we\u2019re taking decisive action to root out antisemitism from our movement and society. The Panorama programme was not a fair or balanced investigation. It was a seriously inaccurate, politically one-sided polemic, which breached basic journalistic standards, invented quotes and edited emails to change their meaning. It was an overtly biased intervention by the BBC in party political controversy. Here is the statement that the UK\u2019s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, issued after last night\u2019s Panorama programme about antisemitism in the Labour party. \u201cThis is no longer a question of the leadership\u2019s inability to deal with the scourge of antisemitism, but of its direct complicity in it,\u201d he says. In his Today interview Tom Watson also said that he thought Jeremy Corbyn was the \u201conly one\u201d who could fix the antisemitism issue in Labour. Asked if he thought Corbyn could fix this problem, Watson replied: Not only do I think [Corbyn] can fix it, I think he is the only one who can fix it. And if he adopts some of the proposals that I\u2019m making [see 9.27am] then these rule changes will go through our party. It won\u2019t be enough to rebuild trust with the Jewish community but it will be a start of trying to challenge a culture of permissiveness that allows anti-Jewish racism to be casually used in political discussion within one of the two great parties in the United Kingdom. We have got an urgent question in the Commons on the resignation of Kim Darroch at 10.30am. Yesterday we started the morning with a former Conservative party leader and prime minister, Sir John Major, saying that he could take legal action against the man likely to be the next party leader and PM, Boris Johnson, over proroguing parliament. The Tory party is clearly not a happy ship. But Labour is also extraordinarily divided, and we saw that this morning when the Today programme 8.10 slot was devoted to Tom Watson, the deputy leader, launching a whole series of complaints about how the party is dealing with antisemitism under its leader, Jeremy Corbyn. The interview was triggered by the reporting in last night\u2019s hour-long Panorama documentary about Labour and antisemitism. Jessica Elgot and Peter Walker\u2019s story about the programme is here. This is a long-running and highly contentious issue not least because allegations of antisemitism are inextricably entwined with two other themes. The first is anti-Israelism. Corbyn and his circle are undoubtedly anti-Israel, and a lot of this debate is really about at what point hostility towards the state of Israel becomes antisemitism. (At some point it certainly feels like antisemitism to Jews.) You could call this anti-Zionism, but that is not a particularly helpful term because Zionism means different things to different people. And the second is anti-Corbynism. There is an undoubted overlap between those in Labour who speak out most against the party\u2019s record on antisemitism and those who are critical of Corbyn generally, but that does not mean their complaints are contrived or insincere. For some, the antisemitism issue helps to explain their anti-Corbynism. Here are the main points from Tom Watson\u2019s interview. Watson strongly criticised his own party for dismissing the former staffers who spoke out in the Panorama programme as \u201cdisaffected\u201d ex-employees with \u201caxes to grind\u201d. Watson said that claim was \u201cfalse\u201d. He went on: I deplore the statement that was made about those people last night. You couldn\u2019t fail to be saddened and moved by the testimony, particularly of the young members who\u2019d had racist abuse in party meetings and on social media. And there was an array of young and old former members of staff from different wings of the party who I think showed great courage to speak out in the way they did ... To speak out about the party they love must have taken a great act of courage and to dismiss their testimony as in some way flawed I think was wrong. In a statement issued late yesterday afternoon the Labour press office, which like the rest of the party machinery is under the control of the Corbyn faction in the party, not people like Watson, said: It appears these disaffected former officials include those who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, worked to actively undermine it, and have both personal and political axes to grind. This throws into doubt their credibility as sources. Interestingly, the long statement issued by the party press office after the Panorama was broadcast did not repeat this criticism of the interviewees. Watson complained there was a perception of \u201calmost a permissive culture\u201d towards antisemitism in the party. He said: In the last four years, since Jeremy and I were elected leader and deputy leader of the party, there is a growing belief that there is a sickness in our party, that this kind of abuse has been in some way allowed. That there\u2019s almost a permissive culture that people can use anti-Jewish, racist language both in our meetings and to each other on social media and we\u2019ve failed to address that properly. Watson called for a rule change to \u201cauto-exclude\u201d party members against whom there was a prima facie case to answer about using antisemitic language or behaviour. He said: I think we need to change the way we investigate these systems. Not casting aspersions on the current people, but I think we need to take these cases away from them and have a full, independent system of investigating cases of anti-Jewish racism that involves representatives from the Jewish community of Britain of standing... I think we need a rule change - and this has been argued by others like Keir Starmer [here] and Gordon Brown - that allows us to auto-exclude from the membership people who have a prima facie case to answer of using antisemitic behaviours and language within our own structures. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 10am: A new report on sexual intimidation and bullying of staff working in the House of Commons is published. 11am: Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, holds a press conference following the publication of the bank\u2019s financial stability report. My colleague Graeme Wearden will be covering it on his business live blog. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime and then another when I finish. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Here there was sharpness at the net and confidence in moving to the volley that bore the signs of her mixed doubles campaign with Murray, and she will need all of that and more to beat Simona Halep in the final on Saturday.</p> <p>As she put it after beating Strycova 6-1, 6-2 in 59 minutes: \u201cI promise you, when I hit a volley I was like: \u2018Would I have made that if I didn\u2019t play doubles?\u2019 I don\u2019t think so. I kept telling you guys I thought the doubles would help me. I really think it did. I don\u2019t attack the net that much. I tried to and I want to.</p> <p>\u201cI know when I do, when I play doubles here with Venus, it definitely helps my singles game. I was really keen to play mixed here. I feel like it helped me, not just for today and this event but hopefully it will help me in the future.\u201d</p> <p>So, there is hope for Murray still to have another tilt at one of the game\u2019s lesser titles, but one that plainly helped Williams on day 10. Tracy Austin, who won the mixed doubles title here in 1980, thinks so.</p> <p>\u201cPlaying mixed doubles with Andy Murray brought her intensity up,\u201d the former world No 1 said in conversation with the BBC\u2019s Sue Barker, \u201cbecause we know how intense Andy is.\u201d</p> <p>Martina Navratilova observed of Williams\u2019s win against the 33-year-old Czech: \u201cStrycova was on the run every single shot. She defended to win her three games but that is all she had.\u201d</p> <p>Williams\u2019s serve clicked near its best, delivering her the point 24 times out of 27 at the first attempt, nine from 17 when she needed a second serve, and striking 28 clear winners in such a short match, demonstrating how commanding she was.</p> <p>Whether or not she can reproduce that brilliance against Halep, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/11/wimbledon-simona-halep-elina-svitolina-semi-final\" title=\"\">beat the No 8 seed Elina Svitolina almost as impressively \u2013 6-1, 6-3</a> in 1hr 13min \u2013 might depend on the American\u2019s mood. As Williams admitted when reflecting on her relaxed demeanour: \u201cI was calm today. It\u2019s a day-to-day basis with me. We all know that. I\u2019m far from perfect.\u201d</p> <p>That is patently true. It is 10 months since she lost all sense of proportion and discipline <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/08/serena-williams-rails-at-umpire-as-superb-naomi-osaka-wins-us-open\" title=\"\">in losing the US Open final</a>, although she insisted in an open letter this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/09/serena-williams-naomi-osaka-us-open-final-tennis-umpire\" title=\"\">to her conqueror, Naomi Osaka</a>, that it was the media\u2019s fault.</p> <p>Ther was no friction here, though. All was well in the world and her smile was wide and generous. She revealed she had been thinking that morning about her journey, about motherhood, her post-match outfit, her first Wimbledon final, against her sister Venus in 2002, and about the number 24, the next hurdle to jump. Or did she?</p> <p>\u201cI thought about it this morning,\u201d she began, adding quickly: \u201cI actually didn\u2019t think about it, because it\u2019s really not about 24 or 23 or 25. It\u2019s just about going out there and giving my best effort, no matter what. No matter what I do, I will always have a great career. I don\u2019t know \u2026 I just kind of let it go this morning. Yeah, I feel really calm about it.\u201d Maybe she does.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Strycova, who looked in the form of her life <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/09/johanna-konta-barbora-strycova-wimbledon-quarter-final\" title=\"\">defeating Johanna Konta on Tuesday</a>, was philosophical, too, in defeat, full of admiration for the player Murray calls \u201cone of the greatest of all time\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Serena Williams could see the question coming \u2013 just as she had anticipated nearly every move Barbora Strycova made on Centre Court shortly before \u2013 and she smilingly agreed that her brief collaboration with Andy Murray had helped her to reach her 11th Wimbledon singles final. This was the relaxed Williams, the Williams who wins as she pleases, rather than the near-meltdown Williams who can inexplicably collapse in sight of the prize \u2013 which, in this case, is an eighth title here and 24th career major, finally to move alongside Margaret Court at the top of her sport. Two days previously she was intermittently dreadful and resilient in beating Alison Riske in three sets. Here there was sharpness at the net and confidence in moving to the volley that bore the signs of her mixed doubles campaign with Murray, and she will need all of that and more to beat Simona Halep in the final on Saturday. As she put it after beating Strycova 6-1, 6-2 in 59 minutes: \u201cI promise you, when I hit a volley I was like: \u2018Would I have made that if I didn\u2019t play doubles?\u2019 I don\u2019t think so. I kept telling you guys I thought the doubles would help me. I really think it did. I don\u2019t attack the net that much. I tried to and I want to. \u201cI know when I do, when I play doubles here with Venus, it definitely helps my singles game. I was really keen to play mixed here. I feel like it helped me, not just for today and this event but hopefully it will help me in the future.\u201d So, there is hope for Murray still to have another tilt at one of the game\u2019s lesser titles, but one that plainly helped Williams on day 10. Tracy Austin, who won the mixed doubles title here in 1980, thinks so. \u201cPlaying mixed doubles with Andy Murray brought her intensity up,\u201d the former world No 1 said in conversation with the BBC\u2019s Sue Barker, \u201cbecause we know how intense Andy is.\u201d Martina Navratilova observed of Williams\u2019s win against the 33-year-old Czech: \u201cStrycova was on the run every single shot. She defended to win her three games but that is all she had.\u201d Williams\u2019s serve clicked near its best, delivering her the point 24 times out of 27 at the first attempt, nine from 17 when she needed a second serve, and striking 28 clear winners in such a short match, demonstrating how commanding she was. Whether or not she can reproduce that brilliance against Halep, who beat the No 8 seed Elina Svitolina almost as impressively \u2013 6-1, 6-3 in 1hr 13min \u2013 might depend on the American\u2019s mood. As Williams admitted when reflecting on her relaxed demeanour: \u201cI was calm today. It\u2019s a day-to-day basis with me. We all know that. I\u2019m far from perfect.\u201d That is patently true. It is 10 months since she lost all sense of proportion and discipline in losing the US Open final, although she insisted in an open letter this week to her conqueror, Naomi Osaka, that it was the media\u2019s fault. Ther was no friction here, though. All was well in the world and her smile was wide and generous. She revealed she had been thinking that morning about her journey, about motherhood, her post-match outfit, her first Wimbledon final, against her sister Venus in 2002, and about the number 24, the next hurdle to jump. Or did she? \u201cI thought about it this morning,\u201d she began, adding quickly: \u201cI actually didn\u2019t think about it, because it\u2019s really not about 24 or 23 or 25. It\u2019s just about going out there and giving my best effort, no matter what. No matter what I do, I will always have a great career. I don\u2019t know \u2026 I just kind of let it go this morning. Yeah, I feel really calm about it.\u201d Maybe she does. Strycova, who looked in the form of her life defeating Johanna Konta on Tuesday, was philosophical, too, in defeat, full of admiration for the player Murray calls \u201cone of the greatest of all time\u201d. Strycova said: \u201cI think it was her best match of all here. She was serving amazing. She was playing very deep, so I really couldn\u2019t play the way I wanted to do. \u201cIf she will play like this in the final, it\u2019s going to be very hard for Simona. But Simona has also her weapons. Every day is different.\u201d With Williams, that is on the money.",

      "bodyText": "A police officer recorded on video striking a handcuffed black teenager with a baton has been placed under criminal investigation. The incident happened in Romford, east London in April and a second officer is under investigation for a potential disciplinary offence over whether police had the grounds to carry out the stop and search in the first place. The Guardian has also learned that four officers are under disciplinary investigation over the use of stop and search in a separate incident in October 2018 in north-west London. That incident, also caught on video, involved a man being sprayed with CS while on the ground. He was later found innocent of the reason for his stop. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating both incidents. It stresses that the serving of a notice of investigation does not mean that misconduct or criminal charges are inevitable. The police watchdog was also to start another investigation into the arrest of a man in east London over a parking incident, caught on video, during which he apparently had a seizure and was taken to hospital. On Thursday the Met said the man, aged 38, had been released under investigation, following his arrest, which led to some criticism of the police. Police use of force is often controversial and the spread of video cameras on mobile phones has led to more incidents being recorded and posted on social media. Police insist they use force rarely and only when necessary. In the incident in Romford in April, the video showed a boy of 17 being struck by an officer with a metal baton several times around the legs. A second teenager was later arrested. In a statement, the IOPC said: \u201cOur independent investigation into the arrest of two teenagers in Romford on Easter Monday [22 April] is making good progress and we met with the boys\u2019 family this week to update them. \u201cSeveral independent witnesses to the interaction between two police officers and the boys have been interviewed. \u201cTwo officers have been served with notices informing them they are being investigated. One officer has been served with a criminal notice in relation to their use of force while the other has been served a notice of gross misconduct for their rationale to initiate the stop and search.\u201d The IOPC said a member of the public who witnessed the incident complained that the use of the baton was excessive, and the watchdog said that it recognised the video \u2013 which captured only part of the incident \u2013 generated significant concern. The Met at the time said it had stopped and searched two teenage boys on Easter Monday under the Misuse of Drugs Act. It said a 17-year-old boy was found in possession of class B drugs, and arrested for possession with intent to supply and obstruction of a drugs search. In the Brent incident from October 2018, police thought a 23-year-old man matched the description of a suspect in a stabbing. He was later found to be innocent of that, but was arrested on suspicion of possession of cannabis, obstructing a drugs search and two counts of assaulting police. The IOPC said the stop and search happened outside the New Atlas cafe in Brent, north-west London, on Thursday 4 October at about 3pm. After the man was tackled and was on the ground, one officer with CS spray can be seen firing it from a few inches away from the man\u2019s face.

      "body": "<p>More than 300 primary schools across England have been forced to become academies in the last three years against a backdrop of mounting opposition from parents, a Guardian investigation has revealed.</p> \n<p>Analysis of government data has shown that 314 schools were forcibly removed from local authority control after being rated inadequate by Ofsted. The Department for Education (DfE) has paid out at least \u00a318.4m to academy trusts for taking on the schools.</p> \n<p>Concerns are growing, however, about the stability of the system, with evidence that a rapidly increasing number of primary schools are being passed from one trust to another after conversion, causing long-term disruption and uncertainty.</p> \n<p>Guardian analysis of DfE data shows that the number of primary schools transferred between academy trusts following conversion has tripled in just three years, from 39 to 121. Since 2013-14 more than 300 primary academies have been rebrokered or moved between trusts.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2019-07-08T13:26:10/embed.html\" data-alt=\"primary schools rebrokered\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2019-07-08T13:26:10/embed.html\">primary schools rebrokered</a> \n</figure> \n<p>As a result, academy sponsors have picked up almost \u00a34m in grants after taking a school from another chain, infuriating critics who point to the current funding squeeze in schools. Meanwhile, seven trusts running primary schools closed in the space of a year up to 2017-18, leaving their schools in search of another sponsor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2ebf8d4a-60fa-4ce5-afec-82e998d1c05d\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>What is forced academisation?</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cForced academisation\u201d describes how a state school in England is compelled to change its legal status from a school overseen by a local authority to that of an academy, and to accept new management by an academy trust.</p>\n    <p><b>How is it triggered?</b></p>\n    <p>Forced academisation is an order issued by the Department for Education (DfE). A school is forced to become an academy if it is \u201celigible for intervention\u201d under law. The order is triggered by a school being classed as inadequate by Ofsted. Previously it could also be triggered by poor performances in exams but that condition was dropped by the education secretary, Damian Hinds, in 2018.</p>\n    <p><b>Do parents get any say in the matter?</b></p>\n    <p>No. Governing bodies, parents and councils get no input in the DfE\u2019s intervention to force academisation. They also have no say in which trust the school is forced to join, meaning the chain may be based hundreds of miles away. Critics say this is a derogation of local democracy.</p>\n    <p><b>What happens to the school?</b></p>\n    <p>The school\u2019s legal relationship becomes a contract between the trust that manages it and the DfE, cutting ties with local authorities. The school\u2019s land and buildings are effectively leased to the trust. Head teachers are stripped of their autonomy, with budget and staffing decisions made by the trust. In most cases the school\u2019s existing leadership is dismissed. The school\u2019s governors lose legal responsibilities, and there is no requirement for trusts to consult with parents. Often the school is renamed and a new uniform adopted. The trust retains a proportion of the school\u2019s funding for its administration and executive costs.</p>\n    <p><b>Does forced academisation improve schools?</b></p>\n    <p>There is little evidence either way. Previously, three-quarters of schools rated as inadequate by Ofsted later improved without forced academisation. The National Audit Office has concluded there is a lack of capable Mats able to improve schools in difficulty.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Commenting on the Guardian findings, the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: \u201cThis is yet another sign that the Tories\u2019 academy system is failing even on its own terms. The problem of \u2018zombie schools\u2019, abandoned by failing academy chains, is spreading at primary level, while other schools are passed from to trust to trust, leading to growing instability.\u201d</p> \n<p>Academy trusts, meanwhile, are expanding rapidly as they absorb more schools. St Ralph Sherwin Catholic multi-academy trust in Nottingham saw the biggest increase, jumping from six to 20 schools in just one year, receiving an estimated \u00a31m from the DfE in the process. Three of these were forced academisations.</p> \n<p>Reach, one of the largest chains in the country, composed of Reach2 and Reach South multi-academy trusts (Mats), now has 68 primary schools in London, Birmingham, Essex, Kent, Reading, Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Devon. Four have been rebrokered from other trusts, for which it received \u00a3220,000. This year, however, Reach2 was warned that it might itself <a href=\"https://schoolsweek.co.uk/top-trust-could-lose-primary-academy-if-more-schools-fall-to-inadequate/\">lose one of its schools in Kent</a> after an inadequate rating by Ofsted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2019-07-08T13:26:06/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Primary academies in England\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2019-07-08T13:26:06/embed.html\">Primary academies in England</a> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cA school system must be built on strong foundations and have the support of all stakeholders in order to thrive and succeed,\u201d said Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union. \u201cBut, as each day goes by, the government\u2019s academy programme is further exposed to be built on quicksand.</p> \n<p>\u201cBillions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money has been spent on forcing schools into academy status, only to see those same schools being rebrokered further down the track as they are later failed by their sponsors.</p> \n<p>\u201cSome schools have had to endure multiple rebrokerings and a number of different sponsors, each bringing a change of ethos and approach, new school uniforms, a turnover of staff and a rise in exclusions and off-rolling. There is no stability in such a system and it is pupils, parents and staff who lose out.\u201d</p> \n<p>The majority of secondary schools in England are now academies, but primaries have been slower to convert. The proportion of primary school pupils being taught in academies is steadily rising and now stands at more than a third, at 1.6 million pupils, according to the most recent school census.</p> \n<p>While schools judged good or outstanding by Ofsted can choose to become academies, since April 2016 if a local authority maintained school is judged \u201cinadequate\u201d the DfE will issue an academy order removing the school from council control and forcing it to join an academy trust.</p> \n<p>A trust will be awarded a grant of \u00a370,000 to \u00a3150,000 to cover conversion costs.

      "bodyText": "More than 300 primary schools across England have been forced to become academies in the last three years against a backdrop of mounting opposition from parents, a Guardian investigation has revealed. Analysis of government data has shown that 314 schools were forcibly removed from local authority control after being rated inadequate by Ofsted. The Department for Education (DfE) has paid out at least \u00a318.4m to academy trusts for taking on the schools. Concerns are growing, however, about the stability of the system, with evidence that a rapidly increasing number of primary schools are being passed from one trust to another after conversion, causing long-term disruption and uncertainty. Guardian analysis of DfE data shows that the number of primary schools transferred between academy trusts following conversion has tripled in just three years, from 39 to 121. Since 2013-14 more than 300 primary academies have been rebrokered or moved between trusts. As a result, academy sponsors have picked up almost \u00a34m in grants after taking a school from another chain, infuriating critics who point to the current funding squeeze in schools. Meanwhile, seven trusts running primary schools closed in the space of a year up to 2017-18, leaving their schools in search of another sponsor. Commenting on the Guardian findings, the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: \u201cThis is yet another sign that the Tories\u2019 academy system is failing even on its own terms. The problem of \u2018zombie schools\u2019, abandoned by failing academy chains, is spreading at primary level, while other schools are passed from to trust to trust, leading to growing instability.\u201d Academy trusts, meanwhile, are expanding rapidly as they absorb more schools. St Ralph Sherwin Catholic multi-academy trust in Nottingham saw the biggest increase, jumping from six to 20 schools in just one year, receiving an estimated \u00a31m from the DfE in the process. Three of these were forced academisations. Reach, one of the largest chains in the country, composed of Reach2 and Reach South multi-academy trusts (Mats), now has 68 primary schools in London, Birmingham, Essex, Kent, Reading, Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Devon. Four have been rebrokered from other trusts, for which it received \u00a3220,000. This year, however, Reach2 was warned that it might itself lose one of its schools in Kent after an inadequate rating by Ofsted. \u201cA school system must be built on strong foundations and have the support of all stakeholders in order to thrive and succeed,\u201d said Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union. \u201cBut, as each day goes by, the government\u2019s academy programme is further exposed to be built on quicksand. \u201cBillions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money has been spent on forcing schools into academy status, only to see those same schools being rebrokered further down the track as they are later failed by their sponsors. \u201cSome schools have had to endure multiple rebrokerings and a number of different sponsors, each bringing a change of ethos and approach, new school uniforms, a turnover of staff and a rise in exclusions and off-rolling. There is no stability in such a system and it is pupils, parents and staff who lose out.\u201d The majority of secondary schools in England are now academies, but primaries have been slower to convert. The proportion of primary school pupils being taught in academies is steadily rising and now stands at more than a third, at 1.6 million pupils, according to the most recent school census. While schools judged good or outstanding by Ofsted can choose to become academies, since April 2016 if a local authority maintained school is judged \u201cinadequate\u201d the DfE will issue an academy order removing the school from council control and forcing it to join an academy trust. A trust will be awarded a grant of \u00a370,000 to \u00a3150,000 to cover conversion costs. If the school has a deficit when it converts, the council picks up the bill, which can be steep. Bradford council was left with costs of \u00a3250,000 when three primary schools converted to academy status. The moves can be complex, critics say, creating a costly academy merry-go-round. Oldknow Academy, which was one of the schools involved in the Birmingham \u201cTrojan horse\u201d scandal, was rebrokered in 2015. The new trust, Ark, received \u00a3260,000 from the DfE for taking it on \u2013 the highest payment for a primary school in the dataset. That school then closed in 2018 after merging with Ark Victoria academy to become an all-through school. Ark Victoria had itself also been rebrokered after its original sponsor, the Perry Beeches Trust, was closed after a government investigation into financial irregularities. The DfE denied that the transfer of academies to other trusts reflects instability in the system. \u201cLast year, only 3.3% of all academies transferred \u2013 most did so voluntarily, and this often involved standalone academies joining strong Mats,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThere are over half a million pupils now in good or outstanding sponsored primary and secondary academies that typically replaced underperforming schools. In converter academies open for one year, 65% of pupils reach the expected standards in reading, writing and maths; this figure rises to 71% in converter academies open for seven years. \u201cWe are striving for a world-class education for all children regardless of background, and when we see issues of underperformance we will not hesitate to take swift action.\u201d According to the DfE more than two-thirds of academy trust transfers were initiated by the outgoing trust, and about half involved single-academy trusts moving into Mats. Rayner said the Tories had wasted money on academy conversions, while school budgets were squeezed year on year, leaving headteachers with little choice but to beg parents for donations. \u201cLabour will end the Tories\u2019 programme of forced conversion, re-empower local communities and properly invest in all our schools,\u201d she said.

The number of parent-led campaigns to defend their community schools should put ministers on notice that the academy programme\u2019s days are numbered.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Local authorities are increasingly reluctant to allow care homes and retirement homes to be built in their areas because they can\u2019t afford the social care costs associated with that demographic, Conservative MP and former deputy prime minister Damian Green has said. The chair of the all-party parliamentary group on longevity, who has produced his own policy paper suggesting a solution to the social care funding crisis, said it was a \u201cquiet secret\u201d that local authorities \u2013 who have to fund social care costs \u2013 try to avoid applications for homes for older people. He also warned that unless all parties agree to seek a cross-party consensus on social care funding, a political crisis triggered by an \u201cenormous scandal\u201d will force them to act. \u201cWe need to face up to these unpalatable truths,\u201d he said. \u201cThe current system isn\u2019t sustainable financially or politically. An enormous scandal will break and suddenly, there will be a political crisis. Cynically, it may be that we need something like that, but we should be able to avoid it because we know it is probably coming. \u201cLocal authorities don\u2019t want to become attractive places for retired people,\u201d he added. \u201cIf things go on as they are, local authorities will become social care providers with everything else as \u2018add-ons\u2019 and the traditional things we all expect from them simply not existing.\u201d Age UK estimates that 1.4 million older people have unmet care needs. This is despite the average share of local authority funding going on adult social care reaching almost 25% of their total budget in 2017-2018. Local authority budgets have seen devastating cuts under the Conservative government. Despite announcements of extra funds, and a \u00a320bn boost to the NHS under Theresa May, the Local Government Association (LGA) has warned of an \u00a38bn funding black hole by 2025. Last month, Jeremy Hunt \u2013 the longest-serving health secretary in British history \u2013 admitted social care cuts went too far on his watch. On a BBC debate for the Conservative party leadership election, Hunt said: \u201cI think having been responsible for health and social care, that some of the cuts in social care did go too far.\u201d Ian Hudspeth, chair of the Community and Wellbeing Board at the LGA, said: \u201cI haven\u2019t come across any planning permissions not being put forward in this way but we\u2019re very aware that the social care structure is at a crisis point.\u201d He pointed to a recent report by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services which reported that almost half of councils have seen the closure of domestic home care providers in their area in the past year and a third had seen residential care homes closed, collectively affecting more than 8,000 clients and residents. \u201cThere have been instances of care homes going out of business without warning and immediate pressure being put on local authorities to provide care and accommodation for their residents,\u201d he added. Green was speaking at a debate on Tackling Britain\u2019s Care Crisis at the Resolution Foundation alongside Liz Kendall MP, former shadow minister for care, Norman Lamb MP, former minister for care, and David Willetts, president of the Intergenerational Centre. All of the speakers called for a cross-party consensus on how to fund social care. There was wide agreement for a year-long programme of citizens\u2019 assemblies and town hall meetings so the public could have their say. Kendall said it was \u201cabsolutely a national imperative\u201d that politicians create a cross-party consensus. Lamb agreed, lambasting the current system as \u201ccompletely dysfunctional\u201d. It \u201cfails people completely\u201d, he said, criticising the government for failing to produce the long-awaited green paper. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cPeople deserve to have a choice of high-quality care services wherever they live in the country. Local authorities are best placed to understand and plan for the care needs of their populations and are responsible for shaping their local markets so they are sustainable, diverse and offer high-quality care and support for local people. \u201cWe have given local authorities access to up to \u00a33.9bn more dedicated funding for adult social care this year with a further \u00a3410m available for adults\u2019 and children\u2019s services. We will set out our plans to reform the social care system at the earliest opportunity to ensure it is sustainable for the future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A public inquiry into the shooting of an unarmed man has found that Greater Manchester police (GMP) was entirely to blame for his death due to serious failings in its firearms unit. Anthony Grainger, 36, was shot through the chest as he sat in a car in the village of Culcheth, Cheshire, by an armed police officer known as \u201cQ9\u201d. Detectives believed he and two others were planning to hold up a supermarket and had access to firearms on the evening of 3 March 2012. However, no weapons were found in the red Audi. In a highly critical report on the incident published on Thursday, Judge Thomas Teague QC, concluded that GMP adopted a cavalier attitude and collated flawed intelligence during the botched operation directly leading to Grainger\u2019s death. Teague said the force\u2019s armed response unit lacked the necessary degree of operational competence and following the shooting officers did not follow proper procedures, adopting a culture of \u201csecrecy\u201d and \u201carrogant disdain for the views of others\u201d. He added that the force repeatedly blocked the inquiry from obtaining relevant documents and evidence, with its tactical firearms unit (TFU) having an \u201cunduly reticent\u201d attitude and \u201cgeneral disinclination\u201d to expose its decisions and actions to external scrutiny \u2013 a culture he believes persists to this day. The commanders within the TFU were also repeatedly singled out for criticism for their gung-ho attitude towards firearms operations and their inability to explore safer tactical alternatives. He added: \u201cIt is the senior commanders who set the tone of a specialised firearms department \u2026 the TFU remained incapable of exercising genuinely objective judgment in relation to its own conduct and that of its officers. They provide further evidence of an entrenched hostility to criticism.\u201d He made nine recommendations including a call for more openness and transparency following the discharge of a police firearm and for firearms officers to be equipped with body-worn video cameras as is now common practice for regular officers. Outside the court Grainger\u2019s mother, Marina Schofield, said she wanted officers to be held to account for her son\u2019s death and confirmed that her legal team had contacted the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to examine whether criminal charges could follow against at least four senior police officers. Leslie Thomas QC, representing the Grainger family, said he had been unlawfully killed by GMP due to a \u201ccalamitous combination of errors and blunders\u201d. He said the report catalogued \u201cdishonesty and corruption\u201d at the highest level of GMP and that senior officers had displayed a \u201ccavalier approach to public safety\u201d. He added: \u201cThe chairman describes serious inaccuracies in threat assessments, seriously misleading briefings of firearms officers, a fundamentally flawed tactical approach, and planning of the operation that was incompetent and dangerous. \u201cAnthony died because of these failings by GMP.\u201d Meanwhile Grainger\u2019s partner, Gail Hadfield-Grainger, said his death could have been prevented had it not been for a \u201clitany of catastrophic failures\u201d by GMP. Hadfield-Grainger requested a meeting with the home secretary, Sajid Javid, describing her partner\u2019s death as a national scandal. She added: \u201cHe needs to explain to the public what he is going to do to make it safe for armed police to be deployed on the streets of Manchester.\u201d Father-of-two Grainger was behind the wheel of the stolen Audi when Q9 fired his MP5 submachine gun, striking Grainger fatally in the chest. Two other rounds were fired at the car\u2019s tyres and a CS gas canister was thrown into the vehicle by another officer. During 14 weeks of evidence in 2017, Q9 told Liverpool crown court from behind a screen that he believed Grainger had reached down as if to grab a firearm. But the inquiry heard that no firearms were found on Grainger and he may have been reaching down for the driver\u2019s door handle. Describing the inquiry as \u201copen and fearless\u201d Teague concluded: \u201cQ9\u2019s mistaken belief that Mr Grainger was about to discharge a firearm was based on the inaccurate and inadequate briefing he had received that morning. \u201cThat he jumped to the wrong conclusion is partly his own fault and partly the fault of his commanders whose incompetent planning and slipshod briefing directly contributed to his faulty appreciation of the facts.\u201d One of Grainger\u2019s two passengers, David Totton, had been under surveillance for five months as part of Operation Shire, an investigation into their suspected involvement in commercial robberies. However, Teague pointed out there was no intelligence to suggest on this occasion they were armed or had access to firearms. He said: \u201cAt the root of the events of 3 March 2012 was a lack of effective leadership in firearms operations conducted by Greater Manchester police. I detected a deeply entrenched complacency among certain senior officers who lacked the necessary critical insight to detect, let alone remedy, the deficiencies I have identified.\u201d Since the shooting seven years ago there have been two inquiries into Grainger\u2019s death. In 2013, an inquiry by the then Independent Police Complaints Commission concluded there had been 16 failings in the Grainger operation. They included that police marksmen had \u201cconferred over witness statements\u201d. Steve Heywood, an assistant chief constable who retired from the force last year, faces a charge of gross misconduct. The inquiry heard that some of his notes had been written after the shooting, leading to a \u201cfalse impression\u201d of intelligence. A spokesman for GMP said the force had made changes since the shooting and would now consider what more could be done. GMP\u2019s chief constable, Ian Hopkins, said in a statement: \u201cOur failings have led to Anthony Grainger\u2019s death and caused unimaginable harm to his family.

      "body": "<p>The death of the film and TV star Rip Torn, whose drunken exuberance so often resulted in the breaking of glass, the splintering of wood and the bandaging of limbs, has led the industry to ponder that exotic creature whose rock\u2019n\u2019roll behaviour, from the 1960s onwards, persisted for decades to tolerant chortling from the similarly inclined or wistfully well-behaved gentlemen of the press. And that creature is the \u201chellraiser\u201d \u2013 a term that originates from a defiant credo espoused by the hard-drinking, hard-living Hollywood legend Richard Burton: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bfi/status/664108360724258816\" title=\"\">\u201cGod put me on this earth to raise sheer hell!\u201d</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/15/peter-otoole-career\" title=\"\">Peter O\u2019Toole\u2019s death</a> in 2013 led to a similar outpouring of grief for the booze legends who have evidently been replaced by corporate dullards, drinking mineral water, policing their own language and anxiously checking their mentions on Twitter. Once we had hellraisers: now we have \u201cdisrupters\u201d, people who give Ted talks about their revolutionary new app for maximising your leisure time. Actors used to spend every penny getting fantastically drunk. Now George Clooney gets a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/22/george-clooney-tequila-casamigos-smirnoff-diageo\" title=\"\">reported</a> $1bn for selling his Casamigos Tequila brand to the drinks retailer Diageo \u2014 although Clooney <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/clooneys-drunken-bust-up-7249502.html\" title=\"\">was reported</a> to lose his cool after a few drinks.</p> <p>But isn\u2019t \u201chellraiser\u201d just a euphemism for alcoholic narcissist? Isn\u2019t hellraising simply another supposedly amusing or picturesque aspect of arrogant behaviour that is becoming increasingly tiresome and objectionable, with wives and children left behind to pick up the pieces? Yes \u2013 almost certainly. But there are certain kinds of determinant factor in hellraising, aside from drinking and even sexual politics: it is part of the postwar history of publicity and celebrity, and the varying histories of Britain, Ireland and the US, whose hellraisers were very different beasts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"548ee4fb3b5909ae9a5b417f11b616250f38aa1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/548ee4fb3b5909ae9a5b417f11b616250f38aa1b/0_84_1967_2804/701.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Reed, glass in hand, in 1985\" width=\"701\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Reed, glass in hand, in 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Young /Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Brits and the Irish had O\u2019Toole, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, and the Americans included Rip Torn, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson. In literature, there were William Burroughs and Norman Mailer, in journalism Hunter S Thompson (the British had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/apr/19/jeffrey-bernard-is-unwell-to-be-staged-at-favourite-soho-haunt\" title=\"\">Jeffrey Bernard</a>) and in literal rather than metaphorical rock\u2019n\u2019roll there were Keith Moon, Pete Townshend, Keith Richards and Pete Doherty. But women are not allowed into the club so easily. The exploits of, say Amy Winehouse, Lindsay Lohan or Lily Allen are not really \u201cexploits\u201d in the same sentimentally rousing sense. These anecdotes are tinged with tragic mourning or thin-lipped disapproval in a way they are not for the guys.</p> <p>Torn commands a certain respect, for all the revisionism, because his hellraising continued unabashed into his late 70s, at an age when the O\u2019Tooles of this world had long since sworn off the booze. He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/30/rip-torn-court-bank-home\" title=\"\">charged</a> in 2010, at the age of 79, with breaking into a bank while drunk and carrying a gun, claiming that he thought it was his home. One detail there is very important in distinguishing American hellraisers from the ones on our side of the Atlantic. Guns. Moreover, Americans were more prominently into cocaine, while our hellraisers were likelier to content themselves with gallons of warm brown bitter.</p> <p>Hopper was once so coked up that he <a href=\"https://dangerousminds.net/comments/dennis_hopper_and_his\" title=\"\">reportedly</a> staged a mock \u201csuicide\u201d by lying down in a coffin in Texas, surrounding himself with sticks of dynamite, challenging people to blow him up, and finally leaving, allegedly shooting up heroin, and taking off for Mexico, where he tried to venture into the jungle without any clothes on. As for Jack Nicholson, he was notoriously drunk at a party thrown by the super-agent Sue Mengers in 1979. Nicholson <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/11834064/Jack-Nicholson-offered-Princess-Margaret-cocaine-book-claims.html\" title=\"\">staggered up to Princess Margaret</a> and suggested they repair to the bathroom to do a line of cocaine together. Her Royal Highness icily declined.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"638075babf532aedef318c907aa1900b68df00cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/638075babf532aedef318c907aa1900b68df00cb/0_0_1543_1856/831.jpg\" alt=\"Rip Torn\u2019s 2010 police mugshot.\" width=\"831\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rip Torn\u2019s 2010 police mugshot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NY State Police/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The aggression, delusion and self-indulgence of non-American hellraisers is obviously comparable to those in the US. Harris was often a cheery soul whose conviviality charmed all those who came across him. But he could also be a crazily aggressive drunk whose addiction took him to the edge of self-destruction. When playing Oliver Cromwell in the 1970 biopic, with Alec Guinness as Charles I, Harris\u2019s incessant drinking took him to a strange place, one in which he believed that the imminent execution of the king was real. He <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=A-wxCwq4u4EC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=richard+harris+telephone+charles+i+ken+hughes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ToQeWtEfU_&amp;sig=ACfU3U1ZGhvBuu9KJqftnDmn3Oj0X5TsFg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjkuOuduKrjAhUNT8AKHVWuBpAQ6AEwEHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=richard%20harris%20telephone%20charles%20i%20ken%20hughes&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">telephoned the director</a>, Ken Hughes, in the middle of the night and yelled: \u201cWe must give him another chance!\u201d A doctor had to be called, along with some strong men to hold him down while a tranquillising injection was administered.</p> <p>As for Reed, he is said to have made an <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/334066.stm\" title=\"\">entrance at an airport</a>, lying drunk on the baggage conveyor. While filming The Lion in Winter, O\u2019Toole drunkenly cut off the top of his finger in a boating accident; he attempted to sterilise the fragment of finger in a glass of brandy before ramming it back on to the bloodied stump and wrapping it in a bandage. On removing this some weeks later, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/15/peter-otoole-60s-hellraiser\" title=\"\">discovered</a> he had put the finger on the wrong way round. When acting on the stage, he very much enjoyed getting drunk in the pub right up until \u201cthe half\u201d \u2013 the half-hour before curtain up when an actor is traditionally expected at the theatre \u2013 and beyond. He is said to have taken Michael Caine out for an almighty drinking session, after which Caine woke up in an unfamiliar flat and asked: \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d, to which O\u2019Toole replied: \u201cNever mind that, what fucking day is it?\u201d Another lost weekend (a phrase immortalised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/24/my-favorite-best-picture-oscar-winner-the-lost-weekend\" title=\"\">the Billy Wilder film</a>), but Caine and O\u2019Toole still had time to make the Monday night performance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7e2f1594f013b62c534973a6ff3ef6f81fd4f5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7e2f1594f013b62c534973a6ff3ef6f81fd4f5b/0_531_3226_4221/764.jpg\" alt=\"Peter OToole\" width=\"764\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter OToole: a better class of hellraiser?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For British thespian hellraisers, drunkenness is much more of a public performance, more about sentimentally singing or declaiming verse in the pub after the landlord has despairingly called time \u2013 in a booming, actorly voice. The British hellraiser, unlike his American counterpart, thinks he is a mixture of John Falstaff and Prince Hal, a superb and lovably bohemian force of nature, who may yet get someone into bed at the end of the evening. Or sort of wishes to, anyway: Harris once said that the only thing drink will get up is your hopes.</p> <p>But it is important that all this originated in the 1960s. It is difficult to credit now how pinched, cramped, uptight and class-bound Britain still was in the postwar period, with restaurants and saloon bars like the dining room of Fawlty Towers, with everyone getting rude service and being afraid to complain. When Reed and O\u2019Toole took their trousers down and started singing in the middle of a public place, it was at least partly a reaction against all the pomposity and hypocrisy and, as stars, they were allowed to do it. It was a quainter sort of hellraising performance.</p> <p>There is something different also in the way that these anecdotes are produced and consumed. They are exactly that \u2013 anecdotes \u2013 refined and burnished over cigars at the dinner table at Langan\u2019s in the 70s and 80s and then presented to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/may/17/michael-parkinson-interview\" title=\"\">Michael Parkinson</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/08/the-10-best-chatshow-moments-letterman\" title=\"\">Russell Harty</a> on TV chatshows, by and large by the grinning participants themselves. The events happened far from the gaze of press and public. Now, in an age of TMZ.com, when everyone can take high-quality pictures or video on their smartphones, these things mean something different: they are captured instantaneously in all their unfunny chaos and squalor, without the people involved getting a chance to change or suppress the details to make it into a funny story.</p> <p>The hellraising of Torn, Hopper et al is performative as well. Of course it is. But it is also much more obviously about machismo, about clout and prestige, about showing the other guy who is boss. In the US in the 60s, the studio system was coming to an end, with actors no longer treated as obedient contract players. A new golden age of star power was in the ascendant, with A-listers throwing their weight around, sometimes literally. So much of the creative energy in Hollywood is expended invisibly to the general public \u2013 in the meeting. The big players have to intimidate, in one way or another. In a new culture of method acting, it\u2019s about real sweat, real passion, real fists, real people.

      "bodyText": "The death of the film and TV star Rip Torn, whose drunken exuberance so often resulted in the breaking of glass, the splintering of wood and the bandaging of limbs, has led the industry to ponder that exotic creature whose rock\u2019n\u2019roll behaviour, from the 1960s onwards, persisted for decades to tolerant chortling from the similarly inclined or wistfully well-behaved gentlemen of the press. And that creature is the \u201chellraiser\u201d \u2013 a term that originates from a defiant credo espoused by the hard-drinking, hard-living Hollywood legend Richard Burton: \u201cGod put me on this earth to raise sheer hell!\u201d Peter O\u2019Toole\u2019s death in 2013 led to a similar outpouring of grief for the booze legends who have evidently been replaced by corporate dullards, drinking mineral water, policing their own language and anxiously checking their mentions on Twitter. Once we had hellraisers: now we have \u201cdisrupters\u201d, people who give Ted talks about their revolutionary new app for maximising your leisure time. Actors used to spend every penny getting fantastically drunk. Now George Clooney gets a reported $1bn for selling his Casamigos Tequila brand to the drinks retailer Diageo \u2014 although Clooney was reported to lose his cool after a few drinks. But isn\u2019t \u201chellraiser\u201d just a euphemism for alcoholic narcissist? Isn\u2019t hellraising simply another supposedly amusing or picturesque aspect of arrogant behaviour that is becoming increasingly tiresome and objectionable, with wives and children left behind to pick up the pieces? Yes \u2013 almost certainly. But there are certain kinds of determinant factor in hellraising, aside from drinking and even sexual politics: it is part of the postwar history of publicity and celebrity, and the varying histories of Britain, Ireland and the US, whose hellraisers were very different beasts. The Brits and the Irish had O\u2019Toole, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, and the Americans included Rip Torn, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson. In literature, there were William Burroughs and Norman Mailer, in journalism Hunter S Thompson (the British had Jeffrey Bernard) and in literal rather than metaphorical rock\u2019n\u2019roll there were Keith Moon, Pete Townshend, Keith Richards and Pete Doherty. But women are not allowed into the club so easily. The exploits of, say Amy Winehouse, Lindsay Lohan or Lily Allen are not really \u201cexploits\u201d in the same sentimentally rousing sense. These anecdotes are tinged with tragic mourning or thin-lipped disapproval in a way they are not for the guys. Torn commands a certain respect, for all the revisionism, because his hellraising continued unabashed into his late 70s, at an age when the O\u2019Tooles of this world had long since sworn off the booze. He was charged in 2010, at the age of 79, with breaking into a bank while drunk and carrying a gun, claiming that he thought it was his home. One detail there is very important in distinguishing American hellraisers from the ones on our side of the Atlantic. Guns. Moreover, Americans were more prominently into cocaine, while our hellraisers were likelier to content themselves with gallons of warm brown bitter. Hopper was once so coked up that he reportedly staged a mock \u201csuicide\u201d by lying down in a coffin in Texas, surrounding himself with sticks of dynamite, challenging people to blow him up, and finally leaving, allegedly shooting up heroin, and taking off for Mexico, where he tried to venture into the jungle without any clothes on. As for Jack Nicholson, he was notoriously drunk at a party thrown by the super-agent Sue Mengers in 1979. Nicholson staggered up to Princess Margaret and suggested they repair to the bathroom to do a line of cocaine together. Her Royal Highness icily declined. The aggression, delusion and self-indulgence of non-American hellraisers is obviously comparable to those in the US. Harris was often a cheery soul whose conviviality charmed all those who came across him. But he could also be a crazily aggressive drunk whose addiction took him to the edge of self-destruction. When playing Oliver Cromwell in the 1970 biopic, with Alec Guinness as Charles I, Harris\u2019s incessant drinking took him to a strange place, one in which he believed that the imminent execution of the king was real. He telephoned the director, Ken Hughes, in the middle of the night and yelled: \u201cWe must give him another chance!\u201d A doctor had to be called, along with some strong men to hold him down while a tranquillising injection was administered. As for Reed, he is said to have made an entrance at an airport, lying drunk on the baggage conveyor. While filming The Lion in Winter, O\u2019Toole drunkenly cut off the top of his finger in a boating accident; he attempted to sterilise the fragment of finger in a glass of brandy before ramming it back on to the bloodied stump and wrapping it in a bandage. On removing this some weeks later, he discovered he had put the finger on the wrong way round. When acting on the stage, he very much enjoyed getting drunk in the pub right up until \u201cthe half\u201d \u2013 the half-hour before curtain up when an actor is traditionally expected at the theatre \u2013 and beyond. He is said to have taken Michael Caine out for an almighty drinking session, after which Caine woke up in an unfamiliar flat and asked: \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d, to which O\u2019Toole replied: \u201cNever mind that, what fucking day is it?\u201d Another lost weekend (a phrase immortalised by the Billy Wilder film), but Caine and O\u2019Toole still had time to make the Monday night performance. For British thespian hellraisers, drunkenness is much more of a public performance, more about sentimentally singing or declaiming verse in the pub after the landlord has despairingly called time \u2013 in a booming, actorly voice. The British hellraiser, unlike his American counterpart, thinks he is a mixture of John Falstaff and Prince Hal, a superb and lovably bohemian force of nature, who may yet get someone into bed at the end of the evening. Or sort of wishes to, anyway: Harris once said that the only thing drink will get up is your hopes. But it is important that all this originated in the 1960s. It is difficult to credit now how pinched, cramped, uptight and class-bound Britain still was in the postwar period, with restaurants and saloon bars like the dining room of Fawlty Towers, with everyone getting rude service and being afraid to complain. When Reed and O\u2019Toole took their trousers down and started singing in the middle of a public place, it was at least partly a reaction against all the pomposity and hypocrisy and, as stars, they were allowed to do it. It was a quainter sort of hellraising performance. There is something different also in the way that these anecdotes are produced and consumed. They are exactly that \u2013 anecdotes \u2013 refined and burnished over cigars at the dinner table at Langan\u2019s in the 70s and 80s and then presented to Michael Parkinson or Russell Harty on TV chatshows, by and large by the grinning participants themselves. The events happened far from the gaze of press and public. Now, in an age of TMZ.com, when everyone can take high-quality pictures or video on their smartphones, these things mean something different: they are captured instantaneously in all their unfunny chaos and squalor, without the people involved getting a chance to change or suppress the details to make it into a funny story. The hellraising of Torn, Hopper et al is performative as well. Of course it is. But it is also much more obviously about machismo, about clout and prestige, about showing the other guy who is boss. In the US in the 60s, the studio system was coming to an end, with actors no longer treated as obedient contract players. A new golden age of star power was in the ascendant, with A-listers throwing their weight around, sometimes literally. So much of the creative energy in Hollywood is expended invisibly to the general public \u2013 in the meeting. The big players have to intimidate, in one way or another. In a new culture of method acting, it\u2019s about real sweat, real passion, real fists, real people. And so hellraising is more about status. As to whether there are hellraisers now, well, of course there are, although the eco-system of deference, naivety about alcoholism, press complaisance and tolerance of male behaviour has worn away. Johnny Depp is someone who has never grown out of his hellraiser \u2013 or hellraiser\u2019s apprentice \u2013 period, being a mate of Keith Richards and Hunter S Thompson and having, in his 20s, bought the notorious Viper Room nightclub in Los Angeles, and trashed many a hotel room. In middle age, his rather sad, ageing wild-man persona was exposed in the Rolling Stone interview he conducted in very late-Brando style. It was given in a sepulchral rented mansion in north London\u2019s eerie \u201cMillionaire\u2019s Row\u201d district of Bishopswood Road, notorious for deserted megahouses purchased by absentee plutocrat investors. What emerged was a huge party lifestyle that was not exactly \u201chellraising\u201d, in that it was perhaps more about ostentatious spending than ostentatious drinking: $3m to shoot the late Thompson\u2019s ashes into the sky from a cannon; $75m for 14 houses; $200,000 a month on private air travel. But he has certainly been accused of having the hellraiser\u2019s tendency to toxic male aggression and arrogance: his former partner Amber Heard claims that he abused alcohol and drugs, and claims that he choked, hit and headbutted her during his drunken and drug-fuelled rages. He has launched a defamation suit to refute this. Much hellraising is about anger: the director David O Russell once had a quasi-hellraiser reputation for confrontational rage on the movie set and Alec Baldwin is a kind of boozeless hellraiser in his way (although he has been a drinker in the past) in that he can get involved in public situations. Tellingly, these tend to be with paparazzi and precisely those 24-hour media warriors who have made hellraising mythology untenable. Leonardo DiCaprio is a \u201cplayer\u201d, rather than a \u201chellraiser\u201d in the classical sense, in that whatever high-jinks this famously eligible single guy gets up to, they are still not for public consumption. The writer and film-maker Emma Forrest has written insightfully about her relationship with the Australian wild-man actor Ben Mendelsohn, indicating that there are still men for whom an uproarious lifestyle is absolutely natural and authentic, not a pose. And there is Colin Farrell, who has spoken out honestly about his battle with drink. He has become a kind of legend for getting drunk with Dame Eileen Atkins, a star many years his senior, in a hotel bar, and then coming up to her hotel room and, to her bemused astonishment, offering to read her bedtime book aloud to her: a bizarre but strangely romantic and even innocent kind of hellraising that turned Farrell and Atkins into firm friends.

      "bodyText": "The pound is having a rare good day, despite Mark Carney\u2019s concerns about Brexit. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx has the details: Seemingly taking heart from the Bank of England\u2019s claim that there has been \u2018some improvement in the preparedness of the UK economy for no-deal Brexit\u2019, the pound rebounded on Thursday. Cable [the pound/dollar exchange rate] also benefiting from the restated dovishness of the Federal Reserve, rose 0.3%, putting further ground between it and the week\u2019s 2-year-plus lows. Against the euro, meanwhile, it added the same amount, pushing it back above \u20ac1.114 and away from yesterday\u2019s 6-month nadir. These gains served to prevent the FTSE from joining in with the gains seen elsewhere. Instead the UK index lost 0.2%, dragging it under 7520. Here\u2019s John McDonnell MP, Shadow Chancellor, n the Bank of England\u2019s Financial Stability Report: \u201cThe Bank of England has spelled out that crashing out of the EU, with no care and no deal, would cause real damage to households and businesses. \u201cNo responsible politician, genuinely concerned for the wellbeing of families and communities, would advocate a no-deal Brexit given these known consequences.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story on the Bank\u2019s latest concerns about financial stability. Time for a recap The Bank of England has concluded that the UK financial sector is strong enough to withstand a trade war and a disorderly Brexit, even if they occurred at the same time. But, in its latest Financial Stability Report, the BoE also fears that a no-deal Brexit would cause significant disruption in the markets. Sweeping aside claims that a no-deal Brexit would be easily managed, BoE governor Mark Carney warned: Being ready for financial stability does not mean market stability. Markets will adjust, potentially quite substantially if there is a no-deal Brexit, It also doesn\u2019t mean economic stability. Even with a smooth adjustment it would still be a major economic adjustment, a major economic shock, virtually instantaneously. The Bank fears that open-ended funds are a growing threat to financial stability. It is taking a closer look, following the suspension of redemptions from Neil Woodford\u2019s Equity Income fund. The Bank will work with the Financial Conduct Authority on the review, looking at the risks caused by funds that let investors pull money out immediately despite being backed by assets which are difficult to sell quickly. The mismatch \u201chas the potential to become a systemic issue\u201d according to the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee. The BoE is also pressing banks to face the cost of climate change. Its next stress tests will examine how financial institutions would cope under a range of scenarios. Carney warned that those are prepared for a low-carbon future would thrive; the rest won\u2019t last long. Carney himself twice refused to comment on whether he wants to become the next head of the IMF. He refused to reveal his thoughts until there is a formal vacancy (once Christine Lagarde is confirmed as the next ECB president). Carney, who is due to leave the Bank in January 2020, pledged to ensure an \u201corderly transition\u201d to his successor. He also hopes for an \u201copen, transparent and merit-based\u201d process to replace Lagarde. The Bank also fired a warning shot at Facebook over its plans for a Libra cryptocurrency. Carney said Libra must satisfy regulatory that it is extremely solid, secure and reliable - otherwise it won\u2019t be allowed. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada now believe the Bank of England is likely to cut interest rates this autumn, once Brexit deadlock forces a general election. Just in: core consumer inflation in America has jumped, casting some doubts on expectations that US central bankers are poised to cut interest rates. Core inflation (stripping out volatile factors such as fuel) jumped to 2.1% per year last month, from 2%, meaning it\u2019s now above the Federal Reserve\u2019s inflation target. If inflation is picking up, it could be harder for the Fed to ease monetary policy aggressively. That could disappoint investors, who are thirsty for central bankers to top up the punchbowl with some rate cuts. City of London Corporation Policy Chair Catherine McGuinness has urged politicians in Westminster to heed the Bank of England\u2019s concerns about Brexit: She says a disorderly exit must be avoided: Material risks include the threat of \u2018significant market volatility\u2019, which could cause economic turmoil in the UK and beyond. While the sector is prepared, the worst impacts can only be mitigated, not avoided, by preparation. In addition to industry action, there is a need for government to take steps to prevent cliff-edge damage. \u201cThis should be a wake-up call for Westminster. We are now just over three months away from the next Brexit cliff-edge and the risk of no-deal is drawing dangerously close. As every day passes, the crippling uncertainty that is holding business hostage remains, leaving companies unable to make everyday decisions. This has been demonstrated in recent data covering the services sector. The clock is ticking. Politicians on all sides must now come together to agree a pragmatic solution to Brexit and make avoiding a no-deal Brexit the absolute priority.\u201d The Bank of England\u2019s new climate change stress tests will force banks to take the issue more seriously, says David Strachan, head of Deloitte\u2019s EMEA Centre for Regulatory Strategy: \u201cBanks will need to make some very significant advances in data collection and in their understanding and management of climate change risks, in order to be ready for the 2021 exploratory scenario. For many, this will require them to develop a wholly-new risk discipline.\u201d The Times have written up Mark Carney\u2019s concerns about open-ended funds. They say: Investment firms may be banned from allowing customers to pull out their money with a day\u2019s notice if their underlying assets are difficult to sell, under plans being considered by the Bank of England. Open-ended funds that invest in commercial property such as shopping centres, which can take a year to sell, may have to tell investors that they have to keep their money tied up for about a year. UK political risk has surged in recent years, points out the Bank\u2019s new financial stability report: During the press conference, Mark Carney was asked whether the cost of a no-deal Brexit were \u201cvanishingly inexpensive\u201d, as Boris Johnson breezily claimed this week. The governor suggested not. Even though the banks could withstand a disorderly Brexit, the process could be very volatile. Carney said: Being ready for financial stability does not mean market stability. Markets will adjust, potentially quite substantially if there is a no-deal Brexit, It also doesn\u2019t mean economic stability. Even with a smooth adjustment it would still be a major economic adjustment, a major economic shock, virtually instantaneously. Time for one last question..... Q: Given the important of central bank independence, what do you say to politicians who might judge your successor based on their Brexit views or their closeness to political leaders? Hmmm, ponders Mark Carney, joking ruefully that taking one last question might be a mistake. But it\u2019s too late now, so the BoE governor explains that part of being independent is about not giving advice when you shouldn\u2019t give advice. It\u2019s not my position to give advice. It\u2019s the government\u2019s job to decide who sits on these committees. But Carney then explains why independence is so valuable. Whoever sits in these committees is guided by statutory frameworks. For the Financial Policy Committee, that means identifying risks - and taking action where possible, he outlines. Sometimes that means an uncomfortable message comes out, that a certain domestic policy or international development has a real risk to financial stability. We have a statutory duty to reveal our thinking on that risk, and take action to mitigate that risk where we can. That is the strength of the FPC. My colleague Richard Partington asks Mark Carney about the \u2018tragedy of the horizon\u2019 [where short-term focused companies won\u2019t consider the climate emergency until it\u2019s too late] Q: Is disclosure and stress-testing really adequate to tackle the market failure of the \u2018tragedy of the horizon\u2019? Isn\u2019t it time to use macro-prudential tools, credit guidance, or green QE, as the climate activists outside say? Carney says that climate policy is the solution to the tragedy of the horizon -- carbon pricing, for example, can drag issues into the present day. So if public policy is credible, then the financial sector can play a huge role in driving it - if they have transparent information (which is where disclosure comes in). The system needs to be ready to help (thus the stress-testing). Q: What is your message to political leaders on Brexit, about what still needs to be done? Mark Carney says there is \u201cmore to be done\u201d in terms of creating capacity and infrastructure for Britain\u2019s new trade relations with the EU. Europe is lagging behind on port infrastructure, it appears. In the financial sector, there isn\u2019t adequate protection for certain cross-border derivative contracts. On data, the UK has already recognised EU data laws after Brexit, but the EU has not, even though the rules are the same. That creates a legal risk, which creates an incentive to separate data - which isn\u2019t easy (or always safe). That\u2019s what we know, Carney concludes. But \u201cit\u2019s the things you don\u2019t know that get you in the end\u201d..... Q: Are you satisfied with Deutsche Bank\u2019s restructuring (which is shedding 18,000 jobs). Deputy governor Sam Woods says Deutsche Bank has well-known problems. The BoE welcomes its \u201cambitious plan\u201d, but will work with DB to see how the plan is implemented. Q: The Financial Stability Report mentions Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency - what are your concerns? Mark Carney explains that G7 countries have created a working group to understand Facebook\u2019s proposition, and consider the risks and opportunities. The issues are very broad-based, he warns. 1) It\u2019s either successful or it isn\u2019t. If it\u2019s successful, it becomes systemic. So it\u2019s 5-sigma, it has to be on all the time. It can\u2019t have teething problems. People can\u2019t be losing money. The standards are in a different zipcode than in other forms of technology. 2) The second issue: the actual design of the stable coin. There can\u2019t be any basis risk, or rebalancing risk, to moving money in and out of the coin. That could create speculation in something that has to be absolutely stable. 3) Managing the underlying assets will be a challenge, given the flows in and out. 4) Fundamentally there are issues about money laundering and terrorist financing. Carney\u2019s broad message to Facebook: Libra needs to be right, or regulators won\u2019t let it get near customers: This is not \u2018learn on the job\u2019 stuff. It needs to be rock solid right from the start, or it\u2019s not going to start. Having said all that, the governor also thinks Libra could be valuable to consumers. It is way too expensive and slow to do domestic payments,and far too expensive to send money across borders. So if Libra isn\u2019t the solution to financial exclusion, we need to identify something else that is, he adds. Back to open-ended funds such as Woodford. Q: Are you saying this is the end for funds that promise daily liquidity... and if so, could you actually create the problems you\u2019re trying to solve if investors run to the doors now? Carney says the danger is that investors only learn there\u2019s a problem when there\u2019s a financial shock. Then they all try to cash out, and the market seizes up (as the asset manager simply can\u2019t sell illiquid assets fast enough). [explainer: an illiquid asset could be an office block, or a stake in a private company that can\u2019t be sold on the stock market]. Q: What\u2019s your message to the protesters asking you to do more on climate change, and put your money where your mouth is? Carney defends the Bank\u2019s track record, saying it has taken a lead forcing financial institutions to show their exposure to climate change. This is the TCFD [Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures] rules, which the Bank itself is now following. Now we need a system that can use that data, and manage the move to a climate-neutral future, the governor explains. He says the Bank\u2019s upcoming stress tests will show if banks and other financial companies are resilient enough to survive a range of future scenarios. That will have a huge impact in terms of the preparedness of the system. Then it\u2019s up to politicians (and ultimately the public) to decide where the system is going. My colleague Larry Elliott bowls a tempting delivery at the governor.... Q: Are you interested in becoming the next head of the International Monetary Fund? Mark Carney says it is an \u201cabsolute privilege\u201d to do his current job. He praises Christine Lagarde\u2019s work at the IMF, citing structural changes she\u2019s driven including adding China\u2019s Renminbi to the Special Drawing Rights Basket used by the IMF to fund its work. Carney says we must respect the process. Lagarde has been nominated to be president of the ECB - she is \u201cextremely well-suited\u201d to that role, but she\u2019s not been appointed yet. Once she is, there will be an \u201copen, transparent and merit-based\u201d process to replace her... and that\u2019s the right time to answer that question, he concludes, tucking his bat behind his pad carefully. Mark Carney says the Bank is \u201cdisappointed\u201d that there hasn\u2019t been enough progress globally in tackling open-ended funds. The problem is that they promise instant liquidity, but can\u2019t provide it if investors rush to the exits at once. Carney says the shuttering of Neil Woodford\u2019s Equity Income fund is an investor protection issue, not a financial stability one. But it is symptomatic of a broader problem. Our sense is that the financial stability risks from such funds are increasing, he adds. On Brexit preparations, Carney says UK companies have made \u201creal progress\u201d. But there is still more to do. Some UK exporters are not \u201call the way there\u201d yet. Also, the UK cannot fully insulate itself from financial spillovers from Europe. Onto questions..... Q: Are you really saying that it there is a massive global trade war, and a disorderly Brexit at the same time, the UK banking sector would be strong enough? \u201cThe short answer is yes,\u201d replies governor Mark Carney. The Bank has concluded that commercial banks have enough capital to absorb a disorderly Brexit rather than amplifying it. The scenarios in the UK\u2019s latest bank stress tests are actually more severe than a simultaneous trade war and no-deal Brexit, Carney explains. The banks passed those tests, so they could survive a trade war and no-deal Brexit, even if they occurred at the same time. Q: If that happened, would you rather tackle it from another role, perhaps as head of the IMF? Carney says he will guarantee an \u201corderly transition\u201d to his successor at the Bank of England. I think that\u2019s a pledge not to suddenly quit the Bank. Carney\u2019s term ends in January. IMF chief Christine Lagarde is due to move to the European Central Bank at the start of November, assuming she\u2019s confirmed in October. On the climate emergency, Mark Carney says the companies who adapt to a low-carbon future will thrive, while those which fail will \u201ccease to exist\u201d. He says the Bank\u2019s next stress tests, in 2021, will test companies for their preparation on climate change -- a world first, he declares (see this post for more details). Carney turns to another financial threat -- open-ended funds which invest in illiquid assets. The problem is that fund managers cannot access capital fast enough if too many investors try to redeem their money. This is likely to encourage investors to check out (rather than languish at the back of the queue) creating a \u201cself-reinforcing dynamic\u201d. Anyone with money locked up with Neil Woodfood knows exactly what Carney means. This is a global problem, Carney cautions. Governor Carney is running through the key points we covered earlier -- the UK financial system is ready for a no-deal Brexit, but there would still be major market volatility. Turning to the rest of the world, Carney points out that global business confidence has been hit by worries about a global trade war. Markets are pricing in lower growth rates, and lower corporate profits, he adds. There are reasons to worry, he adds. For example, credit growth in China is growing faster than earnings growth, and emerging markets are vulnerable to capital outflows. Mark Carney begins by pointing out that Brexit is the single most important determinant of the UK\u2019s economic outlook. Material risks still remain, he warns, even though firms are more prepared for Brexit. Carney also warns that there could be disruption to cross-border financial links unless EU regulators do more -- that would hurt EU-based families and businesses, and possibly those in the UK too. The Bank of England is holding a press conference now to discuss the Financial Stability Report. You can watch it online here (unless you\u2019re too busy following the exciting cricket....) Here\u2019s the key message from the Bank of England\u2019s financial stability report (which you can read online here). Bank resilience: Major UK banks and insurers are strong enough to handle a worst-case disorderly Brexit and continue to serve households and businesses. Brexit checklist: The biggest risks of disruption in a worst-case disorderly Brexit to financial services used by UK households and businesses have been addressed. Global outlook: A trade war would damage the global economy at a difficult time. But UK banks are strong enough to keep lending. Climate change: We will test that the UK financial system can handle the risks from climate change and support the transition to a carbon-neutral economy. The Bank of England has outlined plans to test whether the UK financial system can survive the climate emergency. It says it will publish a discussion paper in autumn 2019, and complete full stress tests by 2021. Financial stability risks from climate change arise both from the physical risks associated with the increased frequency of extreme weather events and from the transition to a carbon-neutral economy. This exercise will integrate climate scenarios with macroeconomic and financial system models. It will motivate firms to address data gaps and to develop cutting-edge risk management consistent with a range of possible climate pathways: ranging from early and orderly to late and disruptive. The discussion paper will cover issues such as the coverage of the test, the nature of scenarios considered, the appropriate time horizon and disclosure of results. This will allow the Bank to develop the scenarios in consultation with risk specialists from across the financial sector, climate scientists, other industry experts, and other informed stakeholder groups. The Bank of England points out that Brexit worries have pushed the pound down, and have dragged on stock prices too. It says: Increased Brexit uncertainties have put additional downward pressure on UK forward interest rates and led to a decline in the sterling exchange rate and an underperformance of UK-focused equities. In markets that are particularly dependent on foreign investors \u2013 notably commercial real estate and leveraged lending - investment into the UK was much weaker in 2019 Q1 than in recent years. Earlier this week the pound hit a six-month low against the US dollar (a two-year low, if you ignore an odd market \u2018flash crash\u2019 in January). But the BoE insists that the banks can cope.... even if Donald Trump unleashes a deeper trade war. As the Bank puts it: The UK banking system remains strong enough to continue to lend through the wide range of UK economic and financial shocks that could be associated with Brexit... Even if a protectionist-driven global slowdown were to spill over to the UK at the same time as a worst-case disorderly Brexit, the FPC judges that the core UK banking system would be strong enough to absorb, rather than amplify, the resulting economic shocks. The Bank of England also warns that Britain could suffer \u201csignificant market volatility\u201d in the event of a disorderly Brexit. The Financial Stability Report warns: \u201cFinancial stability is not the same as market stability. Significant volatility and asset price changes are to be expected in a disorderly Brexit.\u201d That\u2019s a warning that we could see some serious turmoil in the stock market, and on the foreign exchanges, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Breaking! The Bank of England believes the UK banking sector is strong enough to withstand a disorderly Brexit, and an intensified trade war. Its latest financial stability report has just been released, showing that the UK\u2019s banks have enough capital to ride out a double-whammy of disruption at home and abroad. The BoE\u2019s Financial Policy Committee says: \u201cThe perceived likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has increased since the start of the year,\u201d \u201cThe UK banking system remains strong enough to continue to lend through the wide range of UK economic and financial shocks that could be associated with Brexit. More to follow... Here\u2019s a photo of a petition card being delivered to the Bank of England (perhaps to one of its pink frock coat-wearing security guards). Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada have predicted that the Bank of England will slash interest rates from 0.75% to 0.5% immediately, if Britain leaves the EU without a deal this autumn. But if Britain leaves with a deal, they think the BoE will sit on its hands for some time.... RBC told clients this morning: In the event of a no-deal Brexit on October 31st, we see an immediate 25bps rate cut, possibly even before the scheduled MPC meeting on November 7th.We further think that immediate response would be followed-up by a further 25bps cut and the restarting of the bank\u2019s QE policy before the end of the year. In the event of a smooth Brexit, therefore, we don\u2019t see the MPC delivering on its current forward guidance but rather see Bank Rate unchanged through 2020. Interestingly, RBC think the most likely outcome is another Brexit delay and a general election - if that happened, it thinks the Bank would cut rates to 0.5%. One protestor is even quoting one of Mark Carney\u2019s recent articles on the climate emergency (we published it here), which called on the financial sector to help tackle the problem. The group are positioned outside the Bank\u2019s offices on Threadneedle Street, in the centre of the City: You can sign the petition urging the Bank of England to help decarbonise the economy and support investment in low-carbon companies and technologies here. The letter recognises that BoE governor Mark Carney has spoken out about the issue -- including in a speech in March, urging governments to deliver coherent and credible policies. But more action is needed to drive the UK\u2019s \u201cgreen transition\u201d. Rather than buying bonds from oil companies, for example, the Bank could help support a Green New Deal by deterring banks from funding environmentally damaging projects. Addressed to Carney, the letter says: Your recent warning about the \u201cdevastating effects\u201d of climate change has provided a much-needed wake-up call to the world\u2019s banks, investors and regulators. It\u2019s brilliant to see you set a powerful example by announcing that the Bank of England will disclose its own climate risk. But we know you can and must go further. You rightly acknowledge that meeting even the modest targets of the Paris Agreement will require a \u201cmassive reallocation of capital\u201d. But this is unlikely to happen unless central banks play a leading role. The demonstrators are chanting \u201cWhose climate? Our climate\u201d outside the Bank: Today\u2019s protests are organised by Positive Money and Fossil Free London, who argue that the climate emergency is a massive threat to financial stability. As such, the Bank should prioritise climate change when assessing the risks to the UK economy and the financial system. That includes using its bond-buying stimulus programme to support green companies, rather than those who pollute the planet and fuel carbon emissions. They explain: The Bank of England rightly recognises that climate change represents a huge risk to financial stability, estimating that it may lead to $20tn in losses - nearly ten times UK GDP. However, while the central bank has made good progress in talking the talk, it has not always walked the walk, continuing to shy away from treating climate change with the same gravity it gives to other risks to financial stability, such as risky mortgage lending. The Bank of England itself has also been culpable in fuelling carbon bubbles, buying bonds in high-carbon companies such as the likes of Shell and BP with money created through its corporate QE programme. Positive Money and Fossil Free London wants the Bank of England\u2019s power to create money to be used in a way that helps rather than hinders the green transition. A group of campaigners have assembled outside the Bank of England, demanding it does more to tackle the climate emergency. They will hand over two A1 postcards signed by hundreds of members of the public during the recent Glastonbury festival, addressed to governor Mark Carney with the text: \u201cWe the undersigned urge you to use the Bank of England\u2019s powers to unleash green investment now!\u201d They have two key demands: That the Bank of England \u2018greens\u2019 its quantitative easing (QE) programme. With speculation mounting that the Bank could undertake more QE in response to a Brexit shock or another recession, the central bank should at the very least rule out asset purchases in high-carbon sectors, if not actively favour bonds which finance green projects That the Bank of England uses all of the powers at its disposal to stop financial firms it regulates pouring more money into fossil fuels. This approach, known as \u2018credit guidance\u2019, could include tools such as differential collateral requirements and targeted refinancing operations My colleague Richard Partington is there (on his way to read the financial stability report), and sent these pictures: Carney, incidentally, was also at Glastonbury, telling the Economist that he enjoyed the Friday night headline slot by grime artist Stormzy. \u201cI very much enjoyed Stormzy. He puts his money where his mouth is in terms of building a more diverse society.\u201d Mohamed A. El-Erian , chief economic adviser at Allianz, explains why today\u2019s financial stability report (released at 10.30am UK time) matters: The oil price has hit its highest level since late May, after three Iranian boats \u201cattempted to impede\u201d a British oil tanker in the Gulf. My colleague Bethan McKernan reports: The incident took place in the strait of Hormuz through which the commercial vessel, British Heritage, was attempting to pass. It comes in the wake of the UK seizure of an Iranian oil tanker last week, for which Tehran had threatened retaliation. \u201cContrary to international law, three Iranian vessels attempted to impede the passage of a commercial vessel, British Heritage, through the strait of Hormuz,\u201d a UK government statement released on Thursday morning said. The British warship, HMS Montrose was \u201cforced to position herself between the Iranian vessels and British Heritage and issue verbal warnings to the Iranian vessels, which then turned away,\u201d the statement said. This has pushed the cost of a barrel of Brent crude oil up to $67.53 per barrel this morning, on fears that supplies from the Middle East could be disrupted. Commodity prices are also rallying, sending palladium up to $1,600 per ounce for the first time since March. Palladium is used in car catalytic converters, so a pick-up in economic demand can push its price higher. Plus, anything priced in dollars can go up when the US currency weakens. The weakness of the dollar is giving sterling some support this morning, pushing the pound back over $1.25 (away from a six-month low). European stocks are also pushing higher, with the Stoxx 600 index gaining 0.3%. In London, house builders are among the top risers after the latest RICS survey of chartered surveyors suggested the market was picking up. America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 stock index surged over the 3,000 point mark for the first time ever yesterday, after Fed chair Jerome Powell signalled that a rate cut is close. Powell\u2019s dovishness has pushed stock markets higher across the globe. Japan\u2019s Nikkei gained 110 points, or 0.5%, to 21,643.53, and there were gains in Hong Kong (+0.7%), South Korea (+1.1%) and India (+0.5%) too. Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at ADSS, says investors believe the Federal Reserve is certain to cut borrowing costs at its next meeting. A July rate cut seems set in stone as Powell cites geopolitical uncertainties and global growth slowdown as the reasons why an easier policy will help sustain the expansion domestically. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. These are difficult times for the UK economy, with Brexit unresolved, the eurozone struggling, the global economy slowing and trade tensions on a knife-edge. So the Bank of England\u2019s latest financial stability report, released this morning, will show whether policymakers are getting more anxious that the next financial crisis is looming The report will assess the stability of the UK financial system, and outline what the Bank is doing to remove or reduce any risks to it. The BoE will also release its Systemic Risk Survey Results, showing what investors are particularly worried about. This is the final risk assessment before 31 October, the current Brexit date, so investors will be keen to hear the Bank\u2019s views. Mark Carney will face a grilling from the press at 11am. UK issues will obviously dominate, but the BoE governor may also be asked about his own prospects -- is he hoping to replace Christine Lagarde at the head of the International Monetary Fund? Traders, meanwhile, are pushing asset prices higher as they anticipate a US interest rate cut later this month. Yesterday, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell told Congress that America\u2019s economy was suffering from a weakening global economy and rising trade tensions, a cue that policymakers will ease conditions soon. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyst at London Capital Group, explains: The US dollar gave back gains on a sharp move after the Federal Reserve (Fed) Governor Jerome Powell has been very clear that the global economic slowdown outweighs the encouraging data in the US at his speech before the congress on Wednesday. Powell\u2019s testimony gave yet another solid sign that the Fed is preparing to cut the interest rates in July. In the wake of Powell\u2019s first day of testimony, the market sees a 25-basis-point cut as largely granted That weakened the dollar, and drove Wall Street to a record high last night. European stock markets are expected to rise this morning, pushing Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 towards an 11-month high. Powell is back on Capitol Hill later today to take questions from the Senate, so could double-down on his dovish message. We also get new US inflation and unemployment data.

      "body": "<p>The family of a prominent politician who took his own life after being sacked amid allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour have called for an apology from the former Welsh first minister after a coroner ruled no official support was put in place for him.</p> <p>At the conclusion of Carl Sargeant\u2019s inquest, the coroner John Gittins said he would write to the Welsh government warning that there could be more deaths unless better support was provided for high-profile figures when they were sacked.</p> <p>But outside court Sargeant\u2019s family focused their attention on the role of the former Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones, accusing him of letting his friend and colleague down and failing to show remorse.</p> <p>Sargeant\u2019s son, Jack, who has succeeded his father as assembly member for Alyn and Deeside in north Wales, said: \u201cWe are deeply offended by the lack of any remorse or regret from the former first minister. We very much hope that the former first minister will now come forward with a genuine apology.\u201d</p> <p>Jack Sargeant added: \u201cI do feel that dad was let down by Carwyn Jones. Carwyn Jones said on the stand he was a friend. I can\u2019t see myself letting down a friend the way he let down his.\u201d</p> <p>The family criticised discrepancies in the evidence Jones gave during the nine-day inquest and expressed frustration that Jones\u2019s legal bills have been paid by the public purse while they have been forced to eat into savings to fight their cause.</p> <p>Neil Hudgell, solicitor for the family, said: \u201cWe have seen a puppet master that has used the public purse to pursue his own ends without any regard for wider mental health considerations.\u201d</p> <p>Calling for changes in the way people are supported after accusations have been levelled, Sargeant\u2019s widow, Bernie, said: \u201cWe never want this to happen to another person involved in politics or any other walk of life. There has got to be some safeguarding whatever your profession.\u201d</p> <p>Carl Sargeant, 49, was found hanged at his home in north Wales on 7 November 2017, four days after he was sacked from his job as cabinet secretary for communities and children. The inquest was told he had suffered from mental health problems and was vulnerable.</p> <p>The inquest in Ruthin, north Wales, heard that Sargeant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/09/carl-sargeant-shellshocked-after-sacking-widow-tells-inquest\">felt \u201cshellshocked\u201d and \u201cdestroyed\u201d</a> after his sacking. His family claims there was no support for him and he was left in limbo, not able to defend himself because he did not have details of the claims against him pending a full investigation. Bernie Sargeant said he insisted he was innocent and that she believed him.</p> <p>As he began delivering his conclusions, Gittins told the court: \u201cThe twists and turns of the journey at times along the murkiest paths into the world of politics has been a challenge.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone hoping for a glowing vindication of Carl Sargeant or a damning vilification of Carwyn Jones, or indeed vice versa, will be sorely disappointed.\u201d</p> <p>The coroner said the truth of the allegations against Sargeant had not formed any part of his investigation. But he said: \u201cThe absence \u2026 of those allegations at this inquest should in no way be seen as a diminution of the seriousness of these matters.\u201d Gittins accepted it was right for Jones not to give details of the allegations made against Sargeant or the identities of his accusers.</p> <p>During the inquest Jones was accused by the Sargeant family of lying under oath over the care provided to Sargeant. Gittins said Jones\u2019s evidence was contradictory, but accepted Jones had \u201cerred\u201d and properly corrected his error.</p> <p>However, the coroner said: \u201cNo official arrangements were put into place by way of seeking to provide support to Carl Sargeant despite the probability that the first minister knew of Mr Sargeant\u2019s vulnerability in relation to his mental health, and that it is likely that the removal and particularly the reason for the removal would generate significant media interest.\u201d The coroner said he did not feel that Sargeant had received \u201cpastoral\u201d care.</p> <p>Gittins said he had heard from the Labour party that changes had been made to its safeguarding procedures and the new Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said he would created an aide-memoire for himself to use when sacking ministers in the future. But the coroner expressed concern that Drakeford said he could not compel future first ministers to follow his lead.</p> <p>Gittins also recalled an exchange he had with Jones during the inquest when they discussed the level of support that might have been given. Jones had asked: \u201cWhere does it end?\u201d the coroner replied: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t end because we\u2019re talking about people\u2019s lives. It cannot end. It\u2019s not a matter of law or duty of care, it\u2019s a matter of humanity, that\u2019s the responsibility of us all.\u201d</p> <p>On the court steps, Jack Sargeant said: \u201cWe recognise the \u2018murkiness\u2019 the coroner referred to in his summing up. It\u2019s been a thoroughly distressing and dehumanising process that has added to our heartbreak.\u201d</p> <p>The family were angry when Jones\u2019s legal team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/10/misconduct-evidence-is-irrelevant-says-coroner-at-carl-sargeant-inquest\">tried to argue that evidence about allegations against Carl Sargeant should be aired</a>.</p> <p>Jack Sargeant said: \u201cAt times it seems to have been forgotten that this was an inquest into the death of a dearly beloved husband, father, son and brother. Instead it has felt more like a criminal trial. All too often politics have been at play with the sole aim of blackening a dead man\u2019s name to protect another. Where has been the humanity in that?</p> <p>\u201cWe sincerely hope that no political family will go through what we have been through these past 19 months. It\u2019s too late for Dad but may save someone else. We hope that political parties and governments across the union take note and make it policy for safeguarding measures to be in place for all public servants.\u201d</p> <p>Jones issued a statement in which he said: \u201cThis has been a difficult time for everyone, the family most of all and I offer them my deepest condolences for a loss that is inevitably still incredibly painful.</p> <p>\u201cThe nature of these proceedings has meant that there appeared to be two sides in this matter, and whilst it is right that arguments are tested, the process has driven an unnatural wedge between people who remain united at the very least in their ongoing shock, trauma and grief. Nobody wanted this, and nobody could have foreseen it. Suicide is a shattering experience, and I hope some healing can now begin.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Drakeford said: \u201cI extend my deepest condolences to the Sargeant family. I know they continue to grieve for Carl. The coroner has made a regulation 28 report [to prevent future deaths] to the Welsh government in relation to the prevention of future deaths and we will consider this carefully and respond in full.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

As he began delivering his conclusions, Gittins told the court: \u201cThe twists and turns of the journey at times along the murkiest paths into the world of politics has been a challenge. \u201cAnyone hoping for a glowing vindication of Carl Sargeant or a damning vilification of Carwyn Jones, or indeed vice versa, will be sorely disappointed.\u201d The coroner said the truth of the allegations against Sargeant had not formed any part of his investigation. But he said: \u201cThe absence \u2026 of those allegations at this inquest should in no way be seen as a diminution of the seriousness of these matters.\u201d Gittins accepted it was right for Jones not to give details of the allegations made against Sargeant or the identities of his accusers. During the inquest Jones was accused by the Sargeant family of lying under oath over the care provided to Sargeant. Gittins said Jones\u2019s evidence was contradictory, but accepted Jones had \u201cerred\u201d and properly corrected his error. However, the coroner said: \u201cNo official arrangements were put into place by way of seeking to provide support to Carl Sargeant despite the probability that the first minister knew of Mr Sargeant\u2019s vulnerability in relation to his mental health, and that it is likely that the removal and particularly the reason for the removal would generate significant media interest.\u201d The coroner said he did not feel that Sargeant had received \u201cpastoral\u201d care. Gittins said he had heard from the Labour party that changes had been made to its safeguarding procedures and the new Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said he would created an aide-memoire for himself to use when sacking ministers in the future. But the coroner expressed concern that Drakeford said he could not compel future first ministers to follow his lead. Gittins also recalled an exchange he had with Jones during the inquest when they discussed the level of support that might have been given. Jones had asked: \u201cWhere does it end?\u201d the coroner replied: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t end because we\u2019re talking about people\u2019s lives. It cannot end. It\u2019s not a matter of law or duty of care, it\u2019s a matter of humanity, that\u2019s the responsibility of us all.\u201d On the court steps, Jack Sargeant said: \u201cWe recognise the \u2018murkiness\u2019 the coroner referred to in his summing up. It\u2019s been a thoroughly distressing and dehumanising process that has added to our heartbreak.\u201d The family were angry when Jones\u2019s legal team tried to argue that evidence about allegations against Carl Sargeant should be aired. Jack Sargeant said: \u201cAt times it seems to have been forgotten that this was an inquest into the death of a dearly beloved husband, father, son and brother. Instead it has felt more like a criminal trial. All too often politics have been at play with the sole aim of blackening a dead man\u2019s name to protect another. Where has been the humanity in that? \u201cWe sincerely hope that no political family will go through what we have been through these past 19 months. It\u2019s too late for Dad but may save someone else. We hope that political parties and governments across the union take note and make it policy for safeguarding measures to be in place for all public servants.\u201d Jones issued a statement in which he said: \u201cThis has been a difficult time for everyone, the family most of all and I offer them my deepest condolences for a loss that is inevitably still incredibly painful. \u201cThe nature of these proceedings has meant that there appeared to be two sides in this matter, and whilst it is right that arguments are tested, the process has driven an unnatural wedge between people who remain united at the very least in their ongoing shock, trauma and grief. Nobody wanted this, and nobody could have foreseen it. Suicide is a shattering experience, and I hope some healing can now begin.\u201d A spokesperson for Drakeford said: \u201cI extend my deepest condolences to the Sargeant family. I know they continue to grieve for Carl. The coroner has made a regulation 28 report [to prevent future deaths] to the Welsh government in relation to the prevention of future deaths and we will consider this carefully and respond in full.\u201d \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

They have been replaced with a message reading: \u201cThank you guys for all your messages. Ramz is in the right hands getting the support he needs. From Mum &amp; Management\u201d. Rochester broke through in 2017 with his track Barking, which went on to reach No 2 in the UK charts in January 2018. It was also a hit across Europe, especially in Germany, where it reached No 4. A follow up single later that year, Family Tree, reached No 35 in the UK. UK rappers including Wiley, Dappy, Ghetts and Chip all left messages of support for Rochester, the latter posting on Instagram: \u201cActive Boyz all here for u my g ... football as per on your return. Be strong. You will be fine. I pray you\u2019re ok fam. KEEP \u2019TRONG!!!\u201d Rochester was due to perform at Splash festival in Germany this week, but has now been removed from the lineup. The Guardian has contacted his management for any further details. \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

      "bodyText": "Shortly after the 1979 Iranian revolution, the country\u2019s national newspapers published a joint subpoena, unique in film history. All the key stars of \u201cfilmfarsi\u201d \u2013 a form of popular cinema that embodied the aspirations and illusions of a modernising society \u2013 were summoned to the revolutionary court. The careers of hundreds of actors and directors ended overnight. Unlike the Hollywood blacklisting of the McCarthy era, there was not even the opportunity for a mock hearing. The cinema, seen as emblematic of corruption, \u201cwestoxification\u201d and the decadence of the ousted Pahlavi regime, was consigned to oblivion. So marked the end of one of the most thriving film industries in the Middle East, a cinema of song and dance, sex and seduction, violence and vengeance, which combined the western genres with local flavour \u2013 although always with an eye on Shia Islam, as the ultimate code to put everything in its right order. Iranian cinema was anything but limited to poetry and humanism, although both elements existed in some of the pre-revolutionary arthouse films. Millions of filmgoers cared more about a good pop song, the latest tearjerker and a car chase through the streets of Tehran. Cinema was introduced to the country as the exclusive toy of the Qajar kings. Sporadic efforts to create a national cinema were interrupted by the allied occupation of neutral Iran during the second world war.

That may be the most effective way of keeping the big-screen experience alive in 2019 \u2013 but it feels a hollow victory. Disney, of course, is hardly alone in this philosophy: it just has it worked out more consistently than its hit-and-miss rival studios.</p> <p>Yet as long as Disney maintains its box-office stranglehold \u2013 and you have to go back to 2014 for a year in which it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_in_film\" title=\"\">didn\u2019t top the annual chart</a> \u2013 it will be regarded as the principal architect of an ever more uniform and homogeneous popular cinema. In March, Disney subsumed one of its most venerable rivals, completing its $71bn (\u00a357bn) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/20/disney-seals-71bn-deal-for-21st-century-fox-as-it-prepares-to-take-on-netflix\" title=\"\">acquisition of 21st Century Fox</a>, a deal that makes its 2009 purchase of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/aug/31/disney-marvel-buy-out\" title=\"\">Marvel Entertainment</a> for \u00a32.5bn look ever more of a bargain.</p> <p>Save for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/04/spider-man-far-from-home-discuss-with-spoilers\" title=\"\">Spider-Man</a> franchise \u2013 still owned by Sony \u2013 Disney and Marvel\u2019s brands are now thoroughly and lucratively intermeshed, both commercially and aesthetically. Now, having shaken off the embarrassment of inherited duds such as Dark Phoenix, Disney will be aiming for similar synthesis with such upcoming Fox heavy-hitters as Steven Spielberg\u2019s remake of West Side Story and, of course, James Cameron\u2019s looming trail of Avatar sequels.</p> <p>This kind of Hollywood imperialism is not encouraging news if you fear that reduced competition begets reduced creativity, even as Disney\u2019s substantial fanbase \u2013 umbilically bound by the childhood nostalgia in which the corporation trades \u2013 zealously cheers it on.

It could well be that the film\u2019s a mess and the planned reshoots are justified. Still, it\u2019s hard not to speculate that Disney has its own firm ideas of what kind of storytelling its viewers want \u2013 and as long as it holds all the box-office receipts, it will be awfully hard to argue with.</p> <p>\u2022 Guy Lodge writes a weekly film column for the Observer New Review and is the chief UK film critic for Variety</p>",

(In this year\u2019s list of top 10 US grossers, Jordan Peele\u2019s very adult horror invention Us stands as a lone alien object in a sea of established properties.) \u201cI believe in being an innovator,\u201d Walt Disney once said, though he reckoned without the challenges of today\u2019s cinema market, in which giving the people what they want amounts to giving them characters and stories they already know. That may be the most effective way of keeping the big-screen experience alive in 2019 \u2013 but it feels a hollow victory. Disney, of course, is hardly alone in this philosophy: it just has it worked out more consistently than its hit-and-miss rival studios. Yet as long as Disney maintains its box-office stranglehold \u2013 and you have to go back to 2014 for a year in which it didn\u2019t top the annual chart \u2013 it will be regarded as the principal architect of an ever more uniform and homogeneous popular cinema. In March, Disney subsumed one of its most venerable rivals, completing its $71bn (\u00a357bn) acquisition of 21st Century Fox, a deal that makes its 2009 purchase of Marvel Entertainment for \u00a32.5bn look ever more of a bargain. Save for the Spider-Man franchise \u2013 still owned by Sony \u2013 Disney and Marvel\u2019s brands are now thoroughly and lucratively intermeshed, both commercially and aesthetically. Now, having shaken off the embarrassment of inherited duds such as Dark Phoenix, Disney will be aiming for similar synthesis with such upcoming Fox heavy-hitters as Steven Spielberg\u2019s remake of West Side Story and, of course, James Cameron\u2019s looming trail of Avatar sequels. This kind of Hollywood imperialism is not encouraging news if you fear that reduced competition begets reduced creativity, even as Disney\u2019s substantial fanbase \u2013 umbilically bound by the childhood nostalgia in which the corporation trades \u2013 zealously cheers it on. What other acquisitions are on its wishlist? Are we seeing a return to the rigidly controlled Hollywood studio system of the 1940s and 1950s \u2013 only with one studio effectively as the system? If so, a movement not dissimilar to the demands to break up big tech currently rippling towards Silicon Valley might be in order. Yet Disney has rather cunningly advertised itself less as one monopolising entity than as a contrasting collective of minds and voices, as tellingly suggested by distribution president Cathleen Taff\u2019s statement before unveiling its 2019-2022 release calendar: \u201cWe\u2019re excited to put in place a robust and diverse slate that lays the foundation of our long-term strategy, bringing together a breadth of films from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, Fox, Fox Searchlight and Blue Sky Studios to create an extraordinary collection of cinematic experiences for audiences around the world.\u201d So, one big happy family, then. Will Fox and Fox Searchlight \u2013 the Oscar-favoured independent force behind such distinctly un-Disneyish art films as The Favourite and Terrence Malick\u2019s upcoming A Hidden Life \u2013 continue as before, simply adding a more refined, adult-skewing string to Disney\u2019s bow? Perhaps, though this week brought the surprising announcement that one of Fox\u2019s glossiest autumn prospects \u2013 The Woman in the Window, Joe Wright\u2019s Amy Adams-starring adaptation of the Dan Mallory bestseller \u2013 has been pushed back to 2020 by Disney after it expressed concern over \u201cconfused\u201d test screening audiences. It could well be that the film\u2019s a mess and the planned reshoots are justified. Still, it\u2019s hard not to speculate that Disney has its own firm ideas of what kind of storytelling its viewers want \u2013 and as long as it holds all the box-office receipts, it will be awfully hard to argue with. \u2022 Guy Lodge writes a weekly film column for the Observer New Review and is the chief UK film critic for Variety",

      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel sat through the German and Danish national anthems during a ceremony welcoming Denmark\u2019s prime minister to Berlin. The German chancellor reportedly requested the change in protocol a day after she was seen shaking in public for the third time in as many weeks. Merkel appeared calm as she and the new Danish leader, Mette Frederiksen, took seats on white upholstered chairs on the red carpet during military honours outside the chancellery in Berlin. The chancellor remained still throughout the hymns, moving only to smile and nod at her visitor. A report in the Bild newspaper suggested Merkel had asked for a change to the protocol in which the leaders would normally stand through the ceremony. A day earlier, Merkel was seen trembling while standing at the same location as she welcomed the Finnish prime minister, Antti Rinne. Afterwards, the chancellor, who intends to step down by 2021, said she was \u201cdoing fine\u201d and indicated she believed the cause of the shaking bouts was at least partly psychological. The latest episode, which appeared to stop when Merkel moved, was thought to be less serious than previous bouts. The 64-year-old was seen moving uncontrollably during military honours for the visiting Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in blazing heat on 18 June. \u201cI am going through a phase of processing the recent military honours with President Zelenskiy,\u201d Merkel said on Wednesday. \u201cThis appears not to be quite finished yet, but I am making progress and will have to live with it for a while.\u201d After the initial bout, she blamed dehydration, later claiming she recovered after a drink of water. But a week later she had a similar episode in more comfortable weather while appearing with the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, at the Bellevue Palace in Berlin.

He served as an assembly member for more than 14 years. A <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-41904460\">gregarious and popular politician</a>, he had worked as chief whip for the Labour administration and at the time of his death in November 2017 was the cabinet secretary for communities and children.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/11/carl-sargeant-inquest-coroner-raises-concerns-about-support-from-welsh-government\">Carl Sargeant case coroner concerned about support for sacked ministers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sargeant campaigned passionately against domestic violence. He had also harboured ambitions of becoming first minister. He was married to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/21/carl-sargeants-widow-i-thought-we-would-be-treated-with-respect\">Bernie Sargeant</a>, whom he had met in the Labour club in their home town of Connah\u2019s Quay, and they had two children, Lucy and Jack. Few knew he had mental health issues. To relax, he watched football, and also loved crocheting. At the time of his death he was making a dress for Bernie.</p> <h2><strong>Was his position in the Welsh government secure?</strong></h2> <p>Friends have said Sargeant began to feel worried about his position in the months before his death. But the then first minister, Carwyn Jones, has said that in October 2017 he was pencilling him in for the job of leader of the house.</p> <h2><strong>What were the allegations against him?</strong></h2> <p>In 2014 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/28/allegations-against-carl-sargeant-could-not-be-ignored-inquest-hears\">Jones received an anonymous letter</a> from someone claiming to be a Labour party member alleging Sargeant was \u201cnot fit to be around women\u201d. Jones warned Sargeant to be careful about his conduct and to temper his drinking. In May 2016 Jones said he was told by the then general secretary of Welsh Labour, David Hagendyk, that a woman, Ms C, had come forward to make complaints about Sargeant. She did not wish the matter to be pursued but wanted Jones to know. Jones said he did not speak to Sargeant as it would risk exposing the complainant.</p> <h2><strong>Did more allegations emerge?</strong></h2> <p>In October 2017 Jones\u2019s senior special adviser, Matt Greenough, told the first minister of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/27/welsh-first-minister-carwyn-jones-furious-when-carl-sargeant-went-public-over-sacking\">rumours of inappropriate behaviour</a> by Sargeant towards two women. It came at the height of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/20/women-worldwide-use-hashtag-metoo-against-sexual-harassment\">#MeToo movement</a>. Jones said he was not prepared to act on rumours but a few days later Hagendyk, who by then had left his role as general secretary, phoned Greenough and gave him the names of the women, referred to later as Ms A and Ms B.</p> <p>The alleged incidents involved \u201cunwelcome attention, inappropriate touching or groping\u201d and were said to have taken place in the summer of 2017. Neither Jones nor his advisers spoke to Sargeant to hear his side. By the start of November one of the women had made a written statement and Jones decided he had no choice but to sack Sargeant.</p> <h2><strong>Have there been any other </strong><strong>claims?</strong></h2> <p>During the inquest the existence emerged of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/09/carl-sargeant-texts-will-not-be-heard-at-inquest-high-court-rules\">text messages</a> between two Labour councillors that suggested Sargeant had done something that could have resulted in a prison sentence. It was also revealed that another anonymous letter had been written after Sargeant was supposedly seen with a woman in a pub garden. There was also talk during the inquest of an alleged incident at a wedding reception.</p> <p>Earlier this year Jones told the Guardian that a total of nine women had come forward to make allegations against Sargeant. Bernie Sargeant has said she believes he was innocent of all allegations. The family believe there have been attempts to slur Sargeant after his death. The coroner, John Gittins, described the allegations that surfaced in the texts and the pub garden and wedding claims as \u201crumour, multiple hearsay and speculation\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>How did the sacking take place?</strong></h2> <p>The dismissal was swift. Sargeant was called into Jones\u2019s office in Cardiff on Friday 3 November 2017 and told during a 10-minute meeting that he was sacked. Jones did not give details of the allegations, pending an investigation. Two hours later Sargeant was suspended by the Labour party, again pending an investigation.</p> <h2><strong>How did Sargeant</strong><strong> react</strong><strong> to his dismissal?</strong></h2> <p>Bernie Sargeant said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/09/carl-sargeant-shellshocked-after-sacking-widow-tells-inquest\">he was shellshocked, destroyed</a>. He told his family and a staff member he had let them down. His widow and children believe he meant they would face pressure from the media rather than because he had actually done anything wrong. His family argue he was cut off from his beloved Labour party and had been prejudged. They say he was devastated that he could not defend himself because he did not know the detail of the allegations and was very upset when a BBC reporter doorstepped him at the family home. He was found dead four days after his dismissal.</p> <h2><strong>Was any pastoral care put in place for Sargeant?</strong></h2> <p>Little, if any. A Labour assembly member, Ann Jones, was asked to stay in touch with Sargeant over that weekend, the inquest heard, but there was no formal support system for sacked ministers. Carwyn Jones told the inquest that politics was a \u201cbrutal business\u201d and asked rhetorically during the hearing whether police officers had a duty of care to someone who had been arrested and named, adding: \u201cWhere does it end?\u201d Gittins replied: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t end, we\u2019re talking about people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Has </strong><strong>Carwyn Jones\u2019s image been tarnished?</strong></h2> <p>Jones was accused in court by the Sargeant family\u2019s barrister of lying under oath over what measures had been put in place for his colleague after he was sacked. Jones said he mistakenly gave misleading evidence and did not lie. Jones was also criticised in court over a television interview the day before Sargeant died in which he described the claims against him as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/26/carl-sargeant-inquest-north-wales-sacking\">\u201cincidents\u201d rather than </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/26/carl-sargeant-inquest-north-wales-sacking\">allegations</a>. Sargeant\u2019s family and supporters say this fuelled his despair. Jones remains the assembly member for Bridgend. Sargeant\u2019s family are angry at what they see as a lack of contrition. Jones has always maintained that he acted correctly over Sargeant\u2019s dismissal. He has said he could not give more details to Sargeant as this could have identified the women allegedly involved. He has also said he felt it was not appropriate for him to contact Sargeant personally after the sacking.</p> <p>He has said he could not give more details to Sargeant as this could have identified the women allegedly involved.

      "bodyText": "Who was Carl Sargeant? Carl Sargeant rose from the factory floor in north Wales to the corridors of power in the Welsh government. He served as an assembly member for more than 14 years. A gregarious and popular politician, he had worked as chief whip for the Labour administration and at the time of his death in November 2017 was the cabinet secretary for communities and children. Sargeant campaigned passionately against domestic violence. He had also harboured ambitions of becoming first minister. He was married to Bernie Sargeant, whom he had met in the Labour club in their home town of Connah\u2019s Quay, and they had two children, Lucy and Jack. Few knew he had mental health issues. To relax, he watched football, and also loved crocheting. At the time of his death he was making a dress for Bernie. Was his position in the Welsh government secure? Friends have said Sargeant began to feel worried about his position in the months before his death. But the then first minister, Carwyn Jones, has said that in October 2017 he was pencilling him in for the job of leader of the house. What were the allegations against him? In 2014 Jones received an anonymous letter from someone claiming to be a Labour party member alleging Sargeant was \u201cnot fit to be around women\u201d. Jones warned Sargeant to be careful about his conduct and to temper his drinking. In May 2016 Jones said he was told by the then general secretary of Welsh Labour, David Hagendyk, that a woman, Ms C, had come forward to make complaints about Sargeant. She did not wish the matter to be pursued but wanted Jones to know. Jones said he did not speak to Sargeant as it would risk exposing the complainant. Did more allegations emerge? In October 2017 Jones\u2019s senior special adviser, Matt Greenough, told the first minister of rumours of inappropriate behaviour by Sargeant towards two women. It came at the height of the #MeToo movement. Jones said he was not prepared to act on rumours but a few days later Hagendyk, who by then had left his role as general secretary, phoned Greenough and gave him the names of the women, referred to later as Ms A and Ms B. The alleged incidents involved \u201cunwelcome attention, inappropriate touching or groping\u201d and were said to have taken place in the summer of 2017. Neither Jones nor his advisers spoke to Sargeant to hear his side. By the start of November one of the women had made a written statement and Jones decided he had no choice but to sack Sargeant. Have there been any other claims? During the inquest the existence emerged of text messages between two Labour councillors that suggested Sargeant had done something that could have resulted in a prison sentence. It was also revealed that another anonymous letter had been written after Sargeant was supposedly seen with a woman in a pub garden. There was also talk during the inquest of an alleged incident at a wedding reception. Earlier this year Jones told the Guardian that a total of nine women had come forward to make allegations against Sargeant. Bernie Sargeant has said she believes he was innocent of all allegations. The family believe there have been attempts to slur Sargeant after his death. The coroner, John Gittins, described the allegations that surfaced in the texts and the pub garden and wedding claims as \u201crumour, multiple hearsay and speculation\u201d. How did the sacking take place? The dismissal was swift. Sargeant was called into Jones\u2019s office in Cardiff on Friday 3 November 2017 and told during a 10-minute meeting that he was sacked. Jones did not give details of the allegations, pending an investigation. Two hours later Sargeant was suspended by the Labour party, again pending an investigation. How did Sargeant react to his dismissal? Bernie Sargeant said he was shellshocked, destroyed. He told his family and a staff member he had let them down. His widow and children believe he meant they would face pressure from the media rather than because he had actually done anything wrong. His family argue he was cut off from his beloved Labour party and had been prejudged. They say he was devastated that he could not defend himself because he did not know the detail of the allegations and was very upset when a BBC reporter doorstepped him at the family home.

Jones was accused in court by the Sargeant family\u2019s barrister of lying under oath over what measures had been put in place for his colleague after he was sacked. Jones said he mistakenly gave misleading evidence and did not lie. Jones was also criticised in court over a television interview the day before Sargeant died in which he described the claims against him as \u201cincidents\u201d rather than allegations.

The only downside, the write-up notes, is the price. Despite Veyrat\u2019s anger at being accused of using cheddar, no mention is made in the guide of the variety of cheese used in the souffle. The Michelin Guide has its roots in the late 19th century, when brothers Andre and Edouard Michelin founded their tyre company and decided to produce a reference for motorists, filled with information for their trips. By the 1920s, the red book featured write-ups of of hotels and restaurants, which were reviewed anonymously by a team of mystery diners. The star ratings were introduced in 1926, with the hierarchy of zero, one, two and three stars brought in five years later.",

      "bodyText": "The first company to drill for shale gas in the UK plans to restart fracking at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire in a last-ditch effort to convince policymakers to relax safety rules. Cuadrilla will drill a second well near Blackpool after it was forced to abandon the first, which caused multiple earth tremors. It plans to remobilise its drilling and fracking equipment within the coming months to test gas flows from the site before its permission expires in November. Francis Egan, the company\u2019s chief executive, plans to use the data to convince the government and regulators to loosen the safety rules that have slowed the progress of the UK shale industry. He said the work could help to make a case for the UK\u2019s controversial shale ambitions by proving that the Bowland Shale region offers a \u201chugely exciting opportunity for the UK\u201d. Cuadrilla has struggled to convince the public among growing opposition to shale gas exploration and protests by environmental campaigners. Fracking involves pumping high-pressure water, sand and various chemicals into tightly packed shale rock formations. The process fractures the rocks and releases the gas contained within the shale layers. Egan said it was no secret that Cuadrilla had asked for the \u201cexceedingly low\u201d tolerance for earth tremors to be lifted. \u201cIt remains the case that we are the only UK operator currently able to move forward and provide more data to support an expert review of this threshold \u2013 and we intend to do so,\u201d he said. Ineos, the chemicals giant owned by the billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, has an extensive portfolio of shale sites across North and South Yorkshire, the East Midlands and Cheshire. However, Britain\u2019s richest man has been unable to move ahead with plans for Ineos to become the UK\u2019s largest fracking firm because of opposition from local councils. Ratcliffe accused the government of \u201cplaying politics with the future of the country\u201d by refusing to relax its earth tremor rules. He said the policies would cause an \u201cenergy crisis\u201d and \u201cirreparable damage\u201d to the economy. Egan warned last year that commercial shale gas fracking could not go ahead in the UK unless rules on minor earthquakes were relaxed. Cuadrilla was repeatedly forced to suspend its work at the Preston New Road site after the government\u2019s safety limits for earth tremors were breached on multiple occasions. The rules call for an immediate halt if frackers trigger an earthquake measuring a magnitude of 0.5 or higher, which is common when fracturing the Earth\u2019s shale layers to release gas. Natascha Engel stepped down as the UK\u2019s first shale gas commissioner after only six months in April, blaming the \u201cridiculous\u201d regulations for hobbling the industry. The energy minister, Claire Perry, said last October there were no plans for a review after the Guardian revealed that the government was considering looser rules once the industry matures. Since then she has said it would be a \u201cfoolish politician\u201d who relaxed the regulations. The government has legislated new climate targets to cut emissions from the economy to net zero by 2050 and hopes to host the UN\u2019s next milestone climate talks next year. Cuadrilla said that even the government\u2019s official climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, expect the UK to continue using gas by 2050 alongside carbon capture technology. It argues that it would be better for the UK to have its own gas reserves than to import the gas from overseas. Jamie Peters, a campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cFundamentally, at a time when the government have declared a climate emergency, the last thing we should be doing is starting an industry that extracts gas \u2014 a fossil fuel, along with coal and oil, that should be left where it is. \u201cFracking just isn\u2019t viable and investment in renewables and energy efficiency is clearly the answer.\u201d",

The shadow of Yes Minister\u2019s Sir Humphrey falls long and deep. If a politician of any colour feels their cherished policies are going nowhere, it\u2019s easy to characterise officials as progress-blocking, self-serving stuffed shirts.</p> <p>It happened under the coalition government, as David Normington, former civil service commissioner, notes. Between 2010 and 2015, the then minister for the Cabinet Office \u201cwas frequently at odds with, and publicly critical of, the senior civil service. Significantly he was not reined in by the then prime minister.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/05/jeremy-corbyn-and-the-real-civil-service\">Jeremy Corbyn and the real civil service | Letter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Quite so. In fact, David Cameron himself attacked the civil service, while Lord Kerslake, head of the civil service for two turbulent years, was the subject of almost constant off-the-record critical briefings \u2013 so much so that when he underwent a major back operation in the summer of 2014, he tweeted about a \u201cpretty big knife in the back!\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2014/sep/26/universal-credit-undeliverable-says-former-head-of-the-civil-service\">When he stepped down</a> that September, Kerslake said \u201cnoises off\u201d \u2013 briefings against civil servants \u2013 had been the most damaging thing to civil service morale.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a big and frightening difference between the treatment of Kerslake and what has been going on since the referendum in 2016. Kerslake received only verbal abuse, however unpleasant. When Jon Thompson, the head of at HM Revenue and Customs, gave his considered, professional advice that the the post-Brexit customs option preferred by Brexiters would cost up to \u00a320bn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/11/tax-chief-received-death-threats-over-brexit-cost-estimate\">he received death threats so serious that he had to change his route to work</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe have had to literally change how I travel and what my personal security is.

But, as Rutter points out, Brexiters\u2019 distrust in the civil service reached its apogee in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/sep/05/pmqs-theresa-may-corbyn-brexit-due-to-make-surprise-statement-to-mps-after-first-pmqs-of-autumn-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-5b8fdd45e4b0915580ddd075\">September 2018</a>, when MP Richard Drax asked Robbins whether he believed that leaving the EU is a good thing. \u201cYou personally, in your heart, are you right behind us in every single sense of that?\u201d</p> <p>Robbins batted that question away \u2013 and is now departing the service altogether. Kerslake says the frequent attacks on Robbins and other senior civil servants are pernicious. He wants a public campaign to recognise and celebrate the enormous importance of having an impartial civil service. That\u2019s unlikely in an atmosphere where Nigel Farage appears to be calling for the removal \u2013 really? \u2013 of all members of the civil service and the military who don\u2019t \u201cbelieve\u201d in Brexit. It\u2019s a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of an impartial civil service, argues an increasingly despairing and furious Penman.</p> <p>Civil servants, bound by the civil service code of neutrality, cannot speak up for themselves. There are arguments that these times are so turbulent that rules should be overridden. In the meantime, Penman is trying to articulate the value of an impartial civil service at a time when, he says, the tectonic plates are shifting in how many civil servants will look at their relationship with ministers.</p>",

Rutter, now programme director at the Institute for Government thinktank, highlights the decision-making paralysis across Whitehall created by the cabinet\u2019s chasm-like fissure over the \u201cright sort of Brexit\u201d. Civil servants, whatever their own political persuasion, work for the government of the day. The row over Darroch\u2019s leaked comments about the US president, and the shock of his departures across Whitehall, shows the impact when civil service confidentiality is breached. But evidence has been in plain sight over the past few years of the brutal impact of Brexit fervour on the 400,000 public servants who work for the UK civil service. Many politicians come into government suspicious of the civil service. The shadow of Yes Minister\u2019s Sir Humphrey falls long and deep. If a politician of any colour feels their cherished policies are going nowhere, it\u2019s easy to characterise officials as progress-blocking, self-serving stuffed shirts. It happened under the coalition government, as David Normington, former civil service commissioner, notes. Between 2010 and 2015, the then minister for the Cabinet Office \u201cwas frequently at odds with, and publicly critical of, the senior civil service. Significantly he was not reined in by the then prime minister.\u201d Quite so. In fact, David Cameron himself attacked the civil service, while Lord Kerslake, head of the civil service for two turbulent years, was the subject of almost constant off-the-record critical briefings \u2013 so much so that when he underwent a major back operation in the summer of 2014, he tweeted about a \u201cpretty big knife in the back!\u201d. When he stepped down that September, Kerslake said \u201cnoises off\u201d \u2013 briefings against civil servants \u2013 had been the most damaging thing to civil service morale. But there\u2019s a big and frightening difference between the treatment of Kerslake and what has been going on since the referendum in 2016. Kerslake received only verbal abuse, however unpleasant. When Jon Thompson, the head of at HM Revenue and Customs, gave his considered, professional advice that the the post-Brexit customs option preferred by Brexiters would cost up to \u00a320bn, he received death threats so serious that he had to change his route to work. \u201cWe have had to literally change how I travel and what my personal security is. We have had two death threats investigated by the Metropolitan police for speaking truth unto power about Brexit,\u201d he said. Robbins has not revealed whether he, too, has received death threats. But, as Rutter points out, Brexiters\u2019 distrust in the civil service reached its apogee in September 2018, when MP Richard Drax asked Robbins whether he believed that leaving the EU is a good thing. \u201cYou personally, in your heart, are you right behind us in every single sense of that?\u201d Robbins batted that question away \u2013 and is now departing the service altogether. Kerslake says the frequent attacks on Robbins and other senior civil servants are pernicious. He wants a public campaign to recognise and celebrate the enormous importance of having an impartial civil service. That\u2019s unlikely in an atmosphere where Nigel Farage appears to be calling for the removal \u2013 really? \u2013 of all members of the civil service and the military who don\u2019t \u201cbelieve\u201d in Brexit. It\u2019s a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of an impartial civil service, argues an increasingly despairing and furious Penman. Civil servants, bound by the civil service code of neutrality, cannot speak up for themselves. There are arguments that these times are so turbulent that rules should be overridden. In the meantime, Penman is trying to articulate the value of an impartial civil service at a time when, he says, the tectonic plates are shifting in how many civil servants will look at their relationship with ministers.",

In 2017 she moved to King\u2019s College London, where she set up the e-research function for the university and more recently extended her role, taking on responsibility for strategy and business development across all of King\u2019s core research platforms. Jacky was regarded as a national leader in this area and her advice was widely sought by other universities and industry. She was always supportive, kind \u2013 someone people came to for wise counsel. She had many passions outside work: the allotment at Park Hill, near our home in Croydon, Charlie the parrot, her love of films. She is survived by me and by her mother, sister, Andrea, niece, Danielle, and nephew, Lee.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s been a non-stop party for the US women\u2019s national team since they won the World Cup on Sunday. The champagne started flowing in the locker room immediately after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/07/womens-world-cup-final-report-usa-netherlands\">the US beat the Netherlands</a> and, from the charter flight home to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/10/us-womens-soccer-team-world-cup-champions-new-york-parade\">a ticker-tape parade in New York City</a>, players\u2019 Instagram accounts have featured bottle-popping, dancing and singing ever since.</p> <p>Once the celebrations stop, however, the players have to return to their day jobs. That means the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, a fledgling competition now in its seventh season. If fans want to keep up with Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan, they will have to watch Reign FC and Orlando Pride. The question, of course, is whether that will happen. There was a spike after the US won the World Cup in 2015, with NWSL games selling out once USWNT players returned, and just about every club setting attendance records. The problem is that crowds then dipped once the World Cup glow faded. Portland Thorns, the biggest club in the NWSL, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/04/portland-thorns-soccer-nwsl-world-cup\">average more than 18,000 fans a game</a> but they are an exception. Rapinoe\u2019s club, Reign FC, <a href=\"https://soccerstadiumdigest.com/2018-nwsl-attendance/\">drew fewer than 4,000 a game</a> last season. </p> <p>\u201cFor whatever reason, we\u2019re constantly having to remind people that the quality is there, the entertainment is there, and the competition is there,\u201d Rapinoe said of the NWSL. \u201cWorld Cups and big moments like these always provide that extra boost. You know it\u2019s going to go up a level and maybe it\u2019s not going to sustain \u2013 but we hope this time it gets there and levels out a little bit.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/04/portland-thorns-soccer-nwsl-world-cup\">Are the Portland Thorns the ideal template for a women's football club?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The more the NWSL grows, the better it is for the USWNT\u2019s standing in the world as other countries nip at their heels. After all, the NWSL\u2019s talent pool is partly why the US have been so successful in the last two World Cups. But other countries with strong domestic leagues, like Germany, England, France and Sweden also tend to have the strongest national teams.</p> <p>For the teams that made surprising runs into the knockout round of the World Cup, that global success tracks closely with new investment in domestic leagues back home. As Serie A clubs in Italy have started adding women\u2019s sides in the past four years and the Italian federation has invested more money, the national team has benefitted, with Italy making the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the first time since 1991.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest example is Italy,\u201d said Dutch forward Vivianne Miedema during the tournament. \u201cThey put a lot of money into Juventus and in a couple of other clubs. You see it directly [at] the World Cup.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3a15b42826cd744bc2d52b15612eafdba687bbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3a15b42826cd744bc2d52b15612eafdba687bbc/0_163_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portland Thorns draw large crowds but other NWSL struggle to attract fans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portland Thorns draw large crowds but other NWSL struggle to attract fans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Mitchelldyer/isiphotos.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rapinoe agreed: \u201cThere\u2019s the clearest correlation that you could possibly have with money invested in the federation and the level of play, the product on the field and the level of success these teams are having.\u201d</p> <p>But the NWSL is at risk of being overtaken by its European counterparts. Europe is already a soccer hotbed but the investment has been almost exclusively reserved for the men\u2019s game. As these countries fully embrace women\u2019s soccer, it could negate the USA\u2019s built-in advantage from <a href=\"https://www.rochester.edu/sexualmisconduct/title-IX-explained.html\">Title IX</a>, an anti-discrimination law that essentially created the robust and competitive college soccer system for women.</p> <p>And recently, it seems Europe\u2019s women\u2019s leagues have accelerated their growth at a faster rate than the NWSL. Barclays, the former sponsor of the English Premier League, announced earlier this year a multimillion-dollar deal with the English Women\u2019s Super League, which includes \u00a3500,000 in prize money. Mastercard sponsor Arsenal and Olympique Lyonnais, the powerhouse French club that features more national team players than any other.</p> <p>In the past, the NWSL has struggled to draw those kinds of sponsors. After the US won the World Cup in 2015, the NWSL could only add sunscreen Coppertone and insect repellent Cutter to its sponsors, which already included the National Mango Board \u2014 hardly an A-list group of companies.</p> <p>But there\u2019s reason for optimism that the NWSL can capitalize on the World Cup more successfully than it did four years ago. Budweiser, a longtime sponsor of the USWNT, signed on as the first official beer of the NWSL during the World Cup on a multi-year deal. As Budweiser\u2019s vice-president of marketing said when the deal was announced: \u201cBecoming the official beer sponsor of the NWSL is our way of not just supporting the US women\u2019s team once every four years, but also supporting women\u2019s soccer every single day.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/10/us-womens-soccer-team-world-cup-champions-new-york-parade\">'They're icons': US women's champion team take victory parade in New York</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A broadcast deal for the league was also confirmed during the World Cup. After the termination of a strange partnership between the NWSL and the Lifetime Channel, which is known for made-for-TV movies rather than sports, the NWSL will be shown on ESPN, in addition to having games streamed by Yahoo Sports, a much better fit.</p> <p>\u201cWe need more things like that,\u201d said defender Kelley O\u2019Hara. \u201cEyeballs are important and representation is important. For ESPN to have the NWSL on its channels, we need that.\u201d</p> <p>The biggest asset the NWSL has going for it, however, is the players. All 23 women on the US World Cup winning squad play in the NWSL, plus another 35 who represented other countries in France. After the World Cup, the NWSL, which is still trying to find its foothold in the American sports landscape, may feel like a downgrade. But the players, who are paid by US Soccer to play in the NWSL, insist that the club game is important, too.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t won an NWSL championship yet and that\u2019s on my list of things I want to accomplish,\u201d said Alyssa Naeher, goalkeeper for the US and the Chicago Red Stars. \u201cAfter I get through these next few days, I have to get back to Chicago to finish my season.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a non-stop party for the US women\u2019s national team since they won the World Cup on Sunday. The champagne started flowing in the locker room immediately after the US beat the Netherlands and, from the charter flight home to a ticker-tape parade in New York City, players\u2019 Instagram accounts have featured bottle-popping, dancing and singing ever since. Once the celebrations stop, however, the players have to return to their day jobs. That means the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, a fledgling competition now in its seventh season. If fans want to keep up with Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan, they will have to watch Reign FC and Orlando Pride. The question, of course, is whether that will happen. There was a spike after the US won the World Cup in 2015, with NWSL games selling out once USWNT players returned, and just about every club setting attendance records. The problem is that crowds then dipped once the World Cup glow faded. Portland Thorns, the biggest club in the NWSL, average more than 18,000 fans a game but they are an exception. Rapinoe\u2019s club, Reign FC, drew fewer than 4,000 a game last season. \u201cFor whatever reason, we\u2019re constantly having to remind people that the quality is there, the entertainment is there, and the competition is there,\u201d Rapinoe said of the NWSL. \u201cWorld Cups and big moments like these always provide that extra boost. You know it\u2019s going to go up a level and maybe it\u2019s not going to sustain \u2013 but we hope this time it gets there and levels out a little bit.\u201d The more the NWSL grows, the better it is for the USWNT\u2019s standing in the world as other countries nip at their heels. After all, the NWSL\u2019s talent pool is partly why the US have been so successful in the last two World Cups. But other countries with strong domestic leagues, like Germany, England, France and Sweden also tend to have the strongest national teams. For the teams that made surprising runs into the knockout round of the World Cup, that global success tracks closely with new investment in domestic leagues back home. As Serie A clubs in Italy have started adding women\u2019s sides in the past four years and the Italian federation has invested more money, the national team has benefitted, with Italy making the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the first time since 1991. \u201cThe biggest example is Italy,\u201d said Dutch forward Vivianne Miedema during the tournament. \u201cThey put a lot of money into Juventus and in a couple of other clubs. You see it directly [at] the World Cup.\u201d Rapinoe agreed: \u201cThere\u2019s the clearest correlation that you could possibly have with money invested in the federation and the level of play, the product on the field and the level of success these teams are having.\u201d But the NWSL is at risk of being overtaken by its European counterparts. Europe is already a soccer hotbed but the investment has been almost exclusively reserved for the men\u2019s game. As these countries fully embrace women\u2019s soccer, it could negate the USA\u2019s built-in advantage from Title IX, an anti-discrimination law that essentially created the robust and competitive college soccer system for women. And recently, it seems Europe\u2019s women\u2019s leagues have accelerated their growth at a faster rate than the NWSL. Barclays, the former sponsor of the English Premier League, announced earlier this year a multimillion-dollar deal with the English Women\u2019s Super League, which includes \u00a3500,000 in prize money. Mastercard sponsor Arsenal and Olympique Lyonnais, the powerhouse French club that features more national team players than any other. In the past, the NWSL has struggled to draw those kinds of sponsors. After the US won the World Cup in 2015, the NWSL could only add sunscreen Coppertone and insect repellent Cutter to its sponsors, which already included the National Mango Board \u2014 hardly an A-list group of companies. But there\u2019s reason for optimism that the NWSL can capitalize on the World Cup more successfully than it did four years ago. Budweiser, a longtime sponsor of the USWNT, signed on as the first official beer of the NWSL during the World Cup on a multi-year deal. As Budweiser\u2019s vice-president of marketing said when the deal was announced: \u201cBecoming the official beer sponsor of the NWSL is our way of not just supporting the US women\u2019s team once every four years, but also supporting women\u2019s soccer every single day.\u201d A broadcast deal for the league was also confirmed during the World Cup. After the termination of a strange partnership between the NWSL and the Lifetime Channel, which is known for made-for-TV movies rather than sports, the NWSL will be shown on ESPN, in addition to having games streamed by Yahoo Sports, a much better fit. \u201cWe need more things like that,\u201d said defender Kelley O\u2019Hara. \u201cEyeballs are important and representation is important. For ESPN to have the NWSL on its channels, we need that.\u201d The biggest asset the NWSL has going for it, however, is the players. All 23 women on the US World Cup winning squad play in the NWSL, plus another 35 who represented other countries in France. After the World Cup, the NWSL, which is still trying to find its foothold in the American sports landscape, may feel like a downgrade. But the players, who are paid by US Soccer to play in the NWSL, insist that the club game is important, too. \u201cI haven\u2019t won an NWSL championship yet and that\u2019s on my list of things I want to accomplish,\u201d said Alyssa Naeher, goalkeeper for the US and the Chicago Red Stars. \u201cAfter I get through these next few days, I have to get back to Chicago to finish my season.\u201d",

It was ever thus \u2013 just look through history, at everything from troubadour love poetry to WT Stead\u2019s class-boundaried marital agency to know that straight, white men have too often made the big bucks when it comes commodifying romance. No matter what your advantages in life, love \u2013 and the quest for it \u2013 is a great leveller. Yet until women, the LGBT+ community and people of colour start to radically reshape the dating app industry, it will remain the least desirable place to find it. \u2022 Nichi Hodgson is a sex and relationships author and broadcaster",

The Inbetweeners 2 (2014)</h2> \n<p>The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/17/the-inbetweeners-movie-review\" title=\"\">the film of the sitcom</a>, The Inbetweeners 2 bravely wrestles with the question of which is more revolting, a faceful of someone else\u2019s urine or a faceful of someone else\u2019s faeces. Judging by all the vomiting that Will (Simon Bird) does after he receives the latter, the answer is faeces. But that\u2019s not all the Brits abroad have to put up with in Australia. Neil (Blake Harrison) kills a dolphin, Simon (Joe Thomas) gets beaten up, and when their car runs out of fuel in the fiercely hot outback, it looks \u2013 for two whole hours \u2013 as if they will all die of dehydration.</p> \n<h2>19. The Navigator (1924)</h2> \n<p>If you can forgive the less-than-PC depiction of the primitive islanders in the last reel, Buster Keaton\u2019s most commercially successful film is also one of his most delightful. It\u2019s not so much fun for the characters, though. Keaton stars as Rollo Treadway, a top-hatted toff who proposes to his neighbour (Kathryn McGuire). After she turns him down, he decides to go on their honeymoon cruise to Honolulu by himself, but they end up adrift together on a deserted liner. Highlight: Rollo fends off one swordfish by using another swordfish as a weapon.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db53b3b939a60837957ff49efa3037a1139ba597\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db53b3b939a60837957ff49efa3037a1139ba597/0_0_2362_1575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Hall, Patricia Clarkson and Scarlett Johansson in Vicky Cristina Barcelona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Hall, Patricia Clarkson and Scarlett Johansson in Vicky Cristina Barcelona.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>18. Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008)<br></h2> \n<p>In one of Woody Allen\u2019s best 21st-century films, Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) round off their two-month Catalan sojourn by being shot at by the hot-blooded ex-wife (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz) of the artist (Javier Bardem) they have both slept with. Cruz won an Oscar for her bilingual performance, but Hall and Johansson are equally impressive as they trudge side by side through the airport in the closing scene. Vicky is embarking on \u201cthe life she had envisaged before the summer in Barcelona\u201d, the narrator says, and Cristina is \u201ccertain only of what she [doesn\u2019t] want\u201d. Two people have rarely looked less refreshed or revived by a holiday.</p> \n<h2>17. Carry on Abroad (1972)<br></h2> \n<p>Any cultural study of British attitudes towards Europe should begin with an analysis of Carry on Abroad. This later, lesser entry in the series sends the regulars on a package holiday to the island of Elsbels (get it?) on the Costa Bomm (get it?). The hotel is unfinished and understaffed, the phones don\u2019t work, sand pours from the taps, mosquitoes pour in through the windows and then, finally, the resort is washed away by a flash flood. No wonder the team opted for a British caravanning holiday three films later in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072764/\" title=\"\">Carry on Behind</a>.</p> \n<h2>16. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/unrelated\" title=\"\">Unrelated</a> (2007)</h2> \n<p>By the time the middle-aged, middle-class Anna (Kathryn Worth) joins a group of friends in a rented Tuscan villa, the occupants have already split themselves into the \u201cyoungs\u201d and the \u201colds\u201d. Anna, of course, is relegated to the \u201colds\u201d, but would much rather hang out with the \u201cyoungs\u201d, the teenage Oakley (a pre-Loki Tom Hiddleston) in particular. Her discomfort may be mild compared with the physical pain suffered by some of the other holidaymakers on this list, but Joanna Hogg\u2019s acute debut will be excruciating to anyone who has ever felt uncool and out-of-place.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6726a82878dd4f4ecd3bf987c54cd4698c00cd28\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6726a82878dd4f4ecd3bf987c54cd4698c00cd28/0_21_2210_1326/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arnie in Total Recall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arnie in Total Recall.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Tristar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>15. Total Recall (1990)</h2> \n<p>Actual holidays are a risky business, but virtual holidays can be just as hazardous. In Paul Verhoeven\u2019s Total Recall, adapted from a Philip K Dick short story, We Can Remember It for You Wholesale, a construction worker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) pays to have the memories of a trip of a lifetime implanted in his brain. Unfortunately, the process reveals that he is really a secret agent with a history of Martian missions. Or maybe he really is a construction worker, and it\u2019s the Martian missions that are all a fantasy. Either way, he won\u2019t recall it as a relaxing break.</p> \n<h2>14. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/taken\" title=\"\">Taken</a> (2008)</h2> \n<p>We all know that Los Angeles is the safest place on Earth, while Paris is the most dangerous, so when 17-year-old Kim (Maggie Grace) tells her dad (Liam Neeson) that she is off to the city of light, the retired CIA agent assumes, quite rightly as it turns out, that she will be abducted by Albanian sex traffickers as soon as she steps out of Charles de Gaulle airport. You would think that poor Kim would stay in LA after that, but she heads to Istanbul in the sequel. Again, Dad\u2019s \u201cparticular set of skills\u201d are required.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"414ca220a1e8b5e0499f7c99da483418a2f31ea3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/414ca220a1e8b5e0499f7c99da483418a2f31ea3/0_0_3504_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthias Schoenaerts and Tilda Swinton in A Bigger Splash.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthias Schoenaerts and Tilda Swinton in A Bigger Splash.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Frenesy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>13. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/a-bigger-splash\" title=\"\">A Bigger Splash</a> (2015)</h2> \n<p>Recuperating from a throat operation, a rock star (Tilda Swinton) is napping on the beach in Pantelleria when the sun is blotted out by an aeroplane. Yes, trouble is flying her way, specifically, a hedonistic ex (Ralph Fiennes) who is hoping to seduce her, along with the ex\u2019s daughter (Dakota Johnson), who is hoping to seduce her boyfriend (Matthias Schoenaerts). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/luca-guadagnino\" title=\"\">Luca Guadagnino</a>\u2019s sensual drama becomes a thriller when one character is drowned in a swimming pool, but before that it captures the blood-boiling annoyance of having uninvited guests butt in on your holiday.</p> \n<h2>12. Open Water (2003)</h2> \n<p>Open Water is a low-budget thriller with a chilling high concept: a scuba-diving husband and wife bob to the ocean\u2019s surface, only to find that their shuttle boat has left them stranded, miles from the Australian coast, surrounded by sharks and jellyfish. What\u2019s even more disturbing is that it is based on a true story, unlike the two otherwise superior films that followed in its wake: in Adrift (2006), six swimmers can\u2019t reach the deck of a luxury yacht, and in Frozen (2010) \u2013 no relation to the cartoon \u2013 three skiers are trapped in a chair lift.</p> \n<h2>11. The Poseidon Adventure (1972)</h2> \n<p>A New Year\u2019s Eve party is in full swing aboard the SS Poseidon when the ageing ship is capsized by a tsunami and the passengers experience what the pithy poster called: \u201cHell, upside down\u201d. Still, what can you expect when Leslie \u201cNaked Gun\u201d Nielsen is your captain? All-star disaster movies may not win much critical respect, but between the lethal-looking practical effects, and the full-throated yelling by Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine et al, The Poseidon Adventure still holds water, especially compared with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/jun/02/2\" title=\"\">CGI-heavy 2006 remake</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1a780ef889852030dccbaaa1f240bacbb29acea\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1a780ef889852030dccbaaa1f240bacbb29acea/194_488_3060_1836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cary Grant in Charade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cary Grant in Charade.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>10. Charade (1963)<br></h2> \n<p>Sometimes it\u2019s not the holiday that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s what\u2019s going on while you\u2019re away. In Stanley Donen\u2019s Hitchcock-ish romp, Reggie (Audrey Hepburn) is happy enough to be on a skiing trip, flirting with the handsome Peter (Cary Grant) and planning a divorce. But when she gets back to her Paris apartment, she discovers that her husband has sold all of their possessions, run off with the money, got himself murdered, and set up Reggie as the target of three killers. And you thought it was grim to come home to a houseful of dead pot plants.</p> \n<h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/18/cannes-2014-force-majuere-review\" title=\"\">Force Majeure</a> (2014)</h2> \n<p>Filmed in one breathtaking unbroken shot, an avalanche roars towards an Alpine ski resort\u2019s restaurant terrace, where a picture-perfect family is having lunch. The husband (Johannes Kuhnke) sprints away, taking his phone and his gloves, but leaving behind his wife (Lisa Loven Kongsli) and their two children. No harm comes to anyone in Ruben \u00d6stlund\u2019s superb Swedish comedy drama, but in that split-second of panic, the holiday is destroyed \u2013 and so is a family\u2019s complacent image of itself. An American remake starring Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus is in the works.</p> \n<h2>8. National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation (1983)</h2> \n<p>The series we might now subtitle \u201cthe crimes of Griswold\u201d got started with this chaotic road movie, directed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/25/harold-ramis\" title=\"\">Harold Ramis</a>, written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/13/80s-films-molly-ringwald-john-hughes-metoo\" title=\"\">John Hughes</a> and starring Chevy Chase as Clark Griswold, a man who dreams of introducing his wife and children to the Walley World theme park. For a hit Hollywood comedy, National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation is surprisingly subversive in its demolition of the archetypal all-American family holiday. And, as in so many of the films on this list, a pet dog doesn\u2019t survive the journey.</p> \n<h2>7. The Heartbreak Kid (1972)</h2> \n<p>Maybe it\u2019s not such a terrible holiday for Lenny (Charles Grodin). After all, it is while he is lounging in Miami Beach that he meets Kelly (Cybill Shepherd), a blonde goddess he imagines to be his soulmate. The only snag is that he happens to be on his honeymoon. As well as sensing that he and Kelly are not destined to live happily ever after, the viewer can\u2019t help but feel sorry for Lenny\u2019s bride, Lila (Jeannie Berlin). Played by the daughter of the film\u2019s director, Elaine May, she isn\u2019t just betrayed, she is sunburnt to a crisp and confined to her hotel room.</p> \n<h2>6. Withnail and I (1987)</h2> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gone on holiday by mistake!\u201d With that one glorious line, written by Bruce Robinson and snapped by a rain-sodden Richard E Grant, Withnail and I speaks for everyone who has ever been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/withnail-and-i-review\" title=\"\">stuck in a dreary cottage in the middle of nowhere</a> with no heating, no food and, at that stage, no access to the finest wines available to humanity. To their credit, Withnail (Grant) and his flatmate (Paul McGann) are resourceful enough to strangle, half-pluck and cook a chicken. But then Withnail\u2019s Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths) turns up, and things go from bad to worse.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f43afa2ed60b6e31c0c10006bac9d149ac2eda9a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f43afa2ed60b6e31c0c10006bac9d149ac2eda9a/0_0_2381_1887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Naughton in An American Werewolf in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"793\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Naughton in An American Werewolf in London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Polygram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>5. An American Werewolf in London (1981)</h2> \n<p>You have to hand it to David (David Naughton) and Jack (Griffin Dunne). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/12/how-we-made-an-american-werewolf-in-london-john-landis\" title=\"\">In John Landis\u2019s wonderful horror comedy</a>, these two Americans eschew the tourist trail in favour of a hike on the Yorkshire moors and a pint in the Slaughtered Lamb (Brian Glover and Rik Mayall play two of the patrons). It\u2019s just a shame that a hungry lycanthrope puts a crimp in their travel plans. Jack winds up as a decomposing ghost, and David \u2013 with a little help from Rick Baker\u2019s game-changing prosthetic makeup \u2013 undergoes cinema\u2019s most agonising man-to-beast transformation.</p> \n<h2>4. Funny Games (1997)<br></h2> \n<p>Jordan Peele\u2019s Us gave the \u201choliday-home invasion\u201d subgenre a mind-boggling twist, but if any film is going to prompt you to install a security system in your lakeside getaway, it\u2019s Michael Haneke\u2019s Funny Games. From the moment two polite young psychopaths, Peter (Frank Giering) and Paul (Arno Frisch), knock on a family\u2019s door and ask for eggs, the tension never slackens. Yes, Haneke\u2019s nightmarish masterpiece is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/30/features.horror\" title=\"\">a postmodern comment of the viewer\u2019s complicity in Hollywood screen violence</a>. But, more importantly, it\u2019s terrifying.</p> \n<h2>3. Hostel (2005)</h2> \n<p>Two American backpackers (Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson) are lured to Slovakia by the prospect of no-strings sex with the eager locals, and when they are maimed with power drills, chainsaws and blow torches instead, it\u2019s hard to be all that upset. Critics were divided on whether Eli Roth\u2019s Hostel was crass torture porn or a satirical caricature of American ignorance, but its gruesome vision of an exotic, treacherous Europe isn\u2019t so different from what you can see at a cinema near you now in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/03/midsommar-review-ari-aster-florence-pugh\" title=\"\">Midsommar</a> or, for that matter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/27/spider-man-far-from-home-review-jake-gyllenhaal\" title=\"\">Spider-Man: Far From Home</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ec8cf1bafb18a38cc250b19b1455c441c3815f4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ec8cf1bafb18a38cc250b19b1455c441c3815f4/0_99_2544_1526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ronny Cox, Ned Beatty, Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight in Deliverance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ronny Cox, Ned Beatty, Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight in Deliverance.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>2. Deliverance (1972)<br></h2> \n<p>Deliverance is a part of the language. Even if you haven\u2019t seen John Boorman\u2019s Oscar-nominated wilderness thriller, its title alone is enough to conjure up thoughts of savage mountain men, broken bones, twanging banjos and everything you else you might dread when you set off on a canoeing holiday, up to and including the phrase: \u201cSqueal like a pig!\u201d Ironically, despite all the unpleasantness endured by the film\u2019s four Atlanta city-slickers (Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox), Deliverance is so scenic that it turned its location, Rabun County in Georgia, into a tourism hotspot.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1a8096f44d02ef294462642e44da9bb3bc2ef9ec\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a8096f44d02ef294462642e44da9bb3bc2ef9ec/0_0_2965_1698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Hills Have Eyes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"573\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Hills Have Eyes.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar Picture Library/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>1. The Hills Have Eyes (1977)<br></h2> \n<p>When a petrol station attendant urges you to stay on the main road, be sure to listen. That\u2019s the lesson we have been taught by countless backwoods-horror yarns. But Wes Craven\u2019s The Hills Have Eyes was made long before the so-called \u201cgas station of doom\u201d became a much-loved and parodied trope, so we can\u2019t blame the Carter family for ignoring the warnings and detouring into the desert. Cave-dwelling cannibals attack, the Carters fight back, and, as the trailer\u2019s peerless tag line puts it: \u201cThe lucky ones died first.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "20. The Inbetweeners 2 (2014) The sequel to the film of the sitcom, The Inbetweeners 2 bravely wrestles with the question of which is more revolting, a faceful of someone else\u2019s urine or a faceful of someone else\u2019s faeces. Judging by all the vomiting that Will (Simon Bird) does after he receives the latter, the answer is faeces. But that\u2019s not all the Brits abroad have to put up with in Australia. Neil (Blake Harrison) kills a dolphin, Simon (Joe Thomas) gets beaten up, and when their car runs out of fuel in the fiercely hot outback, it looks \u2013 for two whole hours \u2013 as if they will all die of dehydration. 19. The Navigator (1924) If you can forgive the less-than-PC depiction of the primitive islanders in the last reel, Buster Keaton\u2019s most commercially successful film is also one of his most delightful. It\u2019s not so much fun for the characters, though. Keaton stars as Rollo Treadway, a top-hatted toff who proposes to his neighbour (Kathryn McGuire). After she turns him down, he decides to go on their honeymoon cruise to Honolulu by himself, but they end up adrift together on a deserted liner. Highlight: Rollo fends off one swordfish by using another swordfish as a weapon. 18. Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) In one of Woody Allen\u2019s best 21st-century films, Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) round off their two-month Catalan sojourn by being shot at by the hot-blooded ex-wife (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz) of the artist (Javier Bardem) they have both slept with. Cruz won an Oscar for her bilingual performance, but Hall and Johansson are equally impressive as they trudge side by side through the airport in the closing scene. Vicky is embarking on \u201cthe life she had envisaged before the summer in Barcelona\u201d, the narrator says, and Cristina is \u201ccertain only of what she [doesn\u2019t] want\u201d. Two people have rarely looked less refreshed or revived by a holiday. 17. Carry on Abroad (1972) Any cultural study of British attitudes towards Europe should begin with an analysis of Carry on Abroad. This later, lesser entry in the series sends the regulars on a package holiday to the island of Elsbels (get it?) on the Costa Bomm (get it?). The hotel is unfinished and understaffed, the phones don\u2019t work, sand pours from the taps, mosquitoes pour in through the windows and then, finally, the resort is washed away by a flash flood. No wonder the team opted for a British caravanning holiday three films later in Carry on Behind. 16. Unrelated (2007) By the time the middle-aged, middle-class Anna (Kathryn Worth) joins a group of friends in a rented Tuscan villa, the occupants have already split themselves into the \u201cyoungs\u201d and the \u201colds\u201d. Anna, of course, is relegated to the \u201colds\u201d, but would much rather hang out with the \u201cyoungs\u201d, the teenage Oakley (a pre-Loki Tom Hiddleston) in particular. Her discomfort may be mild compared with the physical pain suffered by some of the other holidaymakers on this list, but Joanna Hogg\u2019s acute debut will be excruciating to anyone who has ever felt uncool and out-of-place. 15. Total Recall (1990) Actual holidays are a risky business, but virtual holidays can be just as hazardous. In Paul Verhoeven\u2019s Total Recall, adapted from a Philip K Dick short story, We Can Remember It for You Wholesale, a construction worker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) pays to have the memories of a trip of a lifetime implanted in his brain. Unfortunately, the process reveals that he is really a secret agent with a history of Martian missions. Or maybe he really is a construction worker, and it\u2019s the Martian missions that are all a fantasy. Either way, he won\u2019t recall it as a relaxing break. 14. Taken (2008) We all know that Los Angeles is the safest place on Earth, while Paris is the most dangerous, so when 17-year-old Kim (Maggie Grace) tells her dad (Liam Neeson) that she is off to the city of light, the retired CIA agent assumes, quite rightly as it turns out, that she will be abducted by Albanian sex traffickers as soon as she steps out of Charles de Gaulle airport. You would think that poor Kim would stay in LA after that, but she heads to Istanbul in the sequel. Again, Dad\u2019s \u201cparticular set of skills\u201d are required. 13. A Bigger Splash (2015) Recuperating from a throat operation, a rock star (Tilda Swinton) is napping on the beach in Pantelleria when the sun is blotted out by an aeroplane. Yes, trouble is flying her way, specifically, a hedonistic ex (Ralph Fiennes) who is hoping to seduce her, along with the ex\u2019s daughter (Dakota Johnson), who is hoping to seduce her boyfriend (Matthias Schoenaerts). Luca Guadagnino\u2019s sensual drama becomes a thriller when one character is drowned in a swimming pool, but before that it captures the blood-boiling annoyance of having uninvited guests butt in on your holiday. 12. Open Water (2003) Open Water is a low-budget thriller with a chilling high concept: a scuba-diving husband and wife bob to the ocean\u2019s surface, only to find that their shuttle boat has left them stranded, miles from the Australian coast, surrounded by sharks and jellyfish. What\u2019s even more disturbing is that it is based on a true story, unlike the two otherwise superior films that followed in its wake: in Adrift (2006), six swimmers can\u2019t reach the deck of a luxury yacht, and in Frozen (2010) \u2013 no relation to the cartoon \u2013 three skiers are trapped in a chair lift. 11. The Poseidon Adventure (1972) A New Year\u2019s Eve party is in full swing aboard the SS Poseidon when the ageing ship is capsized by a tsunami and the passengers experience what the pithy poster called: \u201cHell, upside down\u201d. Still, what can you expect when Leslie \u201cNaked Gun\u201d Nielsen is your captain? All-star disaster movies may not win much critical respect, but between the lethal-looking practical effects, and the full-throated yelling by Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine et al, The Poseidon Adventure still holds water, especially compared with the CGI-heavy 2006 remake. 10. Charade (1963) Sometimes it\u2019s not the holiday that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s what\u2019s going on while you\u2019re away. In Stanley Donen\u2019s Hitchcock-ish romp, Reggie (Audrey Hepburn) is happy enough to be on a skiing trip, flirting with the handsome Peter (Cary Grant) and planning a divorce. But when she gets back to her Paris apartment, she discovers that her husband has sold all of their possessions, run off with the money, got himself murdered, and set up Reggie as the target of three killers. And you thought it was grim to come home to a houseful of dead pot plants. 9. Force Majeure (2014) Filmed in one breathtaking unbroken shot, an avalanche roars towards an Alpine ski resort\u2019s restaurant terrace, where a picture-perfect family is having lunch. The husband (Johannes Kuhnke) sprints away, taking his phone and his gloves, but leaving behind his wife (Lisa Loven Kongsli) and their two children. No harm comes to anyone in Ruben \u00d6stlund\u2019s superb Swedish comedy drama, but in that split-second of panic, the holiday is destroyed \u2013 and so is a family\u2019s complacent image of itself. An American remake starring Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus is in the works. 8. National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation (1983) The series we might now subtitle \u201cthe crimes of Griswold\u201d got started with this chaotic road movie, directed by Harold Ramis, written by John Hughes and starring Chevy Chase as Clark Griswold, a man who dreams of introducing his wife and children to the Walley World theme park. For a hit Hollywood comedy, National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation is surprisingly subversive in its demolition of the archetypal all-American family holiday. And, as in so many of the films on this list, a pet dog doesn\u2019t survive the journey. 7. The Heartbreak Kid (1972) Maybe it\u2019s not such a terrible holiday for Lenny (Charles Grodin). After all, it is while he is lounging in Miami Beach that he meets Kelly (Cybill Shepherd), a blonde goddess he imagines to be his soulmate. The only snag is that he happens to be on his honeymoon. As well as sensing that he and Kelly are not destined to live happily ever after, the viewer can\u2019t help but feel sorry for Lenny\u2019s bride, Lila (Jeannie Berlin). Played by the daughter of the film\u2019s director, Elaine May, she isn\u2019t just betrayed, she is sunburnt to a crisp and confined to her hotel room. 6. Withnail and I (1987) \u201cWe\u2019ve gone on holiday by mistake!\u201d With that one glorious line, written by Bruce Robinson and snapped by a rain-sodden Richard E Grant, Withnail and I speaks for everyone who has ever been stuck in a dreary cottage in the middle of nowhere with no heating, no food and, at that stage, no access to the finest wines available to humanity. To their credit, Withnail (Grant) and his flatmate (Paul McGann) are resourceful enough to strangle, half-pluck and cook a chicken. But then Withnail\u2019s Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths) turns up, and things go from bad to worse. 5. An American Werewolf in London (1981) You have to hand it to David (David Naughton) and Jack (Griffin Dunne). In John Landis\u2019s wonderful horror comedy, these two Americans eschew the tourist trail in favour of a hike on the Yorkshire moors and a pint in the Slaughtered Lamb (Brian Glover and Rik Mayall play two of the patrons). It\u2019s just a shame that a hungry lycanthrope puts a crimp in their travel plans. Jack winds up as a decomposing ghost, and David \u2013 with a little help from Rick Baker\u2019s game-changing prosthetic makeup \u2013 undergoes cinema\u2019s most agonising man-to-beast transformation. 4. Funny Games (1997) Jordan Peele\u2019s Us gave the \u201choliday-home invasion\u201d subgenre a mind-boggling twist, but if any film is going to prompt you to install a security system in your lakeside getaway, it\u2019s Michael Haneke\u2019s Funny Games. From the moment two polite young psychopaths, Peter (Frank Giering) and Paul (Arno Frisch), knock on a family\u2019s door and ask for eggs, the tension never slackens. Yes, Haneke\u2019s nightmarish masterpiece is a postmodern comment of the viewer\u2019s complicity in Hollywood screen violence. But, more importantly, it\u2019s terrifying. 3. Hostel (2005) Two American backpackers (Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson) are lured to Slovakia by the prospect of no-strings sex with the eager locals, and when they are maimed with power drills, chainsaws and blow torches instead, it\u2019s hard to be all that upset. Critics were divided on whether Eli Roth\u2019s Hostel was crass torture porn or a satirical caricature of American ignorance, but its gruesome vision of an exotic, treacherous Europe isn\u2019t so different from what you can see at a cinema near you now in Midsommar or, for that matter, Spider-Man: Far From Home. 2. Deliverance (1972) Deliverance is a part of the language. Even if you haven\u2019t seen John Boorman\u2019s Oscar-nominated wilderness thriller, its title alone is enough to conjure up thoughts of savage mountain men, broken bones, twanging banjos and everything you else you might dread when you set off on a canoeing holiday, up to and including the phrase: \u201cSqueal like a pig!\u201d Ironically, despite all the unpleasantness endured by the film\u2019s four Atlanta city-slickers (Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox), Deliverance is so scenic that it turned its location, Rabun County in Georgia, into a tourism hotspot. 1. The Hills Have Eyes (1977) When a petrol station attendant urges you to stay on the main road, be sure to listen. That\u2019s the lesson we have been taught by countless backwoods-horror yarns. But Wes Craven\u2019s The Hills Have Eyes was made long before the so-called \u201cgas station of doom\u201d became a much-loved and parodied trope, so we can\u2019t blame the Carter family for ignoring the warnings and detouring into the desert. Cave-dwelling cannibals attack, the Carters fight back, and, as the trailer\u2019s peerless tag line puts it: \u201cThe lucky ones died first.\u201d",

Appointing Brendan Rodgers as manager in February and sanctioning the \u00a340m signing of Youri Tielemans from Monaco this week is not a bad start. Tielemans was a class act while on loan during the second half of last season and Aiyawatt, more commonly known as \u201cTop\u201d, was resolute in his determination to bring the Belgium international back on a permanent basis, backing Jon Rudkin, the director of football, even when Monaco were digging their heels in over the finances.

      "body": "<p>In 1993, two years after Svetlana Alexievich published <em>Boys in Zinc</em>, her oral history of Russia\u2019s war in Afghanistan, she was sued by a number of the people she had interviewed. They accused her of offending their \u201chonour and dignity\u201d and of portraying their soldier sons as \u201csoulless killer-robots, pillagers, drug addicts and racists\u201d. Though the case was in part thrown out, it said much about the fickleness of memory and the way that the rawness of grief \u2013 conveyed to Alexievich during the interviews \u2013 had quickly been overlaid by a more bearable narrative, in which the war had been a heroic venture to help Afghanistan create a new society: their sons and husbands had not died uselessly but for a noble cause. Alexievich would not have attended the court hearing, she wrote later, except that she felt it her duty to confront her accusers, not to apologise to them, but to \u201cask their forgiveness for the fact that it is not possible to get at the truth without pain\u201d.</p> <p>All non-fiction writers are vulnerable to charges of invention and distortion, and none more so than Alexievich, who has spent more than 40 years producing her own remarkable version of recent Soviet history, one based exclusively on interviews, strung together as a series of monologues, unmediated by commentaries. Oral history was not recognised as professional research by the Russian Academy of Sciences, and Alexievich\u2019s books have attracted repeated criticism in a country where the state has kept tight control of its history through the media, school books and anniversary celebrations, ensuring a shared, tidy and victorious collective memory of the past. Her subversive, anguished testimonies, taken from ordinary people, have not been appreciated. When, in 2015, she was awarded the Nobel prize for literature \u2013 the first journalist to be so honoured and credited with inventing a new literary genre \u2013 it was greeted with outrage in the state-controlled Russian media, which claimed that she had won it only on account of her anti-Putin views.</p> <p><em>L</em><em>ast Witnesses</em>, now published in English for the first time, and translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, first appeared in 1985. A logical sequel to her first book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/02/unwomanly-face-of-war-svetlana-alexievich-review\" title=\"\">The Unwomanly Face of War</a></em> \u2013 interviews with the women who served in the Red Army, which sold more than 2m copies \u2013 it captures the memories of people who had been children, aged between three and 14, during the second world war.</p> <p>Many of her hundred or so testimonies open on the day the war broke out, a time recalled as cheerful: the weather was good and children were out playing with friends or picking mushrooms. All too soon, horrors accumulate. Safety is brutally replaced by fear, pain and hunger. With the arrival of the Germans, in their \u201cstomping iron-shod boots\u201d, fathers are lined up and shot, mothers killed by bombs, houses set on fire. For most of these children, the war was spent in an orphanage, living with a grandparent, or being put to work in a hospital. They forgot that they were children. There are accounts of entire villages being torched, of people eating dirt and grass, or seeing the families of partisans hanging from trees and frozen stiff, so that the bodies tinkled when they swung in the wind.</p> <p>Like her Red Army female soldiers, who survived to return home in 1945, few of the people Alexievich interviewed found the end of the war easy. They came back to their villages in which all the men were dead, and where unexploded mines continued to cause casualties. The sense of loss, ever present in Alexievich\u2019s work, is the theme that binds these memories \u2013 loss of siblings, pets, possessions and above all mothers \u2013 along with an abiding feeling of being too afraid ever to be happy again, because happiness is something that cannot last.</p> <p>Alexievich is not the first person to draw on oral history in Russia. The writer she considers her mentor, the fellow Belarusian Ales Adamovich, put together in the 1970s a history of the siege of Leningrad, based on \u201cepic choruses\u201d provided by interviews and diaries. Like hers, his work was sufficiently unpopular with the authorities for them to delay publication for several years. But it differs from Alexievich\u2019s books in that she almost never intersperses her narrative with an authorial comment, preferring to see herself as a historian of the \u201cuntraceable\u201d, tracking not events but the feelings that people experienced during them, and reclaiming \u201cthe small, the personal and the specific\u201d.

The death of beloved sons is a constant refr, as is that of suicide, about which she has also written a number of short storiesain that runs through her books. Embittered by wars in which they have been tricked into fighting, maimed by wounds that never heal, revolted by killings in which they were forced to take part, Alexievich\u2019s male characters come home from war to take their own lives, leaving their desolate mothers to grieve anew. \u201cThey sent me back,\u201d one woman says bleakly in <em>Boys in Zinc</em>, \u201ca different man.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Alexievich has refused to allow Soviet history to be written without the voices of people who endured the catastrophes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps not surprisingly, Alexievich was drawn to another relatively unchronicled \u201cmonstrous event\u201d, the day in April 1986 when a series of blasts brought down the nuclear reactor at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/chernobyl-nuclear-disaster\" title=\"\">Chernobyl</a>. Though its effects were felt everywhere from Israel to China, 70% of the radioactive fallout descended on Belarus, where rates of cancer soon increased 74-fold. Over a period of 20 years, Alexievich returned repeatedly to the area, to interview former workers at the plant, along with doctors, scientists, soldiers and peasants who had defied the ban and returned to their homes. The explosion, she writes in <em>Chernobyl Prayer</em>, was the \u201cbeginning of a new history\u201d and at times it seemed to her \u201cas if I was recording the future\u201d (the writers of the recent HBO series drew on her book).

Alexievich wrote it during the 10 years she spent abroad in exile in France and Germany, having fallen out with the regime in Belarus in 2000. Based on interviews carried out over two decades, most of them with women, it deals with the years between Stalin\u2019s death in 1953 and the assassination of the opposition activist Boris Nemtsov in 2015. <em>Second</em><em>hand Time</em> depicts a country in which people are poor and resentful and speak of the past, before perestroika, as the best and happiest time of their lives. When capitalism arrived to shatter their worlds into \u201cdozens of colourful little pieces\u201d and poverty became \u201cshameful\u201d, it confused them.

      "body": "<p>As anybody who ever sat blinking in front of a blank page or canvas knows, boundless creativity can be paralysing. Sandbox games such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/may/18/minecraft-at-10-building-things-and-changing-lives\">Minecraft</a> can have a similar effect. Building things without instructions can be liberating, but can also leave us feeling lost. Dragon Quest Builders 2 balances creative freedom with direction, and allows even the most imaginatively challenged of us a taste of the joy of making something.</p> <p>Unlike the more open-ended Minecraft and its ilk, Dragon Quest Builders 2 is an adventure game, based around building, that gives you the option to flex your creative muscles if you so choose. Set in a world where any kind of building is banned by a destruction-worshiping religion, it drops you on to a mysterious deserted island, with an enigmatic amnesiac companion called Malroth. I was initially annoyed at the prospect of having someone following me around all the time, but Malroth endeared himself to me by fighting monsters and collecting materials at my side \u2013 and only very occasionally getting in the way of my masterful crafting.</p> <p>The story is intriguing enough to hold the player\u2019s interest, but the real stars of the show are the dialogue and localisation work that shine in every Dragon Quest game. Packed full of puns and humour, it makes reading the not insignificant amount of dialogue a real joy. Farmers describe things as \u201c<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/3257895.stm\">gurt lush</a>\u201d, miners speak in cockney rhyming slang, and a guard named Britney screams \u201cYOLO\u201d as she charges into battle.</p> <p>The original Dragon Quest Builders was divided into chapters: you would spend hours building up a settlement, only to move on to the next, never to see your hard work again. Here, the Isle of Awakening is a hub where you can build freely, rope in online friends to help with your grand plans, and recruit villagers to build homes. As you expand the settlement you unlock new things to craft and new islands to visit, all dotted with puzzles and places to explore.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q65qT-X8RA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0q65qT-X8RA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Each island has a little narrative of its own. Some are inhabited by bosses and regular waves of enemies, which turn the game into a kind of tower defence experience. Disappointingly, however, combat is simple and very repetitive, mainly consisting of mashing one button and waiting for your more powerful companion to finish enemies off. While the game ran smoothly on PS4, I did come across a bug that vanished all the writing from speech bubbles and menus, causing about 20 minutes of panic before a reset fixed it.</p> <p>This is a very slow game, and while I enjoyed the gentle journey, the constant stream of new things to learn sometimes made me feel as though I were trapped in an endless tutorial. But breaking up your list of tasks with some independent creation and exploration time makes it a lot more tolerable. After completing a long series of main missions, I unwound by creating my own dream cabin and garden, as the villagers built a huge pyramid. (It was not lost on me that this division of labour seemed entirely unfair.) That gentle back-and-forth between idle creative play and world-saving missions makes Dragon Quest Builders 2 absorbing and likable.</p> <ul> <li><p>Dragon Quest Builders 2 is out on 12 July; \u00a344.99</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "As anybody who ever sat blinking in front of a blank page or canvas knows, boundless creativity can be paralysing. Sandbox games such as Minecraft can have a similar effect. Building things without instructions can be liberating, but can also leave us feeling lost. Dragon Quest Builders 2 balances creative freedom with direction, and allows even the most imaginatively challenged of us a taste of the joy of making something. Unlike the more open-ended Minecraft and its ilk, Dragon Quest Builders 2 is an adventure game, based around building, that gives you the option to flex your creative muscles if you so choose. Set in a world where any kind of building is banned by a destruction-worshiping religion, it drops you on to a mysterious deserted island, with an enigmatic amnesiac companion called Malroth. I was initially annoyed at the prospect of having someone following me around all the time, but Malroth endeared himself to me by fighting monsters and collecting materials at my side \u2013 and only very occasionally getting in the way of my masterful crafting. The story is intriguing enough to hold the player\u2019s interest, but the real stars of the show are the dialogue and localisation work that shine in every Dragon Quest game. Packed full of puns and humour, it makes reading the not insignificant amount of dialogue a real joy. Farmers describe things as \u201cgurt lush\u201d, miners speak in cockney rhyming slang, and a guard named Britney screams \u201cYOLO\u201d as she charges into battle. The original Dragon Quest Builders was divided into chapters: you would spend hours building up a settlement, only to move on to the next, never to see your hard work again. Here, the Isle of Awakening is a hub where you can build freely, rope in online friends to help with your grand plans, and recruit villagers to build homes. As you expand the settlement you unlock new things to craft and new islands to visit, all dotted with puzzles and places to explore. Each island has a little narrative of its own. Some are inhabited by bosses and regular waves of enemies, which turn the game into a kind of tower defence experience. Disappointingly, however, combat is simple and very repetitive, mainly consisting of mashing one button and waiting for your more powerful companion to finish enemies off. While the game ran smoothly on PS4, I did come across a bug that vanished all the writing from speech bubbles and menus, causing about 20 minutes of panic before a reset fixed it. This is a very slow game, and while I enjoyed the gentle journey, the constant stream of new things to learn sometimes made me feel as though I were trapped in an endless tutorial. But breaking up your list of tasks with some independent creation and exploration time makes it a lot more tolerable. After completing a long series of main missions, I unwound by creating my own dream cabin and garden, as the villagers built a huge pyramid. (It was not lost on me that this division of labour seemed entirely unfair.) That gentle back-and-forth between idle creative play and world-saving missions makes Dragon Quest Builders 2 absorbing and likable. Dragon Quest Builders 2 is out on 12 July; \u00a344.99",

Within minutes of the incredible event beginning, a great crowd coalesced. The elderly and infirm got out of their chairs. Children were put on shoulders. There were gasps. There was awe. I can tell you what happened but you may prefer to sit down first. Because two weeks ago, almost to the day, a goat in this small-town theme park <em>climbed a tree</em> in its enclosure. \u201cBut \u2026 goats can\u2019t climb trees,\u201d came the murmurs from the crowd. \u201cWhat is it doing?\u201d they asked, with confused astonishment.

Within minutes of the incredible event beginning, a great crowd coalesced. The elderly and infirm got out of their chairs. Children were put on shoulders. There were gasps. There was awe. I can tell you what happened but you may prefer to sit down first. Because two weeks ago, almost to the day, a goat in this small-town theme park climbed a tree in its enclosure. \u201cBut \u2026 goats can\u2019t climb trees,\u201d came the murmurs from the crowd. \u201cWhat is it doing?\u201d they asked, with confused astonishment.

Kundan jewellery is unusual in using wax within the gold or silver frame, as well as incorporating glass and painted illustrations, of white, green, red or blue floral motifs.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Sir, want precious stones?\u201d a man asks me, quietly. I am on the Johari Bazaar, one of Jaipur\u2019s most notable thoroughfares, a straight colonnade screened above by the facades of adjoining houses. Everything is painted orange, terracotta and burnt pink. The man wears white shalwar kameez, and an air of indifference. He unfolds white paper, revealing colourful stones. \u201cEmeralds, sapphires, rubies \u2026\u201d he says. He is among one of several groups of men gathered in this area; they\u2019re local dealers, discussing prices. The avenue, whose name means gem shop road, is lined with dozens of shops displaying magnificent necklaces, bracelets and rings. Johari Bazaar, \u2018designed to be a commercial capital\u2019, according to Unesco, which has named it a world heritage site My encounter reveals something of why the \u201cPink City\u201d, in northern India, has just been named a Unesco world heritage site. Jaipur was selected partly on the basis of its urban plan, featuring colonnaded streets and public squares called chaupurs. The city also contains architectural wonders: the City Palace, Amber Fort, and Water Palace among them. Walking past the pink sandstone Hawa Mahal (Palace of the Winds), Jaipur\u2019s five-storey honeycomb-like wall of 50-odd protruding windows with latticework frames, miniature cupolas and painted motifs, is a breathtaking experience. Clockwise from top: a jeweller in his Johari Bazaar workshop; a street vendor sells his gems; one of the street\u2019s many jewellery stores Along with these ceremonial court buildings, Jaipur was constructed for commerce. As Unesco states, the city was \u201cdesigned to be a commercial capital\u201d. Today, dealers and vendors animate the streets. And in back alleys and second-storey workshops, curious visitors will find artisans working on ornamental crafts. Unesco recognises how Jaipur \u201chas maintained its local commercial, artisanal and cooperative traditions to this day\u201d. Jal Mahal (Water Palace) Jaipur is famous for its wood-block printing, tailoring, carpets, wood and metalwork. There are many contemporary boutiques, such as Teatro Dhora, selling elegant clothes, men\u2019s handkerchiefs, notepads, leather handbags and more at (relatively) affordable prices. But it is in jewellery, in particular, where the city has historically excelled. Vendors and artisans animate the streets and stores around Jaipur After founding Jaipur in 1727, Jai Singh II is said to have organised a procession through the city where local crowds threw precious stones over him and his entourage. He was infatuated with jewels. Under his patronage, Jaipur started to become a centre for jewellery, attracting artisans and traders from afar. Today, the city is home to hundreds of thousands of jewellers and dealers. Salesmen at one of Jaipur\u2019s fabric markets \u201cPeople here are obsessed with jewellery,\u201d says Akshat Ghiya, owner and creative head of Tallin Jewels, a boutiquebrand whose workshop is on the Johari Bazaar. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a compulsion here for people to buy jewellery every few months. Ever since the Raja [Jai Singh II], jewellery has flourished here. Jaipur has become the largest stone-cutting centre in the world.\u201d Akshat Ghiya checking the clarity of a batch of diamonds at his store Tallin (top), and crafting jewellery at his workshop By talking to dealers, visitors can find opportunities to meet jewellers, like Narenda, who I chat with in his second-floor workshop off the Chand Pol Bazaar. He examines a jewel on his workspace, while sitting cross-legged on the floor. \u201cWhen I go to temples, I get a lot of ideas,\u201d he says. On the wall is a framed picture of three Hindu gods, draped with a garland of orange marigolds. Below, at street level, as ever, there\u2019s the din of motorbikes and rickshaws. Through the window, the Nahargarh Fort is faintly visible on the hills beyond the city. Narenda works in the traditional Kundan Meena style. Kundan jewellery is unusual in using wax within the gold or silver frame, as well as incorporating glass and painted illustrations, of white, green, red or blue floral motifs. The results have an ethnic feel but when used in an ensemble of necklace, tiara, earrings and rings, Kundan can look bling. Which can be the point: the style is popular among wealthy brides from Mumbai and Delhi. Kundan Meena jewellery is intricate and inlaid with enamel in a variety of colours While rich Indians visit Jaipur for its gems, the city offers jewellery for anyone. Backpackers and tourists can find inexpensive, quality pieces in dozens of shops around the city. It requires patience and a discerning eye. Visitors can develop their knowledge of Indian jewellery at the Amrapali museum on Ashok Marg Road. It is an extraordinary collection of jewellery, displayed over two small floors. A mesmerising foot-long, 19th-century gold braid, from Tamil Nadu, engraved with Hindu gods and goddesses, is just one of hundreds of spectacular pieces.

      "bodyText": "Ever since the world\u2019s first recognised skyscrapers were built in Chicago and New York in the 1880s, cities have been in thrall to visions of extraordinary height. Early intimations of the ways in which skyscrapers would transform cities came in the 1910s, with images such as Richard Rummell\u2019s below suggesting a future not only of immensely tall buildings but also of multilayered streets, railways and flying machines. 1911: Richard Rummell, illustration from King\u2019s Views of New York Today, we see the effects of a huge increase in both the numbers and height of skyscrapers \u2013 as high as 1km, in the case of the under-construction Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia \u2013 but very little attempt to create connections between tall buildings. 1929: Hugh Ferriss, drawing from The Metropolis of Tomorrow The American architect, illustrator and poet Hugh Ferriss was entranced by the skyscrapers of interwar New York, which reached unprecedented heights with the construction of the Chrysler (1928-9) and Empire State Buildings (1930-1). In his drawings for The Metropolis of Tomorrow, Ferriss imagined skyscrapers of truly mythic proportions that resembled ancient ziggurats, shrouded in a romantic aura of darkness. In some of his drawings, these resolutely artificial edifices morphed into outsized crystals and stone mountains, giving a sense of the skyscrapers as having grown out of the earth itself. 1936: Still from Things to Come Image: United Artists/Photofest Like its better-known cousin Metropolis (1927), Alexander Korda\u2019s film version of HG Wells\u2019 1933 novel The Shape of Things to Come captured a moment of great optimism over technology\u2019s power to improve the cities of the future. In this film, scripted by Wells himself, an unplanned 19th-century city (almost certainly London) is destroyed by war, with a new city emerging only after a protracted period of medieval savagery. A human super-race uses advanced machines to carve the new city into the ground, creating a completely enclosed world of perfect urban order and immaculate surfaces. With its highly formal avenues of trees and gardens, this city of the future embodies the ideals of a generation of modernist architects, who sought to introduce light, air and nature into the congested and polluted industrial cities of the previous century. 1949: Archibald Montgomery Low, Climate to Order Image from the San Antonio Light newspaper The dream of enclosing cities under a protective shell originates in mid-19th century visions of the transformative potential of the then new technologies of iron-and-glass construction. These were attempts to shield citizens from the industrial pollution that plagued Victorian cities but also the result of a utopian desire to create a human-controlled environment free from the vagaries of nature. Only in the mid-20th century did these visions resurface with any force, as the technologies that drove skyscraper construction also suggested a more thorough control of the air above cities. Although Archibald Montgomery Low\u2019s proposal above offers a crude technological solution \u2013 a literal roof over the city supported on skyscrapers of the future \u2013 it nevertheless anticipates a wave of speculative projects in the 1950s and 60s by maverick engineer Buckminster Fuller, in which cities such as New York were imagined to be enclosed by vast geodesic domes. 1969: Oscar Newman, Nuclear-Proof Manhattan Underground cities might well be some of the oldest in existence. In eighth-century Cappadocia, in what is now Turkey, Christians were forced underground by persecution. Threats don\u2019t come any larger than nuclear warfare, even if its potential destructive power has somewhat faded in the cultural imagination. In the 1950s and 1960s, when the prospect of nuclear war was felt viscerally by many, entire populations were drilled in the art of preparing for an apocalypse that might come at any moment. Architect Oscar Newman\u2019s proposal for a replica of Manhattan to be built deep underground may seem like a nightmare application of his theory of \u201cdefensible\u201d space; yet it reflects the hubris of those who believed a nuclear conflict could be survived if we burrowed deep enough into the earth. 1970: Paul Cureton (after Newton Fallis), Autopia Ampere Image: Newton Fallis/A Visual History of the Future Wolf Hilbertz, who developed this extraordinary proposal with artist Newton Fallis in 1970, saw the potential of materials grown in the sea to build entire cities. Fantastic though this may seem, Hilbertz was later instrumental in developing the material commonly known as Biorock, a substance formed by the electro-accumulation of materials dissolved in seawater. Now used to restore damaged coral reefs, Biorock has yet to be grown into a habitable building, let alone an entire city. In recent years, synthetic biologist Rachel Armstrong has proposed growing an artificial reef below Venice to stop the city sinking into the sea. Meanwhile, American architect Mitchell Joachim envisages houses grown in a laboratory from pig cells. 1982: Still from Blade Runner Image: Warner Bros Blade Runner, which is still the most iconic cinematic realisation of the cyberpunk ethic of bleak but beautiful dystopian future cities, presents a vision of a future post-nuclear Los Angeles shrouded in permanent rain-sodden darkness \u2013 but also full of vibrant life, whether human or artificial. 1995: Lebbeus Woods, Quake City Image: estate of Lebbeus Woods, Aleksandra Wagner, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and David Rozelle Although the American architect Lebbeus Woods built almost nothing in his lifetime, his prolific output of exquisitely drawn speculative projects has made him highly influential. Radical in both their forms and their underlying politics, many of Woods\u2019 projects are built on anarchist principles of self-organisation and the dissolution of hierarchical power structures. In this proposal for a new kind of future city after San Francisco is destroyed by the coming \u201cbig one\u201d, Woods envisions a vast structure built by residents entirely out of salvaged materials. The project asks us to think radically about architecture\u2019s relationship with the world and whether we\u2019re prepared to accept and work with the destructive forces of nature and ourselves, rather than fight against them. 2004: Alexis Rockman, Manifest Destiny Image: Smithsonian American Art Museum The likely effects of the climate emergency force us to consider the prospect of cities being submerged as a result of rising sea levels. Alexis Rockman\u2019s painting takes that idea to a new level, showing a submerged and ruined Brooklyn in the year 5,000, after centuries of global heating have transformed the urban landscape. Although the new tropical climate supports an abundance of life, humans are absent. The city remains only as a vestige of its former self \u2013 its drowned subterranean infrastructures now part of the strange ecosystem of the far future. 2013: Still from Elysium Image: TriStar Pictures More than a billion people live in informal settlements, which are characterised by rapidly constructed self-built housing. They often lack basic infrastructure such as water supply and waste disposal. There are more than 200,000 such slums around the world and their number is expected to rise sharply in the coming decades. Elysium imagines the downtown skyscrapers of a future Los Angeles overtaken by the poorest of society, creating a vertical shanty town that sprouts from concrete and steel-framed buildings, which were once the working places of the wealthy. As in many dystopian images of future cities, poverty spreads inexorably and the wealthy few escape to fortified enclaves, in this case a luxury space station.

Let\u2019s start with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H364yo7aBuU\">the race\u2019s first staging at Aintree</a>, when Stirling Moss won it for the first time, and then relive the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOgDAQYuTik\">incident-packed 1976 race at Brands Hatch</a>, when James Hunt\u2019s victory over Niki Lauda was overturned on appeal and the race awarded to the Austrian. The 1987 edition saw <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dwb3ZRkhV8E\">Nigel Mansell sensationally overhaul Nelson Piquet</a> at the last to win, and 1995\u2019s featured an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az_CdcAdAjE\">infamous crash between championship rivals Damon Hill and Michael Schumacher</a> as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR60EhxzslY\">Johnny Herbert took a surprise win</a>. While in 2008, Lewis Hamilton underlined his promise with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWvyv06zr54&amp;t=1s\">a magnificent victory in the wet</a> and five years later a thrilling race was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mI2F2WkGTs\">won by Nico Rosberg</a>.</p> <p>2) Fancy a pointless mud-diving goal celebration? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndyRobsonTips/status/1147474590203109376\">We got \u2019em</a>.

They include the batting masterclasses from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHieIMlSSDM&amp;t=56s\">Clive Lloyd in 1975</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AwbcgArJ4w&amp;t=11s\">Viv Richards</a> in 1979 that helped win the first two World Cups for West Indies, and the same side\u2019s collapse four years later that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Vk0EAXbZlo\">handed India their first crown</a>. England\u2019s last appearance in the final ended in defeat thanks to a superb bowling performance by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow377NPp80o\">Imran Khan\u2019s wounded Pakistan tigers</a>, while in 2003 and 2007, batting exhibitions <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkfeqTG7MVs\">from Ricky Ponting</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egxEfBI3hyk\">Adam Gilchrist</a> respectively brought the title to Australia. And just to cheer up India fans after their semi-final woe this week, here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAtfMy9UvU8\">MS Dhoni\u2019s finishing skills winning the 2011 final</a>.</p> <p>4) Wimbledon quirks: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/James_Dart/status/1147205346290745344\">when sprinklers attack</a>, and Coco Gauff\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davehydesports/status/1147222474624552960\">father\u2019s bar erupts</a> after her thrilling win over Polona Hercog.

      "bodyText": "1) It\u2019s the British Grand Prix this weekend, which gives us an excuse to raid the archives for some classic races from Silverstone and elsewhere down the years. Let\u2019s start with the race\u2019s first staging at Aintree, when Stirling Moss won it for the first time, and then relive the incident-packed 1976 race at Brands Hatch, when James Hunt\u2019s victory over Niki Lauda was overturned on appeal and the race awarded to the Austrian. The 1987 edition saw Nigel Mansell sensationally overhaul Nelson Piquet at the last to win, and 1995\u2019s featured an infamous crash between championship rivals Damon Hill and Michael Schumacher as Johnny Herbert took a surprise win. While in 2008, Lewis Hamilton underlined his promise with a magnificent victory in the wet and five years later a thrilling race was won by Nico Rosberg. 2) Fancy a pointless mud-diving goal celebration? We got \u2019em. Still, at least no one was sent off for their exuberance. Here\u2019s 10 who were, including Edinson Cavani for a sniper impersonation, Carlos Tevez for a topless chicken dance, a couple of foolhardy strips and, our favourite, Medi Dresevic running into the stands and applauding himself for scoring. 3) It\u2019s also the Cricket World Cup final on Sunday, an event that tends not to throw up quite as many thrillers as the semi-finals do, but there have been some memorable showpieces down the years. They include the batting masterclasses from Clive Lloyd in 1975, and Viv Richards in 1979 that helped win the first two World Cups for West Indies, and the same side\u2019s collapse four years later that handed India their first crown. England\u2019s last appearance in the final ended in defeat thanks to a superb bowling performance by Imran Khan\u2019s wounded Pakistan tigers, while in 2003 and 2007, batting exhibitions from Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist respectively brought the title to Australia. And just to cheer up India fans after their semi-final woe this week, here\u2019s MS Dhoni\u2019s finishing skills winning the 2011 final. 4) Wimbledon quirks: when sprinklers attack, and Coco Gauff\u2019s father\u2019s bar erupts after her thrilling win over Polona Hercog. Then there\u2019s Jelena Ostapenko\u2019s secret weapon, the doubles body-serve \u2013 although it works better when you hit an opponent. 5) The Netball World Cup begins in Liverpool on Friday, a tournament that has been dominated by Antipodean teams from the get-go. Here\u2019s New Zealand beating Australia to win the second edition in 1967 and the Kiwis taking on Trinidad &amp; Tobago in 1979, a curiosity as the title was shared between those two teams and Australia as there was no final, just a 10-team round-robin. The 1991 final was something of a classic, with Australia beating New Zealand 53-52. While English hopes this year are pegged around their memorable Commonwealth Games gold medal triumph last year. 6) In cycling (and especially against Marianne Vos) it ain\u2019t over \u2018til it\u2019s over, as Lucy Kennedy found to her cost on stage three of this year\u2019s Gira Rosa: Our favourites from below the line last week 1) Learn to bat like notorious New Zealand rabbit Chris Martin. 2) A package of the best table tennis points of recent years: 2018, 2017 and 2016. 3) Footage of the (unofficial) Women\u2019s World Cup final of 1970, with Denmark beating Italy 2-0 in Turin. 4) What we\u2019ve all been waiting for: a guide to underwater wrestling.

A week come Friday, they could win the trophy for the second time in six years which, given they had won it only twice in the first 55 years of its existence, would be in some bluntly statistical way the most successful period in their history.

They are not the high-class artists of a couple of decades ago. There are no players with the individual qualities of Sunday Oliseh, Jay-Jay Okocha and Nwankwo Kanu. The highest-profile player remains Mikel John Obi, who has been restricted to a supporting role, starting against Burundi and Madagascar but left out of the other three matches, although he delivered a stern team talk amid the celebrations that followed the 3-2 win over Cameroon. There could yet be a glorious finale to his international career in the country where he made his Nigeria debut in the 2006 Cup of Nations.</p> <p>In that sense, Nigeria reflect a wider trend in the development of African football.

      "bodyText": "Nigeria are in the semi-finals of the Cup of Nations. A week come Friday, they could win the trophy for the second time in six years which, given they had won it only twice in the first 55 years of its existence, would be in some bluntly statistical way the most successful period in their history. Yet nobody can seriously believe this Nigeria side to be anywhere near the stature of some of their sides of the past. Nigeria\u2019s record of underachievement in the Cup of Nations always seemed slightly freakish; it may be that this current spell of achievement comes to seem equally weird. That\u2019s not to say that Nigeria don\u2019t deserve to be in the semi-finals, where they face Ivory Coast or Algeria. After a lackadaisical defeat by Madagascar in the final group game, when qualification had been secured \u2013 only their second defeat by African opposition in three years under Gernot Rohr \u2013 they have come through dramatic ties against Cameroon and South Africa. \u201cThey go down but they come back in the last minutes \u2013 it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d Rohr said after the quarter-final victory on Wednesday. \u201cThe attitude of the players is wonderful.\u201d He was in giddily high spirits, attempting to initiate some arch coaching banter about the relative merits of zonal- and man-marking at set plays after both sides had leaked soft goals from corners, only to find Stuart Baxter, South Africa\u2019s robustly Wulfrunian coach, who thanks to CAF\u2019s policy of dual press conferences was seated alongside him, unwilling to engage. But the qualities of this Nigeria are spirit and, for the most part, organisation. They are not the high-class artists of a couple of decades ago. There are no players with the individual qualities of Sunday Oliseh, Jay-Jay Okocha and Nwankwo Kanu. The highest-profile player remains Mikel John Obi, who has been restricted to a supporting role, starting against Burundi and Madagascar but left out of the other three matches, although he delivered a stern team talk amid the celebrations that followed the 3-2 win over Cameroon. There could yet be a glorious finale to his international career in the country where he made his Nigeria debut in the 2006 Cup of Nations. In that sense, Nigeria reflect a wider trend in the development of African football. The best teams are nowhere near the quality they were 10-20 years ago: there is no side to match the Cameroon of Geremi, Rigobert Song and Patrick Mbomba or the Egypt of Ahmed Hassan, Hosny Abd Rabo and Mohamed Aboutrika. The Nigeria, Senegal and Ivory Coast sides of the early part of the century, you suspect, would have been far more successful had they come along 15 years later.

Crib sheet The White House plans to welcome several inflammatory, far-right internet personalities to a summit on social media \u201cbias\u201d on Thursday, to which no representatives from Facebook, Twitter, or Google have been invited. The likely next British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has been accused of throwing the UK ambassador to the US, Kim Darroch, \u201cunder the bus,\u201d by refusing to back him over his leaked criticism of Trump, which led to Darroch\u2019s resignation \u2013 with a potentially chilling effect on diplomacy.

Must-reads A South African anti-apartheid hero, tarnished by corruption Gavin Watson was a legend of the anti-apartheid movement, breaking the law to play rugby alongside black people and later building a chain of menswear stores aimed at black buyers. But now he is caught in a corruption scandal that threatens not only his business, but the ANC government, as Mark Gevisser reports. The death of candour in the age of surveillance The devastating leak of the British ambassador\u2019s correspondence is merely the latest evidence that truly private communication is a bygone privilege, both for public figures and private citizens.

And he said he and the shadow cabinet had been denied access to information on the scale of the problem and the party\u2019s official response to an investigation by the equalities watchdog into how Labour handles allegations of antisemitism. Watson pointedly praised former party officials who broke non-disclosure agreements on the Panorama programme about interference by the leader\u2019s office in investigations into antisemitism claims. Labour complained to the BBC about the programme and dismissed the whistleblowers as \u201cdisaffected employees\u201d. But Watson said: \u201cI deplore the statement that was made about those people last night; you couldn\u2019t fail to be saddened and moved by the testimony, particularly of the young members who\u2019d had racist abuse in party meetings.\u201d He said the whistleblowers \u201cshowed great courage \u2026 and to dismiss their testimony as in some way flawed, I think was wrong.

And he backed calls by Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, and the former prime minister Gordon Brown for a party rule change to automatically exclude members \u201cwho have a prima facie case to answer of using antisemitic behaviours and language\u201d. Watson added: \u201cThat effectively means people who are facing an investigation of antisemitism can\u2019t go to meetings any more where Jewish members feel threatened and insecure and intimidated.\u201d The deputy leader said he could not assess whether Panorama exaggerated the scale of antisemitism in the party because he was unable to find out how many complaints had been made. Watson claimed that since Corbyn was elected leader, there has been a \u201cgrowing belief that there is a sickness in our party, that this kind of abuse has been in some way allowed, that there\u2019s almost a permissive culture that people can use anti-Jewish, racist language \u2026 that we failed to address adequately.\u201d He said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d he and other members of the Labour NEC had not been given access to the party\u2019s response to an investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission into how it handles allegations of antisemitism. \u201cI\u2019ve been told by a general secretary that I\u2019m not legally responsible for dealing with outside regulatory bodies,\u201d Watson said.

      "body": "<p>It was at the beginning of a shift at Harrods that Georgia Brown told her manager where to go. Brown, then aged 22, was working for a temp agency that supplied shop assistants to the department store. She cannot remember the name of the manager. But she does remember why she lost her cool: she had had enough of being forced to wear heels on the job.</p> <p>\u201cNot just a mini-heel, but proper black stilettos. Bear in mind, you\u2019re on your feet in Harrods all day \u2013 you can\u2019t sit down,\u201d says Brown. When she arrived at work, there was a mandatory uniform check, after which she would slip into flat shoes. This time, she got caught. \u201cI said: \u2018My feet hurt; who are you to tell me I have to work on stilts?\u2019,\u201d says Brown.</p> <p>After Brown\u2019s outburst, Harrods notified her agency, and she was fired. </p> <p>This all happened 10 years ago, when the store\u2019s policy called for staff to adhere to high standards of personal grooming. Harrods says that Brown\u2019s experience does not represent the situation for workers now, where the store\u2019s current policy is that staff \u201cdress appropriately for their day. This means that they are empowered to express their personal style, and are very much trusted to represent our brand to the highest of standards.\u201d <br></p> <p>Still, Brown\u2019s situation will be all too familiar to many women. In May, a row erupted after British Airways flight attendants <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/row-over-british-airways-cabin-crew-s-visible-bras-cgzrktmgj\" title=\"\">were warned not to wear </a><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/row-over-british-airways-cabin-crew-s-visible-bras-cgzrktmgj\" title=\"\">bras in certain colours or shapes</a> under their blouses. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit extreme, saying you must wear a white bra under a white shirt,\u201d says Claire Simpson of Unite, the union that represents most cabin crew, who is herself a former flight attendant.</p> <p>Whether or not you agree with Mary Beard\u2019s statement to shoe designer Manolo Blahnik this week that high heels are a \u201csymbol of women\u2019s oppression\u201d, the fact remains that if men do not have to wear them, nor should women. Bunion-inducing stilettos, skirts so tight you are forced to walk with a coquettish wriggle, or gossamer-thin blouses in fiercely air-conditioned offices: women are often the victims of workplace dress codes, whether or not they wear uniforms.</p> <p>But as women\u2019s workwear increasingly becomes a more public battleground in the fight for equality, this may change. Simpson is pleased that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/04/virgin-atlantic-drops-mandatory-makeup-for-female-cabin-crew\" title=\"\">Virgin Atlantic</a> now gives female crew the choice of trousers or a skirt and they no longer have to wear makeup. She points out, though, that while airlines are increasingly allowing women to wear flat shoes, progress is slow.</p> <p>It is not illegal for employers to impose dress codes on women alone. \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet got to the position where you can say: \u2018Having high heels in a dress code is unlawful,\u2019\u201d says the barrister Harini Iyengar, who specialises in employment and discrimination law. This issue was brought to the fore by the receptionist-turned-Coronation Street actor Nicola Thorp \u2013 arguably the champion of the new workwear movement. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/21/high-heels-row-work-government-response-cop-out-nicola-thorp\" title=\"\">made headlines in 2016</a> after being sent home from her agency job at accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers for refusing to wear heels. A <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/archived/petitions/129823\" title=\"\">petition</a> calling for the mandatory wearing of high heels to be made illegal received more than 152,000 signatures, and <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/petitions-committee/news-parliament-2015/high-heels-and-workplace-dress-codes-report-published-16-17/?utm_source=petition&amp;utm_campaign=129823&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=reportstory\" title=\"\">prompted a </a><a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/petitions-committee/news-parliament-2015/high-heels-and-workplace-dress-codes-report-published-16-17/?utm_source=petition&amp;utm_campaign=129823&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=reportstory\" title=\"\">parliamentary inquiry into workplace dress codes</a>. It concluded that further work was needed to strengthen the Equality Act 2010 and protect workers from discrimination, including increased financial penalties for employers that break the law.</p> <p>The problem, says Iyengar, is that it is hard to prove that being forced to wear high heels is discriminatory on the basis of sex \u2013 unless it is in a job that requires heavy lifting. \u201cIn a workplace where it\u2019s the norm and all your colleagues are wearing heels \u2013 aside from the heavy-lifting example \u2013 it\u2019s much harder for somebody without a medical certificate to say to an employer: \u2018High heels are bad in general.\u2019\u201d The same applies for being made to wear makeup or skirts at work: unless you can show it is contrary to your gender identity or sexual orientation, there is not much you can do.</p> <p>Whatever the law may say, though, women are increasingly refusing to put up and shut up. In Japan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/06/japan-women-high-heels-workplace-kutoo-campaign\" title=\"\">the #KuToo movement</a> has called on the government to ban employers from forcing women to wear heels. Employers are also seeing it as simply good PR to keep up with the times. \u201cIn recent years, there has been a relaxation in the uniform codes as far as hair and makeup are concerned,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cIt\u2019s about choice \u2013 and modern values being reflected in the uniform standard.\u201d</p> <p>Obviously, our wardrobes reflect the changing status of women in society. The fashion historian Deirdre Clemente says that, as women become more emancipated: \u201cThey push the boundaries of prescribed work-environment clothing.\u201d The compulsory wearing of tights, she says, changed in the 1990s: \u201cWomen wanted bare legs.\u201d Especially in the summer. Throughout the decade, dress codes were steadily relaxed, as casualwear brands such as Gap redefined corporate attire. \u201cWe started to see things like trouser suits, more casual dresses, maybe trousers and a matching sweater,\u201d says Clemente.</p> <p>If in the 80s, women wore power suits to project an image of masculine strength \u2013 the women\u2019s rights lawyer Gloria Allred wore hers in red for the first 25 years of her career \u2013 as today\u2019s women feel more settled in the workplace, they adopt a relaxed, athleisure-inspired silhouette. \u201cWomen are wanting to wear tank tops to work now, or yoga pants to a meeting,\u201d says Clemente. </p> <p>But, she says, a double standard still persists: \u201cWomen are held to such a different public standard in their appearance to men. That will not change until there\u2019s full equality.\u201d Even the most slovenly man is generally considered OK, provided he wears a suit and tie and remembers to shave. But, for women, corporate dressing is often full of obligations that may not be set out in formal dress codes.</p> <p>It took more than a decade before Iyengar felt comfortable wearing flat shoes to work. \u201cDefinitely at the beginning of my career, when I struggled to fit in, I wouldn\u2019t have dared not to wear heels. I regret that I went along with it when I was younger, but it\u2019s difficult to swim against the tide,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Women of colour are disproportionately policed when it comes to complying with written or unwritten dress codes. When Tara Williams worked as a lawyer in Philadelphia from 2010, she usually spent Sunday nights frowning at her wardrobe, trying to figure out which outfit would not get her into trouble the next day at work. Williams used to wear J Crew suits in black, navy pinstripe, charcoal tweed, light grey, and navy cotton, but she kept being told by her superiors that her outfits were brash or unprofessional. \u201cThere was this constant belittling and implication that I was not playing by the norms.\u201d</p> <p>The problem seemed to be the colour of the shirts she was wearing. \u201cIf I wore anything other than a light blue shirt, like a white or a red, I would receive these comments,\u201d Williams remembers. \u201cThey\u2019d say: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s <em>loud</em>.\u2019\u201d Once, when she wore a berry-coloured coat, she was ridiculed by a senior associate, who told her she looked \u201clike Mrs Claus\u201d. When she was being chastised, Williams would often look around the office and see another woman wearing the same J Crew outfit. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a brown person, particularly if you have dark skin, you\u2019re seen as over-the-top when you reach outside of grey or black.\u201d</p> <p>Her experience is not uncommon. Dr Janet Ainsworth, a professor of law at Seattle University, says: \u201cWhite employees do not have their hairstyles policed in any way, but employees of African ancestry are told they can\u2019t wear braids or Afros.\u201d Ainsworth <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-90-481-9322-6_12\" title=\"\">wrote a 2013 paper</a> that looked at 73 cases in which employees were sacked for dress-code violations. Her conclusion was disturbing. \u201c[Employers wanted] women to look ultra-feminine, wear makeup, feminine-looking clothing and so forth. And African-ancestry women should look as white as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Some women get ahead by rejecting the double standard entirely. One medical researcher tells me that when she started wearing jeans and T-shirts to work, people stopped asking her to make coffee in meetings, because only a scientist would dress so casually. (This approach is backed up by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20190514-taking-a-more-outlandish-approach-to-workwear-could-pay-off\" title=\"\">a 2014 study</a> published in the Journal of Consumer Research into the so-called \u201cred-sneaker effect\u201d, which found that employees who deviate from standard dress codes are perceived more favourably by their peers.) Kate Rosh Bertash, 32, who works in cybersecurity and lives in LA, has revolutionised her wardrobe with the help of the eight identical black wrap dresses that she has worn daily since January 2017. Part of Bertash\u2019s motivation for adopting a uniform was her struggles to find work-appropriate clothing as a plus-sized woman. \u201cThings would pull and gap in strange places.\u201d It is also more environmentally friendly.</p> <p>But wearing the same dress is about more than just convenience or sustainability. It is a feminist act. Bertash says: \u201cThere\u2019s this stress that women put ourselves under to either be noticeable, or novel, or fashionable, and look like we\u2019re always trying, whereas men wear the same thing pretty much every day \u2026 I think most of us have parts of that process and the trappings of femininity and professionalism that we don\u2019t like, and don\u2019t bring us happiness, and suck up a lot of time.\u201d She still dresses up for special occasions \u2013 she recently wore a blue evening gown to a wedding \u2013 but not having to think about her wardrobe on a daily basis is freeing. \u201cI expend a lot of creative energy on my work. It\u2019s nice not to have to expend it on my clothing.\u201d Her advice to anyone thinking of doing the same thing? Make sure the outfit has pockets. \u201cThat in itself is very life-changing.\u201d </p> <p>Why does it matter what women wear in the workplace? Because what we wear matters. Women chafe against sexist dress codes for the same reason we protest against the rolling-back of abortion rights; because, like regulation polyester blouses, they make us itch. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me how I should control my body, or how I should present myself. That\u2019s my personal choice,\u201d Clemente says. The pushback is particularly pronounced right now, because we\u2019re living in increasingly feminist times. \u201cIt\u2019s a big culmination of all of those years where women didn\u2019t have a voice to say: \u2018I\u2019m not wearing this outfit\u2019, and they silently either had to suffer, or band together a little bit and say: \u2018We\u2019re not wearing pantyhose.\u201d\u2019</p> <p>Williams ended up transferring to a different office after the negative comments got too much. She gave the berry-pink coat to charity, but now she wears all the colour she wants. \u201cI have a dress in the exact same colour, and I\u2019m very proud of it,\u201d she laughs. \u201cSo that\u2019s the replacement.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 July 2019. An earlier version referred to Harrods having a policy where \u201cstaff adhere to high standards of personal grooming\u201d. This has been corrected to make clear that was an old policy of the store, not a current one.</p>",

USAG\u2019s scrutiny continues with a <a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/story/news/investigations/2019/04/30/new-lawsuit-seeks-help-potentially-thousands-abused-gymnasts/3625426002/\">new lawsuit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/2019/05/07/directory-of-sports-medicine-was-fired-by-usa-gymnastics-for-failing-to-disclose-safety-complaints-at-club-owned-by-his-wife/\">dissection</a> of a hiring gone wrong, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/03/larry-nassar-gymnastics-film-documentary-hbo\">documentary</a> on how Nassar got away with his crimes for so long, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/24/15-months-on-from-larry-nassar-usa-gymnastics-struggles-to-find-its-way\">looming threat</a> of decertification.</p> <p>USA Swimming, on the the other hand, hasn\u2019t been publicly castigated by the US Olympic Committee, by Congress, or by the media to the same extent. When USA Swimming CEO Tim Hinchey appeared before a Congressional subcommittee alongside other NGB representatives in May 2018, lawmakers and the media put the bulk of the focus on USA Gymnastics CEO Kerry Perry, who didn\u2019t last long in the job.</p> <p>By that time, USA Swimming\u2019s responsibilities and tactics had already changed. The NGB released Safe Sport educational material to parents in 2017.</p> <p>Over the years, USA Swimming\u2019s issues have received scattered media coverage:</p> <ul> <li><p>In 2010, ESPN and ABC <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/abc-news-investigation-usa-swimming-coaches-raped-molested/story?id=10322469\">found</a> swimming coaches easily evaded background checks and moved from club to club. The focal point was Andy King, who stayed one step ahead of investigators until his arrest in 2009. The next year, he was sentenced to 40 years in prison.</p></li> <li><p>In 2014, the same year in which an <a href=\"https://swimswam.com/victor-vieth-opens-usa-swimming-sexual-abuse-review/\">independent review</a> of sexual abuse (Vieth Report) was released and activists <a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/2014/06/02/wielgus-name-pulled-from-swimming-hall-of-fame-consideration/\">stopped</a> longtime USA Swimming executive Chuck Wielgus from being inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame, Outside magazine <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/2162781/unprotected\">ran a comprehensive piece</a> accusing USA Swimming of having a \u201chands-off\u201d attitude toward sexual abuse cases.</p></li> <li><p>In 2018, the Orange County Register <a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/2018/02/16/investigation-usa-swimming-ignored-sexual-abuse-for-decades/\">published an investigation</a> claiming hundreds of swimmers have been sexually abused while USA Swimming wrestled with various conflicts of interest and an unwillingness to act.</p></li> </ul> <p>The numbers in the Register\u2019s piece were staggering. Over a 20-year span, at least 252 coaches and officials faced either criminal charges or USA Swimming discipline for sexual abuse or misconduct against at least 590 alleged victims.</p> <p>But USA Swimming has never had that one galvanizing media-ready moment such as the Nassar courtroom scenes. And one of the few lawsuits to go forward against the organization involves a coach-swimmer relationship, which \u2013 justifiably or not \u2013 just doesn\u2019t stir up the same amount of shock as a doctor taking advantage of young girls in his care. American culture has long seen joy and humor in relationships with an age and power imbalance \u2013 see the 1979 Woody Allen film Manhattan or the <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/snl-did-a-sketch-about-rape-again-and-it-still-wasnt-funny_n_56a64641e4b076aadcc736e5\">2016 Saturday Night Live sketch</a> about a teacher-student escapade.</p> <p>In the swimming community itself, ending coach-student relationships requires a culture change. The <a href=\"https://www.usaswimming.org/docs/default-source/safe-sportdocuments/safe-sport-basics/2014-vieth-report.pdf\">Vieth Report</a> notes USA Swimming\u2019s delegates <a href=\"https://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/usa-swimming-house-of-delegates-closes-sexual-abuse-loopholes-bans-coachathlete-relationships/\">voted against</a> a prohibition of such relationships in 2012, only to be forced into such a ban when the USOC required it the next year. Other sports have seen prominent athletes marry their college coaches, though the relationships have usually started when the athletes were adults.</p> <p>In the lawsuit against USA Swimming, 2012 Olympian Ariana Kukors Smith <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/sports/olympic-swimmer-ariana-kukors-coach-abuse.html\">claims</a> her coach started grooming her for sexual abuse at age 13 and molested her at age 16. The coach, Sean Hutchison, claims the relationship in question was consensual and didn\u2019t start until the swimmer was an adult.</p> <p>USA Swimming is a defendant because lawyers claim the organization carried out a woefully inadequate investigation when alerted to the relationship. The lawsuit notes that the NGB\u2019s Safe Sport director, Susan Woessner, was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/sports/usa-swimming-resignations.html\">forced out</a> in 2018 for failing to disclose that she had her own relationship with Hutchison before investigating the matter.</p> <p>Bob Allard, the attorney representing Kukors Smith and many other athletes, claims USA Swimming had a systemic problem with internal investigations carried out by an opaque and ineffective National Board of Review. The organization\u2019s lawyers, on the other hand, were quite effective.</p> <p>One example of where the liability has fallen: A swimmer <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/15m-settlement-in-womans-claim-of-1990s-sex-abuse-by-swim-coach/\">won a $1.5m settlement</a> from a Washington parks and rec department that employed King, the coach now serving a 40-year prison term. Meanwhile, USA Swimming settled quietly with one of King\u2019s victims in California.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a concerted effort back to the 1990s on behalf of USA Swimming to quash all victims\u2019 complaints,\u201d Allard says.</p> <p>Another factor working against claimants was a side effect, intentional or otherwise, of USA Swimming forming a \u201ccaptive\u201d insurance company, US Sports Insurance Company Inc (USSIC). Captive companies are legal and were popular when adequate commercial insurance was difficult to obtain in the 1980s.</p> <p>USSIC managed to limit financial risk for USA Swimming and its member clubs, making early settlements the best option for most legal complaints. The company also provided \u201csafety rebates\u201d that gave USA Swimming a financial incentive to be aggressive in court.</p> <p>This system, Allard says, helped to enable hundreds of Larry Nassars.</p> <p>What has changed?</p> <p>First, USSIC was <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2016/09/23/427327.htm\">moved</a> from Barbados to the USA and then sold.</p> <p>Second, while the federation hasn\u2019t had quite as much turnover as USA Gymnastics, a few top staffers have left. Wielgus retired in 2017. (He passed away a few months later.) Woessner\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/sports/usa-swimming-resignations.html\">resignation</a> over the Hutchison case coincided with another departure by longtime staff member Pat Hogan.</p> <p>Third, the USOC has realized that it needs to follow the same course of action with athlete abuse that it has with doping issues \u2013 spin off an independent entity that takes the role of policing away from the NGBs that face an inherent conflict of interest in policing themselves. As doping falls under the auspices of the US Anti-Doping Agency, abuse issues now fall under the US Center for SafeSport.</p> <p>Fourth, federal law has changed. The Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017, passed in February 2018, requires NGBs to keep one-on-one interactions between minors and adults to situations with \u201can observable and interruptible distance from another adult, except under emergency circumstances.\u201d The NGBs have had to figure out what this means in their respective sports.</p> <p>For USA Swimming, that means new policies on locker rooms, massages and travel, all designed to virtually eliminate any possibility that a coach and a swimmer will be alone together.</p> <p>Also, swimmers need to take a step back from the 21st century and <a href=\"https://swimswam.com/usa-swimming-maapp-guardian-must-be-included-on-electronic-communication/\">copy their guardians</a> on any communication with a coach and vice versa. That applies to social media as well. Forget those texts asking if practice has been moved or those messages of support on a Facebook page. These changes have caused a bit of confusion, particularly in regards to college recruiting.</p> <p>USA Swimming continues to have a director of Safe Sport (USA Swimming adds a space in \u201cSafe Sport\u201d while the US Center for SafeSport does not), replacing Woessner with Abigail Howard, who has worked in several university compliance offices and worked on child abuses cases as a deputy prosecutor.</p> <p>While the Center has jurisdiction over sexual abuse cases, USA Swimming\u2019s internal Safe Sport department oversees a broader range of code-of-conduct violations and works on education programs, including those designed to teach parents and athletes how to keep coaches and other officials from preying on their naivete.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s certainly a change for anyone involved in youth sports,\u201d Howard says. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve received in feedback isn\u2019t so much that this is a bad policy but, \u2018How do we do it? Is there an app we can use? Is copying that to a parent sufficient?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Most importantly, parents learn to be alert to any tactic predators have learned in the past.</p> <p>USA Swimming still has a few watchdogs in quiet corners of the Internet, and the NGB recognizes that more progress is needed. But if Congress wants to call NGBs to another hearing on Capitol Hill, the NGBs may turn right around and ask representatives why they aren\u2019t funding the US Center for SafeSport.</p> <p>And as the swimming world championships approach in July, expect to hear much more about Katie Ledecky, Simone Manuel and Ryan Murphy than we hear about Sean Hutchison or Andy King.</p> <p>Then we\u2019ll see if quiet efforts to arm families with information will stem the tide of sexual abuse.</p>",

The spotlight still shines most intently on USA Gymnastics, which remains in the news nearly 18 months after the dramatic courtroom scenes in which scores of survivors confronted Larry Nassar, the doctor who will almost certainly spend the rest of his life in prison. USAG\u2019s scrutiny continues with a new lawsuit, dissection of a hiring gone wrong, a documentary on how Nassar got away with his crimes for so long, and the looming threat of decertification. USA Swimming, on the the other hand, hasn\u2019t been publicly castigated by the US Olympic Committee, by Congress, or by the media to the same extent.

But USA Swimming has never had that one galvanizing media-ready moment such as the Nassar courtroom scenes. And one of the few lawsuits to go forward against the organization involves a coach-swimmer relationship, which \u2013 justifiably or not \u2013 just doesn\u2019t stir up the same amount of shock as a doctor taking advantage of young girls in his care. American culture has long seen joy and humor in relationships with an age and power imbalance \u2013 see the 1979 Woody Allen film Manhattan or the 2016 Saturday Night Live sketch about a teacher-student escapade. In the swimming community itself, ending coach-student relationships requires a culture change. The Vieth Report notes USA Swimming\u2019s delegates voted against a prohibition of such relationships in 2012, only to be forced into such a ban when the USOC required it the next year. Other sports have seen prominent athletes marry their college coaches, though the relationships have usually started when the athletes were adults. In the lawsuit against USA Swimming, 2012 Olympian Ariana Kukors Smith claims her coach started grooming her for sexual abuse at age 13 and molested her at age 16. The coach, Sean Hutchison, claims the relationship in question was consensual and didn\u2019t start until the swimmer was an adult. USA Swimming is a defendant because lawyers claim the organization carried out a woefully inadequate investigation when alerted to the relationship. The lawsuit notes that the NGB\u2019s Safe Sport director, Susan Woessner, was forced out in 2018 for failing to disclose that she had her own relationship with Hutchison before investigating the matter. Bob Allard, the attorney representing Kukors Smith and many other athletes, claims USA Swimming had a systemic problem with internal investigations carried out by an opaque and ineffective National Board of Review. The organization\u2019s lawyers, on the other hand, were quite effective. One example of where the liability has fallen: A swimmer won a $1.5m settlement from a Washington parks and rec department that employed King, the coach now serving a 40-year prison term. Meanwhile, USA Swimming settled quietly with one of King\u2019s victims in California. \u201cThere has been a concerted effort back to the 1990s on behalf of USA Swimming to quash all victims\u2019 complaints,\u201d Allard says. Another factor working against claimants was a side effect, intentional or otherwise, of USA Swimming forming a \u201ccaptive\u201d insurance company, US Sports Insurance Company Inc (USSIC). Captive companies are legal and were popular when adequate commercial insurance was difficult to obtain in the 1980s. USSIC managed to limit financial risk for USA Swimming and its member clubs, making early settlements the best option for most legal complaints. The company also provided \u201csafety rebates\u201d that gave USA Swimming a financial incentive to be aggressive in court. This system, Allard says, helped to enable hundreds of Larry Nassars. What has changed? First, USSIC was moved from Barbados to the USA and then sold. Second, while the federation hasn\u2019t had quite as much turnover as USA Gymnastics, a few top staffers have left. Wielgus retired in 2017. (He passed away a few months later.) Woessner\u2019s resignation over the Hutchison case coincided with another departure by longtime staff member Pat Hogan. Third, the USOC has realized that it needs to follow the same course of action with athlete abuse that it has with doping issues \u2013 spin off an independent entity that takes the role of policing away from the NGBs that face an inherent conflict of interest in policing themselves. As doping falls under the auspices of the US Anti-Doping Agency, abuse issues now fall under the US Center for SafeSport. Fourth, federal law has changed. The Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017, passed in February 2018, requires NGBs to keep one-on-one interactions between minors and adults to situations with \u201can observable and interruptible distance from another adult, except under emergency circumstances.\u201d The NGBs have had to figure out what this means in their respective sports. For USA Swimming, that means new policies on locker rooms, massages and travel, all designed to virtually eliminate any possibility that a coach and a swimmer will be alone together. Also, swimmers need to take a step back from the 21st century and copy their guardians on any communication with a coach and vice versa. That applies to social media as well. Forget those texts asking if practice has been moved or those messages of support on a Facebook page. These changes have caused a bit of confusion, particularly in regards to college recruiting. USA Swimming continues to have a director of Safe Sport (USA Swimming adds a space in \u201cSafe Sport\u201d while the US Center for SafeSport does not), replacing Woessner with Abigail Howard, who has worked in several university compliance offices and worked on child abuses cases as a deputy prosecutor. While the Center has jurisdiction over sexual abuse cases, USA Swimming\u2019s internal Safe Sport department oversees a broader range of code-of-conduct violations and works on education programs, including those designed to teach parents and athletes how to keep coaches and other officials from preying on their naivete. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly a change for anyone involved in youth sports,\u201d Howard says. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve received in feedback isn\u2019t so much that this is a bad policy but, \u2018How do we do it? Is there an app we can use? Is copying that to a parent sufficient?\u2019\u201d Most importantly, parents learn to be alert to any tactic predators have learned in the past. USA Swimming still has a few watchdogs in quiet corners of the Internet, and the NGB recognizes that more progress is needed. But if Congress wants to call NGBs to another hearing on Capitol Hill, the NGBs may turn right around and ask representatives why they aren\u2019t funding the US Center for SafeSport. And as the swimming world championships approach in July, expect to hear much more about Katie Ledecky, Simone Manuel and Ryan Murphy than we hear about Sean Hutchison or Andy King. Then we\u2019ll see if quiet efforts to arm families with information will stem the tide of sexual abuse.",

Most viewers, though, may well have a very different reaction to what they saw on the programme \u2013 which was a group of young, committed servants of the Labour party so distressed by what they witnessed being done by the top brass of the party they loved that they were driven to despair, depression and, in the case of the onetime head of disputes, Sam Matthews, <a href=\"https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/jeremy-corbyn-has-done-more-to-inflame-antisemitism-than-any-political-figure-since-second-world-war-1.486310\" title=\"\">contemplation of suicide</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps, at last, Labour party members will find this too much to stomach.

They included people who had come to work for Labour in the Corbyn period, who indeed had voted for him as leader, and who were nevertheless appalled by what they saw: the vile abuse directed at Jews; the meddling from the top; the failure to show zero tolerance of antisemitism; the extraordinary leniency granted to those guilty of egregious racism.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s reaction to this programme has been emblematic of its entire approach to this problem: seeking to attack the motives of the messenger rather than to confront the message, seeking, as Matthews told the BBC this morning, to \u201cdiminish and deny\u201d the scale of the problem. Well, that might be enough to deflect a single TV documentary. But a statutory investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission is under way, which has much, much more information. No doubt, when the time comes, there\u2019ll be an effort to cast the EHRC as biased and Blairite, but it won\u2019t wash. People can see with their own eyes the reality, which is a Labour party with a serious racism problem. The only ones who can\u2019t see it are those who would prefer to look the other way.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p> <h2>Rachel Shabi: I hope this will highlight that Labour has become an unwelcoming place for Jewish people</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"837395322dcde294682cb15760a523f672e62942\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/837395322dcde294682cb15760a523f672e62942/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Rachel Shabi\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Wednesday\u2019s Panorama kicked off with a useful reminder of how Labour\u2019s antisemitism problem all began \u2013 patient zero was Ken Livingstone and his horrible <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/30/ken-livingstone-repeats-claim-nazi-zionist-collaboration\" title=\"\">comments about Hitler and Zionism</a> \u2013 but also how easily it all could have been avoided. That\u2019s important at a time when the entire issue has become so toxic and mired in the gaslighting of Jewish people, cynical misrepresentation and endless political point-scoring.</p> <p>Much of the information contained in this documentary, a painful and depressing watch, is already known. But the power of the programme was in the telling of the story, by former staffers overwhelmed by the scale of the problem and political interference, alongside Jewish Labour members agonisingly recounting their experiences of antisemitism in the party. What was new \u2013 and shockingly sad \u2013 was the revelation by some former Labour staffers of the emotional distress caused by handling this issue in this climate and the impact it had on their mental health.</p> <p>Unfortunately the narrative voiceover of the programme revealed an unsophisticated, inaccurate comprehension of antisemitism and the left, suggesting it as somehow wired in to an anti-imperialist worldview, or the result of reading too much Marx. This is not just wrong, but also undermines serious attempts to analyse the nature and causes of antisemitism within the left and its decades-long blind spot over the issue.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the response from the Labour party, framing the issue so heavily in factional terms, is demonstrative of the deeper problem all along: that it has become engulfed in a political fight, an attack line in this battle rather than a serious issue in and of itself. Hopefully the Panorama show, with its spotlight on Jewish experiences of antisemitism within Labour, will serve to highlight the nature of the issue \u2013 a culture inside the party that has made it an unwelcoming place for Jewish people for whom it was previously a natural home.</p> <p>\u2022 Rachel Shabi is a writer and commentator</p> <h2>Jon Lansman: A politically motivated documentary into a subject that demands serious and fair discussion</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"29ae25cb16d26b855b9342bd1932d187c6a64233\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29ae25cb16d26b855b9342bd1932d187c6a64233/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Jon Lansman\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve had to deal with, and fight, antisemitism all my life. Obviously I take the problem in the party very seriously and Labour must do all it can to tackle the problem. But what was ignored by this one-sided documentary was the decisive action we are taking to tackle it. Since Jennie Formby became general secretary she has doubled staffing resources and the rate at which antisemitism cases have been dealt with has increased more than four-fold. When it comes to dealing with cases and improving procedures, from the left to right, the national executive committee is united in its approach.</p> <p>I found it deeply saddening that the BBC, a public broadcaster with a commitment to impartiality, would commission such a politically motivated documentary into a subject that demands serious and fair discussion. From beginning to end the documentary flouted basic journalistic standards. The emails from Seumas Milne and Jennie Formby were distorted and misrepresented through the programme\u2019s editing and selective quoting. In fact, the evidence shows their clear intent was to speed up processes in the case of Jackie Walker. And, as opposed to seeking to \u201cinterfere\u201d, it was only after being asked by a former staffer for his view that Seumas rightly suggested caution about claims of antisemitism being levelled at Jewish people.</p> <p>And while I have deep empathy with the Jewish people featured on the programme, many of the interviewees were former staffers with an axe to grind. Some of them, Iain McNicol for instance, were even the very staffers who resisted implementing Shami Chakrabarti\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.39essex.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Chakrabarti-Inquiry-Report-30June16.pdf\" title=\"\">recommendations</a> on how to deal with antisemitism, have <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/leaked-emails-reveal-labours-compliance-unit-took-months-to\" title=\"\">reportedly delayed action</a> on cases to undermine Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership and left a complaints process behind them that was shambolic and not fit for purpose. They simply do not have any credibility on the subject of tackling antisemitism.</p> <p>I genuinely want to solve this issue, but it becomes impossible when the discourse around it becomes ever more polarised, with some people denying or diminishing the problem while others claim it is an existential threat and cynically use it to attack the Labour party leadership. This leads to combative, entrenched opinions on both sides and only makes it harder to tackle the problem.</p> <p>\u2022 Jon Lansman is a member of the Labour party\u2019s national executive committee, and a founder of Momentum</p> <h2>Keith Kahn-Harris: Corbyn was supposed to represent the hope of a different, better kind of society</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7baa6cbf01c69aa6d09d810c201768f61422bbab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7baa6cbf01c69aa6d09d810c201768f61422bbab/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Keith Kahn-Harris\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The antisemitism crisis in the Labour party has been going on for so long and opinions have become so entrenched, that John Ware\u2019s programme is not likely to have changed many people\u2019s minds. The experiences of antisemitic abuse reported by Jewish interviewees echo others that have been made many times before and will be received as before. Those who think the antisemitism issue has been exaggerated or confected by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s enemies are likely to continue to think that.</p> <p>But there was something revealed in the documentary that was new, and that should cause even those who are sceptical to think again. The stories from former members of the disputes team were horrible. The visible distress of those who attempted to deal with the problem, but who claimed that their work was repeatedly stymied by the party high command, cannot be dismissed.</p> <p>That the work environment was so bad as to lead to a breakdown, to depression and suicidal thoughts is bad enough; that they had to sign NDAs and have faced subsequent legal threats is inexcusable. Their dismissal by the Labour press office as disaffected opponents with axes to grind is appalling.</p> <p>This is not a problem exclusive to Labour.

      "bodyText": "Jonathan Freedland: The Labour party has a serious racism problem Those who Labour\u2019s high command refers to as \u201coutriders\u201d have been out and about on Twitter, busily doing precisely what a memo of \u201cguidance\u201d suggested they should: seeking to counter the BBC Panorama investigation of Labour antisemitism. Most viewers, though, may well have a very different reaction to what they saw on the programme \u2013 which was a group of young, committed servants of the Labour party so distressed by what they witnessed being done by the top brass of the party they loved that they were driven to despair, depression and, in the case of the onetime head of disputes, Sam Matthews, contemplation of suicide. Perhaps, at last, Labour party members will find this too much to stomach. Perhaps those who were not moved by the testimony of Jews; who dismissed Jewish anxieties about antisemitism within Labour as lies, as smears, as \u201cmood music\u201d, as attempts to weaken Jeremy Corbyn; who believed Jews, uniquely among ethnic minorities, could not be trusted when pointing out the racism they faced \u2013 perhaps those people will listen instead to the voices of the whistleblowers who, showing great courage, spoke to Panorama. Team Corbyn want to cast those people as embittered former employees with a political axe to grind, but they hardly looked or sounded like that. They included people who had come to work for Labour in the Corbyn period, who indeed had voted for him as leader, and who were nevertheless appalled by what they saw: the vile abuse directed at Jews; the meddling from the top; the failure to show zero tolerance of antisemitism; the extraordinary leniency granted to those guilty of egregious racism. Labour\u2019s reaction to this programme has been emblematic of its entire approach to this problem: seeking to attack the motives of the messenger rather than to confront the message, seeking, as Matthews told the BBC this morning, to \u201cdiminish and deny\u201d the scale of the problem. Well, that might be enough to deflect a single TV documentary. But a statutory investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission is under way, which has much, much more information. No doubt, when the time comes, there\u2019ll be an effort to cast the EHRC as biased and Blairite, but it won\u2019t wash. People can see with their own eyes the reality, which is a Labour party with a serious racism problem. The only ones who can\u2019t see it are those who would prefer to look the other way. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist Rachel Shabi: I hope this will highlight that Labour has become an unwelcoming place for Jewish people Wednesday\u2019s Panorama kicked off with a useful reminder of how Labour\u2019s antisemitism problem all began \u2013 patient zero was Ken Livingstone and his horrible comments about Hitler and Zionism \u2013 but also how easily it all could have been avoided. That\u2019s important at a time when the entire issue has become so toxic and mired in the gaslighting of Jewish people, cynical misrepresentation and endless political point-scoring. Much of the information contained in this documentary, a painful and depressing watch, is already known. But the power of the programme was in the telling of the story, by former staffers overwhelmed by the scale of the problem and political interference, alongside Jewish Labour members agonisingly recounting their experiences of antisemitism in the party. What was new \u2013 and shockingly sad \u2013 was the revelation by some former Labour staffers of the emotional distress caused by handling this issue in this climate and the impact it had on their mental health. Unfortunately the narrative voiceover of the programme revealed an unsophisticated, inaccurate comprehension of antisemitism and the left, suggesting it as somehow wired in to an anti-imperialist worldview, or the result of reading too much Marx. This is not just wrong, but also undermines serious attempts to analyse the nature and causes of antisemitism within the left and its decades-long blind spot over the issue. Meanwhile, the response from the Labour party, framing the issue so heavily in factional terms, is demonstrative of the deeper problem all along: that it has become engulfed in a political fight, an attack line in this battle rather than a serious issue in and of itself. Hopefully the Panorama show, with its spotlight on Jewish experiences of antisemitism within Labour, will serve to highlight the nature of the issue \u2013 a culture inside the party that has made it an unwelcoming place for Jewish people for whom it was previously a natural home. \u2022 Rachel Shabi is a writer and commentator Jon Lansman: A politically motivated documentary into a subject that demands serious and fair discussion I\u2019ve had to deal with, and fight, antisemitism all my life. Obviously I take the problem in the party very seriously and Labour must do all it can to tackle the problem. But what was ignored by this one-sided documentary was the decisive action we are taking to tackle it. Since Jennie Formby became general secretary she has doubled staffing resources and the rate at which antisemitism cases have been dealt with has increased more than four-fold. When it comes to dealing with cases and improving procedures, from the left to right, the national executive committee is united in its approach. I found it deeply saddening that the BBC, a public broadcaster with a commitment to impartiality, would commission such a politically motivated documentary into a subject that demands serious and fair discussion. From beginning to end the documentary flouted basic journalistic standards. The emails from Seumas Milne and Jennie Formby were distorted and misrepresented through the programme\u2019s editing and selective quoting. In fact, the evidence shows their clear intent was to speed up processes in the case of Jackie Walker. And, as opposed to seeking to \u201cinterfere\u201d, it was only after being asked by a former staffer for his view that Seumas rightly suggested caution about claims of antisemitism being levelled at Jewish people. And while I have deep empathy with the Jewish people featured on the programme, many of the interviewees were former staffers with an axe to grind. Some of them, Iain McNicol for instance, were even the very staffers who resisted implementing Shami Chakrabarti\u2019s recommendations on how to deal with antisemitism, have reportedly delayed action on cases to undermine Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership and left a complaints process behind them that was shambolic and not fit for purpose. They simply do not have any credibility on the subject of tackling antisemitism. I genuinely want to solve this issue, but it becomes impossible when the discourse around it becomes ever more polarised, with some people denying or diminishing the problem while others claim it is an existential threat and cynically use it to attack the Labour party leadership. This leads to combative, entrenched opinions on both sides and only makes it harder to tackle the problem. \u2022 Jon Lansman is a member of the Labour party\u2019s national executive committee, and a founder of Momentum Keith Kahn-Harris: Corbyn was supposed to represent the hope of a different, better kind of society The antisemitism crisis in the Labour party has been going on for so long and opinions have become so entrenched, that John Ware\u2019s programme is not likely to have changed many people\u2019s minds. The experiences of antisemitic abuse reported by Jewish interviewees echo others that have been made many times before and will be received as before. Those who think the antisemitism issue has been exaggerated or confected by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s enemies are likely to continue to think that. But there was something revealed in the documentary that was new, and that should cause even those who are sceptical to think again. The stories from former members of the disputes team were horrible. The visible distress of those who attempted to deal with the problem, but who claimed that their work was repeatedly stymied by the party high command, cannot be dismissed. That the work environment was so bad as to lead to a breakdown, to depression and suicidal thoughts is bad enough; that they had to sign NDAs and have faced subsequent legal threats is inexcusable. Their dismissal by the Labour press office as disaffected opponents with axes to grind is appalling. This is not a problem exclusive to Labour. Many bureaucracies turn inwards when faced with perceived external threats and end up abusing those who are perceived as threats (the Catholic church for one). Yet Corbyn was supposed to represent the hope of a different, better kind of society. The work of building that society starts within the Labour party itself. If the party cannot police itself without displaying the classic symptoms of toxic institutional culture, then what hope remains? \u2022 Keith Kahn-Harris is the author of Strange Hate: Antisemitism, Racism and the Limits of Diversity",

Jeremy Corbyn&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/05/corbyn-sorry-for-hurt-inflicted-on-jewish-people-by-antisemitism-row-labour\">apologised that April</a>&nbsp;for hurt caused to the Jewish community by problems in the process and pointed to only 0.1% of members being under investigation for alleged antisemitic comments.</p>\n    <p>But the party was also mired in a row about whether to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, which it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/04/labour-adopts-ihra-antisemitism-definition-in-full\">ended up ultimately approving</a>. Then accusations of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/02/new-labour-party-row-over-antisemitism-jeremy-corbyn\">political interference in the complaints process</a>&nbsp;by aides close to Corbyn began to emerge earlier this year, which the party strongly denies.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>When did the complaints about antisemitism turn into a full-blown crisis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The resignations of some MPs and peers over antisemitism in February 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/28/labour-worst-day-shame-tom-watson-luciana-berger-resignation\">alarmed many Labour colleagues</a>.

However, many of his supporters in the party backed a campaign saying he had been vilified and badly treated.

Seumas Milne, one of Corbyn\u2019s closest aides, told officials the party was 'muddling up political disputes with racism' and must review processes.

The thought of things getting worse, and me not speaking out when I could, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to live with myself.\u201d Withers Green started working for Labour full-time from February 2017, having joined the party three years earlier. \u201cI wanted to work for the party for the same reason I joined as a member, I believe and still believe the Labour party can be the greatest force for fairness, equality and anti-racism,\u201d she said. \u201cI was excited to play my part in that, to help the party in ways I could, to help people, to change society.\u201d Withers Green said she had not voted for Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 but when he was elected, she was interested to see what would happen with his leadership. \u201cI wasn\u2019t hostile to him \u2026 my doubts might have been more about his electoral prospects, not his politics,\u201d she said. Before she started her job, which included preparing cases against members facing expulsion by the party\u2019s highest disciplinary body, the National Constitutional Committee, she said antisemitism had barely crossed her radar. \u201cIt seemed archaic, I didn\u2019t know anything about the issue,\u201d she said. She said complaints of anti-Jewish racism were \u201cfar, far more\u201d than any other form of racism or hatred but she said she began to notice \u201can increasingly high bar for what constituted antisemitism\u201d. \u201cPeople I was working with would show me antisemitic things on their screens and I\u2019d flinch \u2013 and then it was deemed not antisemitism or at least the sanctions were lessened to a warning or a reminder of conduct, which means nothing,\u201d she said. She said the pressure externally to deal with the issue, as well as alleged interference in the process, took a punishing toll on her mental health. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t notice it creeping up on me but the atmosphere was absolutely horrendous. I ended up really quite unwell, having to leave because I was too depressed and anxious to go into work, which is not a problem I had ever struggled with before,\u201d she said. Withers Green was signed off sick in June 2018. \u201cIt was like being pincered, it felt like the leader\u2019s office were blaming us for not having dealt with antisemitism but also completely hindering our ability to do so,\u201d she said. \u201cOne day I woke up and I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. I have never, ever had that before. I only realised then how bad it had been. I knew I couldn\u2019t put myself back in there.\u201d It was at that point that she agreed to sign a non-disclosure agreement to leave without working her notice. \u201cI had to see a lawyer before I signed but I still didn\u2019t feel I had a choice. It was what I needed to do to leave,\u201d she said. Withers Green said she knew she could potentially face legal action for breaking the NDA. \u201cThat\u2019s a risk,\u201d she said. Short-term, she is more worried about being the target of trolls, having seen the kind of abuse that can occur, though she is not on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m scared, yes. I have literally been in the department which saw the abuse people received. And I absolutely never thought I would be the target,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have the opportunity to speak out and not many other people have that experience, I\u2019m one of the only people who can.\u201d A Labour spokesperson robustly rejected the allegations in the documentary, saying the party was \u201cimplacably opposed to antisemitism and is determined to root out this social cancer from our movement and society\u201d. The spokesperson added that Corbyn had \u201cproactively addressed antisemitism within the party in direct communications to the party membership, in articles, speeches, videos and interviews\u201d. Withers Green said she remains a member of the party, but said she had no confidence in change while Corbyn remained leader. \u201cI think Corbyn is ultimately responsible. Unless he has been deceived entirely, the buck has to stop somewhere,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anyone that has interfered in any of the cases should be still in position. If you are willing to do that, then you are crossing a line. Protecting your mates above the Labour party\u2019s core values, if you are willing to do that, there is no redeeming that, they should step aside. \u201cI am hopeful and I believe there is redemption for the party. I want to see the Labour party as the extraordinary force for good that I know it can be, I want that back.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tim Lott\u2019s first novel, White City Blue, was acclaimed as heralding a golden age of \u201clad lit\u201d that would ignite men\u2019s passion for fiction the way Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary had for women. That was in 1999. Now, eight novels later, Lott has gone back to White City Blue\u2019s four London blokes to bring them up to date, taking them from Millennium Eve (\u201cWho\u2019s on Jools?\u201d \u201cJamiroquai\u201d) through to the 2008 property crash in a series of time jumps.

      "bodyText": "Anthony Albanese\u2019s vow to expel John Setka from the ALP next week is in tatters, after lawyers agreed the party\u2019s national executive would not move against the union boss until after a supreme court decision was handed down. Setka, the Victorian state secretary of the CFMMEU, is challenging the legality of a push to expel him from the party, and would have sought an urgent injunction in a bid to stop the Labor leader from doing so at a national executive meeting on 15 July. Instead, at the end of the hearing, counsel for Labor, Michael Borsky QC, gave an undertaking that an expulsion motion against Setka would not go ahead on Monday. Justice Peter Riordan said the complexity of the case meant he could not rule before the meeting next week. Riordan reserved his judgment, telling the court he hoped to hand down his decision in August. Counsel for Setka, Geoffrey Kennett SC, told the court the union boss\u2019s reputation would be harmed if he was expelled from the party in a decision that was later found to be unlawful. His membership is currently suspended. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of some significance to his reputation,\u201d he said. After Setka launched his legal bid last week, a defiant Albanese said: \u201cHe will not be advocating after 15 July as a member of the Labor party.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Riordan had earlier hinted he would consider granting an injunction, saying the \u201cbalance of convenience\u201d was in Setka\u2019s favour. Borsky, acting for Labor\u2019s national secretary Noah Carroll, told the court the party should be able to expel Setka at the Monday meeting because if the court found the decision was \u201cmade without power\u201d the \u201cconsequences \u2026 would not flow\u201d. The case hinges on whether Labor\u2019s national executive has the power to bypass a state party branch in order to expel a party member. Borsky said it would be \u201cunworkable for a national political party\u201d to be required to follow the procedures of each state branch, including the Victorian body of which Setka is a member. \u201cWe say that\u2019s nonsensical, with respect,\u201d he said. Kennett said he was not arguing Setka \u201chas not done anything that could possibly justify his expulsion\u201d. But he described a letter from Albanese as \u201ca charge sheet\u201d that \u201cdoesn\u2019t allege which rules have been breached\u201d. Setka was last month found guilty of harassing a woman via a carriage service, which was revealed to be his wife, Emma Walters. He argues his expulsion would harm his reputation and limit his ability to advocate for his members. Borsky compared Setka\u2019s potential expulsion to the ability of the national executive to override state branch laws to preselect candidates. He also said Setka\u2019s \u201creputation on one view has been tarnished already\u201d and that any impact from his potential expulsion was only \u201cspeculation\u201d. Setka\u2019s position has split the union movement, with more than a dozen unions saying he should step down from his position as union boss, while others have publicly backed him. Albanese had moved quickly to say he would banish Setka from the party, but the saga now looks likely to drag on for weeks, if not months. \u201cMy view is this is a matter that could well go to the high court,\u201d Riordan said. Setka and Carroll did not appear in court.",

The first is to run a number of anti-malware programs to find and remove the bad stuff. The second is to reset it to factory condition.</p> <p>Most people take the software approach. This can take quite a long time, but you don\u2019t have to re-install all your programs and data.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t have a lot of programs and data to restore, then a reset could be quicker. In this case, you can either use Windows 10\u2019s built-in reset system or take the nuclear option of reinstalling Windows 10 from scratch. I recommend the nuclear option for bad virus infections and for laptops that only have 32GB of built-in storage. It\u2019s also the best option if you are going to sell a laptop, or give it away.</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s better to avoid having the problem. It\u2019s well over a decade since malware affected any of the PCs in our house. That includes my wife\u2019s machines, and she has no interest in becoming a computer expert.</p> <p>Assuming you run antivirus software and have a firewall turned on, you can generally avoid Windows malware by keeping all your software up to date \u2013 which I do \u2013 and by not making any silly mistakes. Today, this seems to apply even if the only antivirus software you run is Microsoft\u2019s Windows Defender. Which in my case, it is.</p> <h2><strong>Fear the rootkit</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7fcc9ee69041e9ce2699066b500ce1bf4b1785f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7fcc9ee69041e9ce2699066b500ce1bf4b1785f/0_123_3600_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rootkits are the worst.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rootkits can be a pain to spot and remove.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whichever route you take, start by running one or more programs designed to find rootkits and similar software. Rootkits are designed to avoid detection, sometimes for many years. Rootkit writers try to hide code in places where they can avoid detection. Late last year, ESET antivirus researchers found rootkit code hidden in <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/apt28-uses-lojax-first-uefi-rootkit-seen-in-the-wild/\">the Flash memory of a PC\u2019s Serial Peripheral Interface</a> (SPI), where it could survive even if you did a clean reinstallation or changed the hard drive.</p> <p>This was the first attack of its kind to affect Windows 10, but it could become more common. It\u2019s the kind of approach used to attack IoT (Internet of Things) devices, where recovery involves not only changing the software but updating the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware\">firmware</a>.</p> <p>Users sometimes find out they have a rootkit because something odd \u2013 high processor usage or unexplained internet traffic \u2013 prompts them to check their firewall logs to find the culprit. Rootkits act mainly as backdoors so that other programs, such as keyloggers and viruses, can be installed from remote servers. This is one way malware can reappear after you\u2019ve removed it.</p> <p>You can check for rootkits by running the Windows Defender Offline scan. To do this, run the Windows Security app (which used to be the Windows Defender Security Center) and select \u201cVirus and threat protection\u201d. In the section for current threats, click on the words \u201cScan options\u201d. Click the radio button for the Windows Defender Offline scan and then hit \u201cScan now\u201d. This will restart your PC.</p> <p>Several companies also offer free rootkit scanners. Try <a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/antirootkit/\">Malwarebytes Anti-Rootkit</a>, which is now being beta-tested, and Sophos\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-tools/sophos-anti-rootkit.aspx\">Rootkit Removal</a>. For more information, see CSO\u2019s: <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3222066/how-to-detect-and-remove-a-rootkit-in-windows-10.html\">How to identify, prevent and remove rootkits in Windows 10</a>.</p> <p>Rootkits are scary but relatively rare. I\u2019ve never found one despite decades of trying.</p> <h2><strong>Software cleanups</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8f127f5785f65584bc7d6ad343794a42d65ad7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8f127f5785f65584bc7d6ad343794a42d65ad7c/0_242_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Running repeated one-off scans with collection of different antivirus programs is the best way to make sure all the malware is gone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Running repeated one-off scans with collection of different antivirus programs is the best way to make sure all the malware is gone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you have a PC that has been infected for a while, don\u2019t run one scan and think you\u2019ve solved the problem. A bit of malware that\u2019s become securely embedded may well bring in its friends, who will bring their friends. Some of them will try to hide each other. Remove one malicious program and a second scan \u2013 or scanning with a different utility \u2013 may find other malicious programs that were previously hidden.</p> <p>Save and back up your work, and for the best results, keep these three things in mind:</p> <p><strong>1. No single antivirus program will always find everything. </strong>Try two or \u2013 if one of them is Windows Defender \u2013 preferably more. It\u2019s a bad idea to install more than one antivirus program, but you can run one-off scans with as many as you like. <a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/\">Malwarebytes Anti-Malware</a> and <a href=\"https://www.safer-networking.org/products/spybot-free-edition/\">Spybot Free Edition</a> (formerly Spybot Search &amp; Destroy) have often found things other programs have missed. <a href=\"https://www.avast.com/c-malware\">Avast</a> is another good option. <a href=\"https://www.eset.com/uk/home/online-scanner/\">ESET</a> has a good free online scanner. Kaspersky\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/downloads/thank-you/free-virus-removal-tool\">Virus Removal Tool</a> could be worth a go. Malwarebytes\u2019 (formerly Xplode\u2019s) <a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/\">AdwCleaner</a> targets PUPs (potentially unwanted programs) that some antivirus products leave alone.</p> <p><strong>2. No single scan will always find everything. </strong>Checking every file for every known virus could take hours, and some malware can hide other malware. If an antivirus program finds some malware, restart your PC, run it again and it may find more.</p> <p>And while it\u2019s useful to run antivirus programs in standard mode, you must run some scans after restarting your PC in <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode\">Safe Mode with Networking</a>.

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s the cheapest way to get my Windows laptop swept and cleaned out of malware etc? Don There are two obvious ways to clean a Windows laptop, and both of them are free. The first is to run a number of anti-malware programs to find and remove the bad stuff. The second is to reset it to factory condition. Most people take the software approach. This can take quite a long time, but you don\u2019t have to re-install all your programs and data. If you don\u2019t have a lot of programs and data to restore, then a reset could be quicker. In this case, you can either use Windows 10\u2019s built-in reset system or take the nuclear option of reinstalling Windows 10 from scratch. I recommend the nuclear option for bad virus infections and for laptops that only have 32GB of built-in storage. It\u2019s also the best option if you are going to sell a laptop, or give it away. Of course, it\u2019s better to avoid having the problem. It\u2019s well over a decade since malware affected any of the PCs in our house. That includes my wife\u2019s machines, and she has no interest in becoming a computer expert. Assuming you run antivirus software and have a firewall turned on, you can generally avoid Windows malware by keeping all your software up to date \u2013 which I do \u2013 and by not making any silly mistakes. Today, this seems to apply even if the only antivirus software you run is Microsoft\u2019s Windows Defender. Which in my case, it is. Fear the rootkit Whichever route you take, start by running one or more programs designed to find rootkits and similar software. Rootkits are designed to avoid detection, sometimes for many years. Rootkit writers try to hide code in places where they can avoid detection. Late last year, ESET antivirus researchers found rootkit code hidden in the Flash memory of a PC\u2019s Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), where it could survive even if you did a clean reinstallation or changed the hard drive. This was the first attack of its kind to affect Windows 10, but it could become more common. It\u2019s the kind of approach used to attack IoT (Internet of Things) devices, where recovery involves not only changing the software but updating the firmware. Users sometimes find out they have a rootkit because something odd \u2013 high processor usage or unexplained internet traffic \u2013 prompts them to check their firewall logs to find the culprit. Rootkits act mainly as backdoors so that other programs, such as keyloggers and viruses, can be installed from remote servers. This is one way malware can reappear after you\u2019ve removed it. You can check for rootkits by running the Windows Defender Offline scan. To do this, run the Windows Security app (which used to be the Windows Defender Security Center) and select \u201cVirus and threat protection\u201d. In the section for current threats, click on the words \u201cScan options\u201d. Click the radio button for the Windows Defender Offline scan and then hit \u201cScan now\u201d. This will restart your PC. Several companies also offer free rootkit scanners. Try Malwarebytes Anti-Rootkit, which is now being beta-tested, and Sophos\u2019s Rootkit Removal. For more information, see CSO\u2019s: How to identify, prevent and remove rootkits in Windows 10. Rootkits are scary but relatively rare. I\u2019ve never found one despite decades of trying. Software cleanups If you have a PC that has been infected for a while, don\u2019t run one scan and think you\u2019ve solved the problem. A bit of malware that\u2019s become securely embedded may well bring in its friends, who will bring their friends. Some of them will try to hide each other. Remove one malicious program and a second scan \u2013 or scanning with a different utility \u2013 may find other malicious programs that were previously hidden. Save and back up your work, and for the best results, keep these three things in mind: 1. No single antivirus program will always find everything. Try two or \u2013 if one of them is Windows Defender \u2013 preferably more. It\u2019s a bad idea to install more than one antivirus program, but you can run one-off scans with as many as you like. Malwarebytes Anti-Malware and Spybot Free Edition (formerly Spybot Search &amp; Destroy) have often found things other programs have missed. Avast is another good option. ESET has a good free online scanner. Kaspersky\u2019s Virus Removal Tool could be worth a go. Malwarebytes\u2019 (formerly Xplode\u2019s) AdwCleaner targets PUPs (potentially unwanted programs) that some antivirus products leave alone. 2. No single scan will always find everything. Checking every file for every known virus could take hours, and some malware can hide other malware. If an antivirus program finds some malware, restart your PC, run it again and it may find more. And while it\u2019s useful to run antivirus programs in standard mode, you must run some scans after restarting your PC in Safe Mode with Networking. Safe Mode loads a minimal set of programs and drivers, which makes malware somewhat easier to spot. 3. You may need outside help. Some virus infestations are particularly hard to remove. Happily, you can go to an online forum and get an expert to analyse the problem and walk you through the removal process. In this case, my first choice would be Bleeping Computer. It provides a simple tutorial on removing malware and, if that fails, clear instructions on how to request help. The alternatives include, in alphabetical order, BestTechie, Geeks to Go and Major Geeks. These forums are run by volunteers so be respectful, follow instructions, and reply promptly.

Against this historical backdrop, the novel explores the lives of a professor, his girlfriend, their houseboy and the various other people they encounter. Adichie offers an account of one of Nigeria\u2019s most deadly and divisive periods with writing that is far more accessible and delicate than any history book.<strong> Ore Ogunbiyi</strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/children-of-blood-and-bone.html\">Children of Blood and Bone by Tomi Adeyemi</a><br></strong>Adeyemi has <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/2/28/adeyemi-interview/\">described her novel</a> as \u201can allegory for the modern black experience, for people who aren\u2019t black to understand what it\u2019s like to walk in our shoes\u201d. Using both history and fantasy, she whisks you away into the world of Or\u00efsha, full of magic and family betrayals. Her descriptions are vibrant and vivid; so many scenes lingered in my mind and followed me into my dreams. <strong>Chelsea Kwakye</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f02c0772c08a0b748c8d4c8367c2397f69c5dd6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f02c0772c08a0b748c8d4c8367c2397f69c5dd6e/40_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frantz Fanon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frantz Fanon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout/HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/wretched-of-the-earth.html\">The Wretched of the Earth by Frantz Fanon</a><br></strong>This book is almost solely responsible for the passion that fuelled my Cambridge application. Fanon details the impact of colonialism on the psyches of black people. For the first time, I was able to understand empire as more than just an economic phenomenon, and in turn how much Africa\u2019s decolonisation was expected to reverse. Reading it more than 50 years after publication was a visceral confrontation with a legacy that remains a shadow over black people. <strong>OO</strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557462/biased-by-jennifer-l-eberhardt-phd/9780735224933/\">Biased: The New Science of Race and Inequality by Jennifer Eberhardt</a><br></strong>Although grounded in scientific research, this book dissects how our ideas of race are social constructs. Eberhardt details experiences, conversations and most notably, interactions with her own kids who try to articulate their racial trauma. Biased has given me a well-rounded and critical understanding of racial bias and answers the tough question: why does it exist at all? <strong>CK</strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/eloquent-rage-9781250112880.html\">Eloquent Rage: A Black Feminist Discovers Her Superpower by Brittney Cooper</a><br></strong>The \u201cangry black woman\u201d trope is tired and boring, but as black girls we have to prepare ourselves for a world that is going to think of us this way. Cooper gives us permission to not only be angry but to use our anger. She invites other black women to share in her experiences, including desiring men while often feeling let down by them; finding a balance between her faith and her feminism; and learning the art of self-love in a society plagued with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/05/what-is-misogynoir\">misogynoir</a>. <strong>OO</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9c2a0af651cb023e83a360d1176fcdb595039aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9c2a0af651cb023e83a360d1176fcdb595039aa/0_216_5702_3421/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yaa Gyasi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yaa Gyasi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emma-Sofia Olsson/SvD/TT/TT News Agency/Press Association Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/homegoing-520856.html\">Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi</a><br></strong>The best book I have read. I laughed, gasped and cried within a matter of a few pages. Starting on Ghana\u2019s Gold Coast and ending at Stanford University, Gyasi takes you on an emotional rollercoaster through one family story. This novel was a stark reminder of how much family history I didn\u2019t know \u2013 and worse, how much was lost and destroyed. <strong>CK</strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/secret-lives-of-baba-segi-s-wives.html\">The Secret Lives of the Four Wives by Lola Shoneyin</a><br></strong>From the dramatic storyline that could have been straight out of a Nollywood film, to Shoneyin\u2019s poetic command of both the Yoruba and English languages, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. A hilarious tale about a polygamous family in modern-day Nigeria, told with both refreshing candour and subtlety, interwoven with themes of Nigerian patriarchy. <strong>OO</strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-color-purple-9781474607254.html\">The Color Purple by Alice Walker</a><br></strong>At the age of 12, my sister and I watched the starry film (Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover) of Walker\u2019s book. I remember being shocked by the physical, emotional and sexual abuse of the protagonist Celie, at the hands of the men (and women) in her life. It was my first exposure to how segregation and racial politics played out in the everyday lives of African Americans. It should be mandatory reading for every black girl. Walker isn\u2019t afraid to expose her readers to a story that is raw and powerful. <strong>CK</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5805e834560df06e1f3f0071d1fc713860b1936\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5805e834560df06e1f3f0071d1fc713860b1936/0_247_2776_1665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chika Unigwe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chika Unigwe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geraint Lewis/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/on-black-sisters-street-by-chika-unigwe-5486150.html\">On Black Sisters\u2019 Street by Chika Unigwe</a><br></strong>I read this novel when I was 14 but the aftertaste still lingers. For so long, I had viewed Nigeria as a paradise of sorts, but Unigwe cleverly exposes what drives Nigerian women to want to leave, and how many are so desperate to stay away that they end up in sex work. Despite the hardships the women in this book have been through, Unigwe doesn\u2019t portray them as passive or defined by their victimhood. Instead, it taught me the importance of empathy and solidarity, even in the most brutal circumstances. <strong>OO</strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/there-ain-t-no-black-in-the-union-jack.html\">There Ain\u2019t No Black in the Union Jack by Paul Gilroy</a><br></strong>This book has helped me understand the rhetoric used in our divisive times \u2013 by the government, politicians and ordinary people \u2013 when we talk about the UK\u2019s cultural and racial politics. Gilroy challenges the concept of nationhood, suggesting that the idea immigration is a \u201cnational decline\u201d is based on a fallacy that populations are a \u201chomogenous and continuous national stock\u201d. This has never been the case and as a society we need to move away from describing migration in what Gilroy calls \u201cmilitary metaphors\u201d. A complex mosaic of experiences exist \u2013 this should not be simplified for the sake of lacklustre public debate. <strong>CK</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Taking Up Space: The Black Girl\u2019s Manifesto for Change by Chelsea Kwakye and Ore Ogunbiyi is published by #Merky Books.

That\u2019s exactly what we aim to do in Taking Up Space: The Black Girl\u2019s Manifesto for Change, which ends with a list of our favourite reads to inspire black girls everywhere to look beyond a canon that may not include them. Here are some of them. Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Though I went to school in Nigeria for more than five years, Half of a Yellow Sun was my first real encounter with the devastating Biafran civil war of the late 1960s that remains a sore memory for many Nigerians. Against this historical backdrop, the novel explores the lives of a professor, his girlfriend, their houseboy and the various other people they encounter. Adichie offers an account of one of Nigeria\u2019s most deadly and divisive periods with writing that is far more accessible and delicate than any history book. Ore Ogunbiyi Children of Blood and Bone by Tomi Adeyemi Adeyemi has described her novel as \u201can allegory for the modern black experience, for people who aren\u2019t black to understand what it\u2019s like to walk in our shoes\u201d. Using both history and fantasy, she whisks you away into the world of Or\u00efsha, full of magic and family betrayals. Her descriptions are vibrant and vivid; so many scenes lingered in my mind and followed me into my dreams. Chelsea Kwakye The Wretched of the Earth by Frantz Fanon This book is almost solely responsible for the passion that fuelled my Cambridge application. Fanon details the impact of colonialism on the psyches of black people. For the first time, I was able to understand empire as more than just an economic phenomenon, and in turn how much Africa\u2019s decolonisation was expected to reverse. Reading it more than 50 years after publication was a visceral confrontation with a legacy that remains a shadow over black people. OO Biased: The New Science of Race and Inequality by Jennifer Eberhardt Although grounded in scientific research, this book dissects how our ideas of race are social constructs. Eberhardt details experiences, conversations and most notably, interactions with her own kids who try to articulate their racial trauma. Biased has given me a well-rounded and critical understanding of racial bias and answers the tough question: why does it exist at all? CK Eloquent Rage: A Black Feminist Discovers Her Superpower by Brittney Cooper The \u201cangry black woman\u201d trope is tired and boring, but as black girls we have to prepare ourselves for a world that is going to think of us this way. Cooper gives us permission to not only be angry but to use our anger. She invites other black women to share in her experiences, including desiring men while often feeling let down by them; finding a balance between her faith and her feminism; and learning the art of self-love in a society plagued with misogynoir. OO Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi The best book I have read. I laughed, gasped and cried within a matter of a few pages. Starting on Ghana\u2019s Gold Coast and ending at Stanford University, Gyasi takes you on an emotional rollercoaster through one family story. This novel was a stark reminder of how much family history I didn\u2019t know \u2013 and worse, how much was lost and destroyed. CK The Secret Lives of the Four Wives by Lola Shoneyin From the dramatic storyline that could have been straight out of a Nollywood film, to Shoneyin\u2019s poetic command of both the Yoruba and English languages, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. A hilarious tale about a polygamous family in modern-day Nigeria, told with both refreshing candour and subtlety, interwoven with themes of Nigerian patriarchy. OO The Color Purple by Alice Walker At the age of 12, my sister and I watched the starry film (Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover) of Walker\u2019s book. I remember being shocked by the physical, emotional and sexual abuse of the protagonist Celie, at the hands of the men (and women) in her life. It was my first exposure to how segregation and racial politics played out in the everyday lives of African Americans. It should be mandatory reading for every black girl. Walker isn\u2019t afraid to expose her readers to a story that is raw and powerful. CK On Black Sisters\u2019 Street by Chika Unigwe I read this novel when I was 14 but the aftertaste still lingers. For so long, I had viewed Nigeria as a paradise of sorts, but Unigwe cleverly exposes what drives Nigerian women to want to leave, and how many are so desperate to stay away that they end up in sex work. Despite the hardships the women in this book have been through, Unigwe doesn\u2019t portray them as passive or defined by their victimhood. Instead, it taught me the importance of empathy and solidarity, even in the most brutal circumstances. OO There Ain\u2019t No Black in the Union Jack by Paul Gilroy This book has helped me understand the rhetoric used in our divisive times \u2013 by the government, politicians and ordinary people \u2013 when we talk about the UK\u2019s cultural and racial politics. Gilroy challenges the concept of nationhood, suggesting that the idea immigration is a \u201cnational decline\u201d is based on a fallacy that populations are a \u201chomogenous and continuous national stock\u201d. This has never been the case and as a society we need to move away from describing migration in what Gilroy calls \u201cmilitary metaphors\u201d. A complex mosaic of experiences exist \u2013 this should not be simplified for the sake of lacklustre public debate.

In the little encampment tucked away in the valley of H\u00e5rga, Dani finds something close to a second family.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/28/horror-director-ari-aster-hereditary-midsommar-terrors\">Midsommar director Ari Aster: 'I often cling to dead things'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Aster\u2019s dual purposes illustrate a crucial divide in the onscreen portrayal of cults, one more pronounced in recent months as American cinema has seen an uptick in movies about the human side of what\u2019s often been painted with fear and suspicion. There\u2019s plenty of both in Riley Stearns\u2019s new film, The Art of Self-Defense, and yet it takes a more analytically anthropological bent of curiosity to its material than most. The dark, violent comedy illustrates the hazards that face new initiates to non-traditional groups emanating a sinister energy, but Stearns doesn\u2019t want to ride the beats of mounting, Wicker Man-style dread. He\u2019s more preoccupied with what could compel a person to pledge their allegiance to an organization that takes their money, strips them of their dignity and reshapes them into a servant.</p> <p>The main characters of The Art of Self-Defense, Midsommar, Mary Harron\u2019s Charles Manson film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/02/charlie-says-review-matt-smith-is-magnetic-charles-manson-in-unpersuasive-cult-drama\">Charlie Says</a>, the Symbionese Liberation Army film American Woman (a selection at this year\u2019s Tribeca film festival), even Quentin Tarantino\u2019s upcoming Once Upon a Time in Hollywood all have a handful of traits in common. They match a broad psychological profile: wayward souls without a spouse or family to care for, an absence of any meaningful personal philosophy, an overall surplus of internal voids in need of filling. Stearns\u2019s film revolves around the dictionary definition of a beta male in accountant Casey Davies, the kind of ineffectual nebbish who does nothing when he\u2019s openly mocked by French tourists unaware that he can understand them. After he\u2019s roughed up in a mugging, he notices an advertisement for a local martial arts class and apprehensively enrolls in the hopes of changing his life for the better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9ff07ddd32392b35e1111ac924cf8947f8f594b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ff07ddd32392b35e1111ac924cf8947f8f594b5/0_0_1449_967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Florence Pugh in Midsommar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Florence Pugh in Midsommar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/A24</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s the turning point at which hapless Casey falls into the trap laid by his peculiarly intense karate instructor, in the moment at which his needs expand from simple bulking-up to a more existential register. Where straight-horror films like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/10/apostle-review-gareth-evans-exhilarating-netflix-horror-is-a-wild-gory-surprise\">Apostle</a> have drawn chilling, surreal terror from the cult concept, horror-adjacent projects get something even more disturbing from concentrating on the seductive mental lure of the same subject. Manson\u2019s teenybopper disciples survived their own scary movie of hypnosis and villainy, but Harron\u2019s film shows how they believed they themselves saved souls at the time and for decades onward.</p> <p>Any cult worth its hallucinogenic salts operates by perceiving what the mark requires and then giving it to them through a community of surrogate loved ones. Casey, for instance, wants nothing more than to be strong. His manipulative sensei senses this, and prescribes a regimen of hyper-masculinity including black coffee, heavy metal music and a bloodthirsty pooch for a pet. The yellow karate belt grows into a symbol of not of strength, but composure; Casey starts wearing a mustard-colored belt with his everyday clothes because it makes him feel like he\u2019s master of his domain.</p> <p>This phenomenon takes root with particular frequency in the US, and the movies suggest a thesis as to why. These characters get caught between a culture of compulsory self-actualization \u2013 a national obsession with making ourselves whole, happy, successful and complete \u2013 and the rarity of actually achieving that ideal perched all the way on the tippy-top of Maslow\u2019s pyramid. An effective cult leans into this dissonance, first instilling in the mark that they lack the fundamentals required to live their best life, and then inserting itself as the salvational force.

      "bodyText": "As he\u2019s been making the press-circuit rounds in support of his latest feature Midsommar, director Ari Aster has stated that the film \u2013 a daytime nightmare about a mentally precarious young woman named Dani (Florence Pugh), her feckless boyfriend (Jack Reynor), and his academia buddies on a trip to Sweden that takes a grisly turn \u2013 only plays as horror to the boys in the cast. They fall victim to a classic set of perils, from ritual evisceration to some rather out-there sexual perversions, but she has a more agreeable go of things. In the little encampment tucked away in the valley of H\u00e5rga, Dani finds something close to a second family. Aster\u2019s dual purposes illustrate a crucial divide in the onscreen portrayal of cults, one more pronounced in recent months as American cinema has seen an uptick in movies about the human side of what\u2019s often been painted with fear and suspicion. There\u2019s plenty of both in Riley Stearns\u2019s new film, The Art of Self-Defense, and yet it takes a more analytically anthropological bent of curiosity to its material than most. The dark, violent comedy illustrates the hazards that face new initiates to non-traditional groups emanating a sinister energy, but Stearns doesn\u2019t want to ride the beats of mounting, Wicker Man-style dread. He\u2019s more preoccupied with what could compel a person to pledge their allegiance to an organization that takes their money, strips them of their dignity and reshapes them into a servant. The main characters of The Art of Self-Defense, Midsommar, Mary Harron\u2019s Charles Manson film Charlie Says, the Symbionese Liberation Army film American Woman (a selection at this year\u2019s Tribeca film festival), even Quentin Tarantino\u2019s upcoming Once Upon a Time in Hollywood all have a handful of traits in common. They match a broad psychological profile: wayward souls without a spouse or family to care for, an absence of any meaningful personal philosophy, an overall surplus of internal voids in need of filling. Stearns\u2019s film revolves around the dictionary definition of a beta male in accountant Casey Davies, the kind of ineffectual nebbish who does nothing when he\u2019s openly mocked by French tourists unaware that he can understand them. After he\u2019s roughed up in a mugging, he notices an advertisement for a local martial arts class and apprehensively enrolls in the hopes of changing his life for the better. That\u2019s the turning point at which hapless Casey falls into the trap laid by his peculiarly intense karate instructor, in the moment at which his needs expand from simple bulking-up to a more existential register. Where straight-horror films like Apostle have drawn chilling, surreal terror from the cult concept, horror-adjacent projects get something even more disturbing from concentrating on the seductive mental lure of the same subject. Manson\u2019s teenybopper disciples survived their own scary movie of hypnosis and villainy, but Harron\u2019s film shows how they believed they themselves saved souls at the time and for decades onward. Any cult worth its hallucinogenic salts operates by perceiving what the mark requires and then giving it to them through a community of surrogate loved ones. Casey, for instance, wants nothing more than to be strong. His manipulative sensei senses this, and prescribes a regimen of hyper-masculinity including black coffee, heavy metal music and a bloodthirsty pooch for a pet. The yellow karate belt grows into a symbol of not of strength, but composure; Casey starts wearing a mustard-colored belt with his everyday clothes because it makes him feel like he\u2019s master of his domain. This phenomenon takes root with particular frequency in the US, and the movies suggest a thesis as to why. These characters get caught between a culture of compulsory self-actualization \u2013 a national obsession with making ourselves whole, happy, successful and complete \u2013 and the rarity of actually achieving that ideal perched all the way on the tippy-top of Maslow\u2019s pyramid. An effective cult leans into this dissonance, first instilling in the mark that they lack the fundamentals required to live their best life, and then inserting itself as the salvational force. Isolation from the outside world and its systems of support plays a significant role; note how these films predominantly take place in California or the faceless sprawl of suburbia, climates where young adults can easily slip away from interpersonal contact if they let themselves. Horror cinema works under the principle that even in the most fanciful of stories, the trace amounts of the real will excel as the most frightening component. Monsters don\u2019t wield quite as much fearsome power as the unknown, just as the enveloping sway of a cult can be more chilling than its ceremonial bloodletting.

      "bodyText": "The National Disability Insurance Agency is set to appeal a tribunal decision that found a woman with multiple sclerosis had the right to have her sexual therapy funded by the insurance scheme. In a setback for the agency, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruled the woman was entitled to the services of a sexual therapist specially trained in treating disabled people. The tribunal said she should receive $10,000 a year to fund the treatment. The National Disability Insurance Agency has previously stressed it \u201cdoes not cover sexual services, sexual therapy or sex workers in a participant\u2019s NDIS plan\u201d and the minister, Stuart Robert, confirmed on Thursday it would appeal to the federal court. Disability advocates labelled it a \u201cfantastic win\u201d, but expressed disappointment the tribunal stopped short of ruling that the disability scheme could also fund sex work services. Instead, in a decision handed down this week, the tribunal sought to distinguish between the services of a sex worker and a sex therapist. The tribunal\u2019s deputy president, Brian Rayment, said the woman did not want funding to see a sex worker but \u201crather she seeks the services of a specially trained sex therapist, a term which I have used to draw attention to an important difference\u201d. The woman, whose identity was not published, was described as in her 40s, single and had stopped seeking a partner when she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis about 15 years ago. \u201cShe has sexual needs,\u201d Rayment said in the judgment. \u201cShe attributes her inability to locate a partner to her disability, and has explained why that is so.\u201d The tribunal did not publish what Rayment said were \u201cspecial features of the case\u201d that meant it would be unlikely she could find a partner who could help her \u201cobtain sexual release\u201d. \u201cNor, if she ever found a partner, would she be able to sexually stimulate the partner, because of matters referred to in the confidential reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cHer condition also prevents her from masturbation.\u201d Matthew Bowden, the co-chief executive of People with Disability Australia, described the outcome as \u201ca fantastic win for this woman with disability\u201d. \u201cIt acknowledges her right as a woman with disability to an ordinary life that includes sexual satisfaction and that her disability impacts directly on her ability to self-pleasure and in turn give sexual pleasure,\u201d he said.

He also warned the tribunal had made an \u201cunnecessary distinction between sex therapy and sex work services\u201d, which could \u201cdeny people with disability the same rights to sex as non-disabled people\u201d. \u201cIt is not the choice of the majority of people to access the support of a sex worker, however some people with disability do and we fully support that choice.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In Denmark, sex work services are publicly funded for the disabled, while sex therapy is funded in other Nordic countries.

      "bodyText": "Tourists are travelling to Uluru to climb the rock, against the wishes of the traditional owners, to get in before the practice is banned in October. Parks Australia said there were \u201ccertainly visitors travelling with the intention of climbing Uluru before the climb closure comes into effect\u201d. The management board of the Uluru-Kata Tjuta national park voted unanimously in November 2017 to ban tourists climbing Uluru. Dozens of photos of crowds of tourists scaling the world heritage-listed site have been posted on Instagram and Twitter. The ABC reported that tourists were trespassing, illegally camping and dumping rubbish in the lead-up to the closure. Anangu, the traditional owners, have long requested that visitors not climb Uluru because it is a sacred men\u2019s site, and because they feel cultural responsibility over the high number of deaths and injuries incurred from climbing. There have been 37 confirmed deaths since the 1950s. The last was a 76-year-old Japanese tourist in July last year.

Black voices of anticolonialism and revolution, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/aug/04/highereducation.news\" title=\"\">CLR James</a>, Claude McKay and George Padmore, now instructed their British comrades on what being on the receiving end of empire really meant.</p> <p>Drawing attention to this new wave of organised opposition to empire \u2013 not only Britain\u2019s, but also the colonialism of all the European powers \u2013 is an important addition and corrective to that all that has been written recently about the rise and fall of liberal internationalism in the two decades after the Treaty of Versailles of 1919. In many ways, the League of Nations, and then later the Commonwealth, were established to prop up the old European empires, not dismantle them. Gopal shows how this was challenged and contested at every turn. As her final chapter on the British endgame in Africa demonstrates, decolonisation (as the British withdrawal from empire euphemistically used to be known) was as brutal and illiberal in its final stages as it was at the outset. Yet even then voices of dissent could be heard, as her vignette describing the Movement for Colonial Freedom, led by Brockway, brings out vividly. Gopal ends her book where she began, in Oxford, with Margery Perham, the distinguished colonial expert, whose life journey is retold as a passage out of Africa, with Mau Mau as the turning point in her rejection of Britain\u2019s imperial mission. Significantly, in the 1960s Perham went on to help set up some of the first universities of the new African nations, supporting degree programmes that broke with the old convention of exporting textbooks from the mother country, replacing colonial curricula with courses better suited to African needs.</p> <p>This is an important book. Some narratives are told for the first time, others are retold in a different register. Gopal is particularly astute at specifying links between calls for colonial independence overseas and workers\u2019 movements back in Britain, connections that older studies have struggled to show. Polemic there is, but her battles with the empire denial lobby come in the opening pages and towards the close, and do not detract from a rigorous, persuasive revisionist history.</p> <p>But did anti-imperialism really shape British dissent, as she suggests? For all their outrage, her \u201ctroublemakers\u201d sit on the margins of radicalism, never quite converting the rest of the left to a comprehensive rejection of empire. It is hard to recall a leading British radical who has staked a reputation on repudiating empire, in the same way as William Jennings Bryan did in 1900, for example, when he lashed out at the Spanish-American war in his pursuit of the White House. What\u2019s more, empire has never split the British left as it did the German SPD before 1914, or the French Communist party in the 1960s. Deeply rooted in the pacifist traditions of Protestant dissent, British radicals have always been more comfortable opposing war than empire. Conversely, many historians would point to another dissenting tradition \u2013 the radical right \u2013 that has weaponised imperialism and given it a home in the modern Conservative party. From Joseph Chamberlain to Enoch Powell and on to the apologists for Victorian imperialism now lying in wait for a seat at the table of the new Brexit cabinet, empire has had a noisier impact at the Tory end of the political spectrum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/27/bristol-city-slave-trader-edward-colston\">Bristol: the city that lauds the slave trader | David Olusoga</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It need not remain that way.

      "bodyText": "Millions of US taxpayer dollars are being invested into private prison operators involved in the detention of thousands of migrants across the United States, an investigation shows. Some of the largest investments, which are by pension funds for public sector workers such as teachers and firefighters, come from states with \u201csanctuary\u201d policies, such as New York, California and Oregon. Nationwide, at least 20 pension funds and plans have invested in Geo Group or CoreCivic, the two biggest private prison operators, according to a Guardian/Documented analysis of US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings. These funds range from big organizations like the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (CalPers), which manages $81bn in stock holdings, to the more modestly sized funds like the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board, which manages about $2.3bn. Public worker funds across the US have at least $67m currently invested in the two companies, according to filings from the first quarter of 2019, which probably show just a portion of the total amount of public sector pension money invested in both companies. The two firms have become more attractive to investors after Donald Trump became president, pushing tougher immigration policies. The firms have secured contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) which has turned to private operators as it has detained growing numbers of immigrants. \u2018Complicity is unacceptable\u2019 While the holdings in the SEC filings are only a tiny proportion of the estimated $3.8tn invested in public retirement funds, immigration advocacy campaigners and some lawmakers say they have a symbolic power, and have called for public pensions funds to follow the lead of some banks and disinvest. Last week it emerged one of Canada\u2019s biggest pension funds quietly divested from the two firms after the Guardian/Documented had reported late last year that the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) held nearly US$8m in stock in Geo Group and CoreCivic. Disinvestment in private prison operators sent a powerful message, according to Daniel Altschuler, director of civic engagement and research at Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy organization. \u201cTaking a stand sends a message that complicity with companies that are profiting from people\u2019s pain is unacceptable,\u201d said Altschuler. This is a message some major banks have been getting, he added. \u201cAs some cities and states either divest or look at divestment, the banks have been aware of that.\u201d In March, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co decided to stop financing private prison companies. They had previously underwritten bonds and syndicated loans for Geo Group and CoreCivic. Earlier this week SunTrust Bank announced it would be ceasing to do business with the private prison industry.

Other states with immigrant-friendly policies and investments in the two companies include Oregon, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah.

After a hard-fought campaign spearheaded by a group of advocates called Educators for Migrant Justice, the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System into divested the fund\u2019s holdings from CoreCivic in November 2018 and Geo Group, which amounted to about $12m. Now, advocates are focusing on CalPers. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see traction with board members,\u201d said Emily Claire Goldman, founder and director for Educators for Migrant Justice, an ESG transparency initiative.

The groups say they intend to work together to both improve the lives of people and arrest the huge losses of biodiversity by reducing population growth.</p> <p>\u201cThere is very often an overlap of areas facing the greatest need for improved reproductive health services and for conservation,\u201d says a declaration signed by the groups, which include the UN Population Fund, the Jane Goodall Institute and Marie Stopes International. \u201cWe believe that by working together we can help human communities and their ecosystems thrive.\u201d</p> <p>The Goodall institute has provided family planning services as part of its work since 1994, and its founder said bare hills had been returned to forests as women chose to have smaller families. \u201cWith more and more people being born and wanting a better standard of living, it is clear that \u2018business as usual\u2019 will destroy the natural resources of our planet,\u201d Goodall said. \u201cWe only have a small window of time to change things and it is closing fast.\u201d</p> <p>David Johnson, the chief executive of the <a href=\"https://margaretpyke.org/\">Margaret Pyke Trust</a>, which provides contraceptive training to clinicians and which coordinated the campaign, said: \u201cThe existence of barriers to family planning is the most important ignored environmental challenge of our day, but this changes now. It is your right to have as many children as you like, but the problem is that many people are not having the number of children they want.\u201d</p> <p>Phionah Orishaba, a teacher involved with a crane conservation programme in Uganda, said: \u201cEvery day I see the impact that not having access to family planning services has on us women and the environment. Women wanting contraception must do a dangerous six-hour walk to a clinic. Many children are hard to look after. The people are poor and there are no jobs, so they drain wetlands to grow potatoes. They know the cranes need the wetlands to nest and don\u2019t want to hurt them, but what choice do they have?\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cWe are now working with the Margaret Pyke Trust because the women want it and we know that healthcare will be good for both women and the crane.\u201d</p> <p>Matt Jackson, of the UN Population Fund, said: \u201cWe work to achieve zero unmet need for contraception. Conservation organisations play an important role in achieving this vision by working with communities to ensure sustainability, prosperity and empowerment so that people and planet can live in harmony. Together we can achieve our pursuit of rights and choices for all.\u201d</p> <p>Robin Maynard, of Population Matters, said: \u201cThriving Together recognises and celebrates that the actions which address human population growth are positive, not negative. This isn\u2019t about coercion or putting animals ahead of human beings. Barriers to family planning \u2013 whether political and religious or economic \u2013 are barriers to better lives for human beings.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/30/humanity-wiped-out-animals-since-1970-major-report-finds\">Humanity has wiped out 60% of animal populations since 1970, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many scientists believe a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/10/earths-sixth-mass-extinction-event-already-underway-scientists-warn\">sixth mass extinction</a> is under way, largely driven by the destruction of wild habitat for farming and timber and by overhunting.

      "bodyText": "A UN-backed campaign has been launched to help tackle the destruction of wildlife by boosting people\u2019s access to contraception. Growing human populations often underlie the destruction of nature, and barriers to family planning are the \u201cmost important ignored environmental challenge\u201d, say the campaigners. The Thriving Together campaign, launched on World Population Day, unites more than 150 reproductive health and conservation organisations, which spend a combined \u00a38bn a year in 170 countries. The groups say they intend to work together to both improve the lives of people and arrest the huge losses of biodiversity by reducing population growth. \u201cThere is very often an overlap of areas facing the greatest need for improved reproductive health services and for conservation,\u201d says a declaration signed by the groups, which include the UN Population Fund, the Jane Goodall Institute and Marie Stopes International. \u201cWe believe that by working together we can help human communities and their ecosystems thrive.\u201d The Goodall institute has provided family planning services as part of its work since 1994, and its founder said bare hills had been returned to forests as women chose to have smaller families. \u201cWith more and more people being born and wanting a better standard of living, it is clear that \u2018business as usual\u2019 will destroy the natural resources of our planet,\u201d Goodall said. \u201cWe only have a small window of time to change things and it is closing fast.\u201d David Johnson, the chief executive of the Margaret Pyke Trust, which provides contraceptive training to clinicians and which coordinated the campaign, said: \u201cThe existence of barriers to family planning is the most important ignored environmental challenge of our day, but this changes now. It is your right to have as many children as you like, but the problem is that many people are not having the number of children they want.\u201d Phionah Orishaba, a teacher involved with a crane conservation programme in Uganda, said: \u201cEvery day I see the impact that not having access to family planning services has on us women and the environment. Women wanting contraception must do a dangerous six-hour walk to a clinic. Many children are hard to look after. The people are poor and there are no jobs, so they drain wetlands to grow potatoes. They know the cranes need the wetlands to nest and don\u2019t want to hurt them, but what choice do they have?\u201d She added: \u201cWe are now working with the Margaret Pyke Trust because the women want it and we know that healthcare will be good for both women and the crane.\u201d Matt Jackson, of the UN Population Fund, said: \u201cWe work to achieve zero unmet need for contraception. Conservation organisations play an important role in achieving this vision by working with communities to ensure sustainability, prosperity and empowerment so that people and planet can live in harmony. Together we can achieve our pursuit of rights and choices for all.\u201d Robin Maynard, of Population Matters, said: \u201cThriving Together recognises and celebrates that the actions which address human population growth are positive, not negative. This isn\u2019t about coercion or putting animals ahead of human beings. Barriers to family planning \u2013 whether political and religious or economic \u2013 are barriers to better lives for human beings.\u201d Many scientists believe a sixth mass extinction is under way, largely driven by the destruction of wild habitat for farming and timber and by overhunting. The human population is forecast to grow to 9.7 billion by 2050. The impact of the growing population has been debated for many years, and some commentators argue that overconsumption by people in rich nations is a bigger environmental threat than population growth in poorer countries. Goodall said: \u201cWasteful and excessive consumption, so common in wealthier countries, is having devastating impacts on the natural resources of our planet. We must tackle human \u2013 and livestock \u2013 population growth and unsustainable lifestyles.\u201d Sir David Attenborough has frequently expressed concern about human population growth. \u201cAll of our environmental problems become easier to solve with fewer people, and harder \u2013 and ultimately impossible \u2013 to solve with ever more people,\u201d he said in 2013.",

      "bodyText": "Kenya has been urged to halt construction of the country\u2019s first ever coal-powered plant near the coastal town of Lamu, until an assessment is made of its environmental and cultural impact, in the latest setback to the $2bn project (\u00a31.6bn). Plans for the 981MW station, backed by a Chinese-led consortium, are in limbo after Kenyan judges revoked the environmental licence at the end of June. They ruled the authorities had failed to carry out a rigorous environmental assessment and to inform local people of potential impacts. Environmental campaigners \u2013 who took Amu Power and the Kenyan National Environment Management Authority to court over the station \u2013 hailed the ruling as a victory for grassroots lobbying. They had argued that the adverse effect the plant would have on local fishermen and farmland had not been considered. Unesco\u2019s World Heritage Committee, in a meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan this week, called on Kenya to revise the environmental assessments of the coal plant and to consider the potential impact of pollution on the \u201cfragile\u201d stone buildings of Lamu old town, a 14th-century tourist destination and world heritage site. If Kenya fails to submit a new environmental impact statement by February 2020, Lamu could be added to its list of world heritage sites in danger, the committee said. Activists say the plant could trigger breathing problems for locals and acid rain as well as increase Kenya\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions by 700%. The plans lie in contrast to Kenya\u2019s existing commitment to fighting the climate emergency, including generating two-thirds of its electricity by renewable sources and reducing its carbon footprint by a third by 2030. The fossil fuel plant was an example of the dilemmas faced by developing countries with rich environmental and cultural resources, activists said at the Unesco meeting. \u201cOne of the challenges Africa faces is the pursuit to modernise with large development projects as well as rapid and unplanned urbanisation that destroys rich cultural resources. Lamu is a key example of this,\u201d said Mohammed Athman, a board member of Kenyan environmental organisation Save Lamu. The US ambassador to Kenya, Kyle McCarter, has been widely criticised by activists for wading into the debate to argue that coal is environmentally sound, that the plant would boost the country\u2019s economy and that a critical analysis of the project by a US thinktank amounted to the work of \u201chighly paid protesters\u201d. \u201cCoal is the cleanest, least costly option,\u201d the Trump-appointed former Republican senator in Illinois wrote on Twitter, ahead of the ruling on the 26 June. He also cited his experience with coal in his home state as evidence that fossil fuel would work well in Kenya. Mithika Mwenda, the executive director of Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, one of many groups opposing the initiative, raised concerns over the ambassador\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d comments. \u201cWhat interest does the US have in the coal-fired project?\u201d Mwenda said in a statement. \u201cHow will the economy grow if the Kenyan taxpayer is going to be subjected to hugely unsustainable debts, even before we can start producing power?\u201d In sharp contrast to McCarter\u2019s comments, the Chinese ambassador to Kenya told opponents of the plant on 28 June that he supported the will of the Kenyan people on whether or not they want a coal-fired station, according to a Kenyan newspaper. A US state department official told the Guardian that the US backs an approach that takes into account \u201call forms of energy\u201d, including renewables, and stressed electricity must be affordable and reliable to attract investment. \u201cAmerican companies and investors are ready to partner with Kenya to help them achieve an affordable and reliable power grid, in all forms of energy, to support the exponential growth expected in Kenya\u2019s prosperous future using whichever source they choose,\u201d the official said. Construction on the plant was due to begin in 2015, but has been subject to many delays, partly due to opposition from environmentalists. The backers of the initiative say it will help address Kenya\u2019s frequent blackouts and secure energy needs by increasing energy output by nearly a third and generating power that would cost half of what consumers currently pay. But last month, a US thinktank said electricity will cost 10 times more than currently planned. Amu Power has said electricity from the plant will cost $0.072 a kW. However, the US-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said in an independent study \u2013 the most comprehensive on the station\u2019s cost so far \u2013 that the cost projections of the project are \u201cunrealistically low\u201d. It said the project would cost consumers more than $9bn, even if the station never generates any power, and recommended it be cancelled. The station could still be revived if a new environmental assessment addresses the concerns laid out in the June decision. Those defending the plan were given 30 days to appeal.",

Instead, the president appears determined to make his re-election bid about healthcare and relitigate the 2018 midterms. If past is prelude, that tale doesn\u2019t come with a happy ending for Trump or his party. At the moment, Trump may prevail in this latest skirmish over the Affordable Care Act (ACA), at least in the courts. But as far as winning the war for public opinion, that\u2019s a whole other story. Last November, Trump\u2019s hostility toward the ACA ultimately elevated Nancy Pelosi to the House speakership. That same impulse may now cost him his view from the Oval Office. Come election day 2020, his latest dream may degenerate into a nightmare. On Tuesday, Trump attacked the supreme court for previously leaving the ACA in place.

      "bodyText": "The work and pensions secretary has announced a review of the benefits system for terminally ill claimants, in a challenge to the next prime minister to listen to demands for reform. Amber Rudd, who is at risk of being reshuffled out of her cabinet job, laid down a marker on Thursday with the promise of a \u201cfresh and honest evaluation\u201d of the way the system supports terminally ill people. Citing her own experiences, Rudd suggested there should be reform of the current process for those nearing the ends of their lives, whose benefits are subject to special rules for terminal illness (SRTI), which have come under heavy criticism from charities. The rules mean that if a person is living with a terminal illness they can have their benefit claim fast-tracked and paid at an enhanced rate, but many charities, including Marie Curie, have campaigned for claimants not to have to prove that they have six months or less to live. Rudd, whose ex-husband AA Gill died in 2016, said: \u201cHaving a life-limiting illness or severe condition can cause unimaginable suffering from the patient and for their loved ones. Having seen it in my own family I know that the last thing you need is additional financial pressures or unnecessary assessments. \u201cSo that\u2019s why today I am beginning work on a fresh and honest evaluation of our benefits system so that I can be sure that people who are nearing the end of their life get the best possible support. \u201cI hope that this comprehensive evaluation of how we treat those with severe conditions and terminal illnesses will help ensure these vulnerable people get the support they need from our benefits system.\u201d The system has been heavily criticised by charities for denying benefits in some cases to people who have died shortly afterwards and asking insensitive questions such as to name a date when they expect to die. Announcing the review, Rudd\u2019s department said the rules were often seen as favouring those living with cancer when other illnesses can also limit life. She said she wanted to look again to make sure that these processes were working effectively and to see if more could be done to improve engagement with the department for claimants living with the most severe conditions.

      "bodyText": "Facial recognition could be used to replace swipe cards on public transport, the New South Wales government has suggested, but the opposition and digital rights groups say it would pose a risk to privacy. The transport minister, Andrew Constance, said on Tuesday he wanted commuters \u201cin the not too distant future\u201d to be able to board trains using only their faces, with no need for Opal cards, barriers or turnstiles. \u201cI\u2019m about to outline some concepts which may seem pretty crazy and far-fetched,\u201d he told the Sydney Institute on Tuesday. \u201cBut look at it this way \u2013 who would have thought in 1970 that you\u2019d be able to use a handheld device to have a video conversation with someone on the other side of the world? \u201cI want people to not think about their travel. To quite literally turn up and go. Customers have already embraced using their credit cards or electronic device to tap on and off trains.\u201d Constance said he envisioned something similar to Amazon\u2019s \u201cJust Walk Out\u201d technology, which is being trialled in supermarkets. Under that scheme, shoppers are facially scanned, pick the items they want off shelves, then leave. Cameras track which items they took and their accounts are charged. \u201cIn the transport space we\u2019ll use facial recognition technology to scan customers who\u2019ve \u2018opted in\u2019 and linked their Opal account,\u201d Constance said. \u201cNo more gate barriers \u2013 just a smooth journey \u2026 It\u2019s all about making the journey easier and faster for people. I am confident we will also see frictionless transport payments in the not too distant future.\u201d But Labor\u2019s shadow transport minister, Chris Minns, said the idea had come out of nowhere. \u201cIt\u2019s a curious speech from the minister,\u201d he said. \u201cAndrew Constance casually announcing his intention to have facial recognition \u2026 without any reference to consultation with the community. \u201cThe opposition would have major concerns about this technology being rolled out into the network.

It was unclear how any such system would be comply with Europe\u2019s strict privacy laws, which would apply to European citizens using public transport in Australia, Warren said. He said there needed to be a public debate about any plans to roll out the technology. \u201cWe need to stop taking the framing from government that this is something that needs to happen, and rewind and ask why?\u201d Warren said he welcomed consultation with Constance on facial recognition. \u201cEFA would be only too happy to meet with the minister on a regular basis to provide advice on this kind of proposal before it is made public to help the minister avoid making embarrassing statements about technology,\u201d he said. On Tuesday Constance also discussed the potential for scanners to read a person\u2019s retinas, breath or even walking style \u2013 but not necessarily for use on transport. In the future-focused speech, he said the possibilities of all future technology \u201care endless\u201d. \u201cImagine having a \u2018vehicle\u2019 which allows you to do things rather than drive \u2013 all legally,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could work on a laptop, do a work conference call, watch TV or even read the kids a bedtime story via FaceTime. \u201cDigital identity verification will eventually be integrated with biometric recognition.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Gulf flashpoint comes amid growing tensions</h2> \n<p>Good morning briefers. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and here are the top stories.</p> \n<p>Three Iranian boats <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/11/iranian-boats-harass-british-oil-tanker-in-strait-of-hormuz\">have \u201cattempted to impede\u201d a British oil tanker in the Persian Gulf</a>, further deepening tensions in the vital shipping channel off Iran. The incident took place in the Strait of Hormuz through which the commercial vessel, British Heritage, was attempting to pass. \u201cContrary to international law, three Iranian vessels attempted to impede the passage of a commercial vessel, British Heritage, through the Strait of Hormuz,\u201d a UK government statement released on Thursday morning said. The British frigate HMS Montrose was \u201cforced to position herself between the Iranian vessels and British Heritage and issue verbal warnings to the Iranian vessels, which then turned away\u201d, the statement said. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards rejected the claim that they tried to stop the British tanker, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. US defence officials had earlier told Reuters that the incident happened at the northern entrance of the Strait of Hormuz.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Thrown under a bus\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Boris Johnson has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/10/kim-darroch-resigns-as-uk-ambassador-to-us-after-leaked-trump-comment\">throwing the UK ambassador to Washington \u201cunder a bus\u201d</a> after Sir Kim Darroch decided his position in the prestigious role was no longer tenable in the wake of the leaked cables affair. The Guardian understands that Darroch believed he could not go on after he watched Tuesday\u2019s Conservative leadership TV debate, where Johnson repeatedly dodged questions about whether he would sack the ambassador if he became PM. As the senior civil servant at the Foreign Office called an all-staff meeting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/kim-darroch-resignation-effect-international-diplomacy-experts\">to reassure diplomats \u201cshaken\u201d by the shock resignation</a>, Alan Duncan, a Foreign Office minister, was joined by senior Conservative MPs Tom Tugendhat and Sir Patrick McLoughlin in questioning Johnson\u2019s role. Downing Street has been embarrassed by the leak in which Darroch was critical of Donald Trump. Theresa May is understood to be considering appointing a new ambassador in her last week in No 10 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/kim-darroch-effectively-sacked-by-johnson-on-the-orders-of-trump\">amid concerns Johnson could seek to make a controversial political appointment</a> in the hope of pleasing Trump. The affair marks the end of a distinguished 40-year career for the tall and gregarious Darroch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/10/kim-darroch-urbane-diplomat-who-knew-how-to-throw-a-party\">who was dubbed \u201cKimbo\u201d at the Foreign Office</a>. Although never accepted by Trump\u2019s circle, he worked hard to cultivate contacts in Washington where well-connected people would attend his regular parties.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Just like Barcelona\u2019 \u2013 </strong>A study of global warming on major cities says that the climate in London will be more like Barcelona\u2019s by 2050 and Edinburgh\u2019s more like Paris. More than 75% of the urban areas will experience a similar major shift, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/10/global-heating-london-similar-climate-barcelona-2050\">according to an analysis of the world\u2019s 520 major cities</a> by the Crowther Lab. Some cities such as Kuala Lumpur and Singapore will feel a change to conditions never seen before, while London sees more Mediterranean weather, Moscow will be more like Sofia is now and Cardiff will be more similar to Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay. Although some might welcome the warmer temperatures, the changes will also be accompanied by severe drought, the report warns.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Boardroom box-ticking \u2013 </strong>Some big British companies are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/11/uk-firms-accused-hiring-female-directors-for-symbolic-value\">only recruiting women to serve on their boards for their symbolic value</a> and female directors are failing to advance further. Women make up 32% of directors on the boards of the FTSE 100 and are on track to meet the government\u2019s target of 33% by 2020, according to a report by Cranfield University. But women keep their jobs for a shorter time and are less likely to be promoted than men, the report found.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Gulf flashpoint comes amid growing tensions Good morning briefers. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and here are the top stories. Three Iranian boats have \u201cattempted to impede\u201d a British oil tanker in the Persian Gulf, further deepening tensions in the vital shipping channel off Iran. The incident took place in the Strait of Hormuz through which the commercial vessel, British Heritage, was attempting to pass. \u201cContrary to international law, three Iranian vessels attempted to impede the passage of a commercial vessel, British Heritage, through the Strait of Hormuz,\u201d a UK government statement released on Thursday morning said. The British frigate HMS Montrose was \u201cforced to position herself between the Iranian vessels and British Heritage and issue verbal warnings to the Iranian vessels, which then turned away\u201d, the statement said. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards rejected the claim that they tried to stop the British tanker, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. US defence officials had earlier told Reuters that the incident happened at the northern entrance of the Strait of Hormuz. * * * \u2018Thrown under a bus\u2019 \u2013 Boris Johnson has been accused of throwing the UK ambassador to Washington \u201cunder a bus\u201d after Sir Kim Darroch decided his position in the prestigious role was no longer tenable in the wake of the leaked cables affair. The Guardian understands that Darroch believed he could not go on after he watched Tuesday\u2019s Conservative leadership TV debate, where Johnson repeatedly dodged questions about whether he would sack the ambassador if he became PM. As the senior civil servant at the Foreign Office called an all-staff meeting to reassure diplomats \u201cshaken\u201d by the shock resignation, Alan Duncan, a Foreign Office minister, was joined by senior Conservative MPs Tom Tugendhat and Sir Patrick McLoughlin in questioning Johnson\u2019s role. Downing Street has been embarrassed by the leak in which Darroch was critical of Donald Trump. Theresa May is understood to be considering appointing a new ambassador in her last week in No 10 amid concerns Johnson could seek to make a controversial political appointment in the hope of pleasing Trump. The affair marks the end of a distinguished 40-year career for the tall and gregarious Darroch, who was dubbed \u201cKimbo\u201d at the Foreign Office. Although never accepted by Trump\u2019s circle, he worked hard to cultivate contacts in Washington where well-connected people would attend his regular parties. * * * \u2018Just like Barcelona\u2019 \u2013 A study of global warming on major cities says that the climate in London will be more like Barcelona\u2019s by 2050 and Edinburgh\u2019s more like Paris. More than 75% of the urban areas will experience a similar major shift, according to an analysis of the world\u2019s 520 major cities by the Crowther Lab. Some cities such as Kuala Lumpur and Singapore will feel a change to conditions never seen before, while London sees more Mediterranean weather, Moscow will be more like Sofia is now and Cardiff will be more similar to Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay. Although some might welcome the warmer temperatures, the changes will also be accompanied by severe drought, the report warns. * * * Boardroom box-ticking \u2013 Some big British companies are only recruiting women to serve on their boards for their symbolic value and female directors are failing to advance further. Women make up 32% of directors on the boards of the FTSE 100 and are on track to meet the government\u2019s target of 33% by 2020, according to a report by Cranfield University. But women keep their jobs for a shorter time and are less likely to be promoted than men, the report found. The average tenure for female executive directors on FTSE 100 boards is 3.3 years, whereas the average for male directors is 6.6. Among non-executives the average woman has served 3.8 years compared with five years for men. Sue Vinnicombe, Cranfield\u2019s professor of women and leadership, said \u201csome companies have simply been ticking a box \u2026 There is mounting evidence that women have shorter tenures and are less likely to be promoted into senior roles than their male counterparts\u201d. * * * Antisemitism denial \u2013 The Labour party has denied allegations that it interfered with a disciplinary process investigating claims of antisemitism in its ranks. A BBC Panorama programme last night singled out Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s communications chief Seumas Milne and national constitution committee general secretary Jennie Formby for criticism. Eight whistleblowers said they felt undermined by senior Labour figures in their attempts to tackle antisemitism, alleging consistent interference in complaints and claiming that one key aide mocked their efforts. Labour has written a complaint to the BBC about the story. * * * Show some bottle \u2013 Ministers are being urged to adopt a more ambitious return scheme for plastic bottles, cans and glass as campaigners say the government\u2019s own data shows that maximising the recycling could boost the economy by \u00a32bn. The Campaign for the Protection of Rural England says the figures show that a restricted scheme involving only bottles of 750ml or less \u2013 favoured by retailers \u2013 would benefit the economy by just \u00a3250m. Ministers will announce their decision this summer. * * * Beauty turns ugly \u2013 The South Pacific nation of Tonga is in uproar after the island\u2019s annual beauty pageant was marred by accusations of bullying, backstabbing and racism. The Miss Heilala pageant descended into chaos when the outgoing winner was cut off in the middle of a speech detailing how she was \u201ccheated, lied to, backstabbed and just generally mistreated\u201d during her tenure. Another woman was allegedly racially abused while delivering the keynote address. Women\u2019s rights leaders said it showed why \u201ctime is up\u201d for the pageant industry, which should be abandoned altogether.

But anything that gets people watching Will Lorimer\u2019s probing account of one of Britain\u2019s biggest-ever food-related scandals is forgivable. A valuable contemporary perspective on what the programme calls \u201cone of the worst examples of misgovernment since the war\u201d. Mike Bradley Serengeti 8pm, BBC One The cheetah, baboon and lion equivalent of Love Island continues with a new family moving into the Serengeti, forcing the females to take action. A bit like that time when Arabella plonked herself on the sun lounger. Elsewhere, Bakari the baboon is having trouble looking after the baby he rescued. Hannah Verdier Why Can\u2019t We Sleep? 9pm, ITV A useful documentary exploring what some experts are describing as a public health crisis, this examines why so many people in Britain are struggling to get a good night\u2019s sleep. Roughly a third of adults in the UK aren\u2019t getting enough kip and that\u2019s having a dramatic impact on the nation\u2019s health. But is help at hand? MB Catch-22 9pm, Channel 4 In the first of two George Clooney-directed episodes, Yossarian (Christopher Abbott) escapes the base by helping out charming war profiteer Milo with a trip to Oran. He\u2019s soon back in the cockpit, however, hoping to earn his discharge before Colonel Cathcart ups the mission count again. Ellen E Jones Man at Arms: Art of War 9pm, History The hysterically over-excited Danny Trejo presents the second series of this vaguely historical series. We begin in Japan, where Trejo is examining, with slightly unseemly glee, the equipment of \u201cthe rock stars of the warrior world\u201d, the samurai. There\u2019s some interesting technical stuff, if you can get past all the shouting.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing their homes in Mali, where deadly attacks on villages are destabilising an already critical situation in the country\u2019s centre. More than 200,000 people have fled since the start of the year, almost six times the number that were displaced in the same period last year, according to the Rapid Response Mechanism, a tracking and alert system that helps humanitarian organisations respond to vulnerable people. Nearly 600 civilians were killed in the first half of 2019, most of them in the central region of Mopti, where villagers including many women and children have borne the brunt of gruesome attacks attributed to ethnic militias. Herdsmen from the nomadic Fulani ethnic group and hunters from the more settled Dogon have been blamed for these attacks, though neither side has claimed them. Though there are constant smaller-scale attacks, the most deadly of them were in March, when at least 157 people in Ogossogou lost their lives, and in June, when the mayor of Sobame Da said 95 people had been killed, before the governor revised it down to 35. The true total is still unknown, though an unverified list of 101 names of the dead was circulated on Wednesday. Civilians say communities are attacking each other, while the military and armed groups are also fighting. The result is a perfect storm in which those mostly affected are the most vulnerable, such as women and children. \u201cThe first victims of this cycle of violence are civilians,\u201d said the Norwegian Refugee Council\u2019s Hassane Hamadou. \u201cThey are killed, they are maimed, they are threatened; and their only chance of survival is to flee. Today, people are caught between armed groups, self-defence militias and military forces.\u201d In a centre sheltering more than 800 women and children in Bandiagara, the mayor of Doucoumbo, Bogo Kassogu\u00e9, called on the government to respond to the crisis so that everyone could go home and carry on with their lives. \u201cWe have enormous difficulties in this centre \u2013 difficulties concerning food, water and hygiene. Each day, more villagers arrive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people arrived here on 20 June so they\u2019ve been here for one week now. There isn\u2019t even enough space to sleep and move.\u201d There are two other centres in Bandiagara, where conditions are dire, with families huddled in the shadow cast by a wall in the centre, which has only one latrine. But Yadign\u00e9 Djiguiba, a 35-year-old mother of five, said there was no way she could go home, considering what she had seen and experienced. \u201cWe fled because it wasn\u2019t safe. There were killings, gunshots and also the presence of armed men,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as they are there, we do not want to go back.\u201d The attacks in the centre are adding to a crisis in the north that began in 2012 and led to the government losing control of vast swathes of the desert. The humanitarian situation across the country remains critical. Nearly 550,000 people are in urgent need of food, and more than 900 schools are closed. The UN\u2019s peacekeeping mission in Mali has just had its mandate renewed, and although it pledges to protect civilians, researchers say in practice it does not allow its troops to pre-emptively disarm communities. Meanwhile, the Fulani accuse the government of supporting the Dogon militias, although there is no concrete evidence they are providing funding. Yvan Guichaoua, a specialist in rebellions and the rise of jihadism in the Sahel, said the Malian government was creating monsters it could not control. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t have the capacity to impose its own will,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they somehow use loyal groups, but these loyal groups then become something else and start making political claims. What happened in the north, with all the mushrooming of different armed groups, is now also happening in the centre. And this is not about to end.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On 17 January this year, South Africans watched, transfixed, as video from a hidden mobile phone camera was broadcast on TV. It showed a group of men, in corporate uniforms, walking into a vault \u2013 where one of them <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l2aIWYrD84\" title=\"\">counts out bundles of banknotes</a>: \u201cOne, two, three, four, five \u2026 bloody Monopoly money,\u201d he laughs through heavy breaths, \u201cmust be a million.\u201d</p> <p>The man\u2019s name is Gavin Watson, and the whistleblowers who put this video into the public domain claim it shows him counting out bribes to be paid to officials in the South African government. They have given accounts that implicate cabinet ministers, senior lawmakers and even the prosecutors tasked with investigating the corrupt practices of Watson\u2019s logistics company, Bosasa. The video is the most dramatic evidence yet of corruption within the ruling African National Congress (ANC).</p> <p>But Watson is not just another fat-cat industrialist accused of trying to make a fast buck by bribing officials: his family were legendary in the anti-apartheid movement. He is the oldest of four brothers from the Eastern Cape province, white men who became heroes to the black majority when they broke apartheid laws to play rugby with black people in 1976. They joined the banned ANC and faced numerous depredations by the apartheid state, including time in jail and assassination attempts.</p> <p>The youngest brother, Daniel (known as Cheeky), was the most gifted wing player of his generation, who gave up a Springboks blazer for his stand against apartheid. All four brothers left their whites-only teams and went to play for the black league in their home town, Port Elizabeth, one of the only parts of the country where black people as well as white were rugby-mad. In 2012, Cheeky Watson received a state honour for his fearless contribution to non-racial sport.</p> <p>Watson and his brothers owned a highly successful chain of menswear shops, aimed at black buyers. As white people with resources, they provided invaluable support to their black ANC comrades in the Eastern Cape. At a time when many freedom fighters espoused a racially exclusive \u201cblack consciousness\u201d agenda, they also helped set the ANC\u2019s non-racial policies in motion on the sportsfield.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/aug/02/state-capture-corruption-investigation-south-africa-podcast\">\u2018State capture\u2019: the corruption investigation that has shaken South Africa \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After the ban on the ANC was lifted in 1990, the Watson brothers became powerbrokers in both politics and business. They set up companies, fronted by black owners and managers, that obtained shares in mining companies and contracts from the state. \u201cBlack economic empowerment\u201d (or BEE) is the state\u2019s primary means of economic redistribution, an affirmative-action plan stipulating that anyone wishing to do business with the state has to have a certain quota of black ownership and management. On paper, Gavin Watson\u2019s company, Bosasa, was majority black-owned; as such, it garnered contracts worth $140m from the state between 2000 and 2016, from prison catering to fleet management and information technology.</p> <p>According to the testimony of four whistleblowers, all former Bosasa executives, around $5m was paid in bribes to secure these contracts. They allege an industrial-scale operation that generated cash through money laundering and then distributed it to buy influence, secure contracts and prevent prosecution. They have described cash stuffed into Louis Vuitton handbags as gifts, or handed over in monthly instalments on the sides of highways. State officials received cars and houses; free security equipment and school fees for their children \u2013 even monthly meat supplies.</p> <p>Jacob Zuma, the former president, has been named in testimony as allegedly receiving gifts from Watson and playing a role in stopping the prosecution of his company, which first came under investigation in 2007. And even Cyril Ramaphosa, the current president, elected on the promise that he would sweep away corruption, unwittingly accepted a donation from Watson to help him in his campaign to unseat Zuma; Bosasa also paid Ramaphosa\u2019s son Andile a consulting fee for \u201cadvisory services\u201d.</p> <p>Black economic empowerment aims to give black people a greater share of an economy still overwhelmingly owned by whites. But the evidence given to the inquiry against Gavin Watson and Bosasa suggests how easily manipulated it can be: the accusation against Watson is that he and his colleagues have abused the system to line their own pockets, and have \u201ccaptured\u201d the organs of state to do so.</p> <p>\u201cState capture\u201d has become a buzzword in South Africa. It describes the way private individuals and companies have commandeered organs of state to redirect public resources into their own hands, and have gutted those institutions responsible for protecting the country against such corruption. These include the police, the prosecution authority, the tax collection service and even parliament itself.</p> <p>If the whistleblowers\u2019 evidence is correct, Bosasa was a textbook case of state capture. They presented the vault video, along with a blizzard of documents and allegations, at South Africa\u2019s independent judicial inquiry into allegations of state capture, corruption and fraud in the public sector, chaired by the country\u2019s deputy chief justice, Raymond Zondo. Zondo began public hearings last August, and they are expected to continue, almost daily, until the end of this year. <a href=\"https://www.sastatecapture.org.za/\" title=\"\">The </a><a href=\"https://www.sastatecapture.org.za/\" title=\"\">state </a><a href=\"https://www.sastatecapture.org.za/\" title=\"\">capture </a><a href=\"https://www.sastatecapture.org.za/\" title=\"\">commission</a>, as it is known, has been described as a truth and reconciliation commission for our times. Its aim is to cleanse post-apartheid South Africa of its darkest stain, just as Desmond Tutu sought to bring about a healthy transition into the new era by exposing the apartheid years\u2019 gross violations of human rights.</p> <p>The commission\u2019s primary target is the kleptocracy that established itself around the former president Jacob Zuma, and particularly the dealings of another band of brothers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/19/gupta-plane-grounded-in-south-africa-after-request-from-canada\" title=\"\">the Guptas</a>, who allegedly ran Zuma\u2019s government as a private piggy-bank. Zuma himself will finally appear before Zondo next week: he is scheduled to be in the witness box for five days, answering questions primarily about his relationship with the Guptas and the decisions that arose out of this. But he is expected to address the allegations about Bosasa and Gavin Watson, too.</p> <p>Gavin Watson has declined to make any public comment since the allegations, but his brother Valence told me: \u201cOur constitutional rights have been trampled upon.\u201d Valence claims that his family are victims of a \u201cdark state\u201d conspiracy today, just as they were under apartheid. He claims that the commission is illegal, in that it has not offered those implicated by the whistleblowers a fair hearing.</p> <p>Although the whistleblowers have implicated all four brothers in their testimony before the commission, only Gavin is directly linked to Bosasa. On the basis of the tax-evasion allegations put before the commission, Gavin is now being investigated by the South African Revenue Service. And in an unrelated case, a high court has found him to have \u201cacted dishonestly and reprehensibly\u201d in a mining deal, by taking shares allocated to a \u201cblack economic empowerment entity and appropriating them to himself and his family\u201d.</p> <p>The whistleblowers\u2019 testimony sketches one of the most troubling dynamics of post-apartheid South Africa: as some freedom fighters went into politics and others went into business, support networks morphed into patronage networks, which in turn became criminal syndicates.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The Watson brothers were such celebrities in the 1980s that there was even a TV series about them in the works. In a world where rugby was \u201cnext to God\u201d, John Pilger wrote in an introduction to a 1997 book about them, they \u201cembodied almost everything that white South African men liked about their breed: they were physically brave \u2026 men\u2019s men. Even their Christianity fitted the mould. But their manliness and their faith embraced a universal humanity and morality that was the antithesis of this stereotype.\u201d</p> <p>Television only came to South Africa in 1975, and at the time the Watsons were making news for their stand, the country was obsessed with Dallas, the Texas oil saga that centred on the Ewing family. \u201cThey were just like the Ewings,\u201d the former journalist Cate Turner, who fell into their orbit, said to me. \u201cI was starstruck. The Herald had them on the front page every other day: these compelling, good-looking guys and their wives with big hair and shoulder pads.\u201d</p> <p>While Cheeky managed black rugby teams and Gavin ran the family business, the other two brothers, Ronnie and Valence, became underground operatives of the ANC. Ronnie, Valence and Cheeky spent four months in jail after they were charged with burning down their grand family home in an insurance fraud. They insisted the state had framed them, and were eventually acquitted. Their chain of stores, Dan Watson American Imports, had been phenomenally successful, but they went bankrupt shortly after the trial. It took them several years, after the fall of apartheid, to re-establish themselves as BEE entrepreneurs \u2013 and to bring many of their old comrades with them, into the business world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4d9b748d9091cc8b7cb5f11a73858fc9b2f33ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4d9b748d9091cc8b7cb5f11a73858fc9b2f33ee/0_61_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former president Jacob Zuma with Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former president Jacob Zuma with Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: News24.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recently, on a visit to Port Elizabeth, I met one of their former comrades, Mike Xego, a former political prisoner who is now a businessman. He drives a Mercedes with the plates \u201cMr X\u201d, a moniker he also has stitched on to a necktie that is almost as broad as his language. \u201cYou must understand, black people are fucking poor,\u201d he exploded, when I asked him why corruption had become so rife in South Africa. \u201cOur ambitions! We wanted to be proper human beings, with bank accounts and a tie. We thought we would be strutting up and down the streets. Then things really crumbled. It didn\u2019t go well for most of us. We remained where we were.\u201d</p> <p>South Africa was recently declared by the World Bank to be the <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/07/africa/south-africa-elections-inequality-intl/index.html\" title=\"\">world\u2019s most unequal country</a>. In the boom years after the 1994 transition away from apartheid, if you were fortunate enough to be politically connected, you could soar into the stratosphere of the very wealthy via canny partnerships with white capitalists. This was Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s route. But, many black people were unable to access these opportunities, writes the South African sociologist Karl von Holdt, \u201cbecause of political gatekeeping or because they lacked the capital or the skills\u201d. And so \u201can alternative, informal political-economic system\u201d emerged, through which \u201cnetworks of state officials, ambitious entrepreneurs and small-time operators, were rigging tenders or engaging in other kinds of fraud \u2026 to sustain or establish businesses, or simply to finance self-enrichment\u201d. Von Holdt argues that for some South Africans, criminality has become the route to class mobility.</p> <p>Of course, white South Africans had accumulated their wealth through their own affirmative-action programmes \u2013 job reservation for whites \u2013 and alliances with the state. Now, post-apartheid, BEE had two distinct, legitimate arms: the private sector handed over some of its assets to players like Ramaphosa in return for political access and government work, and the state set race quotas for public sector contracts and mining licences.</p> <p>The entrepreneurial \u2013 white \u2013 Watson brothers, seeing how they could parlay their political networks into deals, went down both tracks. Gavin built Bosasa, a company initially founded by leaders of the ANC Women\u2019s League, to gain a foothold in the economy through government business. His younger brothers Valence and Ronnie went into the mining sector, working with a controversial family who bankrolled the ANC Youth League, and bought up marginal goldmines that the big players were getting ready to shut down.</p> <p>To find partners in these ventures, the brothers dug into their political hinterland: they recruited former comrades from ANC intelligence, rugby buddies from the black leagues, Eastern Cape activists. Gavin and Valence gave a major stake in their own companies to a man everyone calls \u201cthe fifth brother\u201d, Archie Mkele, a black rugby legend they befriended when they crossed over to the black league. Mkele was severely burned in the Watsons\u2019 1986 fire, and then tortured into a confession that he had torched the house for his friends as part of the alleged insurance scam; in court, he refused to testify against them. The other suspect, another black rugby mate, turned state witness, but was discharged after evidence emerged that he, too, had been tortured.</p> <p>Bosasa\u2019s other major black shareholder is Mkele\u2019s ex-wife, Carol, the sole beneficiary of a \u201cwomen\u2019s investments\u201d trust. On paper, the Mkeles are very rich indeed, but they lead modest lives in Port Elizabeth: Carol \u2013 now named Muneira Oliveria \u2013 has a mid-level management job at Bosasa; Archie is a priest. The whistleblowers allege in their testimony to the inquiry that the Mkeles\u2019 investment trusts are fronts for Gavin Watson\u2019s own family.</p> <p>Several of the Watsons\u2019 other BEE partners became part of the country\u2019s new political elite; there was a revolving door, in these first years of the new government, between political appointments and BEE entrepreneurs. \u201cThe minute you have a system where people make money just by the connections they have, rather than the work that they do, the system is ripe for abuse,\u201d says the political economist Moeletsi Mbeki, long a staunch critic of BEE. \u201cIt\u2019s a recipe for corruption.\u201d</p> <p>There have been two other important paths to prosperity for black people during the democratic era: through the professions (the universities have deracialised, dramatically), and through employment in public service, due to affirmative-action policies. In 1990, when the ANC was unbanned, there was a tiny number of black people who could be called middle-class: teachers, nurses, other officials and some entrepreneurs. Three decades later, black people constitute at least 50% of the middle class, even though whites remain significantly richer.</p> <p>But a perfect storm was brewing: the aspirations that accompanied democracy were maturing at the same time as South Africa\u2019s post-apartheid growth spurt slowed down, and the economy slumped after the global crash of 2008. As unemployment became more severe, public-service salaries and social welfare grants had to feed an increasing number of people. And as the cost of living soared, it became harder for many people to keep a foothold in the middle class: paying off the mortgage on your home; keeping your kids in private schools.</p> <p>Central to this political economy is the ANC itself, which makes key appointments, from a local to a national level, except in those few parts of the country where it is no longer in power. The party subsists on donations, and there have been allegations that votes for leadership positions are for sale. There are no controls over campaign financing in South Africa, and so an operation like Bosasa can work on two levels: underground, through bribery, and above board, through making high-profile donations to the party, or running and staffing \u2013 as Bosasa did \u2013 huge campaign \u201cwar rooms\u201d for the ANC out of its head office.</p> <p>\u201cIt is impossible to quantify the level of corruption in South Africa,\u201d David Lewis of <a href=\"https://www.corruptionwatch.org.za/\" title=\"\">Corruption Watch</a>, the South African chapter of Transparency International, told me, \u201cbut everyone accepts a perception, which is often the only way you make a judgment, that bribery in order to procure public contracts is ubiquitous.\u201d</p> <p>A young business colleague of Mike Xego\u2019s had accompanied him to our meeting, and when \u201cMr X\u201d jumped up to take a phone call, I struck up a conversation with this man. He was trying to make a go of it, he told me, bringing potatoes from farms to market in his truck, and carrying fuel back. \u201cBut the problem is capital.\u201d He had begun his business by bidding for state tenders, and received a sub-contract helping to build a road in his home township. But as soon as he made enough money to buy his truck, he got out of there.</p> <p>Why did he leave if he was doing so well there, I asked, and if state contracts could build his capital base?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a Christian, sir. And if you tenderise [live off state tenders], you bribe.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Judge Raymond Zondo is a mild and ponderous man in his late 50s who runs his commission with a sometimes-exasperating deliberateness. After viewing the video of Gavin Watson counting out those bundles of banknotes in the vault, he asked his witness \u2013 former Bosasa executive Angelo Agrizzi \u2013 what Watson had meant by referring to the cash as \u201cmonopoly money\u201d.</p> <p>Agrizzi, a white South African of Italian extraction, had been Watson\u2019s right-hand man at Bosasa. A character of operatic proportions and temperament, he spent a full 11 days in the witness box. He told the judge that when he asked Watson that very question, his former boss had replied: \u201cOne, it is just monopoly money, so we can get the monopoly [of state business], and two \u2026 because it is just playing money. You are playing with people.\u201d Some of the banknotes, Agrizzi claimed, were sweeteners for himself and other Bosasa employees. \u201cIt kind of buys loyalty,\u201d Agrizzi explained. \u201cYou feel important. You [get] caught up in a cult \u2026 It is a trap, like bribery is a trap, because you raise your standard of living.\u201d</p> <p>Agrizzi told the judge that he had experienced a Damascene conversion after surviving a heart tumour. The Watson camp suggests, with evidence, that he was trying to blackmail Gavin Watson. Agrizzi, in turn, claims Watson was going to throw him under the bus, and so he acted pre-emptively. Certainly, Agrizzi appears to have accumulated evidence, perhaps as insurance. He kept meticulous coded records: of the transfer of orders of \u201cchicken\u201d, or of \u201cbread\u201d in and out of the \u201coven\u201d, as the vault was known \u2013 in what he liked to call his \u201clittle black books\u201d, personalised and gold-embossed from Smythson in London. Even the state capture commission\u2019s own secretary, a senior justice department official named Khotso De Wee, was to be found in these books, and had to be put on special leave by Zondo. De Wee has denied the allegations.</p> <p>Two characters were inscribed every month into Agrizzi\u2019s dirty little ledger as \u201cSnake\u201d and \u201cSnail\u201d. Agrizzi told the commission that these were Nomgcobo Jiba, the deputy national director of public prosecutions and Lawrence Mrwebi, who headed a unit of the prosecuting authority that had, in fact, been investigating Bosasa since 2010. Agrizzi\u2019s testimony suggested why, almost a decade later, no one had yet been charged: in his account, Jiba and Mrwebi were paid off to obstruct the prosecution \u2013 and even to advise the accused on how to circumvent the charges.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0743c9c89a9e0567ee3fc0ed84cda0ec06e62b54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0743c9c89a9e0567ee3fc0ed84cda0ec06e62b54/0_258_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi testifying to the state capture commission in Johannesburg, January 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Foto24/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both Mrwebi and Jiba have denied Agrizzi\u2019s allegations, and claim they never received money from Bosasa. In April, they were fired by Cyril Ramaphosa, on the basis of another judicial commission that found they had brought the agency into disrepute: not over Bosasa, but other matters that had to do with protecting Jacob Zuma and his cronies from charges of corruption.</p> <p>Shortly after Agrizzi made his revelations before the commission in January this year, the National Prosecuting Authority snapped into gear under a new boss. Although the state capture commission offers protection from self-incrimination, prosecutors used the charge sheet that had been gathering dust at the agency to arrest Agrizzi and two other Bosasa whistleblowers, as well as two prison officials.</p> <p>One of Agrizzi\u2019s co-accused is a man named Linda Mti, an ex-ANC military commander who was the head of security at the 2010 South Africa World Cup and, before that, the country\u2019s prisons commissioner. Hard-driving and charismatic, Mti is still known by his nom de guerre, \u201cRichman\u201d. He likes to tell the story of how, one day in 1980, while he was working out of the neighbouring country of Lesotho, two conservatively dressed young white men were brought to see him. His mother had joked that he might live to see the day that he could tell a white man what to do, and \u201cnow I\u2019ve got two. My whiteboys!\u201d</p> <p>The men were Ronnie and Valence Watson, and they had come to Lesotho at the behest of Chris Hani \u2013 the legendary ANC leader, who was later assassinated \u2013 smuggling forged documents across the border in their big white Mercedes. Mti became their handler, and in the years that followed, the Watson boys shuttled fleeing activists across the same border, along with intelligence reports about what was happening back home. Both Mti and Hani became close personal friends of the Watsons.</p> <p>When, in 1987, an attempt was made on Ronnie Watson\u2019s life in a hotel room in Botswana, it was Richman Mti who came running to his aid. Three years later, when the last white president, FW de Klerk, unexpectedly unbanned the liberation movements and Mti came back to Port Elizabeth, his hometown, he had nowhere to live. Valence Watson put him up, and he lived there for many months. Mti was elected the first ANC chair of the region; the brothers became his fixers and advisers. (Mti declined to speak to me for this story.)</p> <p>Mti became prisons commissioner in 2001, a year after Gavin Watson bought Bosasa: the company provided catering for mine hostels, and ran two detention centres, one for illegal immigrants and one for juvenile offenders. Watson was ready to expand. His man was in place.</p> <p>The state had never previously outsourced its prisons contracts, but inspired by the success of British companies such as G4S and Serco, Bosasa made a pitch to Mti and another senior prison official, Patrick Gillingham, for all the catering contracts in the country\u2019s prisons. According to testimony given to the inquiry and the charge sheet, both men conspired to award Bosasa the prison catering contracts, for which they received lucrative kickbacks, in cash and in kind.</p> <p>A senior career official in the apartheid-era prisons service, Gillingham would have been a strong candidate for prisons commissioner were it not for the timing of the transition to democracy, and the ANC\u2019s affirmative-action policies: he is white. When Agrizzi was trying to explain how he, too, became corrupt while working for Bosasa, he told Zondo: \u201cWe were constantly told that we were white males and that you will not find a job anywhere out there \u2026 This was drummed into our heads.\u201d Similar statements were made by the other whistleblowers, all white men too. I have seen a video in which Watson does, indeed, emphasise to his white staff their unemployability in a changing South Africa.</p> <p>And so, according to the testimony before the state capture commission, Watson played race two ways. He offered his black collaborators a quicker route to self-enrichment than might otherwise be available to them, and his white ones a solution from the impoverishment they imagined might befall them, now that black South Africans were in the ascendant.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When Mike \u201cMr X\u201d Xego was released from five years in jail on Robben Island in 1982, he was 22 and had no clothes; his mother, a domestic worker, could not help. \u201cGo to the Watsons!\u201d he was told. \u201cThey will make you look good.\u201d Even before they became rugby heroes, the brothers were renowned in Port Elizabeth\u2019s black community for their shop, which sold the kind of American fashion beloved by urban black South Africans. Most of the customers were black, but white people shopped there too, meaning it was one of the few mixed spaces in the city, a free zone for black people, and a safe space for activists. With their resources, the Watsons did what they could, setting up a makeshift clinic in the storeroom and tending to comrades injured in protests; photocopying banned literature; gifting clothes to released prisoners like Xego or returned exiles like Richman Mti.</p> <p>Xego acquired his first wardrobe \u2013 on credit, with no interest \u2013 from the Watsons. A few weeks later, all four brothers showed up in their Mercedes at his tiny township home and sat down to tea with his mother, winning her over with the fluent Xhosa they had learned growing up on an Eastern Cape farm. They wrote off his debt.</p> <p>But not all activists were comfortable with the Watsons\u2019 role. Released alongside Xego in 1982 was another youth activist, Saki Macozoma, who would later become one of the country\u2019s most successful black businessmen. Back then, he too was directed to the Watson shop. \u201cI said: \u2018I don\u2019t like being given things, particularly from white people.\u2019 I\u2019d been on [Robben] Island for five years, and I knew that in politics, what you received in one hand you paid with the other.\u201d</p> <p>Port Elizabeth had always been the heart of the freedom struggle and it was here, after the apartheid president PW Botha declared his state of emergency in 1985, that a nationwide consumer boycott of white businesses was most successful. What to do with the Watsons, though?</p> <p>At first they were exempt, but the boycott leaders insisted that they needed to be included: it would be too easy for other retailers to superficially imitate the Watson packaging. Worse yet, vigilantes were enforcing the boycott with violence. If people were found breaking the boycott by coming home from the shops with detergent, for example, they would often be forced to drink it. The only way people could be safe, the leaders insisted, was if the boycott was a blanket one. Others disagreed fervently: \u201cTo us the Watsons were not whites,\u201d their friend Max Mamase told the Australian journalist Kristin Williamson. \u201cThey were part of us. But a few key people felt the Watsons were making money out of the boycott.\u201d</p> <p>The brothers had huge appeal among black people in the region, but they were always controversial among activists \u2013 not just because some were sceptical about working with white people, or what their motives might be, but because their resources seemed to give them a sense of ownership of the movement. It was unclear whether the people they supported were their comrades, friends or their clients. \u201cThe Watsons were one of the \u2018great houses\u2019 of the struggle,\u201d the former activist Mkhuseli Jack said to me. \u201cThere were black ones too, I must say. Once you were in [allied to] one of these \u2018houses\u2019, you did their bidding.\u201d</p> <p>This was significant because of the factionalism in the struggle. You could tarnish your competitors with the slur that they were agents or informers. Ronnie Watson in particular was the master of this game: he had a favourite Xhosa word he would hiss under his breath about anyone who disagreed with him: <em>inywagi</em> \u2013 the genet, a small, wily wild cat that struck its prey with lightning speed. \u201cBlack or white, we were all spies to them,\u201d Jack told me.</p> <p>The brothers stayed away from the above-ground movement, which was launched in 1983 as the United Democratic Front. When the journalist Gavin Evans set up a UDF affiliate with two other white activists, \u201cthey were very threatened,\u201d Evans told me. \u201cThey liked to be the only white activists in the village. In various ways, they spread spy rumours about all three of us.\u201d</p> <p>The journalist Cate Turner remembers the kitchen-table lectures the brothers offered up at her commune, which they often visited: \u201cThey claimed socialism was about the raising of standards for everyone, not the lowering for some. They often spoke about how self-enrichment was not at odds with socialist ideals. When I look back at it now [from the perspective of the Bosasa allegations], it was almost as if they were setting themselves up for this trajectory they are now on.\u201d</p> <p>Obviously, Gavin Watson did not clothe people like Richman Mti in the 1980s in anticipation of a future lucrative relationship: no one could have predicted, back then, how quickly apartheid would fall and a new elite would establish itself. But the testimony before the state capture commission suggests a slippery slope: from comradely support into patronage and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 corruption.</p> <p>In this way, the Watson brothers are reminiscent of another famous struggle family, the Shaiks. The sons of an Indian trader from Durban, the Shaik brothers were deeply committed freedom fighters, and were often detained and even tortured. They answered directly to Jacob Zuma in exile, and they provided both intelligence and resources to the movement.</p> <p>The ANC\u2019s leaders \u2013 in jail or in exile \u2013 had not a penny to their name, but were expected to take their seats at the negotiating table after their release or return after 1990, and talk themselves into power. Even Nelson Mandela was dependent on the largesse of local businessmen when he came out of jail, supported primarily by a brash insurance magnate named Douw Steyn (although there was no suggestion of an illegal relationship). Richman Mti had the Watsons. And Jacob Zuma had the Shaiks.</p> <p>Schabir Shaik bribed Zuma to get a piece of a multibillion dollar arms deal that South Africa signed with French and German companies in the mid-1990s. Shaik went to jail in 2005, and the reason Zuma is free is because a judge accepted testimony that the charges against him were tainted by political interference. This ruling was finally overturned on appeal in 2018, and the charges were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/06/south-africa-jacob-zuma-court-corruption-charges\" title=\"\">reinstated</a>: the former South African president may yet find himself behind bars.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In an image-laundering exercise, Bosasa changed its name to African Global Operations in 2016. Its headquarters are a sprawling campus in a nondescript suburb west of Johannesburg. In its heyday the campus had wildlife roaming around it, a mini golf course, the Watson Corporate University, an evangelical publishing company and a wellness centre. Since the allegations made at the state capture commission earlier this year, the company has lost most of its business and gone into liquidation: most of its staff have been retrenched and its banks have refused to do business with it. Most of the campus\u2019 buildings are dark, and it now has an unkempt air at odds with the regimental Watson style.</p> <p>Gavin Watson liked to call Bosasa a \u201cKingdom company\u201d: he ran it with a kind of entrepreneurial evangelism. All staff were required to wear smart uniforms, and Watson conducted prayer meetings and offered communion every morning between 6am and 8am. A popular public speaker on behavioural science who ran the wellness centre for over a decade, Denise Bjorkman, says that Bosasa was \u201ca cultish environment\u201d with Watson its domineering leader, and that his \u201ccontrol mechanisms extended into prayer\u201d, as staff members felt compelled to attend if they wished to be in favour. \u201cAttendees had to pray out loud as he believed that if they did so he would know what they were thinking,\u201d Bjorkman says.</p> <p>Gavin Watson declined to speak to me, but his close friend Kevin Wakeford agreed to do so. Wakeford is on Bosasa\u2019s books as a consultant, and also implicated by Agrizzi\u2019s testimony at the state capture commission; he describes Agrizzi\u2019s allegations against him as \u201cmalicious\u201d fabrication, and dismisses both the corruption allegations and character profile of Gavin Watson that have been put into the public domain. He points, specifically, to the many black directors and managers in the company: \u201cThe optics were so good! The [BEE] balance scorecard, the work ethic \u2026 the broad span of involvement across the company. Whenever you saw their staff, they were courteous and efficient.\u201d The campaign against Bosasa had \u201cshut down a company that really showed you can be Afrocentric and still be an international benchmark,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In April this year, Valence Watson agreed to spend a day with me, first in the Port Elizabeth offices of his lawyers, and then showing me Royalston, the magnificent \u201ccoastal wildlife residential estate\u201d he is developing outside the city. He is known to be the most affable of the four bluff brothers: he was good company, despite the difficult conversation.</p> <p>Valence explained the family ethos to me, and how it was rooted in both enterprise and Christianity. His farming parents, descendants of hardy Scots settler stock, also ran trading stores, and there were two biblical precepts that governed their lives: \u201cLove your neighbour as yourself\u201d and \u201cEarn your money by the sweat of your brow\u201d. For the Watsons, \u201ceveryone\u2019s money was the same colour\u201d, and the first time he realised it was different elsewhere was when he noticed a wall in the local butchers, dividing black and white shoppers.</p> <p>Although all four brothers are implicated by the whistleblowers at the state capture commission, Valence insisted to me that they had no relationship with their brother Gavin\u2019s company; Ronnie said the same thing, in a written response to questions. (Cheeky declined to talk to me.) There is, indeed, no evidence that they were directly involved in corruption, except for Agrizzi\u2019s allegation that he saw Valence bribing a senior parliamentarian named Cedric Frolick on behalf of Bosasa. Valence dismissed this charge to me as a lie.</p> <p>Still, everyone who knows the Watson family notes the way the brothers band together, particularly in times of trouble. Perhaps because of the way they were once isolated by other whites as <em>kaffirboeties</em> (\u201cnigger-lovers\u201d) and then targeted by the authorities, they tend to close ranks and keep to themselves, and in my own dealings with them \u2013 perhaps exacerbated by their current embattled status \u2013 I experienced their notorious \u201cus-versus-the-world\u201d paranoia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"73997c0a00fe1f8aa85cbc33d800ac1cf9b9310e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73997c0a00fe1f8aa85cbc33d800ac1cf9b9310e/126_0_2690_1615/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Then-president Jacob Zuma and deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa at a cabinet meeting in Cape Town, February 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Then-president Jacob Zuma and deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa at a cabinet meeting in Cape Town, February 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ronnie wrote to me that he was convinced the state capture commission was a continuation of the old ways of the state: \u201cWhat the apartheid regime did through torture, death squads and the barrel of the gun,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Zondo commission and the banks [by closing Bosasa\u2019s and Gavin\u2019s accounts] are achieving without even firing a shot.

(Stratcom may have been responsible, for example, for burning down the Watson house and then manufacturing documents to make it look like an insurance scam.) When I asked Valence who might be behind such a plot, today, he suggested that Agrizzi and the whistleblowers were in cahoots with the opposition Democratic Alliance, in an attempt to discredit the ANC before the country\u2019s May elections, in which the party was re-elected, but with its lowest majority yet.</p> <p>Presumably on the basis of the Bosasa allegations, Cyril Ramaphosa dropped at least one implicated cabinet minister, Nomvula Mokonyane, a close Zuma associate who was allegedly at the heart of the Bosasa syndicate, and Watson\u2019s primary beneficiary. Mokonyane has called the allegations untrue, and announced her intention to defend herself before the commission. Ramaphosa has also apologised for the error in judgment in having accepted funds from Watson, given that Bosasa was under investigation. Still, he now finds himself under investigation too, by an antagonistic public protector (a statutory ombudsman of sorts) who believes that he wilfully misled parliament, and might even be guilty of money-laundering through his campaign fundraising.</p> <p>The public protector\u2019s name is Busisiwe Mkhwebane. So aggressively has she gone after Ramaphosa and his major anti-corruption ally, the state enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan, that many <a href=\"https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/politics/2019-06-26-mkhwebane-a-hired-gun-of-the-anti-ramaphosa-fightback-faction-says-sacp/\" title=\"\">South Africans believe</a> she is doing the bidding of the Zuma kleptocrats swept from office by Ramaphosa \u2013 allegations that <a href=\"https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/news/2019-07-07-busisiwe-mkhwebane-seeks-protection-from-unfair-attacks/\" title=\"\">Mkhwebane says</a> are \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cwithout basis\u201d.

      "bodyText": "On 17 January this year, South Africans watched, transfixed, as video from a hidden mobile phone camera was broadcast on TV. It showed a group of men, in corporate uniforms, walking into a vault \u2013 where one of them counts out bundles of banknotes: \u201cOne, two, three, four, five \u2026 bloody Monopoly money,\u201d he laughs through heavy breaths, \u201cmust be a million.\u201d The man\u2019s name is Gavin Watson, and the whistleblowers who put this video into the public domain claim it shows him counting out bribes to be paid to officials in the South African government. They have given accounts that implicate cabinet ministers, senior lawmakers and even the prosecutors tasked with investigating the corrupt practices of Watson\u2019s logistics company, Bosasa. The video is the most dramatic evidence yet of corruption within the ruling African National Congress (ANC). But Watson is not just another fat-cat industrialist accused of trying to make a fast buck by bribing officials: his family were legendary in the anti-apartheid movement. He is the oldest of four brothers from the Eastern Cape province, white men who became heroes to the black majority when they broke apartheid laws to play rugby with black people in 1976. They joined the banned ANC and faced numerous depredations by the apartheid state, including time in jail and assassination attempts. The youngest brother, Daniel (known as Cheeky), was the most gifted wing player of his generation, who gave up a Springboks blazer for his stand against apartheid. All four brothers left their whites-only teams and went to play for the black league in their home town, Port Elizabeth, one of the only parts of the country where black people as well as white were rugby-mad. In 2012, Cheeky Watson received a state honour for his fearless contribution to non-racial sport. Watson and his brothers owned a highly successful chain of menswear shops, aimed at black buyers. As white people with resources, they provided invaluable support to their black ANC comrades in the Eastern Cape. At a time when many freedom fighters espoused a racially exclusive \u201cblack consciousness\u201d agenda, they also helped set the ANC\u2019s non-racial policies in motion on the sportsfield. After the ban on the ANC was lifted in 1990, the Watson brothers became powerbrokers in both politics and business. They set up companies, fronted by black owners and managers, that obtained shares in mining companies and contracts from the state. \u201cBlack economic empowerment\u201d (or BEE) is the state\u2019s primary means of economic redistribution, an affirmative-action plan stipulating that anyone wishing to do business with the state has to have a certain quota of black ownership and management. On paper, Gavin Watson\u2019s company, Bosasa, was majority black-owned; as such, it garnered contracts worth $140m from the state between 2000 and 2016, from prison catering to fleet management and information technology. According to the testimony of four whistleblowers, all former Bosasa executives, around $5m was paid in bribes to secure these contracts. They allege an industrial-scale operation that generated cash through money laundering and then distributed it to buy influence, secure contracts and prevent prosecution. They have described cash stuffed into Louis Vuitton handbags as gifts, or handed over in monthly instalments on the sides of highways. State officials received cars and houses; free security equipment and school fees for their children \u2013 even monthly meat supplies. Jacob Zuma, the former president, has been named in testimony as allegedly receiving gifts from Watson and playing a role in stopping the prosecution of his company, which first came under investigation in 2007. And even Cyril Ramaphosa, the current president, elected on the promise that he would sweep away corruption, unwittingly accepted a donation from Watson to help him in his campaign to unseat Zuma; Bosasa also paid Ramaphosa\u2019s son Andile a consulting fee for \u201cadvisory services\u201d. Black economic empowerment aims to give black people a greater share of an economy still overwhelmingly owned by whites. But the evidence given to the inquiry against Gavin Watson and Bosasa suggests how easily manipulated it can be: the accusation against Watson is that he and his colleagues have abused the system to line their own pockets, and have \u201ccaptured\u201d the organs of state to do so. \u201cState capture\u201d has become a buzzword in South Africa. It describes the way private individuals and companies have commandeered organs of state to redirect public resources into their own hands, and have gutted those institutions responsible for protecting the country against such corruption. These include the police, the prosecution authority, the tax collection service and even parliament itself. If the whistleblowers\u2019 evidence is correct, Bosasa was a textbook case of state capture. They presented the vault video, along with a blizzard of documents and allegations, at South Africa\u2019s independent judicial inquiry into allegations of state capture, corruption and fraud in the public sector, chaired by the country\u2019s deputy chief justice, Raymond Zondo. Zondo began public hearings last August, and they are expected to continue, almost daily, until the end of this year. The state capture commission, as it is known, has been described as a truth and reconciliation commission for our times. Its aim is to cleanse post-apartheid South Africa of its darkest stain, just as Desmond Tutu sought to bring about a healthy transition into the new era by exposing the apartheid years\u2019 gross violations of human rights. The commission\u2019s primary target is the kleptocracy that established itself around the former president Jacob Zuma, and particularly the dealings of another band of brothers, the Guptas, who allegedly ran Zuma\u2019s government as a private piggy-bank. Zuma himself will finally appear before Zondo next week: he is scheduled to be in the witness box for five days, answering questions primarily about his relationship with the Guptas and the decisions that arose out of this. But he is expected to address the allegations about Bosasa and Gavin Watson, too. Gavin Watson has declined to make any public comment since the allegations, but his brother Valence told me: \u201cOur constitutional rights have been trampled upon.\u201d Valence claims that his family are victims of a \u201cdark state\u201d conspiracy today, just as they were under apartheid. He claims that the commission is illegal, in that it has not offered those implicated by the whistleblowers a fair hearing. Although the whistleblowers have implicated all four brothers in their testimony before the commission, only Gavin is directly linked to Bosasa. On the basis of the tax-evasion allegations put before the commission, Gavin is now being investigated by the South African Revenue Service. And in an unrelated case, a high court has found him to have \u201cacted dishonestly and reprehensibly\u201d in a mining deal, by taking shares allocated to a \u201cblack economic empowerment entity and appropriating them to himself and his family\u201d. The whistleblowers\u2019 testimony sketches one of the most troubling dynamics of post-apartheid South Africa: as some freedom fighters went into politics and others went into business, support networks morphed into patronage networks, which in turn became criminal syndicates. * * * The Watson brothers were such celebrities in the 1980s that there was even a TV series about them in the works. In a world where rugby was \u201cnext to God\u201d, John Pilger wrote in an introduction to a 1997 book about them, they \u201cembodied almost everything that white South African men liked about their breed: they were physically brave \u2026 men\u2019s men. Even their Christianity fitted the mould. But their manliness and their faith embraced a universal humanity and morality that was the antithesis of this stereotype.\u201d Television only came to South Africa in 1975, and at the time the Watsons were making news for their stand, the country was obsessed with Dallas, the Texas oil saga that centred on the Ewing family. \u201cThey were just like the Ewings,\u201d the former journalist Cate Turner, who fell into their orbit, said to me. \u201cI was starstruck. The Herald had them on the front page every other day: these compelling, good-looking guys and their wives with big hair and shoulder pads.\u201d While Cheeky managed black rugby teams and Gavin ran the family business, the other two brothers, Ronnie and Valence, became underground operatives of the ANC. Ronnie, Valence and Cheeky spent four months in jail after they were charged with burning down their grand family home in an insurance fraud. They insisted the state had framed them, and were eventually acquitted. Their chain of stores, Dan Watson American Imports, had been phenomenally successful, but they went bankrupt shortly after the trial. It took them several years, after the fall of apartheid, to re-establish themselves as BEE entrepreneurs \u2013 and to bring many of their old comrades with them, into the business world. Recently, on a visit to Port Elizabeth, I met one of their former comrades, Mike Xego, a former political prisoner who is now a businessman. He drives a Mercedes with the plates \u201cMr X\u201d, a moniker he also has stitched on to a necktie that is almost as broad as his language. \u201cYou must understand, black people are fucking poor,\u201d he exploded, when I asked him why corruption had become so rife in South Africa. \u201cOur ambitions! We wanted to be proper human beings, with bank accounts and a tie. We thought we would be strutting up and down the streets. Then things really crumbled. It didn\u2019t go well for most of us. We remained where we were.\u201d South Africa was recently declared by the World Bank to be the world\u2019s most unequal country. In the boom years after the 1994 transition away from apartheid, if you were fortunate enough to be politically connected, you could soar into the stratosphere of the very wealthy via canny partnerships with white capitalists. This was Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s route. But, many black people were unable to access these opportunities, writes the South African sociologist Karl von Holdt, \u201cbecause of political gatekeeping or because they lacked the capital or the skills\u201d. And so \u201can alternative, informal political-economic system\u201d emerged, through which \u201cnetworks of state officials, ambitious entrepreneurs and small-time operators, were rigging tenders or engaging in other kinds of fraud \u2026 to sustain or establish businesses, or simply to finance self-enrichment\u201d. Von Holdt argues that for some South Africans, criminality has become the route to class mobility. Of course, white South Africans had accumulated their wealth through their own affirmative-action programmes \u2013 job reservation for whites \u2013 and alliances with the state. Now, post-apartheid, BEE had two distinct, legitimate arms: the private sector handed over some of its assets to players like Ramaphosa in return for political access and government work, and the state set race quotas for public sector contracts and mining licences. The entrepreneurial \u2013 white \u2013 Watson brothers, seeing how they could parlay their political networks into deals, went down both tracks. Gavin built Bosasa, a company initially founded by leaders of the ANC Women\u2019s League, to gain a foothold in the economy through government business. His younger brothers Valence and Ronnie went into the mining sector, working with a controversial family who bankrolled the ANC Youth League, and bought up marginal goldmines that the big players were getting ready to shut down. To find partners in these ventures, the brothers dug into their political hinterland: they recruited former comrades from ANC intelligence, rugby buddies from the black leagues, Eastern Cape activists. Gavin and Valence gave a major stake in their own companies to a man everyone calls \u201cthe fifth brother\u201d, Archie Mkele, a black rugby legend they befriended when they crossed over to the black league. Mkele was severely burned in the Watsons\u2019 1986 fire, and then tortured into a confession that he had torched the house for his friends as part of the alleged insurance scam; in court, he refused to testify against them. The other suspect, another black rugby mate, turned state witness, but was discharged after evidence emerged that he, too, had been tortured. Bosasa\u2019s other major black shareholder is Mkele\u2019s ex-wife, Carol, the sole beneficiary of a \u201cwomen\u2019s investments\u201d trust. On paper, the Mkeles are very rich indeed, but they lead modest lives in Port Elizabeth: Carol \u2013 now named Muneira Oliveria \u2013 has a mid-level management job at Bosasa; Archie is a priest. The whistleblowers allege in their testimony to the inquiry that the Mkeles\u2019 investment trusts are fronts for Gavin Watson\u2019s own family. Several of the Watsons\u2019 other BEE partners became part of the country\u2019s new political elite; there was a revolving door, in these first years of the new government, between political appointments and BEE entrepreneurs. \u201cThe minute you have a system where people make money just by the connections they have, rather than the work that they do, the system is ripe for abuse,\u201d says the political economist Moeletsi Mbeki, long a staunch critic of BEE. \u201cIt\u2019s a recipe for corruption.\u201d There have been two other important paths to prosperity for black people during the democratic era: through the professions (the universities have deracialised, dramatically), and through employment in public service, due to affirmative-action policies. In 1990, when the ANC was unbanned, there was a tiny number of black people who could be called middle-class: teachers, nurses, other officials and some entrepreneurs. Three decades later, black people constitute at least 50% of the middle class, even though whites remain significantly richer. But a perfect storm was brewing: the aspirations that accompanied democracy were maturing at the same time as South Africa\u2019s post-apartheid growth spurt slowed down, and the economy slumped after the global crash of 2008. As unemployment became more severe, public-service salaries and social welfare grants had to feed an increasing number of people. And as the cost of living soared, it became harder for many people to keep a foothold in the middle class: paying off the mortgage on your home; keeping your kids in private schools. Central to this political economy is the ANC itself, which makes key appointments, from a local to a national level, except in those few parts of the country where it is no longer in power. The party subsists on donations, and there have been allegations that votes for leadership positions are for sale. There are no controls over campaign financing in South Africa, and so an operation like Bosasa can work on two levels: underground, through bribery, and above board, through making high-profile donations to the party, or running and staffing \u2013 as Bosasa did \u2013 huge campaign \u201cwar rooms\u201d for the ANC out of its head office. \u201cIt is impossible to quantify the level of corruption in South Africa,\u201d David Lewis of Corruption Watch, the South African chapter of Transparency International, told me, \u201cbut everyone accepts a perception, which is often the only way you make a judgment, that bribery in order to procure public contracts is ubiquitous.\u201d A young business colleague of Mike Xego\u2019s had accompanied him to our meeting, and when \u201cMr X\u201d jumped up to take a phone call, I struck up a conversation with this man. He was trying to make a go of it, he told me, bringing potatoes from farms to market in his truck, and carrying fuel back. \u201cBut the problem is capital.\u201d He had begun his business by bidding for state tenders, and received a sub-contract helping to build a road in his home township. But as soon as he made enough money to buy his truck, he got out of there. Why did he leave if he was doing so well there, I asked, and if state contracts could build his capital base? \u201cI\u2019m a Christian, sir. And if you tenderise [live off state tenders], you bribe.\u201d * * * Judge Raymond Zondo is a mild and ponderous man in his late 50s who runs his commission with a sometimes-exasperating deliberateness. After viewing the video of Gavin Watson counting out those bundles of banknotes in the vault, he asked his witness \u2013 former Bosasa executive Angelo Agrizzi \u2013 what Watson had meant by referring to the cash as \u201cmonopoly money\u201d. Agrizzi, a white South African of Italian extraction, had been Watson\u2019s right-hand man at Bosasa. A character of operatic proportions and temperament, he spent a full 11 days in the witness box. He told the judge that when he asked Watson that very question, his former boss had replied: \u201cOne, it is just monopoly money, so we can get the monopoly [of state business], and two \u2026 because it is just playing money. You are playing with people.\u201d Some of the banknotes, Agrizzi claimed, were sweeteners for himself and other Bosasa employees. \u201cIt kind of buys loyalty,\u201d Agrizzi explained. \u201cYou feel important. You [get] caught up in a cult \u2026 It is a trap, like bribery is a trap, because you raise your standard of living.\u201d Agrizzi told the judge that he had experienced a Damascene conversion after surviving a heart tumour. The Watson camp suggests, with evidence, that he was trying to blackmail Gavin Watson. Agrizzi, in turn, claims Watson was going to throw him under the bus, and so he acted pre-emptively. Certainly, Agrizzi appears to have accumulated evidence, perhaps as insurance. He kept meticulous coded records: of the transfer of orders of \u201cchicken\u201d, or of \u201cbread\u201d in and out of the \u201coven\u201d, as the vault was known \u2013 in what he liked to call his \u201clittle black books\u201d, personalised and gold-embossed from Smythson in London. Even the state capture commission\u2019s own secretary, a senior justice department official named Khotso De Wee, was to be found in these books, and had to be put on special leave by Zondo. De Wee has denied the allegations. Two characters were inscribed every month into Agrizzi\u2019s dirty little ledger as \u201cSnake\u201d and \u201cSnail\u201d. Agrizzi told the commission that these were Nomgcobo Jiba, the deputy national director of public prosecutions and Lawrence Mrwebi, who headed a unit of the prosecuting authority that had, in fact, been investigating Bosasa since 2010. Agrizzi\u2019s testimony suggested why, almost a decade later, no one had yet been charged: in his account, Jiba and Mrwebi were paid off to obstruct the prosecution \u2013 and even to advise the accused on how to circumvent the charges. Both Mrwebi and Jiba have denied Agrizzi\u2019s allegations, and claim they never received money from Bosasa. In April, they were fired by Cyril Ramaphosa, on the basis of another judicial commission that found they had brought the agency into disrepute: not over Bosasa, but other matters that had to do with protecting Jacob Zuma and his cronies from charges of corruption. Shortly after Agrizzi made his revelations before the commission in January this year, the National Prosecuting Authority snapped into gear under a new boss. Although the state capture commission offers protection from self-incrimination, prosecutors used the charge sheet that had been gathering dust at the agency to arrest Agrizzi and two other Bosasa whistleblowers, as well as two prison officials. One of Agrizzi\u2019s co-accused is a man named Linda Mti, an ex-ANC military commander who was the head of security at the 2010 South Africa World Cup and, before that, the country\u2019s prisons commissioner. Hard-driving and charismatic, Mti is still known by his nom de guerre, \u201cRichman\u201d. He likes to tell the story of how, one day in 1980, while he was working out of the neighbouring country of Lesotho, two conservatively dressed young white men were brought to see him. His mother had joked that he might live to see the day that he could tell a white man what to do, and \u201cnow I\u2019ve got two. My whiteboys!\u201d The men were Ronnie and Valence Watson, and they had come to Lesotho at the behest of Chris Hani \u2013 the legendary ANC leader, who was later assassinated \u2013 smuggling forged documents across the border in their big white Mercedes. Mti became their handler, and in the years that followed, the Watson boys shuttled fleeing activists across the same border, along with intelligence reports about what was happening back home. Both Mti and Hani became close personal friends of the Watsons. When, in 1987, an attempt was made on Ronnie Watson\u2019s life in a hotel room in Botswana, it was Richman Mti who came running to his aid. Three years later, when the last white president, FW de Klerk, unexpectedly unbanned the liberation movements and Mti came back to Port Elizabeth, his hometown, he had nowhere to live. Valence Watson put him up, and he lived there for many months. Mti was elected the first ANC chair of the region; the brothers became his fixers and advisers. (Mti declined to speak to me for this story.) Mti became prisons commissioner in 2001, a year after Gavin Watson bought Bosasa: the company provided catering for mine hostels, and ran two detention centres, one for illegal immigrants and one for juvenile offenders. Watson was ready to expand. His man was in place. The state had never previously outsourced its prisons contracts, but inspired by the success of British companies such as G4S and Serco, Bosasa made a pitch to Mti and another senior prison official, Patrick Gillingham, for all the catering contracts in the country\u2019s prisons. According to testimony given to the inquiry and the charge sheet, both men conspired to award Bosasa the prison catering contracts, for which they received lucrative kickbacks, in cash and in kind. A senior career official in the apartheid-era prisons service, Gillingham would have been a strong candidate for prisons commissioner were it not for the timing of the transition to democracy, and the ANC\u2019s affirmative-action policies: he is white. When Agrizzi was trying to explain how he, too, became corrupt while working for Bosasa, he told Zondo: \u201cWe were constantly told that we were white males and that you will not find a job anywhere out there \u2026 This was drummed into our heads.\u201d Similar statements were made by the other whistleblowers, all white men too. I have seen a video in which Watson does, indeed, emphasise to his white staff their unemployability in a changing South Africa. And so, according to the testimony before the state capture commission, Watson played race two ways. He offered his black collaborators a quicker route to self-enrichment than might otherwise be available to them, and his white ones a solution from the impoverishment they imagined might befall them, now that black South Africans were in the ascendant. * * * When Mike \u201cMr X\u201d Xego was released from five years in jail on Robben Island in 1982, he was 22 and had no clothes; his mother, a domestic worker, could not help. \u201cGo to the Watsons!\u201d he was told. \u201cThey will make you look good.\u201d Even before they became rugby heroes, the brothers were renowned in Port Elizabeth\u2019s black community for their shop, which sold the kind of American fashion beloved by urban black South Africans. Most of the customers were black, but white people shopped there too, meaning it was one of the few mixed spaces in the city, a free zone for black people, and a safe space for activists. With their resources, the Watsons did what they could, setting up a makeshift clinic in the storeroom and tending to comrades injured in protests; photocopying banned literature; gifting clothes to released prisoners like Xego or returned exiles like Richman Mti. Xego acquired his first wardrobe \u2013 on credit, with no interest \u2013 from the Watsons. A few weeks later, all four brothers showed up in their Mercedes at his tiny township home and sat down to tea with his mother, winning her over with the fluent Xhosa they had learned growing up on an Eastern Cape farm. They wrote off his debt. But not all activists were comfortable with the Watsons\u2019 role. Released alongside Xego in 1982 was another youth activist, Saki Macozoma, who would later become one of the country\u2019s most successful black businessmen. Back then, he too was directed to the Watson shop. \u201cI said: \u2018I don\u2019t like being given things, particularly from white people.\u2019 I\u2019d been on [Robben] Island for five years, and I knew that in politics, what you received in one hand you paid with the other.\u201d Port Elizabeth had always been the heart of the freedom struggle and it was here, after the apartheid president PW Botha declared his state of emergency in 1985, that a nationwide consumer boycott of white businesses was most successful. What to do with the Watsons, though? At first they were exempt, but the boycott leaders insisted that they needed to be included: it would be too easy for other retailers to superficially imitate the Watson packaging. Worse yet, vigilantes were enforcing the boycott with violence. If people were found breaking the boycott by coming home from the shops with detergent, for example, they would often be forced to drink it. The only way people could be safe, the leaders insisted, was if the boycott was a blanket one. Others disagreed fervently: \u201cTo us the Watsons were not whites,\u201d their friend Max Mamase told the Australian journalist Kristin Williamson. \u201cThey were part of us. But a few key people felt the Watsons were making money out of the boycott.\u201d The brothers had huge appeal among black people in the region, but they were always controversial among activists \u2013 not just because some were sceptical about working with white people, or what their motives might be, but because their resources seemed to give them a sense of ownership of the movement. It was unclear whether the people they supported were their comrades, friends or their clients. \u201cThe Watsons were one of the \u2018great houses\u2019 of the struggle,\u201d the former activist Mkhuseli Jack said to me. \u201cThere were black ones too, I must say. Once you were in [allied to] one of these \u2018houses\u2019, you did their bidding.\u201d This was significant because of the factionalism in the struggle. You could tarnish your competitors with the slur that they were agents or informers. Ronnie Watson in particular was the master of this game: he had a favourite Xhosa word he would hiss under his breath about anyone who disagreed with him: inywagi \u2013 the genet, a small, wily wild cat that struck its prey with lightning speed. \u201cBlack or white, we were all spies to them,\u201d Jack told me. The brothers stayed away from the above-ground movement, which was launched in 1983 as the United Democratic Front. When the journalist Gavin Evans set up a UDF affiliate with two other white activists, \u201cthey were very threatened,\u201d Evans told me. \u201cThey liked to be the only white activists in the village. In various ways, they spread spy rumours about all three of us.\u201d The journalist Cate Turner remembers the kitchen-table lectures the brothers offered up at her commune, which they often visited: \u201cThey claimed socialism was about the raising of standards for everyone, not the lowering for some. They often spoke about how self-enrichment was not at odds with socialist ideals. When I look back at it now [from the perspective of the Bosasa allegations], it was almost as if they were setting themselves up for this trajectory they are now on.\u201d Obviously, Gavin Watson did not clothe people like Richman Mti in the 1980s in anticipation of a future lucrative relationship: no one could have predicted, back then, how quickly apartheid would fall and a new elite would establish itself. But the testimony before the state capture commission suggests a slippery slope: from comradely support into patronage and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 corruption. In this way, the Watson brothers are reminiscent of another famous struggle family, the Shaiks. The sons of an Indian trader from Durban, the Shaik brothers were deeply committed freedom fighters, and were often detained and even tortured. They answered directly to Jacob Zuma in exile, and they provided both intelligence and resources to the movement. The ANC\u2019s leaders \u2013 in jail or in exile \u2013 had not a penny to their name, but were expected to take their seats at the negotiating table after their release or return after 1990, and talk themselves into power. Even Nelson Mandela was dependent on the largesse of local businessmen when he came out of jail, supported primarily by a brash insurance magnate named Douw Steyn (although there was no suggestion of an illegal relationship). Richman Mti had the Watsons. And Jacob Zuma had the Shaiks. Schabir Shaik bribed Zuma to get a piece of a multibillion dollar arms deal that South Africa signed with French and German companies in the mid-1990s. Shaik went to jail in 2005, and the reason Zuma is free is because a judge accepted testimony that the charges against him were tainted by political interference. This ruling was finally overturned on appeal in 2018, and the charges were reinstated: the former South African president may yet find himself behind bars. * * * In an image-laundering exercise, Bosasa changed its name to African Global Operations in 2016. Its headquarters are a sprawling campus in a nondescript suburb west of Johannesburg. In its heyday the campus had wildlife roaming around it, a mini golf course, the Watson Corporate University, an evangelical publishing company and a wellness centre. Since the allegations made at the state capture commission earlier this year, the company has lost most of its business and gone into liquidation: most of its staff have been retrenched and its banks have refused to do business with it. Most of the campus\u2019 buildings are dark, and it now has an unkempt air at odds with the regimental Watson style. Gavin Watson liked to call Bosasa a \u201cKingdom company\u201d: he ran it with a kind of entrepreneurial evangelism. All staff were required to wear smart uniforms, and Watson conducted prayer meetings and offered communion every morning between 6am and 8am. A popular public speaker on behavioural science who ran the wellness centre for over a decade, Denise Bjorkman, says that Bosasa was \u201ca cultish environment\u201d with Watson its domineering leader, and that his \u201ccontrol mechanisms extended into prayer\u201d, as staff members felt compelled to attend if they wished to be in favour. \u201cAttendees had to pray out loud as he believed that if they did so he would know what they were thinking,\u201d Bjorkman says. Gavin Watson declined to speak to me, but his close friend Kevin Wakeford agreed to do so. Wakeford is on Bosasa\u2019s books as a consultant, and also implicated by Agrizzi\u2019s testimony at the state capture commission; he describes Agrizzi\u2019s allegations against him as \u201cmalicious\u201d fabrication, and dismisses both the corruption allegations and character profile of Gavin Watson that have been put into the public domain. He points, specifically, to the many black directors and managers in the company: \u201cThe optics were so good! The [BEE] balance scorecard, the work ethic \u2026 the broad span of involvement across the company. Whenever you saw their staff, they were courteous and efficient.\u201d The campaign against Bosasa had \u201cshut down a company that really showed you can be Afrocentric and still be an international benchmark,\u201d he said. In April this year, Valence Watson agreed to spend a day with me, first in the Port Elizabeth offices of his lawyers, and then showing me Royalston, the magnificent \u201ccoastal wildlife residential estate\u201d he is developing outside the city. He is known to be the most affable of the four bluff brothers: he was good company, despite the difficult conversation. Valence explained the family ethos to me, and how it was rooted in both enterprise and Christianity. His farming parents, descendants of hardy Scots settler stock, also ran trading stores, and there were two biblical precepts that governed their lives: \u201cLove your neighbour as yourself\u201d and \u201cEarn your money by the sweat of your brow\u201d. For the Watsons, \u201ceveryone\u2019s money was the same colour\u201d, and the first time he realised it was different elsewhere was when he noticed a wall in the local butchers, dividing black and white shoppers. Although all four brothers are implicated by the whistleblowers at the state capture commission, Valence insisted to me that they had no relationship with their brother Gavin\u2019s company; Ronnie said the same thing, in a written response to questions. (Cheeky declined to talk to me.) There is, indeed, no evidence that they were directly involved in corruption, except for Agrizzi\u2019s allegation that he saw Valence bribing a senior parliamentarian named Cedric Frolick on behalf of Bosasa. Valence dismissed this charge to me as a lie. Still, everyone who knows the Watson family notes the way the brothers band together, particularly in times of trouble. Perhaps because of the way they were once isolated by other whites as kaffirboeties (\u201cnigger-lovers\u201d) and then targeted by the authorities, they tend to close ranks and keep to themselves, and in my own dealings with them \u2013 perhaps exacerbated by their current embattled status \u2013 I experienced their notorious \u201cus-versus-the-world\u201d paranoia. Ronnie wrote to me that he was convinced the state capture commission was a continuation of the old ways of the state: \u201cWhat the apartheid regime did through torture, death squads and the barrel of the gun,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Zondo commission and the banks [by closing Bosasa\u2019s and Gavin\u2019s accounts] are achieving without even firing a shot. Stratcom is alive and well within the Zondo commission.\u201d \u201cStratcom\u201d is short for \u201cStrategic Communications\u201d, the apartheid security forces\u2019 notorious dirty tricks department, which sought to discredit key apartheid activists. (Stratcom may have been responsible, for example, for burning down the Watson house and then manufacturing documents to make it look like an insurance scam.) When I asked Valence who might be behind such a plot, today, he suggested that Agrizzi and the whistleblowers were in cahoots with the opposition Democratic Alliance, in an attempt to discredit the ANC before the country\u2019s May elections, in which the party was re-elected, but with its lowest majority yet. Presumably on the basis of the Bosasa allegations, Cyril Ramaphosa dropped at least one implicated cabinet minister, Nomvula Mokonyane, a close Zuma associate who was allegedly at the heart of the Bosasa syndicate, and Watson\u2019s primary beneficiary. Mokonyane has called the allegations untrue, and announced her intention to defend herself before the commission. Ramaphosa has also apologised for the error in judgment in having accepted funds from Watson, given that Bosasa was under investigation. Still, he now finds himself under investigation too, by an antagonistic public protector (a statutory ombudsman of sorts) who believes that he wilfully misled parliament, and might even be guilty of money-laundering through his campaign fundraising. The public protector\u2019s name is Busisiwe Mkhwebane. So aggressively has she gone after Ramaphosa and his major anti-corruption ally, the state enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan, that many South Africans believe she is doing the bidding of the Zuma kleptocrats swept from office by Ramaphosa \u2013 allegations that Mkhwebane says are \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cwithout basis\u201d. Meanwhile, Zuma will appear before Zondo next week, against his will. In a letter leaked to the press, his lawyer has slammed the commission as seeking its \u201cown truth\u201d and wishing \u201cto deliver our client \u2026 for public display and in order to ambush and humiliate him\u201d. After the vault video, the most sensational piece of testimony Angelo Agrizzi submitted to the state capture commission was a secretly recorded audio file from 2016, in which we hear Gavin Watson coaching Richman Mti about what to say to Jacob Zuma, then still president, in an upcoming meeting. \u201cNow Mr President, you need to close this thing [the investigation into Bosasa] down. We need the right person in the right place.\u201d The allegations against Bosasa and Gavin Watson are by no means the only ones that have been made before Zondo, or even the most damning, in terms of \u201cstate capture\u201d. But they are the most detailed. The way the South African authorities act on them will be a litmus test of whether they are, finally, freed from their \u201ccapture\u201d during the dark second act \u2013 the Zuma years \u2013 of the South African democracy. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

      "bodyText": "If the earthquake that just hit Northern Ireland has an epicentre, it is the Cathedral Quarter, a corner of Belfast once dedicated to making money and now in the business of social revolution. It was here that labour activists turned industrial warehouses and trading offices into political hubs, here that gay bars opened and prospered, here that equal rights campaigners set up campaign coalitions, and here that they said goodbye to Lyra McKee and vowed that her death would not be in vain. \u201cWe\u2019ve had so many occasions when we\u2019ve had our hopes raised only to come crashing back down,\u201d said Cara McCann, the director of Here NI, a charity that advocates for lesbian and bisexual women, on Wednesday. \u201cBut yesterday we just couldn\u2019t believe it. This morning, waking up, our community feels more valued.\u201d A day earlier MPs had voted resoundingly to extend same-sex marriage and access to abortion to Northern Ireland, bringing the region into line with the rest of the UK. The Cathedral Quarter\u2019s non-profits and campaign groups erupted in celebration as they realised that years of lobbying, educating, organising and marching had paid off, seemingly in a blink. \u201cIt feels surreal. You feel validated,\u201d said Clare Moore, an equality officer for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. She said Northern Ireland was more than ready for this moment. \u201cThe battle for hearts and minds was won a long time ago.\u201d Opinion polls in recent years showed big majorities in favour of same-sex marriage and a loosening of the ban on abortion \u2013 a testament to changing values and grassroots work by the likes of Love Equality, an umbrella group. It helped when England and Wales enshrined marriage equality in 2013, followed by the Republic of Ireland in 2015. A rally in Belfast that summer drew tens of thousands of people. In 2018 voters in the republic voted by a landslide to legalise abortion. Last summer\u2019s Pride parade in Belfast drew corporate sponsors, clerics, families, politicians and police \u2013 a confident, exuberant display of people power. The murder in April of McKee, a writer and LGBTQ activist, channelled grief into demands for change. At the funeral at St Anne\u2019s Cathedral \u2013 from which the Cathedral Quarter gets its name \u2013 McKee\u2019s partner, Sara Canning, challenged Theresa May to legislate for equal marriage. \u201cI wanted her to know that Lyra and I had a right to be treated as equal citizens in our own country. Surely that\u2019s not too much to ask?\u201d she said. The Democratic Unionist party (DUP) had blocked reform when it shared power with Sinn F\u00e9in at Stormont, the seat of Northern Ireland\u2019s government. After power-sharing collapsed in 2017, leaving Northern Ireland in a political vacuum, it was able to block change via Westminster because the Conservative government needed DUP support. But on Tuesday the House of Commons, a chamber mocked and vilified for its Brexit gyrations, a symbol of broken politics, ruptured trust and institutional dysfunction, delivered a stunning result. Backbench Labour MPs had added two amendments to an otherwise technical government bill connected to budgets and elections for Northern Ireland\u2019s mothballed assembly. Conor McGinn\u2019s proposal to extend same-sex marriage to the region passed by 383 to 73 votes. Stella Creasy\u2019s proposal to extend abortion rights to the only part of the UK where it remains illegal passed by 332 to 99. A Downing Street source said on Wednesday: \u201cThe government has heard the message the house has delivered and will seek to act upon it.\u201d McGinn\u2019s amendment theoretically will lead to an automatic change in the law within three months if devolved government remains stalled. If and when Stormont is revived it can approve or repeal the measure. It remains unclear what form the new abortion legislation will take. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m shellshocked,\u201d said Malachai O\u2019Hara, a deputy leader of the Green party and veteran LGBQT advocate. People interviewed on the streets of Belfast mostly welcomed the news. \u201cI know loads of gays, they\u2019re lovely people. Good luck to them,\u201d beamed Liz Lismore, 83, a retired nurse. She was less keen on abortion services. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in that.\u201d Daniel Murphy, 90, a retired labourer, said people should be able to make their own decisions about both issues. \u201cEveryone has a free mind.\u201d Des McKeown, 72, a property steward at the First Presbyterian church, also endorsed the changes. \u201cPeople should be left to interpret scripture according to their own conscience,\u201d he said.

The UK ambassador to the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/10/kim-darroch-resigns-as-uk-ambassador-to-us-after-leaked-trump-comment\" title=\"\">has just been forced to resign</a> after describing Donald Trump and his administration as \u201cinept\u201d and \u201cuniquely dysfunctional\u201d in diplomatic memos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/07/donald-trump-inept-and-dysfunctional-uk-ambassador-to-us-says\" title=\"\">that were subsequently leaked to the Mail on Sunday</a>.</p> <p>Darroch\u2019s crime is hardly one of inaccuracy. The only person in the world who seems to disagree with the ambassador\u2019s assessment is Trump himself, who called the civil servant \u201cwacky\u201d and \u201cvery stupid\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/09/donald-trump-calls-theresa-may-foolish-as-diplomatic-row-escalates\" title=\"\">in a dysfunctional series of tweets on Tuesday</a>.</p> <p>But there is no denying that the memos were, well, not particularly diplomatic. An important skill of an ambassador to the US is to balance two competing requirements: to honestly report to your superiors the fact that the president is inept, while remaining chummy with the inept president.</p> <p>Darroch is not the first person to face trouble over seemingly private thoughts becoming public.

The first is to avoid ever entering the public eye in the first place. But that is harder and harder to do: you may be <a href=\"https://gawker.com/justine-sacco-is-good-at-her-job-and-how-i-came-to-pea-1653022326\" title=\"\">retweeted disapprovingly by a famous person</a>, have <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/life-love/sex-relationships/a22838613/wedding-shaming-twitter-thread/\" title=\"\">your Facebook post screencapped and shared in a private group</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdUoZJvdipA\" title=\"\">just be filmed doing something odd but harmless in public</a>. And that is before we admit that \u201cpublic\u201d is a sliding scale. A WhatsApp message sent to a group of four that gets reposted to a group of 20 is hardly \u201cpublic\u201d, but if you are the schoolchild betrayed by a friend, it can nonetheless be life-ruining .</p> <p>And so the second is to ensure you have only ever recorded (publicly or privately) a consistent, polite and focus-group-approved opinion on any issue. If you must be blunt, try to ensure it is in a face-to-face meeting, preferably without notes and in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12810675\" title=\"\">one of those tinfoil-lined tents</a> that President Obama used to take with him on foreign visits. Even then, you run the risk of an embarrassing memoir from your interlocutor. So maybe it is best to just keep quiet.</p> <p>But the death of frank speaking is, speaking frankly, a disaster. A state, a business, even a household, cannot operate without private conversations. The carefully measured words you choose to describe a problem co-worker in an all-staff email are not the same as the harsh language you save for the one-on-one with your line manager. The perfectly fair complaints you have about your flaky friend who always bails at the last minute would be unspeakably cruel to deliver face to face. And the exasperated planning required to deal with an inept president cannot occur if you are forced to pretend, even behind closed doors, that you are dealing with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/949619270631256064\" title=\"\">a very stable genius</a>.</p> <p>Bizarrely enough, Tony Blair was one of the first to raise the alarm. In 2010, just a few months after the Labour party had been ousted from power, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/11/journey-tony-blair-alistair-darling\" title=\"\">he published his memoir, A Journey</a>, and pondered over his mistakes in office. His choices were unexpected. The Iraq war was defended bitterly, even as he wrote he was \u201cnow beyond the mere expression of compassion\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, his regret was preserved for something that many, particularly journalists, hold to be one of his greatest achievements in office: the Freedom of Information Act. \u201cIt\u2019s not practical for government,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/01/tony-blair-a-journey-interview\" title=\"\">he told the Guardian in an interview around the release of his book</a>. \u201cIf you are trying to take a difficult decision and you\u2019re weighing up the pros and cons, you have frank conversations. Everybody knows this in their walk of life. Whether you are in business \u2013 or running a newspaper \u2013 there are conversations you want to have preliminary to taking a decision that are frank.\u201d </p> <p>Blair was pilloried for his comments, but a decade on, the substance, if not the specifics, holds water. The Freedom of Information Act, after all, contains 24 exceptions; an email hacker, or simply an intemperate forwarder, has no such filter. And so frankness is muted, and caution holds sway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7664655ff2463b36bf676acf8cb11560a74034e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7664655ff2463b36bf676acf8cb11560a74034e7/0_85_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keeping it private \u2026 Barack Obama is briefed in a tinfoil-lined tent on the situation in Libya, 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keeping it private \u2026 Barack Obama is briefed in a tinfoil-lined tent on the situation in Libya, 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Souza/Official White House Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Things have not got better since 2010. Pause a moment, and take stock of how much of your life is recorded, archived and searchable that would have been lost to the waters of time just a few years ago. You probably make fewer phone calls, and message more through WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter. You almost certainly now have a record of your every movement, either <a href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/522515/how-to-see-iphone-significant-locations-map/\" title=\"\">tucked away on your iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/timeline\" title=\"\">stored on Google\u2019s servers</a>. And sure, if you were an early adopter you might have posted and tagged personal photos on Facebook a decade ago, but they certainly weren\u2019t annotated by today\u2019s machine-learning algorithm, which can recognise whether you are in a picture by your face alone.</p> <p>We don\u2019t often think about this vast hoard of data as a privacy problem, per se. No one else can see that message log. Your emails are protected by your company\u2019s head of information security (who now reports to the CEO, not the head of IT). Even Google protects its cloud with ferocity, albeit with the same paternalism that a farmer guards their swine.</p> <p>That is because we lack the words. There is a form of privacy being violated by these stores. Entrepreneur and activist Maciej Ceg\u0142owski <a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2019/06/the_new_wilderness.htm\" title=\"\">calls it \u201cambient privacy\u201d</a>: \u201cthe understanding that there is value in having our everyday interactions with one another remain outside the reach of monitoring, and that the small details of our daily lives should pass by unremembered. What we do at home, work, church, school or in our leisure time does not belong in a permanent record. Not every conversation needs to be a deposition.\u201d</p> <p>The death of frankness is one symptom of the wider dearth of ambient privacy in our daily lives. The cheery Silicon Valley surveillance state that prevents us from speaking plainly in private is the same one that requires us to warn our children \u2013 or be warned by our parents \u2013 not to post things online that might harm employment prospects, and the same one that ensures we vet every utterance to make sure that it doesn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/aman-thakar-tory-debate-bbc-tweet-hitler-suspended-leigh-day-labour-a8966361.html\" title=\"\">take on some darker meaning</a> outside of the context in which it was presented.</p> <p>There is no external agent mandating this self-censorship, at least not in the west: in China and Saudi Arabia, Ceg\u0142owski notes, the same capacity is used as a tool of social control. In the UK and the US, \u201cWe\u2019re using it to show ads. But the infrastructure of total surveillance is everywhere the same, and everywhere being deployed at scale.\u201d</p> <p>Another framing makes the difficulty of the problem clear. The problem is not data breaches: it is \u201cdata exhaust\u201d, the information that is produced as a byproduct of our digital lives. The vast majority of emails are not useful after they are received (or, frankly, even before then). But we keep them because it is the only way we can keep hold of the one in a million that is. A record of every website you have ever visited is useful when you want to remember that killer quote you landed on a year ago, but it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/01/data-browsing-habits-brokers\" title=\"\">also a record of every sensitive query you have ever Googled</a>. The purpose of Twitter is not to produce a searchable database of all the times prospective MPs have used racial slurs, but that is a dataset the company now has.</p> <p>The risks of this exhaust would be bad enough if they simply suppressed frankness, muted our freedom to express ourselves and provided a terrifying capability for authoritarian states to co-opt. But the problem is, the playing field isn\u2019t level. There are two groups that float on, unconcerned by the death of ambient privacy.</p> <p>The first are the angels: those whose innermost thoughts are already safely expressible, who never need to talk behind someone\u2019s back because what they want to say is acceptable to deliver to their face, and who cannot have a throwaway comment come back to bite them because every comment is perfectly thought-out and expressed first time round.</p> <p>Such people do not exist.</p> <p>The second group are those who dismiss the very idea of consistency, who elevate rudeness to a virtue and undermine the entire concept of a shared reality. If you build your reputation on consistency and honesty, then a single hypocrisy can be ruining. If you get elected as an MP <em>after</em> you have already been fired from a newspaper for making up \u2013 sorry, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/24/boris-johnson-interview-eddie-mair\" title=\"\">sandpapering</a>\u201d \u2013 quotes, then, well, you can get away with writing pretty much anything. You could even put it on the side of a bus, couldn\u2019t you, Boris Johnson?</p> <p>Similarly, it is the height of unambassadorial behaviour to call someone inept behind their back. But if, like Nigel Farage, you make a habit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/25/nigel-farage-herman-van-rompuy-damp-rag\" title=\"\">telling your negotiating partners to their faces</a> that they have \u201call the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk\u201d, how could a leaked letter possibly hurt you? You might even <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-uk-ambassador-us-trump-kim-darroch-leak-memo-cables-a8993681.html\" title=\"\">suggest yourself</a> as a successor to the clearly hopelessly biased civil servant. You, of course, are unimpeachable: your reputation for plain speaking is all the proof anyone needs. And for even more plain speaking, your fans can hear you on the radio five days a week!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b2356736fc7acfd29081092ccce4292ca5bf4d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b2356736fc7acfd29081092ccce4292ca5bf4d8/72_0_1128_677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Darroch shakes hands with Donald Trump, 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Darroch shakes hands with Donald Trump, 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @KimDarroch/Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The threat is not just to politics. The more we adapt to the absence of ambient privacy, the more the world will split: the worst of us rising to the top, their awfulness baked into their reputation and recontextualised as courage or honesty, the rest of us retreating ever further from the public sphere, trying to find new spaces where conversations are unarchived and unpublished.</p> <p>But in the same way that you can\u2019t fight the climate crisis by simply switching your own habits, you can\u2019t win back ambient privacy on your own. The risks are societal, and they need to be fought on a societal level. You can try, of course. Quitting Facebook is maybe the equivalent of swapping your car for a bike; deleting all your tweets the same as taking the train on holiday rather than flying. These things help, and if everyone did them, they would help an awful lot.</p> <p>But everyone isn\u2019t doing them. And some of those personal choices may be less than helpful.

      "bodyText": "\u201cDance like no one is watching,\u201d the American journalist Olivia Nuzzi wrote in 2014. \u201cEmail like it may one day be read aloud in a deposition.\u201d Nuzzi\u2019s advice could have saved Kim Darroch an awful lot of trouble. The UK ambassador to the US has just been forced to resign after describing Donald Trump and his administration as \u201cinept\u201d and \u201cuniquely dysfunctional\u201d in diplomatic memos that were subsequently leaked to the Mail on Sunday. Darroch\u2019s crime is hardly one of inaccuracy. The only person in the world who seems to disagree with the ambassador\u2019s assessment is Trump himself, who called the civil servant \u201cwacky\u201d and \u201cvery stupid\u201d in a dysfunctional series of tweets on Tuesday. But there is no denying that the memos were, well, not particularly diplomatic. An important skill of an ambassador to the US is to balance two competing requirements: to honestly report to your superiors the fact that the president is inept, while remaining chummy with the inept president. Darroch is not the first person to face trouble over seemingly private thoughts becoming public. Emails get hacked and published (awkward revelations, Donna Brazile); microphones thought to be turned off are actually broadcasting (better apologise, Gordon Brown); documents get released under freedom of information or data protection laws (be more circumspect, GCHQ); old blogposts are rediscovered in a new light (get deleting, Ben Bradley) \u2026 the list seems never-ending. It is increasingly clear that there are only really two ways to avoid this sort of gaffe. The first is to avoid ever entering the public eye in the first place. But that is harder and harder to do: you may be retweeted disapprovingly by a famous person, have your Facebook post screencapped and shared in a private group, or just be filmed doing something odd but harmless in public. And that is before we admit that \u201cpublic\u201d is a sliding scale. A WhatsApp message sent to a group of four that gets reposted to a group of 20 is hardly \u201cpublic\u201d, but if you are the schoolchild betrayed by a friend, it can nonetheless be life-ruining . And so the second is to ensure you have only ever recorded (publicly or privately) a consistent, polite and focus-group-approved opinion on any issue. If you must be blunt, try to ensure it is in a face-to-face meeting, preferably without notes and in one of those tinfoil-lined tents that President Obama used to take with him on foreign visits. Even then, you run the risk of an embarrassing memoir from your interlocutor. So maybe it is best to just keep quiet. But the death of frank speaking is, speaking frankly, a disaster. A state, a business, even a household, cannot operate without private conversations. The carefully measured words you choose to describe a problem co-worker in an all-staff email are not the same as the harsh language you save for the one-on-one with your line manager. The perfectly fair complaints you have about your flaky friend who always bails at the last minute would be unspeakably cruel to deliver face to face. And the exasperated planning required to deal with an inept president cannot occur if you are forced to pretend, even behind closed doors, that you are dealing with a very stable genius. Bizarrely enough, Tony Blair was one of the first to raise the alarm. In 2010, just a few months after the Labour party had been ousted from power, he published his memoir, A Journey, and pondered over his mistakes in office. His choices were unexpected. The Iraq war was defended bitterly, even as he wrote he was \u201cnow beyond the mere expression of compassion\u201d. Instead, his regret was preserved for something that many, particularly journalists, hold to be one of his greatest achievements in office: the Freedom of Information Act. \u201cIt\u2019s not practical for government,\u201d he told the Guardian in an interview around the release of his book. \u201cIf you are trying to take a difficult decision and you\u2019re weighing up the pros and cons, you have frank conversations. Everybody knows this in their walk of life. Whether you are in business \u2013 or running a newspaper \u2013 there are conversations you want to have preliminary to taking a decision that are frank.\u201d Blair was pilloried for his comments, but a decade on, the substance, if not the specifics, holds water. The Freedom of Information Act, after all, contains 24 exceptions; an email hacker, or simply an intemperate forwarder, has no such filter. And so frankness is muted, and caution holds sway. Things have not got better since 2010. Pause a moment, and take stock of how much of your life is recorded, archived and searchable that would have been lost to the waters of time just a few years ago. You probably make fewer phone calls, and message more through WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter. You almost certainly now have a record of your every movement, either tucked away on your iPhone or stored on Google\u2019s servers. And sure, if you were an early adopter you might have posted and tagged personal photos on Facebook a decade ago, but they certainly weren\u2019t annotated by today\u2019s machine-learning algorithm, which can recognise whether you are in a picture by your face alone. We don\u2019t often think about this vast hoard of data as a privacy problem, per se. No one else can see that message log. Your emails are protected by your company\u2019s head of information security (who now reports to the CEO, not the head of IT). Even Google protects its cloud with ferocity, albeit with the same paternalism that a farmer guards their swine. That is because we lack the words. There is a form of privacy being violated by these stores. Entrepreneur and activist Maciej Ceg\u0142owski calls it \u201cambient privacy\u201d: \u201cthe understanding that there is value in having our everyday interactions with one another remain outside the reach of monitoring, and that the small details of our daily lives should pass by unremembered. What we do at home, work, church, school or in our leisure time does not belong in a permanent record. Not every conversation needs to be a deposition.\u201d The death of frankness is one symptom of the wider dearth of ambient privacy in our daily lives. The cheery Silicon Valley surveillance state that prevents us from speaking plainly in private is the same one that requires us to warn our children \u2013 or be warned by our parents \u2013 not to post things online that might harm employment prospects, and the same one that ensures we vet every utterance to make sure that it doesn\u2019t take on some darker meaning outside of the context in which it was presented. There is no external agent mandating this self-censorship, at least not in the west: in China and Saudi Arabia, Ceg\u0142owski notes, the same capacity is used as a tool of social control. In the UK and the US, \u201cWe\u2019re using it to show ads. But the infrastructure of total surveillance is everywhere the same, and everywhere being deployed at scale.\u201d Another framing makes the difficulty of the problem clear. The problem is not data breaches: it is \u201cdata exhaust\u201d, the information that is produced as a byproduct of our digital lives. The vast majority of emails are not useful after they are received (or, frankly, even before then). But we keep them because it is the only way we can keep hold of the one in a million that is. A record of every website you have ever visited is useful when you want to remember that killer quote you landed on a year ago, but it is also a record of every sensitive query you have ever Googled. The purpose of Twitter is not to produce a searchable database of all the times prospective MPs have used racial slurs, but that is a dataset the company now has. The risks of this exhaust would be bad enough if they simply suppressed frankness, muted our freedom to express ourselves and provided a terrifying capability for authoritarian states to co-opt. But the problem is, the playing field isn\u2019t level. There are two groups that float on, unconcerned by the death of ambient privacy. The first are the angels: those whose innermost thoughts are already safely expressible, who never need to talk behind someone\u2019s back because what they want to say is acceptable to deliver to their face, and who cannot have a throwaway comment come back to bite them because every comment is perfectly thought-out and expressed first time round. Such people do not exist. The second group are those who dismiss the very idea of consistency, who elevate rudeness to a virtue and undermine the entire concept of a shared reality. If you build your reputation on consistency and honesty, then a single hypocrisy can be ruining. If you get elected as an MP after you have already been fired from a newspaper for making up \u2013 sorry, \u201csandpapering\u201d \u2013 quotes, then, well, you can get away with writing pretty much anything. You could even put it on the side of a bus, couldn\u2019t you, Boris Johnson? Similarly, it is the height of unambassadorial behaviour to call someone inept behind their back. But if, like Nigel Farage, you make a habit of telling your negotiating partners to their faces that they have \u201call the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk\u201d, how could a leaked letter possibly hurt you? You might even suggest yourself as a successor to the clearly hopelessly biased civil servant. You, of course, are unimpeachable: your reputation for plain speaking is all the proof anyone needs. And for even more plain speaking, your fans can hear you on the radio five days a week! The threat is not just to politics. The more we adapt to the absence of ambient privacy, the more the world will split: the worst of us rising to the top, their awfulness baked into their reputation and recontextualised as courage or honesty, the rest of us retreating ever further from the public sphere, trying to find new spaces where conversations are unarchived and unpublished. But in the same way that you can\u2019t fight the climate crisis by simply switching your own habits, you can\u2019t win back ambient privacy on your own. The risks are societal, and they need to be fought on a societal level. You can try, of course. Quitting Facebook is maybe the equivalent of swapping your car for a bike; deleting all your tweets the same as taking the train on holiday rather than flying. These things help, and if everyone did them, they would help an awful lot. But everyone isn\u2019t doing them. And some of those personal choices may be less than helpful. Swapping plastic bags for canvas ones can take years to pay off; moving from a public Twitter to a private Facebook group gives the illusion of privacy. However, it is still on Facebook, being monitored, archived and algorithmically curated. \u201cThe infrastructure of mass surveillance is too complex, and the tech oligopoly too powerful, to make it meaningful to talk about individual consent,\u201d Ceg\u0142owski concludes. \u201cI believe [Google\u2019s Sundar] Pichai and [Facebook\u2019s Mark] Zuckerberg are sincere in their personal commitment to privacy, just as I am sure that the CEOs of Exxon Mobil and Shell don\u2019t want their children to live in a world of runaway global warming. But their core business activities are not compatible with their professed values. \u201cOur discourse around privacy needs to expand to address foundational questions about the role of automation: to what extent is living in a surveillance-saturated world compatible with pluralism and democracy? What are the consequences of raising a generation of children whose every action feeds into a corporate database? What does it mean to be manipulated from an early age by machine-learning algorithms that adaptively learn to shape our behaviour?\u201d Individual action is important, though. It can act as a signal of support for the wider fight. It can frighten corporations into shifting their behaviour ever so slightly. And it can help psychologically, by fighting the creeping feeling of uselessness. Download a privacy app such as Jumbo and use it to lock down your Facebook, sanitise your Google and erase your Twitter. Switch from WhatsApp to Signal, and from Instagram to Snapchat, and everywhere enable the ability to erase your messages after they\u2019ve been read. Turn off \u201cHey, Siri\u201d and \u201cOK, Google\u201d, and remove Alexa from your house. Fight for frankness. But if you do think your email might be read aloud in a deposition, maybe follow Nuzzi\u2019s advice. Frankness in the wrong place is a mistake you only get to make once.",

Everyone who is female, every gay person knew what it was to be scrutinised, to be suspect, to be controlled, to be less than the norm. There\u2019s only one way universal rights can work: for everybody, or for nobody at all. As we sink deeper into the new politics, arguing over undreamt-of matters \u2013 whether or not it\u2019s the end of democracy to prorogue parliament, for instance \u2013 there has never been a more important time to reassert some fundamental principles that years of consensus somehow managed to fudge or ignore. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Kamala Harris is charming Iowa. She has more than doubled her campaign staff in New Hampshire and South Carolina. She enthused a crowd of black women at the Essence Festival with a multibillion-dollar plan to invest in black homeownership that matched concrete economic solutions with a fierce promise to right past wrongs. It is the jolt of energy that Harris\u2019 campaign needed after months of struggling to stand out in the polls. Harris\u2019 performance on 27 June, in the first round of debates of the 2020 presidential race, was a much-needed win. Harris walked on stage ranked fifth in the most crowded Democratic race in history. She left basking in attention, having metaphorically kneecapped the frontrunner. Within 24 hours, her team raised more than $2m in online donations, from 63,277 people \u2013 more than half of whom were donating for the first time. In the days that followed, polls put her among the group of top candidates in the race. With more than a year to the Democratic National Convention and 481 days until the 2020 presidential election, it\u2019s still anybody\u2019s game. Harris\u2019 debate performance didn\u2019t win her a domineering spot in the polls. It didn\u2019t drown out the criticism she\u2019s gone back and forth on key policy ideas. It didn\u2019t obfuscate some of her controversial decisions as a California prosecutor. But she\u2019s back in the race. Six months ago, for her campaign launch announcement in Oakland, 20,000 people swarmed downtown chanting, \u201cKa-ma-la! Ka-ma-la!\u201d Local police estimated that Harris drew a crowd larger than Barack Obama did when he announced his run for president in Illinois in 2007. Harris spoke of her upbringing as a child of Indian and Jamaican parents in California, and she raised the mantle of her experience: her steady climb from career prosecutor to district attorney of San Francisco, to attorney general of California and becoming one of the state\u2019s senators. She promised to prosecute the case against Donald Trump and fight for the one client she has fought for her entire life: the people. In her hometown of Oakland, deep in the heart of the self-fashioned resistance state, her message hit its target. \u201cWhen she announced, it was life-changing,\u201d said Kasie Barnes, a lifelong Oakland resident and mother of four. \u201cI\u2019ve always been familiar with her, I\u2019ve always been proud of her successes, proud of her fight, proud of her voice. Because her voice is my voice and now that I have children, her voice is their voice.\u201d Harris had a profile that spoke to the Democratic party\u2019s rapidly changing base: she was a woman with a diverse background, and unapologetically so. She was a trailblazer: the first woman of color to be elected district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California. She stood for all the things that the man in the White House did not, and against all the things that he did. She raised a jaw-dropping $1.5m in her first day. But as more and more people jumped into the race, the sheer volume of candidates began to water down the excitement that came with her launch. Until the end of June, even in her populous home state, Harris consistently polled behind the former vice-president Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders. A UC Berkeley poll had her at fourth in California in mid June, behind Senator Elizabeth Warren. Nationwide, Quinnipiac University and Politico had her polling at fifth, after Warren or the South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg. Warren had elbowed her way into the spotlight with her \u201cI have a plan for that\u201d attitude. Buttigieg was on magazine covers after clips of him speaking in Norwegian went viral. Yet six months into the campaign, Harris was fielding questions about whether she\u2019d want to be Biden\u2019s running mate. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing Harris has done wrong. It\u2019s just that she\u2019s one of many,\u201d David Latterman, a San Francisco-based political consultant, said in early June. \u201cShe\u2019s up against heavyweights. Her whole career was in California. She\u2019s well-known in California, but outside of California, she\u2019s only just begun to make a name for herself. \u201cCampaigns are not typically won in the spring of the off year\u201d one Harris adviser told the Guardian. He pointed out that even though she trailed behind Biden and Sanders, she remained in the top five in a race of more than two dozen. \u201cWe have been putting the infrastructure in place for a push in the latter half of the year,\u201d he said. To friends and supporters, Harris\u2019 argued she has had her back against the wall before. At a gala celebrating the Sun-Reporter, San Francisco\u2019s black community newspaper, around that time \u2013 an event where most attendees had known each other for decades greeted each other with full-hearted hugs encompassing the entire body, and proudly donned Kamala pins \u2013 Harris began her speech: \u201cWhen I pulled those papers in November of 2002 to run for district attorney of San Francisco, there were many, many, friends and those who were not friends, that said it cannot be done, no one like you has done this before, it will be difficult, it will be hard work, you should wait your turn.\u201d The anecdote centered on praising Amelia Ashley-Ward, the publisher of the Sun-Reporter, but the message behind it was clear: We\u2019ve polled third, or even last, before. And look how that turned out. \u201cIn her 2010 campaign for attorney general, in the primary, I was told personally, by very influential electeds, that they did not think she could win,\u201d said Brian Brokaw, a Sacramento-based Democratic consultant who managed Harris\u2019 campaign during her 2010 run for California attorney general. \u201cShe proved everybody wrong.\u201d \u201cShe thrives when her back is against the wall,\u201d Brokaw added. \u201cIt\u2019s like fuel for her.\u201d Throughout the first six months of the campaign, Harris\u2019 supporters had maintained: wait for the debates. She\u2019ll take command of the stage in the same way she stole the spotlight while questioning Trump appointees, they promised. She\u2019ll display that keep-them-on-their-toes moxie that kept everyone listening on their toes. \u201cWhen those debates come, she is going to kill it,\u201d her longtime friend Amelia Ashley-Ward said in May. At the 27 June Democratic debate, Harris brought on the fire even before the first commercial break. The stage had devolved into a chaos of candidates shouting at each other when Harris entered the fray: \u201cAmerica does not want to witness a food fight, they want to know how we\u2019re going to put food on their table.\u201d \u201cShe was prosecuting,\u201d Latterman said. \u201cOf course the line was preplanned, but it was very well-played because she was literally standing between two men yelling at each other, right over her face.\u201d And then Harris went for the jugular. \u201cAs the only black person on this stage, I would like to speak on the issue of race,\u201d she said, before turning her attention to Biden. \u201cI do not believe you are a racist,\u201d she continued, and then took him to task for his relationship with segregationist senators and his record of not supporting desegregation bussing efforts that directly benefited children like Harris. \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,\u201d Harris said to Biden. \u201cThat little girl was me.\u201d Within hours of that line, her website was selling T-shirts with the face of \u201cthat little girl\u201d splashed on the front. Harris\u2019 questions and interjections had been among her biggest strengths in her three years in the Senate. Her exchanges with the the supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh over the Russia investigation and abortion rights led to memes of her skeptical face circulating around social media. Video of the 1 May Senate judiciary committee hearing in which she flusters attorney general William Barr over the Mueller report has notched millions of views. \u201cEvery time she has one of those judiciary committee moments, her social media and her donations spike,\u201d said Dan Schnur, a professor of political communications at UC Berkeley. \u201cShe\u2019s a very talented prosecutor, and a very tough questioner, and Democratic primary voters are going to cheer whenever they see someone beating up on a Trump appointee.\u201d The context behind the cheers is clear: if this is what she can do to a Trump appointee, what could she do to Trump himself? And, for many Democratic voters, kicking Donald Trump out of the White House is ultimately what the election is about. \u201cShe is someone whose toughness can\u2019t ever be questioned,\u201d Brokaw said. \u201cPeople who are supporting her know she would not shy away from a fight against Trump, and I think a lot of people are picturing the two of them on a debate stage together.\u201d At a Harris town hall viewing party in Rancho Cordova, California, earlier this year, the question of which candidate was most likely to beat Trump was on everyone\u2019s mind. \u201cShe\u2019s great in public hearings,\u201d said Etta, a retired singer and legal assistant who asked to be identified only by her first name, over iced tea and brownies. \u201cTrump will not be able to cut her in pieces.

But in the small, conservative town in central California, the five attendees, all but one of them of retirement age, were excited they had found other \u201cpeople who are interested in Kamala.\u201d \u201cShe is unflappable when she\u2019s speaking,\u201d added Barbara. \u201cThat\u2019s something that we really need. I always trust her that she\u2019s going to say the right thing, she\u2019s going to lay it out clearly, and not stumble on her words. The question now is if the anticipation of a Trump v Harris showdown will be enough to ease some of the criticism and overcome some of the challenges the California senator has faced in recent months. She has a natural constituency among women of color, a crucial constituent in the Democratic race to the White House, but she needs to get better at telling her personal story to those voters, said Aimee Allison, the founder of She the People. Her attack at the debate and the Essence Conference was a start \u2013 \u201cTalking about her own experiences was part of the most powerful part with her exchange with Biden,\u201d Allison said \u2013 but she must do more. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that because you\u2019re a woman of color, you\u2019re going to appeal. That\u2019s not the case for Tulsi Gabbard, for example,\u201d Allison said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re a woman of color who can speak with vulnerability, authenticity and power, that will make you stand out.\u201d In tapping into that vulnerability, however, her prosecutorial experience gets viewed through a different lens. In the age of Black Lives Matter and broadening support for criminal justice reform, someone who has worked within the system her entire career can\u2019t exactly reinvent herself as someone now fighting against it. Harris describes herself as a \u201cprogressive prosecutor\u201d, but has a track record endorsing policies now considered racist and ineffective as district attorney and attorney general. \u201cKamala Harris is a cop,\u201d some of her critics on the left have argued, pointing at some of her decisions on issues including sex work, police reform, prosecutors\u2019 misconduct, prisoners\u2019 rights and truancy. Just last week, amid the celebrations over her debate performance, The Appeal, a not-for-profit media outlet focused on criminal justice reform, highlighted the wrongful conviction of Jamal Trulove under Harris\u2019 tenure as district attorney. San Francisco ultimately agreed to pay Trulove $13.1m after a federal civil jury found that the police had coerced a witness into identifying him as the suspect. Trulove, an actor who is gaining recognition following his role in the film The Last Black Man in San Francisco, tweeted, \u201cThat Black man was me!\u201d \u2013 a glib reference to one of Harris\u2019 one-liners in the debate. \u201cEvery candidate\u2019s record is going to be scrutinized in this race,\u201d her campaign adviser shrugged. \u201cThis is not a walk in the park. This is the competition to be leader of the free world. Everybody\u2019s record should be scrutinized.\u201d Others have questioned Harris\u2019 hesitancy to clarify her position on more divisive policy questions in the first months of the campaign. After the CNN town hall in April, political pundits pilloried Harris for continually answering, \u201cI think we should have that conversation.\u201d They criticized her for taking too cautious a stance, for being too deliberate, too guarded. Even Etta, one of the women at the Rancho Cordova watch party, was quick to pipe in with a snarky aside. \u201cOh, cop-out answer!\u201d she hollered, when Harris punted. Harris faced a similar criticism last week, when her answers on whether she\u2019d support federally-mandated bussing appeared to change. Her team later explained that it was a question of nuance, not yes or no \u2013 she supported the federally-mandated bussing that allowed \u201cthat little girl\u201d to go to elementary school in 1970, but understands that times are different now. She came out on the technical side of right in this fight, but dinged nonetheless. She was scathed even more for her position on eliminating private health insurance, an issue she had already walked back but raised her hand in favor of during the debate. She later had to clarify that she misinterpreted the question. \u201cWhere is she politically?,\u201d asked Latterman, the San Francisco-based political consultant. \u201cShe seems to be moving to the left. More exposure is going to expose more of what her politics are, and I think to some extent, she\u2019s still trying to figure that out on a national level.\u201d \u201cShe is not one to make rash or hasty decisions,\u201d conceded Brokaw, her former campaign manager. He sees that as working in her favor, however. \u201cVoters, having been through almost [three] years of a president who is beyond reckless, are looking for someone who is both bold and deliberate in her way of acting and thinking,\u201d he said. Harris\u2019 supporters in San Francisco argue that given the chance, she will beat Trump. After all, this is the woman who faced off with an incumbent district attorney from a storied San Francisco family, and won. This is the woman who remained steadfast for three weeks after the 2010 attorney general election while the state tallied up mail-in and provisional ballots, and won by a margin of 50,000 votes. \u201cI was for her from the very beginning and I will continue to support her because I know that her heart is right,\u201d Ashley-Ward said. \u201cPeople are drawn to her. When they see her on TV, taking on these powerful men who think they can do anything, say anything and get away with anything, people are impressed with that because I think 98% of Americans wouldn\u2019t take on these guys. She\u2019s not afraid.\u201d",

Here\u2019s an alternate invite list for a social media censorship summit that might actually be worth having:</p> <h2>Nick Ut and Kim Ph\u00fac</h2> <p>In September 2016 Facebook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/08/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-napalm-girl-photo-vietnam-war\">censored Nick Ut\u2019s iconic \u201cnapalm girl\u201d photograph</a> of nine-year-old Kim Ph\u00fac because it violated the company\u2019s ban on naked images of children.

But the controversy was an important inflection point for the public\u2019s understanding of Facebook \u2018s power. It provided a chance to consider what it would have meant if Facebook had existed in 1972 and had dictated whether or not an image with the chance to change the course of history would ever be seen \u2013 and what images might never gain historical importance because of Facebook\u2019s dominance.</p> <h2>Mass shooting survivors </h2> <p>One of the nightmarish realities of American society is that the survivors of gun massacres are often victimized twice: first by the shooter and next by the legions of gun-rights activists and conspiracy theorists who reliably launch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/28/us-guns-mass-shootings-hoax-conspiracy-theories\">campaigns of harassment and abuse</a> accusing survivors of being \u201ccrisis actors\u201d.<strong> </strong>Social media platforms have played a key role in facilitating such bullying and abuse; YouTube has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/04/las-vegas-shooting-youtube-hoax-conspiracy-theories\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/21/youtube-florida-teenagers-actors-videos-conspiracy-theories-promotion-results\">recommended</a> videos spreading lies about survivors in the aftermath of shootings, and harassers often use Facebook to find and then bully victims.

      "bodyText": "Turkey has hit back at Greek and EU officials, denying claims it is acting illegally by drilling for gas in waters off Cyprus. The country\u2019s foreign ministry criticised EU condemnation of its efforts to tap the region for potentially lucrative energy resources, saying the bloc could not be considered an impartial mediator for the divided island. In a statement that will cause dismay in Brussels, Ankara vowed to press ahead with offshore exploration to safeguard the rights of Turkish Cypriots to the natural resources. Tensions over hydrocarbons escalated sharply after the discovery of possibly huge gas reserves off Cyprus, where there are conflicting claims over territorial waters. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has repeatedly warned international oil companies commissioned by the Greek Cypriot government not to participate in the search for underwater deposits. ExxonMobil, Total and Eni are among the firms that have won licences to search in blocks around the island. Last year Turkish gunboats were dispatched to prevent Eni, an Italian oil company, from conducting drilling operations. On Wednesday Ankara dug in its heels, pledging a second drilling vessel, the Yavuz, would expand exploration activities. The ship dropped anchor off the island\u2019s north-eastern Karpas peninsula on Monday. Its arrival came two months after another ship, the Fatih, began drilling off Cyprus\u2019s west coast escorted by a frigate. Greece\u2019s newly elected prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis discussed the growing tensions in the eastern Mediterranean with Theresa May when his British counterpart called to congratulate him on the victory of his centre right New Democracy party in snap polls on Sunday. Government sources said Mitsotakis used the opportunity to highlight the role of the European Union in the wider region. In Athens, Ankara and Nicosia, diplomats fear the showdown could trigger military confrontation, and worry Erdo\u011fan may be looking to provoke crisis to divert attention from domestic troubles. Cyprus has waged a far-reaching diplomatic campaign, accusing Turkey of breaching the republic\u2019s sovereignty by encroaching on its exclusive economic zone in its efforts to stake a claim to the resources. Ankara insists it is acting within its own continental shelf or in territorial waters where Turkish Cypriots would also be entitled to an equal share of any finds. Its determination to press ahead with drilling follows Nicosia\u2019s decision to take legal action, with arrest warrants issued for the crew of Fatih. The island has been ethnically split between its majority Greek population in the south and Turks in the north since an Athens-inspired coup aimed at union with Greece prompted Ankara to order a full-scale invasion in 1974 and seize the northern third. Only Turkey recognises the breakaway state of northern Cyprus. Last month the EU threatened economic sanctions against Ankara. On Tuesday, Washington urged all parties to exercise restraint. \u201cThe United States remains deeply concerned by Turkey\u2019s repeated attempts to conduct drilling operations in the waters of Cyprus,\u201d the state department said in a statement. \u201cWe urge Turkish authorities to halt these operations and encourage all parties to act with restraint and refrain from actions that increase tensions in the region.\u201d Brussels also voiced \u201cgrave concern\u201d over Turkey\u2019s declared intention \u201cto illegally conduct\u201d a new drilling operation off the island. In a statement on Monday the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, pledged the bloc would continue to stand by its most easterly member, describing the dispatch of the second drilling ship as an \u201cunacceptable escalation\u201d. \u201cWe call on Turkish authorities, once again, to refrain from such actions, act in a spirit of good neighbourliness and respect the sovereignty and sovereign right of the Republic of Cyprus in accordance with international law,\u201d she said. \u201cThe European Union will respond appropriately and in full solidarity with Cyprus.\u201d France also stepped in this week, calling on Turkey to avoid any action that would endanger regional stability. Ankara and Paris have been at loggerheads over the issue since the French president, Emmanuel Macron, came out in support of Cyprus at a meeting of heads of EU Mediterranean states last month. \u201cWe want to take the road of calm. We want to resolve this peacefully between Greece, Turkey and Cyprus,\u201d said one EU ambassador based in Athens. \u201cThat\u2019s what we want, but frankly, who knows?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "David Gallop will stand down as Football Federation Australia chief executive in December, signalling a new era for the game after the often polarising figure\u2019s seven years at the helm of the organisation. FFA chairman Chris Nikou announced on Thursday that Gallop had handed in his notice and would leave his post at the end of the year. The timing of the decision, Nikou said, was predicated on the recent progress of the new leagues working group, which will determine the future governance of the game in Australia. It also gives FFA ample time to identify a replacement with major changes afoot in the game, including a move towards the A-League becoming an independent competition. Gallop will leave FFA having overseen a turbulent few years during which he came in for heavy criticism over his handling of fan issues and most recently the sacking of former Matildas coach Alen Stajcic. Gallop replaced Ben Buckley as chief executive in 2012 and initially ingratiated himself with fans by introducing the FFA Cup and appointing Ange Postecoglou as Socceroos coach. But a perceived lack of awareness of fan culture and, in particular, the bungled handling of the Stajcic saga at the turn of this year had led to a fall in confidence and calls for his resignation. \u201cDavid has provided strong and distinguished leadership over a long period and particularly through a difficult last few years for FFA as we have managed the governance and structural changes around the game,\u201d Nikou said. Gallop, who had previously been the NRL\u2019s chief executive between 2002 and 2012, secured a record six-year media deal with Fox Sports and he has worked towards finalising Australia\u2019s bid to host the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup. \u201cThere are challenges given the expectations that are created by the global mirror that is held up to the game in this country\u2019s competitive sporting landscape, but enormous growth opportunities are available if the stakeholders are united,\u201d Gallop said.

But it is integral to understanding her, her latest book The Yield, and the gaps in her story, which you can fill by reading her fiction but you won\u2019t find answers for here. During our interview, she asks me, again and again, to not include particular details of her life. Some are incredibly personal but some are so seemingly innocuous that I begin to wonder if I will have anything left by the end.</p> <p>But ask yourself: how would you have coped with being humiliated before your entire nation, when you were actually 25? How would you deal with a lengthy court battle that would reach Australia\u2019s federal court, that would end with your accuser found guilty of contravening the Racial Discrimination Act but who stood defiant on the court steps, refusing to apologise? You might begin to wonder where all your vulnerabilities start and end. You might begin to resist the idea that, because you are in the public eye, you have to share all of yourself with an audience who want to know about the artist but not the art.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I love writing. It fucks me though</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We meet in Paris, a long way from Wollongong, where Winch was raised; she lives on a rural property near Nantes with her husband, Arnaud, and teenage daughter, Lila. Now 35, she is incredibly nervous about reception to The Yield, her first novel since her 2006 debut, which was beloved by critics, put on school syllabuses and won awards. But what Winch remembers is reading the first review in the Australian, which implied she had only written it with \u201cwhite editorial help\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI rang my editor and threatened to jump off the roof,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really crushed me. I was really vulnerable. I was 22, a single mum. But then everything else was positive.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never written anything so commercial, so I am nervous. It means more people loving it or hating it. I should be used to it now, to know it is not an attack on me, but it is really hard, especially when you rip your heart out and put it on the page.\u201d</p> <p>Spending a decade out of the public eye has allowed her to \u201cgrow up\u201d, she says. \u201cI was a little kid. I feel old now. I didn\u2019t have my 20s. And if I don\u2019t make it by the time I\u2019m 40, I\u2019ll go be something else.\u201d She doesn\u2019t feel as though she\u2019s made it already? \u201cNooo,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you look at my bank balance, you\u2019ll know I haven\u2019t made it.\u201d But she\u2019s happy? \u201cYeah. I love writing. It fucks me though. I put on 35 kilos writing this book. <em>Thirty-five</em>. Once the idea was there, it was this huge burst over one year, getting it all on the page. I had to be manic. I had to not sleep. In that state, I didn\u2019t look after my body or my health. It was only my family and my book, and I disappeared.\u201d</p> <p>She apologises for \u201cbeing selfish\u201d and talking about herself so much \u2013 in an interview about her own book. But she\u2019s adamant: \u201cThis book can\u2019t just be for me. Maybe that\u2019s why I feel uncomfortable about the attention. It\u2019s not for my ego. This is just my heart on a plate. And I want to get it right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fd5ab754349bd42b45b2ef88817fcf54ce818896\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd5ab754349bd42b45b2ef88817fcf54ce818896/83_61_4397_5539/794.jpg\" alt=\"Tara June Winch\" width=\"794\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winch now lives in France \u2013 a long way from Wollongong, where she grew up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Alcock/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Yield spans about 200 years of history but follows the life and cultural heritage of August Gondiwindi, who is \u201cabout to exit the infinite stretch of her twenties and had nothing to show\u201d. She returns from Europe to her family home in dusty Massacre Plains when her \u201cPoppy\u201d, Albert Gondiwindi, dies of cancer: \u201c[She] knew too that she would return for the funeral.

August gets wind that Albert was researching the Indigenous history of the area, new information that may influence a proposed mining project: \u201cThe residents of Massacre gossiped about the mine and how bad it would be for the environment and others bit back that they needed jobs. Though all sides of arguing agreed they were owed something more.\u201d</p> <p>In 2008 Winch won a prestigious Rolex mentoring scheme, in which she was paired with the Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, who introduced her to a whole new world of reading; for the first time, she began making links between Greek tragedies, biblical myth and Indigenous dreaming stories. <a href=\"https://www.rolexmentorprotege.com/pairing/2008-2009/wole_soyinka_and_tara_june_winch\">There is footage of them strolling together in Nigeria</a>; Soyinka looks stately, while Winch is soft-spoken and painfully young. (When asked about her win, she told press that she was \u201cstoked\u201d.) Soyinka seemed to have a good measure of his charge: her next novel, he predicted, <a href=\"https://www.rolexmentorprotege.com/pairing/2008-2009/wole_soyinka_and_tara_june_winch\">\u201cmaybe it\u2019ll come in 10 years\u2019 time.\u201d</a> After the Carnage, a confident collection of short stories, came in 2016 but made less of an impact; she says it sold only in the hundreds.</p> <p>Winch alternates between guarded and guileless giving details of her life since she left Australia. When I press her to say more about herself, she says: \u201cWhat I really want to say is on the page. If people really want to know my small, insignificant opinion on anything \u2026 you know what I mean? I don\u2019t want to talk about this because I want to be a good role model. I am a flawed human being. I am a tortured person.\u201d</p> <p>She talks of writing as though it is a fight with her own mind, forcing herself to stay awake until the early hours to get herself into a new headspace. \u201cYou know that moment at 3am, when you\u2019re honest with yourself? And you are almost like a guide for yourself, leading yourself on the right path? I just want to listen to that voice and get on the right path.

      "bodyText": "In 2009 the Australian conservative commentator Andrew Bolt wrote an article for the Herald Sun under the headline: \u201cIt\u2019s so hip to be black.\u201d In it he named several prominent Indigenous figures who he felt had used their heritage to qualify for roles he believed they did not deserve because of their fair skin. One of them was Tara June Winch, who was then \u2013 in the words of Bolt \u2013 \u201cjust 26 and has written only one book, Swallow the Air\u201d. He complained that she had been named an ambassador for the Australia Council\u2019s Indigenous literacy project \u2013 which didn\u2019t exist. \u201cYes, indeed,\u201d Bolt wrote, \u201cbecause despite her auburn hair and charmingly freckled face, she, too, is an Aborigine, who claims her \u2018country is Wiradjuri\u2019.\u201d You may think there is something unjust in starting with this episode, or with Bolt, to tell you about Tara June Winch. But it is integral to understanding her, her latest book The Yield, and the gaps in her story, which you can fill by reading her fiction but you won\u2019t find answers for here. During our interview, she asks me, again and again, to not include particular details of her life. Some are incredibly personal but some are so seemingly innocuous that I begin to wonder if I will have anything left by the end. But ask yourself: how would you have coped with being humiliated before your entire nation, when you were actually 25? How would you deal with a lengthy court battle that would reach Australia\u2019s federal court, that would end with your accuser found guilty of contravening the Racial Discrimination Act but who stood defiant on the court steps, refusing to apologise? You might begin to wonder where all your vulnerabilities start and end. You might begin to resist the idea that, because you are in the public eye, you have to share all of yourself with an audience who want to know about the artist but not the art. We meet in Paris, a long way from Wollongong, where Winch was raised; she lives on a rural property near Nantes with her husband, Arnaud, and teenage daughter, Lila. Now 35, she is incredibly nervous about reception to The Yield, her first novel since her 2006 debut, which was beloved by critics, put on school syllabuses and won awards. But what Winch remembers is reading the first review in the Australian, which implied she had only written it with \u201cwhite editorial help\u201d. \u201cI rang my editor and threatened to jump off the roof,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really crushed me. I was really vulnerable. I was 22, a single mum. But then everything else was positive. \u201cI\u2019ve never written anything so commercial, so I am nervous. It means more people loving it or hating it. I should be used to it now, to know it is not an attack on me, but it is really hard, especially when you rip your heart out and put it on the page.\u201d Spending a decade out of the public eye has allowed her to \u201cgrow up\u201d, she says. \u201cI was a little kid. I feel old now. I didn\u2019t have my 20s. And if I don\u2019t make it by the time I\u2019m 40, I\u2019ll go be something else.\u201d She doesn\u2019t feel as though she\u2019s made it already? \u201cNooo,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you look at my bank balance, you\u2019ll know I haven\u2019t made it.\u201d But she\u2019s happy? \u201cYeah. I love writing. It fucks me though. I put on 35 kilos writing this book. Thirty-five. Once the idea was there, it was this huge burst over one year, getting it all on the page. I had to be manic. I had to not sleep. In that state, I didn\u2019t look after my body or my health. It was only my family and my book, and I disappeared.\u201d She apologises for \u201cbeing selfish\u201d and talking about herself so much \u2013 in an interview about her own book. But she\u2019s adamant: \u201cThis book can\u2019t just be for me. Maybe that\u2019s why I feel uncomfortable about the attention. It\u2019s not for my ego. This is just my heart on a plate. And I want to get it right.\u201d The Yield spans about 200 years of history but follows the life and cultural heritage of August Gondiwindi, who is \u201cabout to exit the infinite stretch of her twenties and had nothing to show\u201d. She returns from Europe to her family home in dusty Massacre Plains when her \u201cPoppy\u201d, Albert Gondiwindi, dies of cancer: \u201c[She] knew too that she would return for the funeral. Go back full with shame for having left, catch the disappointment in their turned mouths, go back and try to find all the things that she couldn\u2019t find so many thousands of kilometres away.\u201d Massacre Plains is a town divided, in \u201cepithets \u2026 procured off supermarket shelves\u201d: Chocolate Chips are the \u201cold Mission Gondiwindi north of town\u201d; Vegemite Valley \u201cwas where the blackfellas in government housing lived\u201d; and the middle-class, mostly white centre, is dubbed \u201cthe Minties\u201d. August gets wind that Albert was researching the Indigenous history of the area, new information that may influence a proposed mining project: \u201cThe residents of Massacre gossiped about the mine and how bad it would be for the environment and others bit back that they needed jobs. Though all sides of arguing agreed they were owed something more.\u201d In 2008 Winch won a prestigious Rolex mentoring scheme, in which she was paired with the Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, who introduced her to a whole new world of reading; for the first time, she began making links between Greek tragedies, biblical myth and Indigenous dreaming stories. There is footage of them strolling together in Nigeria; Soyinka looks stately, while Winch is soft-spoken and painfully young. (When asked about her win, she told press that she was \u201cstoked\u201d.) Soyinka seemed to have a good measure of his charge: her next novel, he predicted, \u201cmaybe it\u2019ll come in 10 years\u2019 time.\u201d After the Carnage, a confident collection of short stories, came in 2016 but made less of an impact; she says it sold only in the hundreds. Winch alternates between guarded and guileless giving details of her life since she left Australia. When I press her to say more about herself, she says: \u201cWhat I really want to say is on the page. If people really want to know my small, insignificant opinion on anything \u2026 you know what I mean? I don\u2019t want to talk about this because I want to be a good role model. I am a flawed human being. I am a tortured person.\u201d She talks of writing as though it is a fight with her own mind, forcing herself to stay awake until the early hours to get herself into a new headspace. \u201cYou know that moment at 3am, when you\u2019re honest with yourself? And you are almost like a guide for yourself, leading yourself on the right path? I just want to listen to that voice and get on the right path. But I\u2019m not there yet.\u201d Winch has said that when she writes: \u201cI dredge the gully of what I know best: what burnt me most, what wakes me in my sleep \u2013 the value of life.\u201d That life might be quotidian Australiana, though many of her characters are traumatised: by intergenerational grief, racism, sexual abuse, absent parents. Many of them have Indigenous blood. \u201cWe carry our ancestors on our backs,\u201d she says, of her fellow Indigenous authors. \u201cWe write these stories with our worlds on our shoulders. And that is our burden, for all First Nation writers around the world. All our stories seem really similar because we can\u2019t escape them. These problems, these things that need to be fixed, they\u2019re our stories. That\u2019s why we write similarly.\u201d Thomas Keneally has apologised for writing in the voice of an Indigenous character in his 1972 novel The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith \u2013 yet he has just done it again in his latest book, The Book of Science and Antiquities. Winch says she is tired of big Australian authors \u201cticking that box, putting in an Indigenous character because it is Australian novel. Richard Flanagan is a good bloke, but some of the big names, I\u2019m sick of them writing books about Indigenous Australia then talking about how they knew nothing about it. We\u2019ve got a problem when writers in their 60s and 70s don\u2019t know the true history of Australia.\u201d Winch was born a decade after Australia formally ended the policies that created the stolen generations but she is the product of that history; she says her fair skin is not uncommon among the Wiradjuri people owing to those policies, and she has seen firsthand how trauma travels down generations. \u201cI\u2019m trying to write that pain in my family whole, which is in a lot of Indigenous families \u2026 \u201d she says, then trails off. \u201cI\u2019m not going to ignore that drugs and alcohol are escapes for pain. And there is a lot of pain in my family.\u201d She doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, but is resigned to journalists asking. \u201cI know you have to ask. And I don\u2019t deny that I have profited from white privilege because of my skin tone. I\u2019m not delusional, I know I look like my mum and not my father. I get it. I don\u2019t have a problem.\u201d The unspoken end to that is: other people do. Which brings us back to Bolt. Winch dropped out of the legal action against him as she was interning in New York: \u201cI was so sad. I was too far away. And it was too much for me. I was too young. I just had to take a step back.\u201d On one level she \u201calmost empathises\u201d with him, as she knows race is complex; but \u201call he had to do was ring my dad, or the local Aboriginal health centre where I went as a kid.

      "body": "<p>Politicians, tech experts and even the NBN itself talked up the arrival of Netflix and other streaming video services years before the government-owned company blamed it for speed issues on the wireless network. But just how responsible is Netflix?</p> <p>On ABC\u2019s 7.30 program <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/7.30/how-the-%E2%80%98netflix-effect%E2%80%99-killed-the-nbn%E2%80%99s-dream-of/11290920\">on Monday night</a>, NBN\u2019s head of stakeholder relations, Sam Dimarco, attributed people not being able to get fast download speeds on the 4G fixed wireless network, a part of the NBN, to the \u201cNetflix effect\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened in that moment there though was the usage behaviour within the internet in general was on the increase,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spoke about the \u2018Netflix effect\u2019 and people spending more time streaming content. That put a lot of pressure on our networks, fixed wireless in particular.\u201d</p> <h2>Who does this affect?</h2> <p>There are about 11m homes and businesses that will be able to connect to the NBN by next year. Of those 600,000 can connect by fixed wireless.</p> <p>Some 285,000 homes are using a fixed wireless service on the NBN.</p> <h2>What\u2019s the problem?</h2> <p>People should be able to get speeds of up to 50Mbps on their wireless service but, as the ABC report highlighted, some customers in peak hour can only get as low as 3Mbps. Not enough to stream Netflix, or do much else.</p> <h2>Is Netflix to blame?</h2> <p>To blame Netflix or other streaming services suggests the NBN was somehow not prepared for people to use these services once connected.</p> <p>For years it was often trumpeted as one of the great uses for the network. \u201cThe lack of comparable IPTV products and services in the local market has meant that Australia is yet to experience the full data impact from this segment, however, given the rate of new product releases, it is expected that this is only a matter of time,\u201d NBN said in its 2012 corporate plan.</p> <p>\u201cNetflix now makes up 33% of peak downstream fixed access network traffic in the US. HBO has developed a range of streaming movie options to either internet connected TVs, game consoles or via web browsers.\u201d</p> <p>In 2011 the then Internode regulatory manager, John Lindsay, told a parliamentary committee that Netflix had just become \u201cthe largest single piece of traffic on the internet\u201d in the United States.</p> <p>But others sought to downplay its pending impact. The then shadow communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said in 2013 that even Netflix demonstrated that people did not need much higher speeds on the NBN.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNetflix know a bit more about this than any of us here, and their own publications say you need four megabits per second,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you had, for example, a 25 megabit per second connection to the internet, you could stream simultaneously four, or more than four \u2013 five or six \u2013 high-definition video streams.</p> <p>\u201cAnd so you could, as a household, be watching much more video, consuming much more data \u2013 hundreds and hundreds of gigabytes a month \u2013 but nonetheless not require that larger pipe.\u201d</p> <h2>So why did we not prepare?</h2> <p>While individually speeds of up to 1Gbps aren\u2019t needed to stream Netflix, it is the collective use of the network that is driving the speeds down and causing all the problems.</p> <p>In November the NBN reported that the average household connected to any type of its technology was consuming 213GB of data every month, representing a 30% jump in just one year.</p> <p>When Turnbull began as communications minister in 2013, much of the fixed network construction plan was changed, but he initially left the fixed wireless rollout untouched.</p> <p>But, as the project went on, the NBN expanded the number of homes <a href=\"https://www.itnews.com.au/news/nbn-co-to-grow-fixed-wireless-footprint-468494\">in the wireless footprint</a>, adding tens of thousands of new homes that were previously slated to be connected to the NBN via fibre-to-the-node.</p> <p>To reduce the cost per premises for the wireless network, NBN said in its 2018 corporate plan that the average number of homes covered by each tower had gone up.</p> <p>At the same time the company told the parliament that of the 1,972 towers active at that stage, 549 towers had a take-up rate of more than 50%, and, of those, eight had a take-up rate of more than 80%.</p> <p> As of June last year, less than one in five NBN towers being used to deliver wireless services was connected back to the rest of the network by fibre. The company otherwise uses microwave, which has its own capacity constraints, unlike fibre.</p> <p>A spokesperson for NBN told Guardian Australia the company had accurately predicted the rise in demand over the past few years.</p> <p>\u201cOverall, we\u2019ve tracked data consumption on the NBN access network virtually doubling every three to four years,\u201d the spokesperson said.</p> <p>\u201cWe work to ensure there is sufficient capacity to meet customers\u2019 data needs for everyday use across all technologies.\u201d</p> <p>But the company acknowledged there was some congestion during the busiest hours of the day.</p> <h2>What is NBN doing about it?</h2> <p>All of these factors have the potential to add to capacity issues but NBN has said its $800m investment to upgrade cell towers should ease some problems.

      "bodyText": "Politicians, tech experts and even the NBN itself talked up the arrival of Netflix and other streaming video services years before the government-owned company blamed it for speed issues on the wireless network. But just how responsible is Netflix? On ABC\u2019s 7.30 program on Monday night, NBN\u2019s head of stakeholder relations, Sam Dimarco, attributed people not being able to get fast download speeds on the 4G fixed wireless network, a part of the NBN, to the \u201cNetflix effect\u201d. \u201cWhat happened in that moment there though was the usage behaviour within the internet in general was on the increase,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spoke about the \u2018Netflix effect\u2019 and people spending more time streaming content. That put a lot of pressure on our networks, fixed wireless in particular.\u201d Who does this affect? There are about 11m homes and businesses that will be able to connect to the NBN by next year. Of those 600,000 can connect by fixed wireless. Some 285,000 homes are using a fixed wireless service on the NBN. What\u2019s the problem? People should be able to get speeds of up to 50Mbps on their wireless service but, as the ABC report highlighted, some customers in peak hour can only get as low as 3Mbps. Not enough to stream Netflix, or do much else. Is Netflix to blame? To blame Netflix or other streaming services suggests the NBN was somehow not prepared for people to use these services once connected. For years it was often trumpeted as one of the great uses for the network. \u201cThe lack of comparable IPTV products and services in the local market has meant that Australia is yet to experience the full data impact from this segment, however, given the rate of new product releases, it is expected that this is only a matter of time,\u201d NBN said in its 2012 corporate plan. \u201cNetflix now makes up 33% of peak downstream fixed access network traffic in the US. HBO has developed a range of streaming movie options to either internet connected TVs, game consoles or via web browsers.\u201d In 2011 the then Internode regulatory manager, John Lindsay, told a parliamentary committee that Netflix had just become \u201cthe largest single piece of traffic on the internet\u201d in the United States. But others sought to downplay its pending impact. The then shadow communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said in 2013 that even Netflix demonstrated that people did not need much higher speeds on the NBN. \u201cNetflix know a bit more about this than any of us here, and their own publications say you need four megabits per second,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you had, for example, a 25 megabit per second connection to the internet, you could stream simultaneously four, or more than four \u2013 five or six \u2013 high-definition video streams. \u201cAnd so you could, as a household, be watching much more video, consuming much more data \u2013 hundreds and hundreds of gigabytes a month \u2013 but nonetheless not require that larger pipe.\u201d So why did we not prepare? While individually speeds of up to 1Gbps aren\u2019t needed to stream Netflix, it is the collective use of the network that is driving the speeds down and causing all the problems. In November the NBN reported that the average household connected to any type of its technology was consuming 213GB of data every month, representing a 30% jump in just one year. When Turnbull began as communications minister in 2013, much of the fixed network construction plan was changed, but he initially left the fixed wireless rollout untouched. But, as the project went on, the NBN expanded the number of homes in the wireless footprint, adding tens of thousands of new homes that were previously slated to be connected to the NBN via fibre-to-the-node. To reduce the cost per premises for the wireless network, NBN said in its 2018 corporate plan that the average number of homes covered by each tower had gone up. At the same time the company told the parliament that of the 1,972 towers active at that stage, 549 towers had a take-up rate of more than 50%, and, of those, eight had a take-up rate of more than 80%. As of June last year, less than one in five NBN towers being used to deliver wireless services was connected back to the rest of the network by fibre. The company otherwise uses microwave, which has its own capacity constraints, unlike fibre. A spokesperson for NBN told Guardian Australia the company had accurately predicted the rise in demand over the past few years. \u201cOverall, we\u2019ve tracked data consumption on the NBN access network virtually doubling every three to four years,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe work to ensure there is sufficient capacity to meet customers\u2019 data needs for everyday use across all technologies.\u201d But the company acknowledged there was some congestion during the busiest hours of the day. What is NBN doing about it? All of these factors have the potential to add to capacity issues but NBN has said its $800m investment to upgrade cell towers should ease some problems. The upgrades are set to be completed later this year. In 2018 NBN said it upgraded 3,855 cells on 452 towers in total. As those upgrades are being made, NBN is keeping track of capacity issues. According to the company\u2019s latest tracking report, just over half of those connected to fixed wireless get above 25Mbps at the busiest time of day. A total of 15.31% of users get between six and 12Mbps in that hour, and less than 3% get below that. The company also put off plans to offer the 100Mbps service, similar to what it offers homes on the fixed network, in order not to make the problem worse for everyone on wireless. The company has said it would cost billions more to accomodate the higher speeds on fixed wireless. The NBN spokesperson said the company was giving network updates weekly to internet providers to pass on to customers about what speeds they could expect to get on the network. What does it mean for the government\u2019s NBN policy? At the same time as the company is making all these changes, NBN needs customers to sign on and use the network in greater numbers in order to ultimately pay off the government investment of $29.5bn and, even sooner, an additional $19.5bn commercial loan from the government to complete the network. If customers are driven away from using the network due to speed issues, the company can\u2019t pay back the money. The incoming brief prepared by the communications department for its new minister, Paul Fletcher, revealed NBN has already spent just over $10bn of the loan. The company has also flagged getting an additional $2bn in private debt to complete the network, taking the total cost to build the network to more than $51bn. Fletcher told Nine newspapers he did not see the NBN being privatised any time soon and ruled out selling the network to Telstra.",

      "bodyText": "The South Pacific nation of Tonga is in uproar after its annual beauty pageant was marred by accusations of bullying, backstabbing and racism, prompting calls by women\u2019s rights leaders for the pageant industry to be abandoned altogether. The country\u2019s Miss Heilala pageant descended into chaos on Friday when the outgoing winner had her microphone cut in the middle of a speech and another woman was allegedly racially abused while delivering the keynote speech. At the annual event, at which one young female contestant is crowned Miss Heilala and becomes Tonga\u2019s contender for the Miss South Pacific pageant, the outgoing winner gave a speech detailing alleged bullying and lack of support from the competition\u2019s organisers over the last year that left her \u201ca shell of a person\u201d. Kalo Funganitao, who is a law student at Auckland University, said she and her mother were \u201ccheated, lied to, backstabbed and just generally mistreated\u201d during her tenure, though she did not specify exactly what happened to her. Shortly after she started criticising the pageant, Funganitao\u2019s microphone was cut and loud music was played over the top of her speech. Despite the fact she could no longer be heard by the crowd, some of whom were jeering, Funganitao yelled: \u201cI am not done!\u201d and continued speaking, as her mother and brother joined her onstage. \u201cEnough is enough and I will not tolerate any more fakeness!\u201d she said. \u201cIf you have the guts to attack a person as a group in such a cowardly way, then you can deal with the consequences when she shares her experience with the entire world!\u201d A statement released on behalf of Tonga Tourism Association said it was \u201cregretful\u201d that Funganitao \u201cchose to publicly air concerns harboured over the past year\u201d. The fiery scene was not the only moment of drama of the night. The special guest at the event, Leoshina Mercy Kariha, who won the Miss South Pacific pageant in December, was reported to be the subject of a racist attack yelled from the crowd during her keynote speech. While Kariha, who comes from Papua New Guinea, was speaking, a member of the crowd reportedly yelled that she was \u201cblack, ugly and disgusting\u201d. In a statement after the event, Kariha confirmed that \u201ca comment by one individual in the VIP area was made \u2013 and that is something that is never nice to hear.\u201d But she said that since her arrival in Tonga she had been treated \u201cwith so much dignity and respect\u201d. In a statement, the festival and Tonga Tourism Association said: \u201cThe audience\u2019s alleged bullying and racist reaction to the speech from Miss Pacific Islands, as well as to that of the former Miss Heilala is deeply regretted\u201d, adding they \u201cdid not condone any form of bullying or racism and takes this allegation very seriously.\u201d Women\u2019s rights leaders from across the Pacific said a rethink of the entire pageant industry was needed. \u201cThe whole issue of bullying, sexual harassment \u2026 has been ongoing throughout [the history of the pageants],\u201d said Shamima Ali, the director of Fiji Women\u2019s Crisis Centre.

      "bodyText": "A Japanese spacecraft has successfully landed on a distant asteroid where it hopes to collect samples that could shed light on the evolution of the solar system. Scientists at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) observing the landing from a control room on the southern island of Tanegashima applauded and made \u201cV\u201d for victory signs after the Hayabusa2 probe landed on the asteroid on Thursday morning local time. \u201cThe touchdown is successful,\u201d Jaxa spokesman Takayuki Tomobe said. The agency said the probe had been working normally above Ryugu asteroid, some 300m km (185m miles) from Earth. Its landing is the second time the probe has touched down on the desolate asteroid as part of a complex mission that has also involved sending rovers and robots. The mission hopes to collect pristine materials from beneath the surface of the asteroid that could provide insights into what the solar system was like at its birth 4.6bn years ago. The agency said it would be the first time a probe has taken particles from below the surface of an asteroid. To get at those crucial materials, in April an \u201cimpactor\u201d was fired from Hayabusa2 towards Ryugu in a risky process that created a crater on the asteroid\u2019s surface and stirred up material that had not previously been exposed to the atmosphere. Jaxa said the samples could contain organic materials and water. \u201cThis is the second touchdown, but doing a touchdown is a challenge whether it\u2019s the first or the second,\u201d Yuichi Tsuda, Hayabusa2 project manager, told reporters ahead of the mission. \u201cThe whole team will do our best so that we\u2019ll be able to complete the operation,\u201d he said. Hayabusa2\u2019s first touchdown was in February, when it landed briefly on Ryugu and fired 5g pellet at more than 1,050km per hour (650mph) into the asteroid\u2019s surface to puff up dust for collection, before blasting back to its holding position. Thursday\u2019s second touchdown required special preparations because any problems could have meant the probe lost the precious materials already gathered during its first landing. The probe began its descent on Wednesday from its usual stationary position 20km above the asteroid, and is believed to have touched down on a targeted area located about 20 metres from the artificial crater\u2019s centre. During its brief time on the asteroid, Hayabusa2 collected samples from the crater formed in February via a tube that retrieved the unidentified \u201cejecta\u201d as it floated up. A photo of the crater taken by Hayabusa2\u2019s camera showed that parts of the asteroid\u2019s surface are covered with materials that are \u201cobviously different\u201d from the rest of the surface, mission manager Makoto Yoshikawa told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to analysing these materials.\u201d Tsuda said: \u201cIt would be safe to say that extremely attractive materials are near the crater.\u201d The probe will return to Earth next year, when scientists hope to learn more about the history of the solar system and even the origin of life from its samples. At about the size of a large refrigerator and powered by solar panels, Hayabusa2 is the successor to Jaxa\u2019s first asteroid explorer, Hayabusa \u2013 Japanese for falcon. That probe returned with dust samples from a smaller, potato-shaped asteroid in 2010, despite various setbacks during its epic seven-year odyssey and was hailed as a scientific triumph. Hayabusa2\u2019s photos of Ryugu, which means \u201cDragon Palace\u201d in Japanese and refers to a castle at the bottom of the ocean in an ancient Japanese tale, show the asteroid has a rough surface full of boulders. The Hayabusa2 mission was launched in December 2014 at a cost of around 30bn yen ($270m). It reached its stationary position above Ryugu in June last year after travelling 3.2bn km on an elliptical orbit around the sun for more than three years, according to Kyodo news agency. If the rest of its historical mission goes to plan, Hayabusa2 will return to its landing site in Woomera, South Australia, at the end of 2020. In 2005, NASA\u2019s Deep Impact project succeeded in creating an artificial crater on a comet but only for observation purposes.",

      "bodyText": "Kari Paul, signing off for the night! Here\u2019s what happened late in the day today. Democratic Senate candidate Amy McGrath said she would have supported Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh then changed her mind. A Nevada congressman is calling for Energy Secretary Rick Perry to resign over a toxic waste controversy. A federal judge in Maryland denied the Justice Department\u2019s motion to replace its legal team in its case to include a question regarding citizenship on the 2020 Census. Former Palm Beach State Attorney Barry Krischer denied allegations from labor secretary Alexander Acosta that he mishandled charges of sex crimes against Jeffrey Epstein more than a decade ago. Less than 24 hours after saying she would have voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Democratic Senate candidate Amy McGrath has reversed her position. McGrath, a retired Marine, tweeted at 7:30 pm ET on Wednesday she would not, in fact, have voted to confirm the justice, who faced allegations of sexual assault. Amy McGrath, the Democratic candidate challenging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for his seat in 2020, said she likely would have voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. \u201cI was very concerned about Judge Kavanaugh, what I felt like were the far-right stances that he had. However, there was nothing in his record that I think would disqualify him in any way,\u201d McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot, told the Louisville Courier-Journal. \u201cAnd the fact is when you have the president and the Senate, this is our system and so I don\u2019t think there was anything that would have disqualified him in my mind,\u201d she said, adding when pressed on how she would have voted: \u201cyeah, I probably would have voted for him.\u201d A Nevada congressman is calling for Energy Secretary Rick Perry\u2019s resignation after the department acknowledged low-level radioactive waste that was shipped to Nevada may have been mislabeled and out of compliance with safety regulations for years. From the Associated Press: Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford said Wednesday that Perry has disrespected the people of Nevada and eroded public trust in his ability to abide by rules established for nuclear waste disposal. The material is unrelated to weapons-grade plutonium that the department secretly shipped to the same site last year and is currently at the center of a legal battle with the state of Nevada in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Former Palm Beach State Attorney Barry Krischer denied allegations from labor secretary Alexander Acosta that he mishandled charges of sex crimes against Jeffrey Epstein more than a decade ago. Epstein, a convicted sex offender and financier with ties to the Trump administration, is facing new charges of trafficking and raping underage girls.Democrats are now calling for the resignation of Acosta, who brokered a plea deal for Epstein in 2008. Acosta defended his handling of the case and said Krischer was responsible for the deal. In a statement released Wednesday, Krischer said Acosta is \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d and that a 53 page federal indictment \u201cwas abandoned after secret negotiations between Mr. Epstein\u2019s lawyers and Mr. Acosta.\u201d \u201cNo matter how my office resolved the state charges, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office always had the ability to file its own federal charges,\u201d he said. Federal regulators have raised \u201cserious concerns\u201d about Facebook\u2019s proposed cryptocurrency Libra related to \u201cmoney laundering, consumer protection and financial stability\u201d, according to the New York Times. \u201cI just think it cannot go forward without there being broad satisfaction with the way the company has addressed money laundering\u201d, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell testified on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. Previously, five Democrats in the committee called on Facebook to \u201cimmediately cease implementation plans\u201d of Libra until lawmaker questions are answered. In June, Facebook announced plans to roll out the digital currency in 2020. It has pledged to work with regulators ahead of the official launch. A federal judge will let prosecutors file secret evidence in the trespassing case of a Chinese woman accused of sneaking into President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club because it contains national security information. From the Associated Press: District Judge Roy Altman said in a two-page order filed Tuesday that he reviewed the evidence against Yujing Zhang that prosecutors want to keep secret and agrees its disclosure could \u201cseriously damage\u201d U.S. national security. Zhang is charged with illegally entering the president\u2019s Florida club in March and then lying to Secret Service agents when confronted. Her trial is scheduled for next month. Authorities say she was carrying a computer and other electronics when arrested, but hasn\u2019t been charged with espionage. She fired her public defenders last month to serve as her own attorney. She remains jailed without bond. A federal judge in Maryland has denied a motion from the Justice Department to replace its legal team in its ongoing struggle to add a question regarding US citizenship to the 2020 census. Over the weekend, the Justice Department announced it wanted to replace its attorneys on the case. A judge denied that change on Tuesday, challenging the department\u2019s assertion the withdrawal of counsel \u201cwill [not] cause any disruption.\u201d A second judge denied the changes on Wednesday. Trump has threatened to issue an executive order to put the citizenship question on census forms. Critics say it will diminish participation in the census in areas with high immigrant populations. Hello, readers! It\u2019s Kari Paul here in San Francisco taking over the blog for the afternoon. Stay tuned for updates. The top news story this afternoon centered on embattled Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, who calmly and methodically defended his handling of a plea deal granted to Jeffrey Epstein related to sex crimes charges in Florida over a decade ago. Epstein said he believes his office acted \u201cappropriately\u201d and said he believes his standing with the president is secure. But the morning began with news that Kim Darroch had resigned after leaked memos sparked an international row between Trump and Britain. The Guardian reported that Darroch made his decision after Boris Johnson, the leading contender for Prime Minister, wavered in his support for the ambassador. Today, DC\u2019s mayor Muriel Browser said in a letter to Trump that his Fourth of July event \u2013 in addition to the cost of implementing security measures at protests and other related events during the weekend \u2013 bankrupted the city\u2019s special security fund. She is asking the federal government for funds to replenish it. A House panel heard from a mother whose 21-month-old daughter died in Ice custody. Her powerful testimony moved several lawmakers to tears and provided new insights into the conditions into the detention centers where newly arrived migrants and asylum seekers are kept. One fun highlight: The US Women\u2019s soccer team took a victory lap with a ticker tape parade in New York. In her remarks, co-captain Megan Rapinoe ruled out running for president but called on Americans to be kinder and better to one another. Sounds like a stump speech to us. Billionaire activist Tom Steyer is the 25th Democratic presidential candidate many in the party say they didn\u2019t really need. Steyer\u2019s entry confounded Democrats, not least because he announced six months ago that he wouldn\u2019t run for president. Steyer, a former hedge fund manager, would have been the 26th but fellow Californian, congressman Eric Swalwell, dropped out the day before Steyer jumped in. \u201cIt\u2019s rough out there,\u201d Swalwell said when asked what advice he had for the latest entrant. Steyer\u2019s change of heart essentially boils down to a fear that the Democrats in the race are not bringing the fight to Trump, as he has tried to with a multimillion-dollar campaign to impeach Trump. \u201cThey\u2019ve had one hearing so far, with Michael Cohen, and it was months ago,\u201d Steyer told the Washington Post in an interview. \u201cSo yes, I\u2019m frustrated. And really, what I\u2019m saying now is that our politics are broken by corporate money, the solution is pushing power to people, and I am convinced that it will take someone from the outside to do it.\u201d Steyer has said he intends to spend $100m on his presidential campaign, a pledge that has earned groans from candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, whose are running to weaken the influence of money in politics. The chilly reception begs the question: will Steyer receive at least 65,000 unique donors and poll at 1% in time for the first debate? He sure is trying. In a raw moment, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez embraced Yazmin Ju\u00e1rez after her testimony. Ocasio-Cortez asked her several question in Spanish regarding what she saw and experienced in the detention centers. Asked if she felt safe there, Ju\u00e1rez said \u201cno\u201d. In the House oversight committee, Yazmin Juarez, whose 21-month old baby daughter died in ICE custody, delivered searing testimony before Congress this afternoon. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta says he believed his team proceeded \u201cappropriately\u201d but won\u2019t say whether he harbors any regrets, saying the goal was to avoid a deal allowing Jeffrey Epstein to \u201cwalk free\u201d. \u201cFacts are important, and facts are being overlooked,\u201d Acosta said at a the press conference in Washington. Acosta oversaw the department at the time federal prosecutors granted the plea deal to Epstein. \u201cWe did what we did because we wanted to see Epstein go to jail,\u201d Acosta continued. \u201cHe needed to go to jail and that was the focus.\u201d During the press conference, Acosta urged more victims to come forward. \u201cThe message to victims is: come forward,\u201d Acosta said, saying they should do so \u201cbecause the justice system needs to hear from them\u201d. Asked several times whether he would apologize to the women, Acosta refused. When pressed on his relationship with Trump, Acosta said that they have a good relationship and the president has his back. \u201cMy relationship with the president is outstanding,\u201d Acosta said, adding that Trump \u201chas made publicly ... that I have his support\u201d. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta is addressing the public for the first time since Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s arrest amid calls for his resignation. He begins by saying he is pleased that federal prosecutors in New York are pursuing the case. \u201cI absolutely welcome this New York prosecution. It is absolutely the right thing to do,\u201d Acosta said. The labor secretary then offers his version of how the plea deal unfolded, suggesting that the US attorney\u2019s office, under his leadership, stepped in when it looked like the state prosecutor\u2019s office was going to let Epstein \u201cwalk\u201d. \u201cI know that my former colleagues the men and women of my office wanted to help them. I wanted to help them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we intervened.\u201d An extensive investigation by the Miami Herald paints a different picture of the deal that Acosta granted, which set aside a 53-count federal indictment and allowed Epstein to plead guilty to state prostitution charges involving underage girls. Presidential candidates love to unveil new endorsements. They are markers of influence and support and a sign post for where the energy is in a race. Bernie Sanders is taking a different tack. Today he unveiled a list of \u201canti-endorsements\u201d \u2013 people who have forcefully opposed his campaign. The list, which is filled with wealthy businessmen, billionaires and centrist Democrats, was headlined by a quote from FDR: \u201cI ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.\u201d The list of anti-endorsements include: Haim Saban, billionaire Kenneth Lagone, co-founder of Home Depot Andy Puzder, former fast food CEO Lowell McAdam, former CEO of Verizon Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase Bob Iger, CEO of Disney Jeffrey Immelt, former CEO of General Electric Lloyd Blankfein, former CEO of Goldman Sachs Alan Greenspan, Former Federal Reserve Chairman Third Way, centrist \u201cThink Tank\u201d Leon Cooperman, Former Partner at Goldman Sachs Bernard Marcus, co-founder of Home Depot Stanley Druckenmiller, billionaire hedge fund manager Guardian reporter Amanda Holpuch will be sending updates from the House oversight committee\u2019s \u201cKids in Cages\u201d hearing which is due to get underway shortly. Among those testifying is Yazmin Ju\u00e1rez, the mother of a 21-month-old girl who died shortly after being released from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) custody, Holpuch writes. The Guatemalan toddler, Mariee Juarez, is one of seven children to die while in the custody of US immigration agencies, or shortly after being released from them, in the past year. In the decade prior, no children died in the custody of these agencies. Mariee\u2019s mother will testify that Ice medical staff neglected the toddler while she was being held at a family detention facility in Dilley, Texas. A week after entering Dilley, Mariee had a 104 degree fever and suffered from cough, congestion, diarrhea and vomiting, according to the family\u2019s attorney. These conditions were not mentioned by medical staff on discharge forms, according to the lawsuit. The girl spent six weeks in hospitals before succumbing to a collapsed lung from a respiratory infection. The toddler did not show signs of illness when she was first detained by Ice, according to documents obtained by ABC and The Marshall Project. Ju\u00e1rez filed a wrongful death claim against the US government and is seeking $60m in damages. Congressional Democrats will hold hearings on Labor Secretary Alex Acosta\u2019s handling of a 2008 plea deal granted to Jeffrey Epstein after he was charged with sex trafficking involving underage girls. The renewed interest in Acosta\u2019s handling of the plea deal, which allowed Epstein to leave jail six days a week, has shone a spotlight on his work as secretary. As ace Guardian reporter Ed Pilkington explains, Acosta has proposed 80% funding cuts for the government agency that combats child sex trafficking. Acosta\u2019s plan to slash funding of a critical federal agency in the fight against the sexual exploitation of children is contained in his financial plans for the Department of Labor for fiscal year 2020. In it, he proposes decimating the resources of a section of his own department known as the International Labor Affairs Bureau (ILAB), the story says. The bureau\u2019s budget would fall from $68m last year to just $18.5m. The proposed reduction is so drastic that experts say it would effectively kill off many federal efforts to curb sex trafficking and put the lives of large numbers of children at risk. Katherine Clark, a congresswoman from Massachusetts, said Acosta\u2019s proposed cut was \u201creckless\u201d and \u201camoral\u201d. When seen alongside the sweetheart plea deal he granted Epstein in 2008, when Acosta was the US attorney in Miami, she said, it indicated that the labor secretary did not see protecting vulnerable children as a priority. \u201cThis is now a pattern,\u201d Clark told the Guardian. \u201cLike so many in this administration Mr Acosta chooses the powerful and wealthy over the vulnerable and victims of sexual assault and it is time that he finds another line of work.\u201d A federal appeals court in Virginia has sided with the president in a lawsuit accusing Trump of illegally profiting off the presidency as a result of his decision to hold on to his business interests while in office. A three-judge panel of the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based in Virginia, unanimously overturned the ruling by a federal judge who agreed with the lawsuit brought by the District of Columbia and Maryland that claimed Trump was violating the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause by making money off of the foreign and domestic officials who stay at his Washington-based Trump International hotel. The ruling effectively blocks the DC and Maryland attorneys general from pursuing financial information on Trump and the Trump organization. Trump, who has broken with presidential precedent by not divesting from his businesses, celebrated the decision in a tweet. The case is only one of several fronts on which Trump faces legal challenges and investigations into his finances from states and Democratic members of Congress. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar today called Fox News host Tucker Carlson a \u201cracist fool\u201d after he delivered a three-minute monologue on air riddled with anti-immigrant rhetoric and personal attacks. \u201cNot gonna lie, it\u2019s kinda fun watching a racist fool like this weeping about my presence in Congress,\u201d the Minnesota congresswoman write. \u201cNo lies will stamp out my love for this country or my resolve to make our union more perfect. They will just have to get used to calling me congresswoman!\u201d In the segment, aired on Tuesday night, Carlson described Omar as \u201cliving proof that the way we practice immigration has become dangerous to this country\u201d and \u201ca living fire alarm\u201d. He also accused her of having \u201cundisguised contempt for the United States and for its people\u201d. In the segment, Carlson recounted Omar\u2019s journey from Somalia \u2013 \u201cone of the world\u2019s poorest countries\u201d \u2013 to the US, \u201cthe world\u2019s richest country with all the bounty that that implies\u201d, and said she had \u201ca lot to be grateful for\u201d. \u201cBut she isn\u2019t grateful, not at all,\u201d he continued. \u201cAfter everything America has done for Omar and her family, she hates this country more than ever.\u201d Omar, one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress and the first person to wear a hijab on the House floor, has become a lightening rod for the right, who question her loyalty to the US The freshman congresswoman said her family received death threats after Trump tweeted an edited video that insinuated she had played down the 9/11 attacks. Megan Rapinoe, the co-captain of the US women\u2019s soccer team, may have ruled out running for president this year (she\u2019s \u201cbusy\u201d), but her remarks at today\u2019s ticker tape parade in New York sounded a lot like a stump speech to us (minus the expletive at the end, of course.) But that doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t be involved in the 2020 race to oust a president who has publicly denigrated her over her refusal to attend a ceremony at the White House. As 2020 campaign takes shape, with women surging to the top of the crowded field, Rapinoe could emerge as a sought after endorsement, especially for the trailblazing candidates in the race. And even if politics aren\u2019t in her future, Rapinoe, one of the first white athletes to take a kneel during the national anthem in solidarity, a leader of the campaign for equal pay and a forceful critic of the president, is unlikely to stop speaking her mind any time soon. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s own Bryan Armen Graham who, like the team, is fresh from France, on their victory parade in New York. Donald Trump, signing an executive order on kidney health: \u201cVery special, the kidney has a very special place in the heart.\u201d Robert Foster, a Republican candidate for Governor in Mississippi, has refused to a allow a female political reporter to join him on a ride along unless she was accompanied by a male colleague. \u201cIn two phone calls this week, Colton Robison, Foster\u2019s campaign director, said a male colleague would need to accompany this reporter on an upcoming 15-hour campaign trip because they believed the optics of the candidate with a woman, even a working reporter, could be used in a smear campaign to insinuate an extramarital affair,\u201d Mississippi Today reporter Larrison Campbell wrote, explaining her interaction with the campaign. \u201cThe only reason you think that people will think I\u2019m having a (improper) relationship with your candidate is because I am a woman,\u201d this reporter said. Robison said the campaign simply \u201ccan\u2019t risk it.\u201d Campbell and her editor agreed the request was \u201csexist\u201d and an \u201cunnecessary use\u201d of newsroom resources. The told Robinson she would attend the ride along alone. But the campaign insisted she would not be allowed. On Twitter, Foster defended the decision, saying he and his wife had agreed to \u201cavoid any situation that may evoke suspicion or compromise of our marriage.\u201d He followed up: Read Campbell\u2019s full story here. Donald Trump\u2019s Fourth of July event cost the DC government $1.7m, an amount that when combined with other related expenses from the weekend, has completely drained a fund used to \u201cprotect the nation\u2019s capital from terrorist threats and provide security at events such as rallies and state funerals,\u201d the Washington Post is exclusively reporting. Trump faced sharp criticism for the event that used taxpayer dollars and placed the president at the center of a holiday celebrating American independence. In a letter to the president on Tuesday, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) warned that the fund has now been depleted and is estimated to be running a $6 million deficit by Sept. 30. The mayor also noted that the account was never reimbursed for $7.3 million in expenses from Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration,\u201d the Post reported. Bowser requested that the White House commit to fully reimbursing the fund. \u201cWe ask for your help with ensuring the residents of the District of Columbia are not asked to cover millions of dollars of federal expenses and are able to maintain our high standards of protection for federal events,\u201d she wrote. Read the full story here. Our reporter Sabrina Siddiqui has been talking to DC power-players about what Darroch\u2019s resignation means. What she found is that despite Trump\u2019s efforts to portray the former ambassador as unpopular and out-of-touch, he was relatively popular in D.C., including among White House officials who regularly attended embassy parties. Sally Quinn, a Washington socialite who regularly attended Darroch\u2019s parties at the British Embassy, told The Guardian his resignation set the stage for \u201ca very big change in the way diplomacy is conducted\u201d. \u201cUp until this, I think diplomats were able to communicate to their governments and they were honest and provided valuable information,\u201d Quinn, a former journalist, said. \u201cClearly, we can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d She said the controversy was \u201cembarrassing\u201d for Darroch, whose memos were written with the intention of aiding of his government. \u201cHe wrote what he thought was going to be private, and it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Quinn said, while adding Darroch was by no means alone within the diplomatic community in his assessment of Trump. \u201cEvery word he said was true, and what he said is pretty much unanimous among most of the diplomats in Washington,\u201d Quinn said. Trump was fuming, she added, because the source of Darroch\u2019s information was likely the president\u2019s own staff, some of whom were frequently spotted at the British ambassador\u2019s parties. \u201cHe entertained constantly at the embassy and he entertained Trump people, because they like him,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing for Trump, because he\u2019s got to know it\u2019s coming from the inside.\u201d \u201cAs for Kim, every single diplomat is looking at him and saying, there but for the grace of God go I,\u201d she added. \u201cThere is not a single word Kim wrote that isn\u2019t absolutely accurate and isn\u2019t the prevailing view in Washington.\u201d \u201cIt could have been anyone.\u201d The Democrat running to unseat Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell has raised $2.5m in the first 24 hours after she announced. Amy McGrath, a retired Marine fighter pilot, rose to prominence in the 2018 midterms as part of a wave of female former members of the armed services who ran for Congress. She narrowly lost a bid for the House of Representatives. She faces a tough road ahead. Trump won the state by a far wider margin than he won the House district she lost last cycle. But she is seen as a top Democratic recruit and a prodigious fundraiser who could make the race competitive. In an announcement video released on Tuesday, McGrath recalled writing a letter to McConnell as a 13-year-old girl asking why women couldn\u2019t fly combat jets. \u201cHe never wrote back,\u201d McGrath said. \u201cI\u2019m Amy McGrath, and I\u2019ve often wondered, how many other people did Mitch McConnell never take the time to write back or even think about?\u201d Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of the USCIS, told reporters at the White House that the raids on immigrant communities are \u201cabsolutely going to happen\u201d and declined to give more details about when. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to say,\u201d he told reporters. Trump is tweeting this morning about the Iran nuclear deal in response to news that the country moved to increase uranium enrichment that surpasses the threshold reached in the landmark accord. \u201cSanctions will soon be increased, substantially!,\u201d Trump tweeted. Fox News is reporting that Labor Secretary Alex Acosta will address reporters amid calls for his resignation in the wake of his role in cutting a lenient plea deal with financier Jeffrey Epstein in 2008. Several 2020 Democrats, including Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, as well as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, have called for Acosta\u2019s resignation. According to Fox, Acosta is not expected to step down. There are mixed media reports on how willing Trump is to stand by his Labor Secretary. Kathleen Sebelius, who served as Barack Obama\u2019s Health and Human Services secretary during the rollout of Obamacare, will not run for the open Kansas Senate seat being vacated by Senator Pat Roberts, according to Politico. Sebelius, one of the most popular Democrats in the state and a former governor, was considered a top recruit for the seat. Kris Kobach, the controversial Republican former Kansas secretary of state who led Trump\u2019s disbanded electoral commission on voter fraud and the author of hardline immigration legislation, will run for the seat. His candidacy has alarmed Republicans who fear that his nomination could put the seat in a ruby red-state in jeopardy. In 2018, he lost the statewide contest for governor to Democrat Laura Kelly. New York\u2019s ticker tape parade celebrating the US women\u2019s soccer team is first and foremost about their excellence at the beautiful game. But it\u2019s also very much about politics. Which is how New York governor Andrew Cuomo ended up rolling through downtown New York on a float with Crystal Dunn and Tobin Heath chanting equal pay after signing new pay equality legislation. Meanwhile New York mayor and 2020 hopeful Bill DeBlasio, who is throwing the parade, is riding on a separate float with several of the other teammates. In an emotionally searing interview this morning, Jennifer Araoz accused Jeffrey Epstein sexually assaulting her when she was 14 and then raping her at the age of 15 inside his New York City townhouse. Federal prosecutors have charged the politically-connected financier with sex trafficking of young girls who he abused at his Manhattan and Palm Beach homes. He counts among his friends Donald Trump and former president Bill Clinton, both of whom have sought to distance themselves from Epstein in recent days. Araoz, now 32, is the latest woman to publicly accuse Epstein of assault when she was a girl. Today the House oversight committee is hosting a hearing called \u201cKids in Cages: inhumane treatment at the border,\u201d ace Guardian reporter Amanda Holpuch tells us. Among those testifying are an asylum-seeking mother who said her daughter died after being neglected by medical staff at a US Immigration Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention center; immigration attorneys who in recent weeks spoke out about the overcrowded, dirty conditions they saw at border patrol facilities; and a doctor calling for medical professionals to be sent into those facilities. Speaking for the US government is the former acting director of Ice, Ron Vitiello. Attorney Hope Frye, who supervised a team of lawyers\u2019 visit to detention facilities, said she expects that politicians at the hearing seeking to defend Donald Trump\u2019s administration will paint the criticism as partisan. Though, Frye noted, Barack Obama was also criticized by advocates and newspapers for the poor conditions in migrant detention under his watch. \u201cYou can\u2019t make this a partisan political issue,\u201d Frye said. \u201cThis is about how Americans treat children. Period. That\u2019s all.\u201d The House oversight committee is also holding a hearing on Friday to discuss family separation at the border. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of politics in Washington and around the country. This morning, Sir Kim Darroch, the UK ambassador to Washington who has been at the centre of a diplomatic row over leaked cables that were anything but diplomatic in their assessment of Donald Trump, has resigned, the Foreign Office has said. The Guardian is reporting that his decision to leave the post followed Tuesday\u2019s Conservative leadership debate, in which the frontrunner, Boris Johnson, stopped short of backing him. Elsewhere, the Wall Street Journal reported over night that Democrats are seeking testimony from two former prosecutors on the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team. We\u2019re at one week and counting until Mueller testifies publicly before Congress. The justice department has recommended the deputies not to testify, according to the New York Times. The DNC confirmed that the third Democratic debate will be hosted in Houston on September 12 and 13. The Golden Girls of American soccer will be feted with a ticker tape parade in New York City this morning after winning a fourth World Cup championship. They have become champions for equal pay \u2013 and on CNN yesterday co-captain Megan Rapinoe had a message for the president. And later this morning Trump will deliver remarks and sign an executive order on Advancing American Kidney Health.",
