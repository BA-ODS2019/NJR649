      "bodyText": "Police in England and Northern Ireland have dropped a controversial investigation into journalists who made a documentary about a Troubles atrocity, following a public outcry and a stinging rebuke from judges. The Durham constabulary and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) announced on Monday night that they were no longer investigating Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey over their work on No Stone Unturned, a film about the murder of six Catholics in Loughinisland, County Down, in 1994. The journalists were immediately released from police bail and, on Tuesday can retrieve computers, files, phones and other material that had been seized. The decision represented a victory for the journalists and press freedom campaigners and a humiliating climbdown for police, who will now face fresh pressure to find the Loughinisland murderers. \u201cThe police have dropped the case for one reason only \u2013 finally, they accept that by arresting us and raiding our homes and offices, they were the ones that acted unlawfully,\u201d Birney and McCaffrey said in a statement. \u201cThe PSNI put the cudgel in the hands of Durham constabulary and let them loose on us and on press freedom itself.\u201d The 2017 documentary, directed by the Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney, shone a light on a particularly dark event of the Troubles: the night Ulster Volunteer Force gunmen slaughtered customers in a pub watching a World Cup match. No one was charged. No Stone Unturned named the main suspects and questioned contacts between police and the alleged killers. The police arrested Birney and McCaffrey in dawn raids last August on suspicion of stealing an unredacted police ombudsman investigation into the massacre. The raids were overseen by officers from Durham constabulary after they were asked to take over the case by the PSNI due to a potential conflict of interest. Birney and McCaffrey challenged the legality of the search warrants in a judicial review, leading to vindication in Belfast high court last week when Northern Ireland\u2019s top judge quashed the warrants and rebuked police. In a statement on Monday night Durham constabulary\u2019s chief constable, Mike Barton, said the force had decided \u201cnot to progress\u201d the investigation into Birney and McCaffrey. \u201cAt all times, my officers have acted in good faith, within the law and followed due process,\u201d he said. George Hamilton, the PSNI chief constable, said he agreed with the decision and said police still hoped to find the murderers.

A Sutton Trust-funded study published last year criticised \u201cpiecemeal\u201d cuts to Sure Start centres and said that a fifth of English local authorities planned to reduce the number of children\u2019s centres in the future as reductions in central funding forced them to draw up \u201cbare legal minimum\u201d levels of services.

Plastic is seen as a versatile, indispensable product, but the environmental impact is becoming more stark. Plastic is now so pervasive that recycling systems cannot keep up and the leakage into the environment is such that by 2050 plastic in the ocean will outweigh fish. In 2017 scientists found plastic fibres in tap water, and plastic has been found in the stomachs of sea creatures in the deepest part of the ocean. Most plastic waste ends up in landfill sites or leaks into the natural environment, where it is causing huge damage to eco-systems on land and sea, creating near permanent contamination. According to academics in the United States, by 2015, of all the plastic waste generated since the 1950s, only 9% has been recycled, with 12% incinerated and 79% accumulated in landfill sites or the environment.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why are the supermarkets under fire?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Producers of plastic include retailers, drinks companies and supermarkets. Supermarkets create more than half of the plastic waste in the household stream in the UK. But they refuse to reveal how much they put on to the streets and how much they pay towards recycling it. Supermarkets are under pressure to reduce their plastic packaging and campaigners argue they have the power to turn off the tap. Much of the packaging they sell to consumers is not recyclable: plastic film, black plastic trays, sleeves on drinks bottles and some coloured plastic. The Recycling Association and other experts believe supermarkets could do much more to make packaging 100% recyclable and reduce the use of plastic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who pays to clean up the waste?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The taxpayer, overwhelmingly. UK producers and retailers pay among the lowest towards recycling and dealing with their waste in Europe. In other countries, the \u201cpolluter\u201d is forced to pay much more. In France, a sliding system of charges means those who put more non- recyclable material on the market pay more.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What can shoppers do to help?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Supermarkets are under pressure, not least from the prime minister, to create plastic-free aisles. A growing number of zero-waste shops are springing up and consumers are being encouraged to ask for products to be sold without plastic.</p>\n    <p><b>Sandra Laville</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ariana Densham, an oceans campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cThis is a genuinely bold step from Waitrose to trial food dispensers so customers can use refillable tubs and jars.

      "bodyText": "Waitrose has unveiled its vision of environmentally conscious shopping, offering customers the chance to buy food and drink that is completely free of packaging as part of a ground-breaking trial for a large retailer. In a new drive to try to eliminate unnecessary plastic and packaging, shoppers will be able to fill their own containers with a range of products from a series of dispensers using a dedicated refill station, one of the first to be installed by a major UK supermarket. In a trial starting this week at a Waitrose supermarket in Oxford, customers are being given refillable options for products including wine and beer, rice and cleaning materials, with prices typically 15% cheaper than the packaged alternatives. A standalone pick and mix range of frozen fruit and a borrow-a-box scheme to help carry shopping home are other new retail formats being tested by Waitrose at the Botley Road shop. Waitrose has transformed the store by removing hundreds of products from their packaging, although shoppers will still be able to buy the packaged versions if they wish. Plastic waste has become a major environmental issue, with television programmes such as Blue Planet exposing its detrimental effects on the oceans, and media coverage highlighting the dangers of a global plastic binge. Waitrose is among the UK\u2019s supermarkets which have signed up to the UK Plastics Pact \u2013 an industry-wide initiative to transform packaging and reduce avoidable plastic waste. However, retailers have been criticised for not doing more to tackle the issue at an earlier stage. \u201cThis test has potential to shape how people might shop with us in the future so it will be fascinating to see which concepts our customers have an appetite for,\u201d said Waitrose\u2019s Tor Harris.

The lack of clarity about the outcome of Brexit had led to some companies diverting supply chains away from the UK, while weak production led to a second month of job losses.</p> <p>Manufacturers remain hopeful that a Brexit deal will eventually be secured, with 49% expecting output to be higher in a year\u2019s time against 7% expecting it to be lower.</p> <p>Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said: \u201cThe UK manufacturing sector was buffeted by ongoing Brexit uncertainty again in May.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s retailers are warning of a fresh wave of job losses and store closures after its health check of consumer spending showed the biggest drop in almost a quarter of a century last month. Blaming the political uncertainty that also led to a contraction in manufacturing, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said sales were down 2.7% \u2013 the weakest performance since it began its monthly survey in 1995. The BRC said there had been a marked contrast between May 2018 \u2013 when hot weather and a royal wedding boosted retail sales \u2013 and the much more difficult conditions this year. Helen Dickinson, the BRC\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWith the biggest decline in retail sales on record, the risk of further job losses and store closures will only increase. \u201cWhile May 2018 offered almost unbroken sunshine, topped off by the run up to the World Cup and the marriage of Meghan and Harry, May 2019 delivered political and economic uncertainty. Food sales dropped for the first time since June 2016, with further declines in clothing, footwear and outdoor goods.\u201d Consumer spending has been the mainstay of the economy in recent months, helped by wages rising at a faster rate than prices. Official data has tended to be stronger than suggested by surveys. Dickinson said, however, that retail conditions were the toughest they had been for a decade and called on politicians to support the reinvention of the high streets, where the number of shops lying empty increased by 7,500 last year. \u201cBusiness rates remain a barrier, preventing many retailers from investing in their physical space,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a broken tax system, which sees retailers paying vast sums of money regardless of whether they make a penny at the till, and yet the government is failing to act. The legislation is falling behind the technological revolution.\u201d The BRC said almost a third of non-food sales were now taking place online. The report from the BRC followed a downbeat health check of the manufacturing sector from the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply (Cips), which found the weakest performance by industry since the immediate aftermath of the 2016 EU referendum. Orders from both domestic and overseas customers shrank after a period when businesses had been stockpiling goods in the run-up to the original Brexit deadline at the end of March, according to the regular monthly survey conducted for Cips by the research group IHS Markit. The purchasing managers\u2019 index \u2013 a closely watched guide to the strength of the manufacturing sector \u2013 fell from 53.1 points in April to 49.4 in May. A finding below 50 indicates contraction. With the deepening global trade war adding to industry\u2019s woes, Cips/Markit said it was one of the sharpest declines in the index in six and a half years. Manufacturers in the eurozone are experiencing an even sharper slowdown than their counterparts in Britain, IHS Markit said, with the purchasing managers\u2019 index falling from 47.9 in April to 47.7 in May. The UK survey found that the seven-month delay to Brexit had been followed by a reduction in domestic and overseas orders. The lack of clarity about the outcome of Brexit had led to some companies diverting supply chains away from the UK, while weak production led to a second month of job losses. Manufacturers remain hopeful that a Brexit deal will eventually be secured, with 49% expecting output to be higher in a year\u2019s time against 7% expecting it to be lower. Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said: \u201cThe UK manufacturing sector was buffeted by ongoing Brexit uncertainty again in May. The trend in output weakened and, based on its relationship with official ONS data, is pointing to a renewed downturn of production.\u201d A separate survey by the consultancy and auditing firm EY found that the UK retained its position as the No 1 European destination for foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2018, but the number of projects was down by 13% on the previous year. Fifteen per cent of global investors have put investment plans in the UK on hold owing to Brexit, the firm said, but only 6% planned to move assets out of the UK in the future. Sectors exposed to Brexit experienced major declines in FDI in 2018, with manufacturing down by 35%, headquarters down 49% and R&amp;D down 17%.",

When you are president of the US, you have a massive leadership role. You have a massive platform as well. People follow what you do.

It is really important we continue to move forwards.</p> \n   <p>What we are seeing in the USA is a rolling back of the reproductive rights of women.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is all a shambles and is in danger of becoming a rather tragic farce unless some order is brought into it. There is nothing I can do about that; the 1922 Committee perhaps should have tightened up the rules before we started.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Clarke also used the interview to challenge the argument in <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/new-prime-minister-intent-no-deal-brexit-cant-be-stopped-mps-0\">a much-read briefing by the Institute for Government </a>arguing that, if the next prime minister decides to take the UK out of the EU without a deal, it would be \u201cnear impossible\u201d for the House of Commons to prevent this. The blog has encouraged Tory Brexiters, who at one stage were very taken with the argument that MPs would never allow a no-deal.</p> \n  <p>Asked about the IfG argument, Clarke said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Procedurally you might be able to tie it [stopping no-deal] to a vote of confidence or whatever, if some prime minister was ploughing on, regarding himself or herself as not accountable to parliament.</p> \n   <p>With respect to the so-called experts at the Institute for Government, and they are experts, I find it a constitutional innovation, this argument that all parliament can do is change laws, that governments no longer need the approval of parliament for policy. If you had suggested 20 years ago that a government could proceed despite the fact that parliament had passed a motion condemning the policy it was pursuing, that would be regarded as absolutely absurd. We have conventions. Parliament has got more powers than just the powers to change the law and pass statutes.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Even though Clarke thinks a government cannot, in practice, just ignore a Commons vote opposing its policy, last year<strong> Sir David Natzler</strong>, the then clerk of the Commons, told MPs that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/oct/31/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-will-get-a-deal-through-parliament-leading-brexiter-david-davis-predicts-politics-live?page=with:block-5bd97c16e4b04df4aeadd3b3#block-5bd97c16e4b04df4aeadd3b3\"> the government could ignore a vote of this kind.</a></p> \n  <p>The IfG briefing, by <strong>Maddy Thimont Jack</strong>, is well worth reading. But it probably does not make enough allowance for the possibility that John Bercow, the Speaker, could allow some sort of binding vote on no-deal by ignoring precedent and applying the Commons procedural rules in a new way. He has already done this once before in the Brexit process, and in an interview last week (given after the IfG published its piece) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/john-bercow-reveals-plans-stay-commons-speaker\">he strongly hinted he would be willing to do so again.</a></p> \n  <figure class=\"element

A state visit of this kind is supposed to improve relations between the UK and the US. But the American president has backed Boris Johnson as the next prime minister, called for Nigel Farage to be given a role in negotiating Brexit and described Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, as \u201cnasty\u201d. He has also signalled that he is not going to let up in the ongoing row about whether the UK should give the Chinese firm Huawei a role in creating the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure. And there is a row about what might be included in the potential post-Brexit UK-US trade deal.</p> \n  <p>The Americans want healthcare to be included. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/02/donald-trump-to-land-in-uk-amid-rising-anger-over-trade-demands\">Yesterday Woody Johnson, the US ambassador to London, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cI think the entire economy, in a trade deal, all things that are traded would be on the table.\u201d </a>Asked if that specifically meant healthcare, he said: \u201cI would think so.\u201d But yesterday Matt Hancock, the health secretary and a contender to succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader and prime minister, immediately ruled out this proposal. And this morning, on the Today programme, <strong>Jeremy Hunt,</strong> the foreign secretary, former health secretary and another Tory leadership candidate, also said that the NHS would be off limits in a trade deal. Asked if he agreed with Hancock, he replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Yes. Matt is absolutely right. I can\u2019t conceive of any future prime minister, for any party, ever agreeing that we would allow NHS procurement to be part of trade talks, because the NHS as a publicly-run, publicly-owned institution is part of our DNA.</p> \n   <p>That\u2019s not to say that pharmaceutical products, drugs, those kind of things which are freely traded between countries could not be discussed. But the ownership of the NHS, and NHS services, I can\u2019t imagine that ever being part of a trade deal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is important because May\u2019s decision to offer Trump a state visit, only days after he had taken office, was to a large extent inspired by the idea that it would help the UK secure some wonderful trade deal that would somehow compensate for the economic harm caused by Brexit. (The experts say it won\u2019t, but that\u2019s another matter.)</p> \n  <p>Now that state visit is actually happening, May seems peripheral to the proceedings because she has already announced that she is resigning. As my colleague <strong>Patrick Wintour</strong> writes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/02/donald-trump-uk-state-visit-foreign-policy-special-relationship-us\">his very good preview,</a> Trump is \u201cundertaking a state visit at a time when the Queen is head of state but there is no fully functioning state\u201d. But Trump won\u2019t mind. As my colleague <strong>Julian Borger </strong>writes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/02/royals-extras-donald-trump-victory-lap-uk-brexit\">another good scene-setter</a>, the US president doesn\u2019t seem to care much about the Downing Street aspect of his visit.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/23/donald-trump-uk-state-visit-adult-children\">Trump is bringing his extended family</a>, including the heirs to his fortune and political power, Donald Jr, Eric and Ivanka.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: The US president, Donald Trump, has talked up the possibility of a post-Brexit trade deal between Washington and London during his state visit. Trump claimed talks were already happening after his ambassador made clear the US would expect to be allowed business access to the NHS as part of any deal. Trump was honoured with a state banquet at Buckingham Palace, attended by the monarch and prominent political and business figures. The White House reiterated his support for Brexit and Trump used his speech to tell the Queen the UK\u2019s sacrifice in the second world war \u201censured that your destiny would always remain in your own hands\u201d. The monarch reminded him of the two countries\u2019 commitments to international organisations set up after that conflict to help ensure peace. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said claims from Tory leadership contenders that they could renegotiate the Brexit deal were unrealistic. He challenged them to explain how they planned to \u201cavoid becoming Theresa May mark II, stuck in a holding pattern\u201d. The favourite to replace May, Boris Johnson, launched his leadership bid in earnest. He released a video promising Brexit \u2013 deal or no deal \u2013 on 31 October and calling for higher school spending, as well as defending stop and search and his record reducing crime. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, announced he would speak at an anti-Trump rally on Tuesday. He said the demonstration was an opportunity to \u201cstand in solidarity with those [Trump has] attacked in America, around the world and in our own country.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s party colleague, Sadiq Khan, joined him in criticising Trump. Khan said Trump\u2019s values were the \u201copposite of London\u2019s values and Britain\u2019s values\u201d. The US president had earlier engaged in a personal attack on the London mayor, who wrote an article for the Observer protesting the state visit, and with whom Trump has had a long-running spat. If you\u2019d like to read more, my colleagues Caroline Davies, Heather Stewart and Simon Murphy have the full story: The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has been reiterating the White House\u2019s stance on a US-UK trade deal, saying he regards it as a priority \u2013 but declining to say whether Washington will look to do a deal with the EU or the UK first. He has told NBC\u2019s Euronews: We\u2019ve got to see how Brexit proceeds and how that timing goes, but yes, [a UK-US deal is] a priority for us. We have a deep, long relationship with the United Kingdom. We have important trade relationships. I\u2019m here in the Netherlands today. They\u2019re huge investors in the United States. The United States are huge investors inside of the Netherlands. We\u2019re having a global entrepreneurial summit because of the two deep commitments to rule of law, trade, openness, entrepreneurship, as the centre of what we do. We want to do that with the United Kingdom. Yes, we will. When Brexit is completed, as the people of the United Kingdom have demanded, we do intend to work on a free trade agreement with them \u2013 one that\u2019s fair, reciprocal, based on mutual trust, and then we will both get after it and grow both of our economies. Asked in which order the US would approach negotiations over deals with the EU and with the UK, Pompeo said: \u201cI have no idea what the sequence will be.\u201d Theresa May will give Donald Trump a copy of one of the most significant documents in the transatlantic \u201cspecial relationship\u201d to mark his state visit. The prime minister and her husband, Philip, will present Trump with a framed typescript draft of the 1941 Atlantic Charter, agreed by president Franklin D Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, setting out their vision for the post-war world. The US first lady, Melania Trump, will be given a bespoke tea set from designer Emma Bridgewater. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said the Atlantic Charter was \u201cone of the first steps towards the formation of the United Nations\u201d. It\u2019s a copy of Churchill\u2019s personal draft of August 12, 1941, with his amendments in red pencil. There were no further amendments made and Churchill kept the draft on his wall as a reminder. A copy has kindly been provided with the consent of Winston Churchill\u2019s family. The first lady will receive a \u201cbespoke No 10 tea set\u201d. Asked why Donald Trump was being given a historically significant gift, while his wife was being given a tea set, the spokesman said: \u201cI think they are both gifts which have been carefully chosen.\u201d The tea set was \u201ca memento of a visit to No 10 as part of what we hope will be a successful state visit\u201d. Boris Johnson has lodged an application for a judicial review over a decision to summons him to court over claims he lied during the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign, the campaigner who brought the prosecution against him says. Marcus Ball says Johnson\u2019s legal team is seeking an order that it was unlawful for Westminster magistrates court to issue the summons against the former foreign secretary, and to suspend the criminal proceedings against him until the application for judicial review was determined. Ball says he is named an \u201cinterested party\u201d in the application and will oppose the order, the Press Association reports. The White House\u2019s tweet linked to a statement, in which Washington said Trump wanted to strengthen economic ties with the UK through an ambitious new trade agreement. The United Kingdom is one of the largest markets for US exports and one of the largest suppliers of US imports. In February, President Trump outlined his negotiating objectives to strike an ambitious trade agreement with the United Kingdom after it leaves the EU. As two of the top five largest economies in the world, the United States and the United Kingdom stand to benefit greatly from expanded trade and economic cooperation. Here are some more on the comments made by Trump as the state banquet opened this evening. He told the Queen: Your Majesty, Melania and I are profoundly honoured to be your guests for this historic state visit. Thank you for your warm welcome, for this beautiful weather, your gracious hospitality, and Your Majesty\u2019s nearly seven decades of treasured friendship with the United States of America. This week, we commemorate a mighty endeavour of righteous nations and one of the greatest undertakings in all of history. Seventy-five years ago, more than 150,000 allied troops were preparing on this island to parachute into France, storm the beaches of Normandy, and win back our civilisation. As Her Majesty remembers, the British people had hoped and prayed and fought for this day for nearly five years. In his remarks, Trump made a reference to the UK\u2019s endeavours in the second world war that can be interpreted as a coded reference to Brexit, of which he is a supporter. He told the Queen: The courage of the United Kingdom\u2019s sons and daughters [during the second world war] ensured that your destiny would always remain in your own hands. Minutes later, the White House tweeted that Trump wanted to see the process of the UK leaving the EU completed: The Queen also mentioned the US and UK\u2019s \u201cstrong cultural links and shared heritage\u201d and said the two nations were \u201cbound by the strength and breadth of our economic ties\u201d. She said: Mr President, as we look to the future, I am confident that our common values and shared interests will continue to unite us. Tonight we celebrate an alliance that has helped to ensure the safety and prosperity of both our peoples for decades, and which I believe will endure for many years to come. The Queen finished by inviting the room to raise a toast to the \u201ccontinued friendship between our two nations, and to the health, prosperity and happiness of the people of the United States\u201d. In her speech, the Queen spoke of the \u201cnew challenges\u201d the US and the UK face in the 21st century, and stressed the bonds between the two countries. As we face the new challenges of the 21st century, the anniversary of D-day reminds us of all that our countries have achieved together. After the shared sacrifices of the second world war, Britain and the United States worked with other allies to build an assembly of international institutions, to ensure that the horrors of conflict would never be repeated. While the world has changed, we are forever mindful of the original purpose of these structures: nations working together to safeguard a hard-won peace. Trump rises and says he and his wife are honoured to be present. He thanks the Queen for her hospitality. He acknowledges that the two heads of state will commemorate the D-day anniversary this week and says the UK \u201cshowed the world what it means to be British\u201d during the Blitz that preceded that invasion. Trump invokes the Queen\u2019s wartime service and calls her a \u201cgreat, great woman\u201d. And he says the two countries defeated the Nazis and liberated the world from tyranny. The US president offers a toast to the friendship of the two nations and the long reign of the Queen. The guests rise for the UK\u2019s national anthem. The Queen is delivering her speech to open the state banquet. She says she is glad of an opportunity to demonstrate the importance of the relationship between the US and the UK. She tells the US president the two nations\u2019 armed forces have cooperated regularly \u2013 including on D-day; the 75th anniversary of which Trump will commemorate on Thursday. She recalls her first state visit to the USA, at the invitation of President Eisenhower, who commanded the Allied Forces as they liberated Europe. The Queen reminds Trump that the UK and US helped set up organisations following that war. One interpretation is that she may have been referring to Nato, an organisation Trump has regularly attacked. She proposes a toast to the Trumps and the continued relationship between the UK and the US, then the guests rise for the US national anthem. The Trump dynasty is mingling with the royal family at the state banquet, where industry chiefs \u2013 rather than Hollywood stars \u2013 have gathered. In the Buckingham Palace ballroom, the white-clothed, horse shoe-shaped table has been laid out with George IV\u2019s silver gilt grand service dinner set. White place cards embossed with a golden royal crest and edged in gold show where the 170 guests are to be seated. The Queen, who does not have her own place card, is at the head of the table, with the Prince of Wales on her left and Trump on her right. Joining Trump and the first lady, Melania, at the white tie and tiara event are four of the president\u2019s five children \u2013 Ivanka Trump, with her husband Jared Kushner, Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump and his wife Lara, and Tiffany Trump. Including the Queen and Prince Charles, 16 members of the royal family are at the dinner \u2013 the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Duke of York, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, the Princess Royal, vice admiral Sir Tim Laurence, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, the Duke of Kent, Prince and Princess Michael of Kent and Princess Alexandra. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not be present. Among the captains of industry invited are the Swedish businessman and chairman of AstraZeneca, Leif Johansson, the chairman of BP, Helge Lund, and the Balfour Beatty chief executive, Leo Quinn, the GlaxoSmithKline boss, Emma Walmsley, the Universal Music Group chairman, Sir Lucian Grainge, and the Royal Dutch Shell chief executive, Ben van Beurden. They are joined by the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick. Here is the menu: Steamed fillet of halibut with watercress mousse, asparagus spears and chervil sauce. Saddle of new season Windsor lamb with herb stuffing, spring vegetables, port sauce. Strawberry sable with lemon verbena cream. Selection of assorted fresh fruits. Coffee and petit fours. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has been accused of being blind to the scale of poverty in the UK after he dismissed a UN report that found the government\u2019s austerity programme had caused misery for many Britons. The report by the UN\u2019s rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, said 14 million people in the UK live in poverty and 1.5 million were destitute. It claimed the government\u2019s \u201cpunitive, mean-spirited, and often callous\u201d austerity policies were often intended to bring about social re-engineering. Hammond has balked at the claims, telling the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme: I reject the idea that there are vast numbers of people facing dire poverty in this country. I don\u2019t accept the UN rapporteur\u2019s report at all. I think that\u2019s a nonsense. Look around you, that\u2019s not what we see in this country. Of course, there are people struggling with the cost of living. I understand that. But the point being is that we are addressing these things through getting to the root causes. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, responded: Multi-millionaire Hammond lives in a different world to the rest of us. He displays a brutal complacency about the scale of poverty and human suffering his austerity programme has created. Heartless, without compassion or any sense of humanity, after these remarks he demonstrates he is not fit to hold office and should consider his position. It\u2019s not just the United Nations: Human Rights Watch and others have commented on the poverty and inequality under this government. Meanwhile, Philip Hammond\u2019s colleagues compete with each other to promise more tax cuts, showing how utterly out of touch the Conservatives are with the problems of today\u2019s society. It appears Trump has arrived at Buckingham Palace in Marine One for the state banquet. The royal family has released a picture of the ballroom in which they\u2019ll be dining: Donald Trump claimed he has not seen any protests. About 100 demonstrators are outside the gates of Buckingham Palace. They are protesting against the US president being handed \u201cthe red-carpet treatment\u201d. Waving banners emblazoned with messages declaring the president was \u201cevil\u201d, scores of protesters blowing whistles and horns massed on a green outside the palace. Demonstrators, many of who were clutching signs urging people to \u201cjust say no\u201d to the special relationship, chanted: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s not welcome here.\u201d The demonstration, labelled Protest at the Palace: Spoil Trump\u2019s banquet by Facebook organisers, called on attendees to \u201cBring pots and pans, vuvuzelas, musical instruments etc and make some noise\u201d. Weyman Bennett, 54, the co-convenor of Stand up to Racism who helped organise the protest, told the Guardian the state visit represented \u201can insult to people\u2019s basic decent values\u201d and should have been cancelled. It will be cucumber sandwiches over champagne. It doesn\u2019t matter how boorish he is or what ridiculous things he says, I think very few people will challenge him. That\u2019s not to our credit. Sometimes you have to say to a bully they\u2019re wrong and stand up for basic rights. He\u2019s threatened nuclear war, he\u2019s behaved like a boorish idiot, he doesn\u2019t even respect basic diplomatic values. Theresa May had hoped to bolster her position by inviting Trump, he said, but it had \u201ccompletely backfired\u201d, adding: \u201cHis visit should have been cancelled until he accepts basic human rights.\u201d Bernard Kiernan, a 70-year-old retired IT consultant who volunteers at a hospital, said he had joined the protest in \u201csolidarity\u201d with friends living in America. He branded Trump a \u201cbully\u201d and a \u201cmisogynist\u201d, adding: \u201cHe should not have the right to visit our country. He\u2019s not fit to be president.\u201d Margaret Sanchez, 65, a retired nurse from north-west London, described the multi-million pound visit as a \u201cwaste of public funds\u201d. She added: He\u2019s a businessman, he\u2019s not a politician. He doesn\u2019t know how to talk to people. If it doesn\u2019t suit him, he calls it fake news. Neighbours Roshan Pedder, 72, and Paul Gossage, 66, from Surrey, travelled to London to voice their opposition to the visit. Gossage, a retired ambulance technician, carried a sign declaring: \u201cTRUMP IS A MENACE.\u201d He said: I think it\u2019s important that ordinary people from the UK life myself show we don\u2019t want him here. At one stage during the protest, a scuffle broke out when a demonstrator tried to wrestle a \u201cmake America great again\u201d red hat from a Trump supporter who had turned up. The US is ready to do a trade deal once the UK \u201cgets rid of the shackles\u201d, Donald Trump says. Serious concerns have been voiced in some quarters about the standards the UK might be obliged to accept in order to secure a trade deal with Washington after Brexit. Fears about US farming methods resurfaced earlier this year when the US ambassador, Woody Johnson, urged the UK to open up its markets and insisted practices such as washing chicken in chlorine to kill pathogens were safe. Johnson has also indicated that the US will want business access to the NHS as part of any deal. He told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show on Sunday: \u201cI think the entire economy, in a trade deal, all things that are traded would be on the table.\u201d Asked if that specifically meant healthcare, he said: \u201cI would think so.\u201d In his Financial Times article today, Vince Cable wrote: Behind the pomp is a simple truth about trade. Mr Trump is doing what he can to destroy the international rules-based order on which the government\u2019s \u201cGlobal Britain\u201d strategy is based. His administration is systematically undermining the World Trade Organization, in which Brexiters have such touchingly naive faith. And he is destroying the multilateral agreements in which UK governments have invested so much political capital: the climate change agreement; the nuclear proliferation deal with Iran; the UN Arms Trade Treaty \u2014 all are being shredded by the Trump administration. The hoped-for bilateral trade deal between Britain and the US looks less appetising by the day. Mr Trump\u2019s crude mercantilism \u2014 based on bilateral trade balances \u2014 will not suit a country such as the UK with a trade surplus. The US is clear that it wants lower food standards to please its agricultural exporters. It wants to bypass British courts to settle disputes. And it would like preferential access to public service procurements, including the NHS. Even if the government dodges these negotiating icebergs, the draft agreement would have to pass the US Congress, where House Speaker Nancy Pelosi lies in wait prepared to reject any deal if the UK ditches Northern Ireland\u2019s Good Friday Agreement in pursuit of Brexit. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Vince Cable, turned down an invitation to attend this evening\u2019s royal banquet. Today, writing for the Financial Times, he criticised the decision to invite Donald Trump at all; denouncing it as political manoeuvring by Theresa May as she sought to secure the UK\u2019s place in the world after the Brexit vote. President Trump will not be the first or last nasty piece of work to enjoy a state visit, but he is among the most dangerous. His attitudes to women and to race are abhorrent. And his crude protectionism has placed the world on the brink of trade war between the US and China, with an exposed Brexit Britain stuck in the crossfire. No amount of pomp, circumstance and royal regalia can disguise the fact that Mr Trump poses a real risk to the world, and to Britain. Here\u2019s what Cable said when he announced the decision: The housing and communities secretary, James Brokenshire, has faced criticism from Whitehall officials after suggesting people should be allowed to dip into their pension funds to afford the deposit on a first home. A DWP source said the idea had not been discussed with the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, or her department, and that officials had outlined their worries to No 10. We cannot support this policy because the evidence shows it will be risky and does not help the people it intends to help. The housing market doesn\u2019t need people to dip into their pensions to buy more houses. In an interview for the BBC\u2019s Newsnight, Philip Hammond, the chancellor and one of the most pro-European members of the cabinet, has suggesting that those Tory leadership candidates proposing to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement (which is almost all of them) are not being realistic. He said: My challenge to all of the candidates is: Explain to me how you will avoid becoming Theresa May mark II, stuck in a holding pattern. An extension of time to try to renegotiate, when the EU have already said they have finished the negotiation and, indeed, have disbanded their negotiating team, strikes me as a not very auspicious policy. Hammond also said that a no-deal Brexit, and no Brexit, were both unacceptable outcomes. That meant MPs would have to accept compromises they did not like, he said. He explained: We have a solemn obligation to find a solution which avoids both of those outcomes [no-deal or no Brexit]. That means that even at this late stage, a deal. It means people in parliament having to stop pontificating, get off their high horses and understand that we will all have to give up something to get to a deal that will work. We will all be grumpy about it, we will all be dissatisfied. But in many ways that is the only way forward for the country. If we end up with a deal that means half the people in this country think they achieved total victory and the other half think they have been totally defeated, that is not the recipe for unity in the future. And countries that are not unified are not successful. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. He will be covering tonight\u2019s state banquet at Buckingham Palace. Jeremy Corbyn will be addressing the anti-Trump demo tomorrow, but not the parliamentary Labour party, the Evening Standard\u2019s Joe Murphy reports. President Trump has arrived back at Winfield House, the US ambassador\u2019s residence, via helicopter, following his tea with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at Clarence House. And while we\u2019re on the subject of the anti-Trump demonstration tomorrow, Labour has just announced that Jeremy Corbyn, the party leader, will be attending and speaking at it. Earlier he tweeted a message of support for the protesters. (See 12.33pm.) In another Guardian article, my colleague Owen Jones argues that the protests against President Trump due in London tomorrow won\u2019t just be about who Trump is, but about what he represents. Here is an extract. These protests won\u2019t simply be about Trump and the perverse reality TV show he\u2019s treated the world to ever since he fatefully declared for the presidency. The protests will be about Trumpism: about confronting a resurgent global far right, defending the rights of women and minorities, fighting the climate emergency, opposing the threat of war, and standing against an attempt to gut the NHS and trash hard-won rights and freedoms. Trump will have left our shores by Wednesday: sadly, our own Trumpism will remain and, in the coming months, we must continue to fight it. And here is the full article. In the US, my colleague Jamiles Lartey is writing the US Politics Live blog. He is focusing on Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and influential adviser, refusing to deny in an interview that Trump\u2019s birtherism (his assertion that Barack Obama might not be a US citizen) was racist. The Labour backbencher Kate Hoey, who is one of the few MPs in her party who enthusiastically supports Brexit, like Donald Trump, has criticised her colleagues how have been complaining about his visit. (See 11.06am.) President Trump has now arrived at Clarence House, where he is having tea with the Prince of Wales. According to the White House pool, when President Trump was in Westminster Abbey he paused at white marble slab commemorating Lord Byron and inspected the stone marking the grave of Robert Adam, the Scottish architect. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has broadened his attack on President Trump. He has posted a video on Twitter saying Trump\u2019s values are the opposite of London\u2019s values and Britain\u2019s values. Here\u2019s an extract. President Trump, if you are watching this, your values, and what you stand for, are the opposite of London\u2019s values and the values of this country. We think diversity is not a weakness. Diversity is a strength. We respect women, and we think they are equal to men. We think it\u2019s important to safeguard the rights of all of us, particularly the vulnerable and the maginalised. When you are president of the US, you have a massive leadership role. You have a massive platform as well. People follow what you do. What we have seen over the last few years in the USA is a rolling back of much of the progress made in previous decades. It is really important we continue to move forwards. What we are seeing in the USA is a rolling back of the reproductive rights of women. We\u2019ve got a situation now where some states in the USA are making it almost impossible for women to have the right to have an abortion ... The fight for gender equality shouldn\u2019t just be a fight women and girls. All of us should be feminists. That means men and boys too ... If you believe that it\u2019s wrong that there\u2019s gender inequality, if you believe it\u2019s wrong that women earn less than men, if you believe it\u2019s wrong that women are still discriminated against in 2019, then you are a feminist. Khan\u2019s message focuses in particular on the way abortion rights in the US are being restricted because a number of conservative states, like Louisiana (here), Missouri (here) and Alabama (here), have been passing increasingly draconian abortion laws. Trump is not personally responsible for these state-level decisions, which have received negative media coverage in the UK, but they are consistent with the extreme anti-abortion line taken by his administration in Washington and his appointments to the supreme court, and to other courts, suggest he hopes to eventually overturn the historic 1973 Roe v Wade ruling making abortion constitutional. President Trump was welcomed at Westminster Abbey by the dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr John Hall, who led prayers at the Grave of the Unknown Warrior. As the Press Association reports, a wreath was laid in honour of the two world wars and more recent conflicts, as is tradition with a state visit - President George W Bush laid a wreath in 2003 and President Obama in 2011. Standing at the grave, the president touched his hand on the wreath and kept his eyes closed during the prayer. The proposal from Boris Johnson, the favourite in the Tory leadership contest, to ensure that every school in England gets at least \u00a35,000 per pupil (see 10.51am) could amount to a spending increase of just \u00a348.6m, or 0.1%, according to a report for Schools Week. From CBS\u2019s Mark Knoller More on what President Trump and the Queen viewed from the Royal Collection. President Trump has arrived in Westminster Abbey, where he will be laying a wreath on the tomb of the unknown warrior. President Trump\u2019s convoy is now leaving Buckingham Palace for Westminster Abbey. It\u2019s not far. By the time the first car arrives, the last vehicle may just be leaving the Palace. This is what the White House pool has filed on the visit to the Royal Gallery. The president and the queen entered a lovely pink-walled gallery at 2:28 pm for a tour of objects in the royal collection chosen for Trump\u2019s review. Many have obvious ties to the United States or the Americas, including a map of New York and Audubon birds. The first couple and the Queen are now making their way around the display now, with a guide. Conversation mostly inaudible. Also - a John Bolton sighting among the aides trailing along. And this is from Bloomberg\u2019s Jennifer Jacobs. These are from CBS\u2019s Mark Knoller. President Trump is still in Buckingham Palace, where the Queen is showing him items from the Royal Collection. Bill de Blasio, the Democrat mayor of New York, has said that he is happy to be compared to Sadiq Khan by Donald Trump. (See 9.17am.) \u201cStan\u201d is not a typo, but slang for devoted fan. It\u2019s from an Eminem song, my younger and much cooler colleagues tell me. It is also good to see de Blasio make the point that there is a very obvious reason why Trump is so fond of Boris Johnson; they have a great deal on common. UPDATE: This is from my colleague Matthew d\u2019Ancona. The Washington Post story on President Trump\u2019s state visit to the UK is headlined: \u201cAs Trump\u2019s state visit looms, Britain seems a reluctant host.\u201d Here\u2019s an extract: In Britain, a state visit doesn\u2019t just mean dining with the prime minister, or even tea with the queen. It means an extraordinary level of pomp and pageantry, plus a sleepover at Buckingham Palace. At least, it normally does. Britain is gearing up for this week\u2019s state visit by President Trump as only Britain can do. There will be an official greeting ceremony at Buckingham Palace, a lavish banquet with the queen\u2019s best china, a gun salute fired from Green Park and the Tower of London. It will all be suitably over-the-top. But there is also a sense that British officials are slightly less than enthusiastic about this particular round of state visit grandeur ... Unlike his predecessor, Trump won\u2019t be staying overnight at Buckingham Palace, the official residence of the queen. Instead, he will stay at Winfield House, the stately home of U.S. Ambassador Woody Johnson, which has the second-largest gardens in London (after Buckingham Palace). When Trump visited Britain last summer for a more modest working visit, he stayed there as well. Buckingham Palace is reportedly unable to host the Trumps because of ongoing renovation work that began in 2016. According to the official royal website, Buckingham Palace has 775 rooms, including 52 \u201cRoyal and guest bedrooms.\u201d Donald Trump clearly thinks the UK would be a better place if we were able to watch Fox News. (See 12.54pm.) But, as the Guardian reported at the time, 21st Century Fox took it off air in the UK in 2017 because it was no longer commercially viable. Subsequently Ofcom, the media regulator, ruled that some of its programmes did not comply with UK impartiality rules. If the 13 candidates who have declared that they are running for the Conservative party leadership were to form their own group in the Commons, they would be the fourth largest party - bigger than the Lib Dems, Change UK or the DUP. This morning, in his speech to the Policy Exchange thinktank, James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, said that those candidates with no realistic chance of winning should stand down now, to enable the party to conclude the contest quickly. He said: This morning, in his speech to the Policy Exchange thinktank, James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, said that those candidates with no realistic chance of winning should stand down now, to enable the party to conclude the contest quickly. He said: We simply do not have any time to waste. We simply do not have the luxury of weeks of navel gazing or days and days of whittling candidates down to the final two and talking to ourselves. At a time when the country is looking to us for leadership we need to show this as a party. So I say gently to some of my colleagues who have put themselves forward for what has been described as the Grand National of political contests. Please think carefully. If you already know it\u2019s going to be a bit of a struggle to get over the first fence let alone Becher\u2019s Brook ahead, then maybe you should pull up. There is no embarrassment in that. It doesn\u2019t reflect on your talent or ability to influence the direction of our party now and in the future. It\u2019s just the overriding need to get our new leader in place as quickly as possible. The ConservativeHome website has been keeping a tally of how many Tory MPs are publicly backing each leadership candidate. It was last updated this morning, when it had Boris Johnson in the lead, with 30 endorsements, ahead of Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove, both on 29. Since then six more MPs have come out for Johnson: Jack Lopresti, Simon Hart, Anne Main, Sir Paul Beresford, Andrew Stephenson, and Graham Stuart. Here are tweets from four of them. The others have been announced by @BackingBoris. And here is Guardian video of the president\u2019s arrival at Buckingham Palace. Here are more pictures from the president\u2019s arrival at Buckingham Palace. What was Donald Trump doing at Winfield House, the US ambassador\u2019s residence, before he arrived at Buckingham Palace? Watching TV, it seems. Anyone used to spending time in foreign hotels will know what it is like to be disappointed at the choice of channels available. Trump seems to have had the same problem. Obviously, he thinks we should be watching Fox News. According to the White House pool, along with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, other US visitors on the balcony included: Steven Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary; Woody Johnson, the US ambassador; and Kellyanne Conway, Dan Scavino, and Steven Miller, advisers to Trump. Meanwhile, back at Buckingham Palace ... Jeremy Corbyn is encouraging people to join the anti-Trump demonstration tomorrow. He has just posted this on Twitter. Earlier I said that being denounced by President Trump would do Sadiq Khan no harm at all when it comes to be re-elected as mayor of London next year. (See 9.17am.) The polling figures back this up. Last month YouGov published a poll (pdf) suggesting that 63% of Britons think Trump has been a poor or terrible president. But, for Londoners, that figure is 71%, the poll suggests, and only 9% of people in the capital think Trump has been a great or good president. The only place where Trump polls worse is Scotland, where 72% of people think he has been poor or terrible. The president was met by Prince Charles. From CBS\u2019s Mark Knoller These are from my colleague Heather Stewart, who was at the Downing Street lobby briefing. President Trump is arriving now at Buckingham Palace by helicopter. His daughter, Ivanka, is already there. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Ken Clarke, the Conservative pro-European and father of the Commons (ie, its longest-serving MP), said his party\u2019s leadership election was turning into a \u201ctragic farce\u201d because there were so many candidates. He said: It is all a shambles and is in danger of becoming a rather tragic farce unless some order is brought into it. There is nothing I can do about that; the 1922 Committee perhaps should have tightened up the rules before we started. Clarke also used the interview to challenge the argument in a much-read briefing by the Institute for Government arguing that, if the next prime minister decides to take the UK out of the EU without a deal, it would be \u201cnear impossible\u201d for the House of Commons to prevent this. The blog has encouraged Tory Brexiters, who at one stage were very taken with the argument that MPs would never allow a no-deal. Asked about the IfG argument, Clarke said: Procedurally you might be able to tie it [stopping no-deal] to a vote of confidence or whatever, if some prime minister was ploughing on, regarding himself or herself as not accountable to parliament. With respect to the so-called experts at the Institute for Government, and they are experts, I find it a constitutional innovation, this argument that all parliament can do is change laws, that governments no longer need the approval of parliament for policy. If you had suggested 20 years ago that a government could proceed despite the fact that parliament had passed a motion condemning the policy it was pursuing, that would be regarded as absolutely absurd. We have conventions. Parliament has got more powers than just the powers to change the law and pass statutes. Even though Clarke thinks a government cannot, in practice, just ignore a Commons vote opposing its policy, last year Sir David Natzler, the then clerk of the Commons, told MPs that the government could ignore a vote of this kind. The IfG briefing, by Maddy Thimont Jack, is well worth reading. But it probably does not make enough allowance for the possibility that John Bercow, the Speaker, could allow some sort of binding vote on no-deal by ignoring precedent and applying the Commons procedural rules in a new way. He has already done this once before in the Brexit process, and in an interview last week (given after the IfG published its piece) he strongly hinted he would be willing to do so again. Vauxhall bridge in central London is now bedecked with anti-Trump banners. Ivanka Trump has also been tweeting today about the state visit, but her tweets are blander and more diplomatic than her father\u2019s. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has criticised President Trump for what he said about Sadiq Khan. And Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee, has condemned Trump too, calling him \u201cdivisive, childish and destructive\u201d. The increasingly-beleaguered Ukip are looking for yet another leader after Gerard Batten stepped down, the party has announced. Batten made the announcement at a meeting of the Ukip national executive on Sunday. A replacement \u2013 the fifth permanent leader since Nigel Farage left the post in 2016 - will be in place by 10 August, a party statement said. Ukip performed disastrously at both the local and European elections last month. In the latter they won just 3.2% of the vote, and seem to have been more or less entirely replaced by Farage\u2019s new vehcile, the Brexit party. Batten took over as leader without a contest last year after the disastrous tenure of Henry Bolton, and built up the party in the polls as public frustration with Brexit grew. However, his fixation with anti-Islam policies and links to the far-right agitator Tommy Robinson saw a series of leading figures leave, among them Farage. Ukip\u2019s future even under a new leader remains extremely perilous. Turning away from President Trump\u2019s visit for a moment, Boris Johnson, the favourite to succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader and prime minister, has released his campaign launch video. It starts with Johnson promising that, if he takes over, \u201cwe will come out [of the EU], deal or no deal, on October 31\u201d, and a voter responding by saying that would be enough to make him vote Conservative again. It also features Johnson calling for higher school spending, defending stop and search and his record reducing crime when he was London mayor and speaking to a women who tells him she would consider voting for him although she is not a Conservative voter. Johnson elaborates on his plan to increase school spending in his column in today\u2019s Daily Telegraph. He says he will improve \u201csignificantly\u201d per-pupil funding. Above all, we need to address what is now a yawning funding gap between some parts of the country and others; not to split the difference, but to level up. It is simply not sustainable that funding per pupil should be \u00a36,800 in parts of London and \u00a34,200 in some other parts of the country ... Of course there are special and extra costs of living in the capital, and London schools, which face unique challenges, deserve that recognition and a helping hand. But I pledge significantly to improve the level of per pupil funding so that thousands of schools get much more per pupil \u2013 and to protect that funding in real terms. In his article Johnson does not say what his new per-pupil funding minimum would be, but a news story in the paper, which attributes its information to a source close to Johnson, says he would spend at least \u00a35,000 on every secondary school pupil - \u00a3\u00a3200 more than the government\u2019s target for 2019-20. Neither the Johnson column, nor the news story, explain how this policy would be funded. But that is unlikely to stop his policy appealing to Conservative MPs and party members who have long complained that the complicated formula used to decide how much schools receive per pupil favours inner city schools at the expense of rural schools (which are often in Tory-voting areas). And this is what Jeremy Hunt said about what President Trump said to him as they spoke on the tarmac at Stansted. I said to him that we were going to put on a great show for him, because America is our closest ally. And he mentioned to me some of his very strong views about about the mayor of London ... What he said to me was consistent with what was in his tweet. President Trump is now at Winfield House, the US ambassador\u2019s resident in central London. In an interview with Sky News Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, refused to criticised President Trump for his comments about Sadiq Khan. (See 9.17am.) When it was put to him that Trump\u2019s tweets were shocking, Hunt replied: Well, the elected mayor of London has made some pretty choice insults about Donald Trump, and all I would say is that that spat started because the mayor of London, and other people in the Labour party, decided to boycott this visit. And I think that is just totally inappropriate. In the end, everyone has their views about President Trump. I don\u2019t agree with President Trump about some things. I went to battle with him on some of the things he said about the NHS when I was health secretary. But you put those things aside when the leader of the free world, the president of our closest ally, comes here on a state visit hosted by Her Majesty, and you celebrate what is special and enduring about our relationship. Actually, the Trump/Khan spat started long before this state visit was scheduled. It has been running since 2016. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has responded to President Trump\u2019s Twitter broadside. (See 9.17am.) A spokesperson for Khan said: This is much more serious than childish insults which should be beneath the President of the United States. Sadiq is representing the progressive values of London and our country warning that Donald Trump is the most egregious example of a growing far-right threat around the globe, which is putting at risk the basic values that have defined our liberal democracies for more than 70 years. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, is speaking to BBC News now. He won\u2019t say exactly what President Trump had to say to him when they spoke at Stansted a few minutes ago, but he said that Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cconsistent\u201d with the comments on posted on Twitter about Sadiq Khan. (See 9.17am.) And here is a video of the Trump arrival. Here are more pictures of the Trump\u2019s arrival at Stansted. Here are President Trump and his wife, Melania, posing for a photograph as they were about to get off Air Force One. They were met on the ground by Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, and have just now left Stansted by helicopter for the ambassador\u2019s residence in central London. In an article for the Observer yesterday Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, said that the language used by President Trump was similar to the language used by 20th century fascists. It was the latest in a long-running series of bitter barbs the two men have exchanged about each other in public. As Trump\u2019s plane was about to land, he responded on Twitter, dismissing Khan as a \u201cstone cold loser\u201d. He also suggested that \u201cKahn\u201d (sic) was \u201cvery dumb\u201d and \u201cincompetent\u201d, and mocked him for being short. Khan will probably not be that bothered. In fact, the easiest job in politics at the moment is probably running Khan\u2019s campaign for re-election as London mayor next year. Trump is not a popular figure with Londoners, and so all Khan needs is a few posters saying Trump wants him out, and he should be home and dry. Here is President Trump\u2019s plane landing at Stansted. Donald Trump has only just landed in the UK yet already he\u2019s been stirring things up considerably. A state visit of this kind is supposed to improve relations between the UK and the US. But the American president has backed Boris Johnson as the next prime minister, called for Nigel Farage to be given a role in negotiating Brexit and described Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, as \u201cnasty\u201d. He has also signalled that he is not going to let up in the ongoing row about whether the UK should give the Chinese firm Huawei a role in creating the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure. And there is a row about what might be included in the potential post-Brexit UK-US trade deal. The Americans want healthcare to be included. Yesterday Woody Johnson, the US ambassador to London, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cI think the entire economy, in a trade deal, all things that are traded would be on the table.\u201d Asked if that specifically meant healthcare, he said: \u201cI would think so.\u201d But yesterday Matt Hancock, the health secretary and a contender to succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader and prime minister, immediately ruled out this proposal. And this morning, on the Today programme, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, former health secretary and another Tory leadership candidate, also said that the NHS would be off limits in a trade deal. Asked if he agreed with Hancock, he replied: Yes. Matt is absolutely right. I can\u2019t conceive of any future prime minister, for any party, ever agreeing that we would allow NHS procurement to be part of trade talks, because the NHS as a publicly-run, publicly-owned institution is part of our DNA. That\u2019s not to say that pharmaceutical products, drugs, those kind of things which are freely traded between countries could not be discussed. But the ownership of the NHS, and NHS services, I can\u2019t imagine that ever being part of a trade deal. This is important because May\u2019s decision to offer Trump a state visit, only days after he had taken office, was to a large extent inspired by the idea that it would help the UK secure some wonderful trade deal that would somehow compensate for the economic harm caused by Brexit. (The experts say it won\u2019t, but that\u2019s another matter.) Now that state visit is actually happening, May seems peripheral to the proceedings because she has already announced that she is resigning. As my colleague Patrick Wintour writes in his very good preview, Trump is \u201cundertaking a state visit at a time when the Queen is head of state but there is no fully functioning state\u201d. But Trump won\u2019t mind. As my colleague Julian Borger writes in another good scene-setter, the US president doesn\u2019t seem to care much about the Downing Street aspect of his visit. Trump is bringing his extended family, including the heirs to his fortune and political power, Donald Jr, Eric and Ivanka. The most powerful of them, Ivanka, will attend a \u201cbusiness leaders\u201d breakfast on Tuesday with her father in the company of Theresa May and the Duke of York. The scenes will eventually be marketed by his business empire and his re-election machine in the same way: the House of Trump and the House of Windsor, the top luxury brands of their respective nations, sitting down to make deals in the most sumptuous settings. In effect, the British royals will be serving as co-stars and extras in stock footage for Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election ads. The only royal with experience of acting for a living, Meghan, the American-born Duchess of Sussex, is thought to be staying away. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Donald Trump, the US president, is due to arrive at Stansted. Later he will receive a ceremonial welcome from the Queen at Buckingham Palace. Then he will visit Westminster Abbey before having tea with Prince Charles at Clarence House and arriving at Buckingham Palace in the evening for a state banquet. 9am: James Brokenshire, the communities secretary, gives a speech to the Policy Exchange thinktank. 9am: Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, takes part in an LBC phone-in. Morning: Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, is due to launch a campaign video for his bid for the Tory leadership. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Trump visit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. UPDATE: I have taken out some of the timings in the 9am paragraph above because they were not accurate.",

Here's who is in the family entourage:</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Ivanka Trump</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ivanka is Trump\u2019s oldest daughter and works in the White House (unpaid) as an adviser to the president. Trump has relied on her often for overseas diplomacy, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/08/politics/ivanka-sits-in-president-g20/index.html\">sitting in</a> for him briefly at a G20 summit, and he said he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/12/ivanka-trump-world-bank-pick-father-confirms-consideration\">considered</a> naming her to head the World Bank. She has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/16/hypocrisy-without-borders-ivanka-trump-trip-africa-ethiopia-ivory-coast\">visited</a> Ethiopia and the Ivory Coast on behalf of the administration to promote women\u2019s rights. Before her father\u2019s presidency, Trump ran her own fashion line.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Jared Kushner</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Trump\u2019s son-in-law is a White House senior adviser and the administration\u2019s envoy to the Middle East (also unpaid). With his wife Ivanka he has also been the subject of a host of controversies \u2013 with a whistleblower <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-clearances/whistleblower-says-ivanka-jared-got-security-clearance-over-experts-advice-idUSKCN1RD2HU\">alleging</a>&nbsp;they were granted sensitive security clearances over the objections of career security experts. He has also been <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/jared-kushners-conflicts-of-interest-reach-a-crisis-point\">accused</a> of conflicts of interest over his family\u2019s sprawling real-estate empire. Kushner wears many hats in Washington. He is supposed to come up with a Middle East peace plan, as well as US immigration policy.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Donald Trump Jr</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Trump\u2019s eldest son and his brother, Eric, run their father\u2019s business empire while he is in the White House. <a href=\"https://www.trump.com/leadership/donald-trump-jr-biography\">Officially</a>, Trump Jr is executive vice-president of the Trump Organization. It was Trump Jr who met a Russian lawyer in an infamous Trump Tower meeting in New York in 2016, after the Russian offered him election \u2018dirt\u2019 on the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Kushner also attended. Although accepting campaign help from foreign nationals is illegal, the special counsel Robert Mueller said after investigating that there was not enough evidence to prove meeting participants knew they were breaking the law. Trump Jr&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dcvisit-kjb3z6zv6\">may be accompanied</a>&nbsp;by his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News host.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Eric Trump</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Eric Trump is the co-leader of the Trump Organization during his father\u2019s presidency. He has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/17/eric-trump-donald-racism-my-father-sees-one-color-green\">defended</a> his father from accusations of racism, and <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-eric-trump-calls-father-s-critics-not-1496849988-htmlstory.html\">called</a> the president\u2019s critics \u201cnot even people\u201d.

The first couple later joined the Queen, Charles and Camilla, Prince Harry and other royals for a private lunch, also attended by Ivanka and Kushner.</p> \n<p>The Queen presented him with a first edition of The Second World War by Winston Churchill and a three-piece pen set bearing the royal cypher.</p> \n<p>But on a tour of Royal Collection artefacts in the palace\u2019s picture gallery, Trump was shown the pewter horse he gave the Queen on his last visit. Asked if he recognised it, he replied \u201cno\u201d, at which point Melania jumped in, saying: \u201cYes, this is one of ours.\u201d Trump did better when he was shown a book of tartans opened at the yellow design of his Scottish Hebridean mother\u2019s MacLeod clan. \u201cThat\u2019s my tartan,\u201d he said immediately.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad663183271c10ac2e28c5da907966adb9bf2450\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad663183271c10ac2e28c5da907966adb9bf2450/0_74_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump and the Prince of Wales.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump and the Prince of Wales.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At the banquet, Ivanka was seated between Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, and the Countess of Wessex, while Kushner was placed next to Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, and Princess Anne.</p> \n<p>Prince Harry was absent from the dinner. Corbyn and the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, had already declined to attend.</p> \n<p>Guests dined on a starter of steamed fillet of halibut followed by saddle of Welsh lamb and a strawberry sable dessert. Trump is teetotal, though the meal was accompanied by four wines \u2013 champagne, white, red, port \u2013 and water.</p> \n<p>Six glasses were set for each guest, including a champagne glass for the toast when the Queen and Trump both referenced D-day and the shared sacrifices of both nations during the second world war. The Queen stressed a war legacy that had highlighted the importance of nations working together, but Trump\u2019s emphasis was on how Britain had stood alone.</p> \n<p>Referring to the Normandy landings, the Queen said: \u201cAs we face the new challenges of the 21st century, the anniversary of D-day reminds us of all that our countries have achieved together. After the shared sacrifices of the second world war, Britain and the United States worked with other allies to build an assembly of international institutions, to ensure the horrors of conflict would never be repeated. While the world has changed, we are forever mindful of the original purpose of these structures: nations working together to safeguard a hard-won peace.\u201d</p> \n<p>In his response, Trump praised the Queen as \u201ca great, great woman\u201d who embodied \u201cthe spirit of dignity, duty and patriotism that beats proudly in every British heart\u201d. He paid tribute to the leadership shown by the royal family during the war and said Britain had stood alone in the Blitz.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn that dark hour, the people of this nation showed the world what it means to be British,\u201d he said. \u201cThe courage of the United Kingdom\u2019s sons and daughters ensured that your destiny would always remain in your own hands.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the guests rose for the toast, the president touched the Queen lightly on the back.</p> \n<p>When he arrived in the country, the presidential plane was met at Stansted by the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt. Even as it was taxiing in, Trump was launching his broadside against Khan, who has criticised Britain rolling out the red carpet for the visit.</p> \n<p>The president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1135453891326238721\">tweeted</a>: \u201cSadiq Khan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly \u2018nasty\u2019 to the visiting President of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me.\u201d</p> \n<p>The president then appeared to use some downtime at the US ambassador\u2019s residence to indulge another favourite pastime, venting his anger on Twitter on the topics of \u201cfake news\u201d, China, and the US broadcaster CNN. \u201cJust arrived in the United Kingdom. The only problem is that CNN is the primary source of news available from the US,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1135495710894374917\">he tweeted</a> before condemning it as \u201cAll negative &amp; so much Fake News\u201d.</p> \n<p>In the evening, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1135602449987899395\">tweeted</a>: \u201cLondon part of trip is going really well. The Queen and the entire Royal family have been fantastic. The relationship with the United Kingdom is very strong. Tremendous crowds of well wishers and people that love our Country.</p> \n<p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen any protests yet, but I\u2019m sure the Fake News will be working hard to find them. Great love all around. Also, big Trade Deal is possible once UK gets rid of the shackles.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hastily offered by Theresa May after Trump\u2019s inauguration, the state visit brings down the curtain on her troubled premiership.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump breezed into Britain by launching an attack on London\u2019s mayor and berating so-called fake news before being honoured with a glittering banquet hosted by the Queen. Buckingham Palace provided the sumptuous backdrop for the US president, who had long desired the endorsement of an official state visit, and took the opportunity to bring four of his five children with him. At the white-tie-and-tiara affair for 170 guests in the grand ballroom, his daughters, Ivanka and Tiffany, and sons Donald Jnr and Eric joined politicians, including the prime minister, royals, dignitaries and business people. Trump was seated between the Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall, while the first lady, Melania Trump, was placed next to the Prince of Wales. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were also on the top table. The three-day state visit had begun, perhaps unsurprisingly, with controversy. Shortly before Air Force One touched down at Stansted airport Trump launched a Twitter tirade against his old adversary Sadiq Khan, condemning the mayor of London as a \u201cstone cold loser\u201d, comments the mayor\u2019s office rebuffed as \u201cchildish insults\u201d. However, by the time the president\u2019s helicopter, Marine One, landed at Buckingham Palace for his long-desired ceremonial visit, he was wreathed in smiles, with his arrival marked by two 41-gun salutes, a guard of honour and a white-tie-and-tiara banquet. More than 100 protesters demonstrated outside the gates of Buckingham Palace against the US president being handed \u201cthe red-carpet treatment\u201d and more than 250,000 protesters are expected to take to London\u2019s streets on Tuesday, when the Trump baby blimp is expected to appear once again. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who will address the protesters in London, tweeted: \u201cTomorrow\u2019s protest against Donald Trump\u2019s state visit is an opportunity to stand in solidarity with those he\u2019s attacked in America, around the world and in our own country \u2013 including, just this morning, @SadiqKhan\u201d. The state visit, which is the 113th hosted by the Queen, brought together two dynasties, one ancient, one fledgling, as Trump combined the official visit with a family jaunt. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, a presidential adviser, watched from a palace balcony as the president and the first lady were greeted warmly by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall on the palace lawn, with Trump holding on to Prince Charles\u2019s hand for 10 seconds. The president was then officially welcomed by the Queen on the palace steps where they shared a slightly awkward half handshake. Accompanied by Charles, and to a medley of American service tunes played by the band of the Grenadier Guards, Trump inspected the guard of honour by the Nijmegen Company Grenadier Guards. The first couple later joined the Queen, Charles and Camilla, Prince Harry and other royals for a private lunch, also attended by Ivanka and Kushner. The Queen presented him with a first edition of The Second World War by Winston Churchill and a three-piece pen set bearing the royal cypher. But on a tour of Royal Collection artefacts in the palace\u2019s picture gallery, Trump was shown the pewter horse he gave the Queen on his last visit. Asked if he recognised it, he replied \u201cno\u201d, at which point Melania jumped in, saying: \u201cYes, this is one of ours.\u201d Trump did better when he was shown a book of tartans opened at the yellow design of his Scottish Hebridean mother\u2019s MacLeod clan. \u201cThat\u2019s my tartan,\u201d he said immediately. At the banquet, Ivanka was seated between Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, and the Countess of Wessex, while Kushner was placed next to Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, and Princess Anne. Prince Harry was absent from the dinner. Corbyn and the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, had already declined to attend. Guests dined on a starter of steamed fillet of halibut followed by saddle of Welsh lamb and a strawberry sable dessert. Trump is teetotal, though the meal was accompanied by four wines \u2013 champagne, white, red, port \u2013 and water. Six glasses were set for each guest, including a champagne glass for the toast when the Queen and Trump both referenced D-day and the shared sacrifices of both nations during the second world war. The Queen stressed a war legacy that had highlighted the importance of nations working together, but Trump\u2019s emphasis was on how Britain had stood alone. Referring to the Normandy landings, the Queen said: \u201cAs we face the new challenges of the 21st century, the anniversary of D-day reminds us of all that our countries have achieved together. After the shared sacrifices of the second world war, Britain and the United States worked with other allies to build an assembly of international institutions, to ensure the horrors of conflict would never be repeated. While the world has changed, we are forever mindful of the original purpose of these structures: nations working together to safeguard a hard-won peace.\u201d In his response, Trump praised the Queen as \u201ca great, great woman\u201d who embodied \u201cthe spirit of dignity, duty and patriotism that beats proudly in every British heart\u201d. He paid tribute to the leadership shown by the royal family during the war and said Britain had stood alone in the Blitz. \u201cIn that dark hour, the people of this nation showed the world what it means to be British,\u201d he said. \u201cThe courage of the United Kingdom\u2019s sons and daughters ensured that your destiny would always remain in your own hands.\u201d As the guests rose for the toast, the president touched the Queen lightly on the back. When he arrived in the country, the presidential plane was met at Stansted by the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt. Even as it was taxiing in, Trump was launching his broadside against Khan, who has criticised Britain rolling out the red carpet for the visit. The president tweeted: \u201cSadiq Khan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly \u2018nasty\u2019 to the visiting President of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me.\u201d The president then appeared to use some downtime at the US ambassador\u2019s residence to indulge another favourite pastime, venting his anger on Twitter on the topics of \u201cfake news\u201d, China, and the US broadcaster CNN. \u201cJust arrived in the United Kingdom. The only problem is that CNN is the primary source of news available from the US,\u201d he tweeted before condemning it as \u201cAll negative &amp; so much Fake News\u201d. In the evening, he tweeted: \u201cLondon part of trip is going really well. The Queen and the entire Royal family have been fantastic. The relationship with the United Kingdom is very strong. Tremendous crowds of well wishers and people that love our Country. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen any protests yet, but I\u2019m sure the Fake News will be working hard to find them. Great love all around. Also, big Trade Deal is possible once UK gets rid of the shackles.\u201d Hastily offered by Theresa May after Trump\u2019s inauguration, the state visit brings down the curtain on her troubled premiership. Trump was vocal before his visit in criticising her handling of Brexit. Given both, there was no surprise when it emerged on Monday that there would be no formal one-to-one between the president and the prime minister. Instead, the two will meet alongside their aides on Tuesday. Asked whether the president had preferred to hold a one-to-one meeting, May\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cI\u2019m sure the answer to that is no.\u201d Waving banners emblazoned with messages declaring the president was \u201cevil\u201d, scores of protesters blowing whistles and horns massed on a green outside the palace. Demonstrators, many of who were clutching signs urging people to \u201cjust say no\u201d to the special relationship, chanted: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s not welcome here.\u201d Outside Buckingham Palace, Weyman Bennett, 54, the co-convenor of Stand up to Racism, who helped organise the protest, said the state visit represented \u201can insult to people\u2019s basic decent values\u201d and should have been cancelled. He added: \u201cSometimes you have to say to a bully they\u2019re wrong and stand up for basic rights. He\u2019s threatened nuclear war, he\u2019s behaved like a boorish idiot, he doesn\u2019t even respect basic diplomatic values.\u201d Before the banquet, the Trumps took tea at Clarence House with Charles and Camilla, and laid a wreath on the tomb of the Unknown Warrior, accompanied by the Duke of York. Trump\u2019s visit culminates on Wednesday when he will join the Queen during commemorations of the 75th anniversary of D-day in Portsmouth. He will be escorted by May on a private tour of the Churchill War Rooms, from which Winston Churchill directed British forces during the second world war.",

So far England had somehow allowed them to bowl nine overs and take two for 38. Pop. Buttler clipped a four, his first, off Malik through mid-off. Pop. He knocked Hafeez for six above mid-wicket.

Wahab plays like an angry man, he stalks back to his mark like he is trying to walk away from a bar fight, then spins to run in again like he has just changed his mind. Here he was all fire and fury. He served up a series of snorting short balls, thud, thud, thud up at Buttler\u2019s ribs. The sixth was back-of-a-length, and just a touch under 90mph, and anyone sensible would have tried to ride it down to the ground. But not Buttler. He stepped across to the off, spun around on his heel and flicked the ball up over the \u2019keeper\u2019s head to fine leg for four.</p> \n<p>It was an astonishing shot and it seemed to break the spell. Soon enough the English fans were chanting You\u2019re Not Singing Any More at the Pakistanis who had fallen quiet as Root and Buttler pressed on together. They made some pair, a real Astaire and Kelly, Root lissom and elegant, twisting his bat this way and that as he popped up on his tiptoes, Buttler flashy and muscular, bound down low to the ground. Until now no one had scored a hundred in this World Cup; until now England had not scored more than one century in a World Cup match. Root and Buttler changed all that. So how did England end up losing the match?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1fb10da1212579a9ecc1f9775c9a5936c2fb58d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1fb10da1212579a9ecc1f9775c9a5936c2fb58d/0_209_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Root in full flow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Root in full flow.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robbie Stephenson/JMP/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>You can\u2019t blame the defeat on the two men who succeeded. But, you guess both Buttler and Root will regret that having made centuries, one, the other or both was not able to go on and finish the job. Root got out for 107, slicing a catch to backward point off Shadab Khan. Buttler followed for 103, caught at short third man off a canny off-cutter from Mohammad Amir.</p> \n<p>If Buttler\u2019s arrival had changed the game one way, his departure blew it right back the other. They still needed 61 off 33 and all of a sudden the improbable seemed almost impossible. England have overcome odds like those often enough in the last four years. Usually a superhero turns up to save them in the last act. But not this time. They had been too sloppy, the pressure was too intense and Pakistan were too sharp. As good as England were coming into this tournament it is clear they are going to need to be that much better again if they are going to win it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure>",

He stepped across to the off, spun around on his heel and flicked the ball up over the \u2019keeper\u2019s head to fine leg for four. It was an astonishing shot and it seemed to break the spell. Soon enough the English fans were chanting You\u2019re Not Singing Any More at the Pakistanis who had fallen quiet as Root and Buttler pressed on together. They made some pair, a real Astaire and Kelly, Root lissom and elegant, twisting his bat this way and that as he popped up on his tiptoes, Buttler flashy and muscular, bound down low to the ground. Until now no one had scored a hundred in this World Cup; until now England had not scored more than one century in a World Cup match. Root and Buttler changed all that. So how did England end up losing the match? You can\u2019t blame the defeat on the two men who succeeded. But, you guess both Buttler and Root will regret that having made centuries, one, the other or both was not able to go on and finish the job. Root got out for 107, slicing a catch to backward point off Shadab Khan. Buttler followed for 103, caught at short third man off a canny off-cutter from Mohammad Amir. If Buttler\u2019s arrival had changed the game one way, his departure blew it right back the other. They still needed 61 off 33 and all of a sudden the improbable seemed almost impossible. England have overcome odds like those often enough in the last four years. Usually a superhero turns up to save them in the last act. But not this time. They had been too sloppy, the pressure was too intense and Pakistan were too sharp. As good as England were coming into this tournament it is clear they are going to need to be that much better again if they are going to win it.",

More than 250,000 protesters are expected to take to London\u2019s streets on Tuesday, but on Monday the US president was all smiles as his arrival was marked by two 41-gun salutes, a guard of honour and a white-tie-and-tiara banquet. Richard Wolffe says the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/03/trump-queen-british-state-visit\">status accorded by such a reception is all Trump wants</a> from his UK visit; Hannah Jane Parkinson analyses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/03/trump-windsor-state-visit-queen\">what the photos of the visit mean</a>; and Zoe Williams <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/03/brexiters-donald-trump\">warns Brexiters</a> that allying with Trump will do nothing to preserve Britain\u2019s sovereignty.

One chronically ill former employee of the Queensland department of primary industries said the use of the chemical in defiance of long-known risks and forceful warnings from health authorities amounted to \u201cstate-sanctioned poisoning\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 4 June. Top stories Donald Trump has kicked off his state visit to the UK on the offensive against \u201cfake news\u201d and the mayor of London. The president heralded his arrival with a Twitter tirade against his old adversary Sadiq Khan, condemning the mayor as a \u201cstone-cold loser\u201d. More than 250,000 protesters are expected to take to London\u2019s streets on Tuesday, but on Monday the US president was all smiles as his arrival was marked by two 41-gun salutes, a guard of honour and a white-tie-and-tiara banquet. Richard Wolffe says the status accorded by such a reception is all Trump wants from his UK visit; Hannah Jane Parkinson analyses what the photos of the visit mean; and Zoe Williams warns Brexiters that allying with Trump will do nothing to preserve Britain\u2019s sovereignty. Trump is expected to demand that the UK rethinks its plan to do business with Huawei when he meets Theresa May in Downing Street, amid much speculation that she will accede to the wishes of the US. Queensland government biosecurity workers were exposed to a carcinogenic and gene-altering chemical for six months after its use was banned in the mid-1990s. A leading occupational medical expert has said workers\u2019 exposure to the highly toxic fumigant ethylene dibromide was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d the cause of debilitating and serious illnesses suffered over two decades. One chronically ill former employee of the Queensland department of primary industries said the use of the chemical in defiance of long-known risks and forceful warnings from health authorities amounted to \u201cstate-sanctioned poisoning\u201d. A Guardian Australia investigation into the landmark papaya fruit fly eradication program has also revealed claims that long-term unemployed people were recruited to work with unconventional pesticides and told they were \u201cguinea pigs\u201d. Australian musicians including Midnight Oil, Cloud Control, Vance Joy and Regurgitator have banded together to create a new investment platform that allows musicians to build and invest in solar farms. Launching today, it will help artists offset the extremely high emissions output of touring and music production. Cloud Control\u2019s Heidi Leffner, who led the project, said she wanted to tap into the creative drive of her industry to find a solution to a complex problem. \u201cThe environmental movement often lacks a positive premise for action,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is exciting to own a piece of a solar farm. To do that collectively, we can leave a lasting, tangible infrastructure legacy and say, \u2018We built that together.\u2019\u201d World An attempt to extradite Julian Assange to Sweden has suffered a setback after a court in Uppsala rejected a request to detain him. The ruling by the district court prevents Swedish prosecutors from applying immediately for an extradition warrant. Safety regulators in the US have identified a further problem in Boeing\u2019s grounded 737 Max model and the generation of planes that preceded it. The Federal Aviation Administration has told airlines to check more than 300 737 aircraft, including 179 of the Max model, for improperly manufactured parts. Boris Johnson has pulled ahead of his closest rivals for the leadership of the UK Conservative party, with a slew of endorsements from prominent party moderates and Brexiters. Kevin Spacey appeared on Monday at a Massachusetts courthouse where a judge was set to hold a hearing in the case accusing the actor of groping a young man at a Nantucket bar in 2016. His appearance was a surprise as he was not required to attend the hearing. Apple has announced that the iPhone is going to get faster, the iTunes app is dead on the Mac and the iPad is getting its own operating system, as it launches its latest products. Opinion and analysis Eighteen-year-old Ollie Nancarrow mowed a giant phallus into a field to greet Donald Trump as the US president flew into the UK\u2019s Stansted airport on Monday morning. He\u2019s not the first to employ such imagery, writes Leo Benedictus in his short history of penis protests. And, while the schoolteachers of your childhood would likely not agree, some drawings of penises are extremely big, and actually quite clever. On Tuesday the Reserve Bank is expected to cut interest rates to a record low of 1.25%. It is not all doom and gloom, but the Australian economy is not doing well, writes Greg Jericho: \u201cThe GDP figures released on Wednesday are likely to confirm that real household incomes remain flat.

Barty\u2019s impressive run at the Open continued on Monday when the Australian saw off Kenin 6-3, 3-6, 6-0. Pakistan have stunned England with a 14-run win at the cricket World Cup, despite centuries from Joe Root and Jos Buttler. Pakistan set a daunting target of 349, in utter contrast to the feeble performance against West Indies in their opening match of the tournament.

While West Ham are unlikely to be as busy as they were when they spent \u00a3100m on nine players last summer, Manuel Pellegrini has made a new central midfielder a priority and believes Gomes would have a major impact on his side\u2019s development. The London Stadium club have already had an \u00a318m bid for the Portugal player knocked back and have returned to Barcelona with a new offer. It is thought the Spanish champions want at least \u00a325m for the 25-year-old. However, West Ham are concerned they will struggle to convince Gomes to join them even if they agree a deal with Barcelona. He impressed while on loan at Everton last season and his representatives have made it clear his preferred outcome is a permanent move to Goodison Park. Everton are yet to make a bid and Pellegrini is desperate to pair Gomes with Declan Rice, but West Ham face the likelihood of having to make alternative plans.

The land that Brigalow solar farm is being built on was previously used as a sorghum grain farm. It is now being leased from the land\u2019s owner to build the solar project, whose progress is closely monitored by Impact Investment Group, which manages the underlying fund investing in Brigalow.</p> <p>And artists can put forward as much as they can afford. Perhaps they want to throw in a one-off lump sum, or offer a percentage of their touring income; the idea is that everyone should be able to invest in their financial and environmental future \u2013 which is why FEAT. set a floor price of just $5 to set up an account.</p> <p>FEAT. says the 34.55-megawatt Brigalow solar farm could power the equivalent of 11,300 homes for 30 years. (Looked at another way, it could generate more than 2,000 Cloud Control tours in renewable energy.) That energy is then sold into the energy market, with a target return on investment for artists of 5% a year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7c19b5f0a8afb068064d69f13cb0f307db171017\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c19b5f0a8afb068064d69f13cb0f307db171017/0_0_6474_4316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heidi Lenffer at Brigalow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heidi Lenffer was willing to gamble that \u2018a progressive community like the music industry would have the guts and imagination to embrace change\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ulrich Lenffer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The total emissions output of the global music sector is not well studied.

The land that Brigalow solar farm is being built on was previously used as a sorghum grain farm. It is now being leased from the land\u2019s owner to build the solar project, whose progress is closely monitored by Impact Investment Group, which manages the underlying fund investing in Brigalow. And artists can put forward as much as they can afford. Perhaps they want to throw in a one-off lump sum, or offer a percentage of their touring income; the idea is that everyone should be able to invest in their financial and environmental future \u2013 which is why FEAT. set a floor price of just $5 to set up an account. FEAT. says the 34.55-megawatt Brigalow solar farm could power the equivalent of 11,300 homes for 30 years. (Looked at another way, it could generate more than 2,000 Cloud Control tours in renewable energy.) That energy is then sold into the energy market, with a target return on investment for artists of 5% a year. The total emissions output of the global music sector is not well studied. A 2010 investigation into the UK industry found it was responsible for more than 540,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas every year, much of it from live music. Most of that was transport, not just of band members and equipment, but fans: audience travel alone accounted for 43% of emissions. A further 26% came from the lifecycle of CDs, which speaks to the age of the study. But, according to researchers from the University of Glasgow, the streaming age hasn\u2019t made for a cleaner product: the energy required to store and process music in the cloud makes for an even worse carbon footprint than manufacturing and distributing CDs and records. For artists, the pitiful royalty rates generated from streaming, and the crash in sales of physical product, means that live music makes up the bulk of revenue. For Lenffer, going on tour meant contributing to the global climate emergency \u2013 but she was willing to gamble that \u201ca progressive community like the music industry would have the guts and imagination to embrace change\u201d. Lenffer says she was inspired by community movements overseas, particularly in Europe, where groups were banding together to buy investments in renewables. \u201cSporting clubhouses would install solar panels on their rooftops purchased by the residents in the area, [who] would then be paid back through the energy generated over a period of time,\u201d she explains. \u201cI found about 70 groups in Australia doing it, as opposed to around 500 in Scotland and 1000 in Germany.\u201d But as well as being the biggest greenhouse gas emitters per capita, Australians also have the highest take-up of rooftop solar. Lenffer says this statistic \u201cshows that people are driving the change where our government is not\u201d. And, compared with Europe, there are far more abundant solar resources available in our sunburnt country. Lenffer sees the potential for her idea to catch on. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why this couldn\u2019t go global,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we can demonstrate it works here \u2013 which I feel like we can, because we\u2019ve already got a number of big-name and emerging artists signed up \u2013 if we can take ownership over building the solar assets that are going to power our future, which we need to do as quickly as possible, there\u2019s no reason why this couldn\u2019t be rolled out for every artist touring the world.\u201d \u2022 Read more about FEAT.",

      "bodyText": "Karen Khachanov speaks: \u201cI would say this is my best result at a slam, the first quarter-final.\u201d \u201cThe atmosphere was really good ... I have good energy in Paris [he won the Masters here last November], the people like me\u201d he adds with a wry smile. The crowd end up chanting his name, which is all that matters at the end of the day. He\u2019ll face Dominic Thiem next, and that could be a cracker. That\u2019s all from us today, thanks for reading along. The crowd sing Del Potro\u2019s name as he makes his way off the court. Khachanov had to deal with a partisan crowd \u2013 and a strange, slightly pantomime performance from Del Potro \u2013 and did so with minimum fuss. Del Potro clips the line with a forehand winner, then outlasts Khachanov in the next rally to go 15-30 up. A mighty first serve gets the Russian level, and when Del Potro fires a cross-court shot wide, it\u2019s a first match point. With the light fading fast, he takes it with an ace down the middle. He\u2019s into his first slam quarter-final, and in some style. There\u2019s something of Novak Djokovic about Khachanov \u2013 the lateral movement, the relentless baseline hitting, pouncing on opportunities and a killer touch when he approaches the net. Del Potro keeps him at bay on serve, but the Russian will now serve for the match... As we pass the three-hour mark, Khachanov lets 30-0 slip away with a wonky smash and missed forehand down the line. Del Potro misses the baseline by a hair, then the Russian does the same as he looks to seal the game. Deuce, and with Del Potro firing the ball back at approx 1000mph, he clips an outstanding short volley away! Delpo\u2019s resistance might finally be broken by that piece of sorcery. Khachanov one game away. Khachanov wants to get this done asap, and works poor Delpo all over the court in an 18-shot rally at deuce \u2013 then finishes with a drop shot, and implores the crowd to make some noise. The jig almost up for Del Potro, but he digs deep to keep the match alive. Khachanov leads 4-2. Khachanov keeps on track with a hold to love, sealed with a ferocious cross-courter that Delpo can only dump into the net. He leads 7-5, 6-3, 3-6, 4-1 and is two games from his first grand slam quarter-final. Woof! Khachanov is like lightning around the court, prevailing in a terrific rally and leaving Del Potro slumped face down in a flower bed like Wile E Coyote. Pure theatre from the big man tonight, but he can\u2019t get into his opponent\u2019s head. After a lengthy, somewhat scrappy tussle, he sees off two break points to keep hope alive. Del Potro confronts the second courtside buffoon to shout out mid-point during the game, giving him a brisk talking-to that ends with a firm handshake. Textbook. It\u2019s absolutely in Khachanov\u2019s best interests to get this one finished tonight. He doesn\u2019t need any more time on court, with Dominic Thiem up next if he can get through. With that in mind, he holds serve with minimum fuss, and is suddenly three games away. Khachanov breaks in the second game! A test for the Russian now \u2013 he\u2019s been motoring along at a decent level, with the match dictated by the fall and rise of Del Potro\u2019s form. Now he needs to be aggressive again, in a stadium packed with Argentinian fans. He digs out a useful hold, then gets 30-0 up on Del Potro\u2019s serve \u2013 and his opponent buckles with a double fault. A return winner seals the break, and he\u2019s back on top, 7-5, 6-3, 3-6, 2-0. Del Potro gets some eye drops from his trainer \u2013 not sure what\u2019s been bothering him, hayfever perhaps. But I\u2019m very much not a doctor. It\u2019s nearly 9pm in Paris, so probably time for one more set. The order of play is out for tomorrow \u2013 three cheers for whoever decided to put the two most eye-catching matches on at the same time. Philippe Chatrier (7) Sloane Stephens v Johanna Konta (26) (7) Kei Nishikori v Rafael Nadal (2) Suzanne Lenglen (24) Stan Wawrinka v Roger Federer (3) Marketa Vondrousova v Petra Martic (31) Khachanov makes his opponent serve it out, then rips a backhand winner down the line to level the game at 30-all. Del Potro serves up an ill-advised drop shot, and the Russian has a break point \u2013 but nets another backhand attempt. Two huge first serves get the job done for Del Potro! He\u2019s pulled a set back, and wallops himself in the end with his racket to celebrate. Can the Russian bounce straight back again? Del Potro looks a different prospect now, lashing the ball to all corners \u2013 and then double faulting to surrender a break point. What a weird performance. Delpo saves two points with ferocious forehands, and closes out with an ace. Could be a big moment \u2013 he\u2019s two sets down, but 5-2 up in the third. Famous last words, as Khachanov\u2019s first serve fails him and he slips 30-0 behind. He aims for Del Potro\u2019s suspect backhand \u2013 and he nails an unstoppable winner! Three break points, the first taken as Khachanov\u2019s shot down the line drifts wide. He\u2019s back ahead in the third set! Del Potro, who would of course be the lovable wingman that stays comfortably single throughout, holds to move 3-2 up. There\u2019s little to show he can really rattle Khachanov, who looks much the stronger from the baseline so far. Khachanov\u2019s get-up has the look of someone sent in to shake up the villa, two weeks into Love Island. He\u2019s grafting here, taken to deuce by Del Potro but dominating the next two rallies to hold. Oh, Juan Mart\u00edn. After an unexpected break that looked to have revived that match, he tumbles to 15-40 straight away. Khachanov dominates the rally, keeping the ball well away from Del Potro\u2019s forehand to break straight back! Here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell on Johanna Konta\u2019s preparations for the quarter-finals. The British No 1 takes on Sloane Stephens early doors tomorrow. Frustration boils over for Del Potro as Khachanov wins the match\u2019s longest rally with a ferocious forehand winner. Muttering away to himself, he swiftly falls 40-15 down \u2013 but rallies to deuce as his opponent takes his eye off the ball. Khachanov then overcooks a groundstroke, and it\u2019s break point! The Russian stays in the rally, and Delpo thinks he\u2019s missed a smash \u2013 but it catches the line. He\u2019s back in this, 2-0 up in the third! After a routine hold each, Khachanov serves for the second set. He hasn\u2019t given Del Potro a look in on first serve in this set. The No 10 seed quickly brings up three set points, and takes the first as his opponent goes long. It\u2019s a long way back for Del Potro now. Khachanov has never reached a grand slam quarter-final before, but he\u2019s on his way here. He\u2019s lost in the fourth round on his last two visits to Roland Garros, against Sascha Zverev and ... Andy Murray. Speaking of which: Khachanov offers up a short ball that Del Potro can\u2019t put away. Something not quite right with Delpo \u2013 he\u2019s missing chances and has seemed irritable throughout. 40-0 down here, he scraps a couple of points back but the Russian holds with a big serve out wide to lead 7-5, 4-1. Del Potro looks to get into this set but Khachanov isn\u2019t having a bar of it, powering a winner into the corner at deuce. Del Potro\u2019s big serve rescues him, and keeps the second set alive as a contest. An email! \u201cIs there a name for that crowd call and response thing that only seems to happen at Roland Garros?\u201d asks Chris Collinson. \u201cIt starts with a soloist belting out a few notes then the whole crowd shouts the French equivalent of \u201c\u00a1Ol\u00e9!\u201d in response.\u201d Je ne sais pas, Chris. But I\u2019m sure someone out there can enlighten both of us. Two stats that tell a story: Khachanov is 2/2 on break points, Del Potro 0/5. And after three games in the second set, Khachanov leads 14-2 on points, and 3-0. Del Potro was on top in that first set without making it count, and all of a sudden, the match could be slipping away. Khachanov has three break points in the second game of this second set \u2013 and takes the first! The Russian leads 7-5, 2-0. Here\u2019s the full quarter-final line-up in the women\u2019s draw. Form and seedings point to a Halep v Stephens final, but recent women\u2019s slams have been about as predictable as the Pakistan cricket team. Madison Keys (14) v Ashleigh Barty (8) (3) Simona Halep v Amanda Anisimova (7) Sloane Stephens v Johanna Konta (26) Marketa Vondrousova v Petra Martic (31) After absorbing plenty of heat on his own serve, Khachanov makes a dent on his opponent\u2019s, carving out a break and set point. He digs in to stay in the rally, and takes the set when Del Potro nets a backhand! All too easy for the up-and-coming American, who will face Simona Halep in the quarter-finals. Delpo now putting the pressure on Khachanov, some hefty winners earning him a sniff at a break. The Russian hammers down aces to deny him twice, and gets the hold. Five break points passed up by Del Potro in this set. England v Pakistan is going down to the wire at the Cricket World Cup. Sport \u2013 it just keeps giving. You can drop in on that with Rob Smyth: Del Potro seems to have regained his rhythm, firing down big first serves and coming into the net to try and keep the rallies short. He holds for five all. Incidentally, whoever wins this game, the quarter-finals look absolutely stacked. Seven of the top 10 seeds, and a previous winner in Stan Wawrinka. Del Potro\u2019s gears appear to have been ground by a mobile phone going off in the crowd, and then being censured by the umpire for swearing in Spanish. Khachanov is focusing on the job in hand, holding to go 5-4 up. On Simonne-Mathieu, the last women\u2019s quarter-final place is up for grabs. 17-year-old Amanda Anisimova is on course to take it, leading Aliona Bolsova 6-3, 2-0. Thanks Jacob, evening all. It\u2019s been a predictably gritty affair between Khachanov and Del Potro early on. Three games all, and the Argentinian is currently mithering at the umpire. My work is done. Luckily Niall McVeigh has arrived to take you through to the end of the day\u2019s play. Bye! On Suzanne-Lenglen some tennis balls could be in for some punishment until the end of play. Juan Martin del Potro, the eighth seed, is in action against the powerful young Russian Karen Khachanov. On Simonne-Mathieu, meanwhile, the USA\u2019s Amanda Anisimova is in action against Spain\u2019s Aliona Bolsova. Anisimova is one to watch. It\u2019s all over in 45 minutes. Whoosh. Halep was way too accomplished for her young Polish opponent, who will do well to learn from this free lesson from the defending champion. A zany, slightly madcap match ends with Zverev taking his third match point when Fognini batters a forehand long. It\u2019s Zverev\u2019s first win over a top-20 player this year and his first ever win over a top-20 player at a grand slam. The fifth seed will play Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals after fighting back to deal with the erratic Fognini. Fabio Fognini has just saved two match points in the tie-break against Alexander Zverev. Zverev can serve for it now. Simona Halep really isn\u2019t hanging about. She leads 6-1, 5-0 and is mercilessly crushing Iga Swiatek\u2019s hopes and dreams. Fabio Fognini holds to love with a contemptuous drop shot. He\u2019s got himself a fourth-set tie-break. Pah. I could do that. Halep only needed 26 minutes to win the first set against Swiatek and she only made three unforced errors. That\u2019s tough to break down, especially when you\u2019re an inexperienced and slightly starstruck youngster. Zverev saves a break point, roars and holds to lead 3-6, 6-2, 6-2, 5-4. Fognini will serve to stay in the match. No. Simona Halep breaks again to take the first set 6-1. Iga Swiatek, who only turned 18 on Friday, breaks back when Simona Halep was serving for the set at 5-0! The youngster has some heart. Now, can she impose her game on Halep? No hint of a smile on Suzanne-Lenglen, where Zverev and Fognini continue to fight it out in angry, tetchy, irritable fashion. Neither of them look like they\u2019re having much fun, but it is an entertaining watch, especially as Fognini has mustered some resistance in this fourth set. It\u2019s 3-3 with Zverev, who leads by two sets to one, serving. Iga Swiatek is wearing a rueful smile on her face. She\u2019s sent another forehand wide and faces the prospect of being bageled by a rampant Simona Halep, who leads 5-0 in no time at all. Swiatek looks overwhelmed by the occasion. Still, at least she can smile. Make that two breaks: Halep leads 3-0 already. It could be a blowout. Simona Halep has broken Swiatek already. What an opportunity this is for Halep to defend her title successfully. Naomi Osaka, the world No1, is out. Karolina Pliskova, the No2 seed, is out. Garbine Muguraza, the 2016 champion, is out. Serena Williams is out. The final match on Philippe-Chatrier sees the defending champion Simona Halep face the Polish teenager Iga Swiatek. It could be fascinating. Or it could be a blowout. Oh Fabio. This has been a complete capitulation from the Italian, who serves up a double-fault on set point to let Zverev cruise into a 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 lead. Zverev is a set away from a quarter-final with Novak Djokovic. A calm, composed and professional win for the 2018 finalist. That\u2019s an excellent win for Thiem after a slightly unconvincing opening week. He\u2019s through to the quarters and awaits the winner of Juan Martin del Potro and Karen Khachanov. Zverev saves a break point and holds to lead 3-6, 6-2, 5-2. Fognini is getting rather tetchy. Gael Monfils nets a limp backhand to drop his serve again. Dominic Thiem will serve for the match at 6-4, 6-4, 5-2. For all his eye-catching shotmaking Monfils is actually a pretty underwhelming player. Fognini is having some tape applied to his right leg. The word is a calf problem. Fabio Fognini has been given a warning for unsporstmanlike conduct after bashing his racquet on the clay. Now he\u2019s called for the trainer. It\u2019s all happening. Zverev looks perplexed. Over on Suzanne-Lenglen, Zverev lands the first blow in the third set. He leads 3-6, 6-2, 4-1. Dominic Thiem leaves everyone on Philippe-Chatrier with their jaws cemented to the floor with an astonishing tweener. What a shot that was. Even Monfils is chuckling and applauding. Moments later he earns a break point with a lovely chopped backhand slice down the line. Monfils saves it with a drop shot. But Thiem gets another chance and Monfils pulls a forehand wide. Thiem breaks to lead 6-4, 6-4, 2-1. An interesting tidbit. I\u2019m sure Judy is pleased... Suddenly it\u2019s Alexander Zverev dominating on Suzanne-Lenglen. He has two set points on Fognini\u2019s serve. Fognini saves the first but Zverev grabs the second with a huge forehand down the line. He levels the match after taking the second set 6-2. To think that Fognini had four break points in the fifth game of the set. Gael Monfils sends a forehand long and Dominic Thiem leads 6-4, 6-4. The Austrian shouldn\u2019t have too many problems from here, he says while completing forgetting that Thiem adores making life difficult for himself just for the fun of it. Gael Monfils knocks a backhand long to drop his serve. Thiem breaks to lead 6-4, 5-4. He\u2019ll serve for a two-set lead. After dealing with all that pressure, now it\u2019s Zverev\u2019s turn to press at Fognini\u2019s eccentricities. He earns two break break points. Fognini saves the first with a smash, but Zverev converts the second to lead 4-2 in the second set. Fognini lets Zverev of the hook on break point, spanking a forehand long. Bad miss. Not much is working for Zverev, though, and he gives the Italian another chance after netting a backhand. Zverev saves it with an ace. Then he double-faults. Then he forces deuce with a stunning forehand down the line. It\u2019s deuce for a while. Zverev sums up where he is by following a double-fault with an ace to save another break point. Somehow he holds to lead 3-2 in the second set. Thiem sprays a lovely backhand down the line to hold for 3-3 in the second set. This is much more even now, though. Monfils is playing some sprightly tennis. Dominic Thiem hasn\u2019t been on the end of any gifts from Gael Monfils in the second set on Philippe-Chatrier. Monfils is more dialled in now. He\u2019s serving well and finding the mark with some skidding groundstrokes. Thiem leads 6-4, 1-2 and is about to serve. Alexander Zverev is not in a good place mentally at the moment. He\u2019s bellowing in Russian after more errors at the start of the second set. He really needs to get his act together. He\u2019s in danger of handing the match to Fognini. Alexander Zverev batters another forehand long and bellows at his box. He\u2019s livid. But Fabio Fognini\u2019s delighted. The 9th seed is a set to the good against the young German on Suzanne-Lenglen. That was a very impressive set from Fogini, who took it 6-3. As for events on Philippe-Chatrier, Dominic Thiem has quelled the late fightback from Gael Monfils and taken the first set 6-4. The lesson there is not to waste the first 10 minutes of a match. Start as you mean to go on. Under pressure, Zverev goes for way too much on a second serve and hands Fognini a break point at 3-4 in the first set. Then he balloons a forehand to give the Italian a break. The young German\u2019s so furious he decides to punish himself by stuffing his gold necklace in his mouth and having a good old chew on the metal. Yum! Having held to lead 4-3 on Suzanne-Lenglen, Fabio Fognini can be seen glaring at the umpire as he walks back to his chair. He\u2019s a fiery character. It\u2019s not clear why he\u2019s annoyed. Monfils has woken up! Serving for the set, Thiem finds himself down 0-30. He finds the line with a few backhands, but it\u2019s Monfils who comes up with the decisive shot, a brilliant low backhand for three break points. He\u2019s in this now, the Frenchman, and he quickly breaks to love to trail 3-5 on Chatrier. Gael Monfils is having a shocker. Serving to stay in the opening set, one of his forehands goes a good 10 yards past the baseline. He\u2019s making so many errors. Dominic Thiem is barely having to do anything. But Monfils does manage to hold. Thiem will serve for the set at 5-2. Alexander Zverev waits for Fabio Fognini\u2019s level to dip, which always seemed a likely development, and breaks to love. Zverev is back in the first set and will serve at 2-3. Alexander Zverev is on the board against Fabio Fognini. Gael Monfils is on the board against Dominic Thiem. Monfils loses his serve again. He\u2019s 3-0 down to Thiem and playing atrociously. If only he could rewind the last 10 minutes and start again. Ah, and here\u2019s Jacob. I\u2019ll hand back over to him. Bye. Fognini held his serve after a testing first game against Zverev. I was warned by Jacob that this match may go five sets. The closeness of that first game suggests he may be right. One man who exuded calm earlier was Novak Djokovic. Here\u2019s the report of his straight-sets win over Jan-Lennard Struff. Ga\u00ebl Monfils gets off to a shocker, losing his serve to love immediately, with two double faults thrown in for good measure. He needs to calm down a little, he looks incredibly jumpy. Tok! Tok! Tok! The Parisian skies have brightened up considerably and the players are out on court warming up. Just a reminder, we have Thiem v Monfils on Philippe-Chatrier and Fognini v Zverev on Suzanne-Lenglen in the men\u2019s last 16. It looks like the rain is petering out at Roland Garros and the forecast for the afternoon is good so when play does get under way it shouldn\u2019t be interrupted. Another headline match this afternoon that has been delayed by the Parisian drizzle is fourth seed Dominic Thiem v Ga\u00ebl Monfils, the 16th seed and French fans\u2019 favourite. Should be fun on Philippe-Chatrier once the clouds clear. Hello, it\u2019s Gregg here. I\u2019ll be keeping you updated while Jacob is fuelling up for the potential five-setters this afternoon. One of those matches is ninth seed Fabio Fognini v fifth seed Alexander Zverev on Court Suzanne-Lenglen. There\u2019s no sign of the players on court yet, though, because \u2026 it\u2019s raining. Might not be much to update you on then. Hmmm. I\u2019ll keep you posted. I\u2019m heading for lunch. Gregg Bakowski will step in. Move along, nothing to see here. The world No1 was in exceptional form. Can anyone stop him reaching the final? Serving for the match, Nishikori begins by knocking a forehand wide for 0-15. He wins the next two points, though, a backhand lob taking him to 30-15. Soon he has his third match point. He misses a first serve. But Paire nets a forehand off a second serve and Nishikori, who must be exhausted, is through to face Rafael Nadal! Who\u2019s just who you\u2019d want to play after a long, gruelling five-setter. Benoit Paire saves a break point magnificently. He has a point to kill the game. Then he double-faults. So many self-inflicted blows. Then comes a dismal forehand slice that drifts past the baseline, giving Nishikori a break point. Nishikori goes on the attack and he makes life awkward for Paire with a few looping shots. Off balance, the Frenchman nets a backhand. Nishikori will serve for the match at 6-5! Benoit Paire is down in the dumps after that game. Kei Nishikori, hitting his spots now, holds to 30 for 5-5. \u201cRafa Nadal couldn\u2019t have asked for a better birthday gift than this Nishikori - Paire match,\u201d Aditi Modi says. \u201cRegardless of the outcome of this match, its length, and the fact that it\u2019ll get over today, can only bode well for the defending champion.\u201d Defiant to the last, Kei Nishikori makes it 0-15 with a glorious passing shot. At 15-all Benoit Paire double-faults. Uh oh. Oh dear. Then he nets a backhand volley to give Nishikori two break points. To be fair there wasn\u2019t much he could do with an excellent backhand from Nishikori. He saves the first with a big serve for 30-40 - but Nishikori takes the second with a stonking forehand return to break back! Paire served for the match and didn\u2019t come close to getting over the line. What a match this is turning out to be. Serving at 3-4, Kei Nishikori finds himself down a break point. He comes up with a huge, deep, brave forehand to save it. Benoit Paire is making chances. Soon he has another - and this time he belts a backhand return down the line! He\u2019ll serve for the match at 5-3. The French crowd love it. \u201cAllez Benoit!\u201d they cry. In less dramatic news, Novak Djokovic has broken already in the third set on Philippe-Chatrier. He leads 6-3, 6-2, 2-0. But Benoit Paire is so inconsistent. He\u2019s up 40-15 on his own serve. Before long he\u2019s looking to the heavens after being broken. Nishikori, who has plenty of weapons of his own, is back in this increasingly dramatic fifth set! Kei Nishikori comes through a tough deuce game to hold. But Benoit Paire, who\u2019s hitting his groundstrokes so beautifully, leads 4-2. Novak Djokovic has raced into a two-set lead. It\u2019s only taken an hour. He leads Jan-Lennard Struff 6-3, 6-2. Benoit Paire is on his way to beating Kei Nishikori. He\u2019s a break up in the fifth set. Novak Djokovic is a set and a break to the good against Jan-Lennard Struff, who has a sort of faraway look on his face at the moment. The German\u2019s wondering what on earth he can do to break down the Djokovic wall. Indeed he\u2019s soon in danger of going down two breaks, at which point he nets a forehand. Djokovic leads 6-3, 3-0. Kei Nishikori only does five-setters. Benoit Paire nails a backhand down the line on set point and despite holding two match points in the tie-break - both on his own serve, for crying out loud - Nishikori is going the distance again. Clearly he doesn\u2019t like rest. Paire, having won the tie-break 10-8, will fancy himself now. Benoit Paire wastes a set point. Kei Nishikori wastes a second match point, a backhand flashing wide. On they go. 8-8. Here\u2019s a report on Ashleigh Barty\u2019s win over Sofia Kenin. Benoit Paire saves a match point in magnificent style, giving a lame second serve from Kei Nishikori the treatment. It\u2019s 6-6 in the tie-break. Elsewhere Novak Djokovic has the first set in the bag against Struff. All of a sudden Novak Djokovic starts to get the missiles from Jan-Lennard Struff back with interest. You know what that means. Djokovic earns two break points and the punishing relentlessness of his accurate, piercing groundstrokes is too much for Struff to handle. The German is powerless when he lifts the ball into the air for Djokovic to smash and break for 5-3. Kei Nishikori gobbles up a poor drop shot from Benoit Paire to grab an early advantage in the tie-break. He leads 4-2. Three points from victory. If a quarter-final against Rafa Nadal counts as a victory. Benoit Paire holds. Tie-break. It\u2019s been a good start on Philippe-Chatrier. Jan-Lennard Struff is really hitting through the ball at the moment, which is allowing him to stay with Novak Djokovic. They\u2019re still on serve. Back on Suzanne-Lenglen, Kei Nishikori has held to lead 6-2, 6-7, 6-2, 6-5, meaning Benoit Paire needs to hold to stay in the match. Kei Nishikori is heeding my advice. He\u2019s broken back against the always unpredictable Benoit Paire in the fourth set. Over on Suzanne-Lenglen, Kei Nishikori is already a break down in the fourth set against Benoit Paire. He just loves five-setters. But it\u2019s letting this one go the distance probably isn\u2019t the best approach given the winner plays Rafa Nadal. The next match on Philippe-Chatrier: Novak Djokovic and Jan-Lennard Struff, a big-hitting German who had to dig deep to beat Borna Coric in the third round. Struff had to go to 11-9 in the fifth set to beat Coric. Perfect preparation for taking on the world No1. That\u2019s some way to handle a deciding set. Barty wobbled midway through this speedy match, but she is deservedly through to the last eight for the first time. She\u2019ll play Madison Keys next. Sofia Kenin didn\u2019t quite have the consistency or energy to follow up her win over Serena Williams, but she can be proud of her efforts over the past week. Next on Suzanne-Lenglen, a match held over from last night is about to resume. Kei Nishikori, seeded seventh, was leading by two sets to one against Benoit Paire when bad light stopped play. It would be very Nishikori to let this trundle into a third set. Ashleigh Barty is in complete control on Philippe-Chatrier now. Her serve has clicked and she bangs down an ace to lead 6-3, 3-6, 5-0. Poor Sofia Kenin was so full of hope at the start of the final set, but she has been blown away here. The American has a big grin on her face. She\u2019s dealt with the heavy conditions on Suzanne-Lenglen, reaching the quarter-finals again after Siniakova fires a forehand wide on match point. A good win for Keys against a difficult opponent. Remember, Siniakova knocked out Naomi Osaka in the previous round. Madison Keys is a game away from victory after holding to lead 6-2, 5-4. Katerina Siniakova will serve to stay in the match. Over on Chatrier, Ashleigh Barty has broken to lead 6-3, 3-6, 2-0. Serving for the second set at 5-3, a wonderful backhand winner from Sofia Kennin makes it 30-all. Then she smashes accurately to earn a set point. Ashleigh Barty saves it with a clever drop shot for deuce. Kenin follows it with an untimely double-fault, but Barty lets her off the hook on break point, netting a forehand return off a second serve. She went for too much. Kenin earns a second chance. Barty wipes it out again. Then she earns a break point with some outrageous tennis, a drop shot setting her up for a gorgeous forehand lob. Kenin saves it with a crisp forehand. Soon she has a third chance and she takes this one when she forces Barty to hook a forehand long. Into a third set they go on Philippe-Chatrier. Ashleigh Barty slams down an ace to hold easily. Sofia Kenin will serve for the second set at 5-3. Madison Keys has done well to get back on serve in the second set on Suzanne-Lenglen. The American would love to get this done in two sets. Conserve energy. Keep the old powder dry. Sofia Kenin is a punchy competitor on court, you know. She doesn\u2019t mind who she upsets. Born in Moscow and raised in Florida, the 20-year-old is a fan of both Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova. Maybe she could have the pair of them round for dinner one day. Lots to discuss, I\u2019m sure. For now, however, she\u2019s concerning herself with derailing Ashleigh Barty, who looks like she might get dragged into a third set at the moment. A momentum shift on Suzanne-Lenglen as well. Outplayed in the first set, Katerina Siniakova comes out fighting at the start of the second, touch and variation helping her to break through Madison Keys\u2019s thumping groundstrokes. Keys is broken in the first game of the second set. Meanwhile Ash Barty is on the board in the second set on Chatrier. She leads 6-3, 1-3. Sofia Kenin takes advantage of some poor serving from Ashleigh Barty to break at the start of the second set on Philippe-Chatrier. Barty sends a desperate backhand lob long and Kenin leads 2-0 in the second set. Another thumping drive from Madison Keys is enough for her to break for a third time in the opening set - and with that she takes it 6-2. The American looks to have too many weapons for Katerina Siniakova at the moment. Ashleigh Barty has no problems when she serves for the opening set a second time. A few big shots do the trick, allowing the powerful Australian to take it 6-3 in 26 minutes. Errors from Katerina Siniakova prove fatal in the sixth game of the first set. Madison Keys breaks again to lead 4-2. Not so fast. Sofia Kenin cancels out one of those Barty breaks. The American will serve to stay in the set at 2-5, having finally introduced a semblance of competitiveness on Philippe-Chatrier. They might be in for a longer contest on Suzanne-Lenglen. Katerina Siniakova is warming to her task and has started to cause Madison Keys a few problems. The Czech has wiped out the American\u2019s early break and will serve at 2-3. Ashleigh Barty is utterly rampant on Philippe-Chatrier. She\u2019s broken Sofia Kenin again and leads 5-1. She\u2019ll serve for a set which has whizzed by. Madison Keys is already bashing the ball about. She leads 3-1 against Katerina Siniakova. A fast start from Ashleigh Barty, who breaks immediately for a 2-0 lead on Philippe-Chatrier. The Australian is booming those serves as well. As for events on Suzanne-Lenglen, it begins with the USA\u2019s Madison Keys taking on the Czech Republic\u2019s Katerina Siniakova. Keys is seeded 14th and has long threatened to do something special at a slam. But she\u2019ll need to be careful against the world No42. Siniakova will be full of confidence after taking out Naomi Osaka, the world No1, on Saturday. The players are out on court. The first match on Philippe-Chatrier sees Australia\u2019s Ashleigh Barty, the eighth seed, face the USA\u2019s Sofia Kenin, slayer of Serena Williams. Barty is widely fancied to go far here, especially with so many of the top seeds making early exits, but she\u2019ll need to be careful against the unpredictability Kenin. Hello and welcome to live coverage of the French Open. We\u2019ve got Novak Djokovic, Juan Martin del Potro, Simona Halep, Ashleigh Barty and many more in action as the remaining fourth round matches get sorted out. It\u2019s going to be another busy day at Roland Garros. Play begins at: 10am BST, 11am in Paris.",

And the TV app looks basically the same as the TV app on Apple TVs and iPads. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-03T19:25:26.458Z\">at 8.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cf56a158f087dd73466d454\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-03T18:43:53.921Z\">7.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We get a price and release date!

Well, maybe real app windows (that\u2019s a lower-case W) for iPad users who want to get real work done.</li> <li>Mac Pros: Don\u2019t expect a release, or even a release date, but if Apple doesn\u2019t at least give a glimpse of the long-awaited upgrade to its most powerful computer, then something\u2019s gone wrong.</li> <li>MacOS 10.15: Marzipan, marzipan, marzipan. That\u2019s the codename for the project to port iOS apps to the Mac, and expect that to be front and centre of the conference. The most obvious outcome? The (overhyped) death of iTunes. It\u2019s not really going anywhere (the core app is probably just being renamed Music), but features including Podcasts, TV and the App Store are all likely to be spun-off into their own apps.</li> <li>WatchOS 6: Period tracking could go prime-time, as Apple finally graduates reproductive health from an embarrassed sub-menu in its Health app to a full-blown feature in its own right.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us here; if you want this liveblog in a more easily digestible format, my colleague Samuel Gibbs has wrapped the morning\u2019s event up in one lovely piece. Apple may have had a good morning inside its conference centre, but outside the room, things went less well: the company\u2019s stock is sliding on reports that the US department of justice is considering an investigation into alleged anticompetitive practices. Before we close the liveblog, one last piece of late-breaking news from the iOS 13 website, of great import: the volume indicator is now being moved to the corner of the screen so that it doesn\u2019t pop-over the video you\u2019re watching and spoil everything. Tim\u2019s back on stage, thanking everyone, and giving (vague) release dates: A developer beta for the new OSs today, a public beta in July, and the final release in \u201cfall\u201d. And that\u2019s that! More of the developer-focused launches: Swift is getting UI scripting support, with SwiftUI. The developers in the audience are VERY EXCITED about how much less code you need to write a UI compared to before. You can also see the preview update live when you edit the code, which is again VERY EXCITING to the audience. We move into the really nerdy bit: new APIs for developers who work with AR or Apple\u2019s programming language Swift. Skip this if that makes no sense to you. If it does: RealityKit and RealityComposer let developers work with AR experiences even if they can\u2019t handle graphics engines or low-level code. ARKit 3 now has automatic \u201cpeople occlusion\u201d, letting the developer know exactly where a person is and put things in front of or behind them. It also has built-in motion capture. ARKit 3 gets demo\u2019d onstage by (the Microsoft-owned) Mojang, creators of Minecraft, who show off the new Minecraft Earth. You can build a world, walk around inside it, and play with friends. It looks fun, though \u201cit\u2019s hard to believe that there\u2019s nothing on the ground or around us on the stage\u201d has to win the prize for least convincing line delivery of the event. A big launch for developers: \u201cProject Catalyst\u201d lets developers \u201cquickly and easily develop Mac apps from their iPad apps\u201d. \u201cThis means one development team for the first time can build a single app that can span all the way from iPhone to iPad to Mac.\u201d Mac apps that are coming at launch: the game Asphalt 9: Legends, Twitter and Atlassian\u2019s Jira. Federighi continues with the new features: Sidecar lets users use their iPads as a second screen for their Mac, or even as a graphics tablet, wired or wirelessly. Voice control lets users with motor impairments control their Mac and iOS devices entirely with their voice. \u201cFind My\u201d combines Find My iPhone with Find My Friends, and even works if the device is offline. How? Your sleeping macbook continues to send out a secure bluetooth beacon, that nearby iPhones \u2013 anyone\u2019s nearby iPhone \u2013 can pick up, and report to Apple. It\u2019s basically how hardware trackers like Tile works. Activation lock: just like on iPhones, you can set your Mac up so that it cannot be even wiped and reused without your password. Screen Time is coming to Mac from iOS, so that you can block Twitter from Safari on the desktop as well as on the go. And finally, macOS! Craig Federighi returns to reveal that the new release is called Catalina, after Santa Catalina Island in California. And then we jump straight in to an obituary for iTunes. Federighi gently mocks the app\u2019s history, uttering the definitely-not-true line that \u201cCustomers Love iTunes\u201d, and that they\u2019ve been asking whether it can do \u201ceven more\u201d, joking that the next version will have a calendar and web browser as well. In fact, it\u2019s being split: Music, Podcasts and TV will replace the single iTunes app. Phone management, meanwhile, will occur in the Finder for the first time. Music and Podcasts look very similar to the old iTunes, although Podcasts gains a new auto-transcription feature letting you search the contents of podcasts. And the TV app looks basically the same as the TV app on Apple TVs and iPads. We get a price and release date! The Mac Pro will start at $5999, this autumn. (Expect that to be \u00a35999). And the pro display will start at $4999, with an anti-glare version for $5999, and will also be available this autumn. There\u2019s also a new Apple Pro display. It\u2019s HDR enabled. It has a cheesegrater back, just like the new Mac Pro. It has a 6K resolution and a 32\u201d panel. It looks a bit like an iMac. Apple is launching it by comparing it to a $43,000 reference monitor, which is some interesting anchoring. Anything will look like good value when it\u2019s compared to the price of a mid-sized car. There\u2019s a lot of specs coming for the Mac Pro: it has a 28 core Intel Xeon, with 300 watts of power, supporting 1.5TB of Ram, and 8 internal PCIe slots. It has built in ethernet, four Thunderbolt 3 slots, two USB-A slots and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It also has a new built-in graphics module, the MPX, that lets users dock powerful AMD graphics cards in a\u2026 new fancy way. But they can also dock normal graphics cards in a normal way. There\u2019s also another card called Afterburner, which users can buy purely to speed up their video rendering and playback. And it has wheels. Back to Tim, who turns us towards the Mac \u2013 and the first new hardware of the day: the Mac Pro. It no longer looks like a small wastepaper bin. In fact, it looks like\u2026 the old Power Mac: Moving on to the newest OS in Apple\u2019s line-up: today is the 0th birthday of iPadOS! Happy Birthday iPadOS! Why the spin-off? Because as the iPad has become more and more of a computer, it\u2019s got more and more features to itself. Features like: You can pin widgets to your homescreen. Slide-overs get their own multi-tasking. Think of it as a mini iPhone on your iPad. Multi-window capability comes to iPad apps. You can run two copies of the same app side-by-side, or run a third copy (or a fourth, or a fifth) alongside other apps at the same time. The Files app has a Column view! Someone in the audience cheered for this! Files also gets file sharing through iCloud Drive \u2013 and access to thumbdrives for the first time. Safari gets an update to force websites to serve the desktop version to iPads. That includes web-apps like Google Docs. Safari also gets a download manager, keyboard shortcuts \u201cand more\u201d. Designers will be happy: you can now download custom fonts from the app store. Try remembering this one: a three-finger pinch is a new gesture for copying text, and a three-finger spread for pasting \u2013 with a three-finger swipe for undoing. Apple Pencil latency will drop from 20ms to 9ms. And 3rd party apps will now get to develop directly for the pencil. And again, we get the round-up of things that just missed the keynote: Now for the accessory roundup! Airpods: Siri can read messages as soon as they arrive and you can instantly respond. And if two people have airpods and iPhones, they can now share audio just by tapping phones together, and listen at the same time. Homepod: Get home and put your phone near the homepod to hand off music or a phone call to the smart speaker. It\u2019s also getting live radio for the first time via Tune-In. And the speaker can personalise responses based on who is speaking for messages, reminders, notes, music and more. Carplay: You can now have music and maps visible at the same time. Siri is now a popover, with the screen remaining visible when the voice assistant is active. Siri: Last year\u2019s Shortcuts feature will get an upgrade, giving you suggested Siri shortcuts automatically. And Siri is getting an AI voice for the first time, ditching the old human recordings for good. It sounds better! Camera and Photos are also getting some new features \u2013 simple video editing in Photos, a new depth-sensitive filter in the Camera, and a whole new way of browsing photos in the main app: Apple\u2019s going to use machine learning to intelligently hide duplicates, and to select new thumbnails that reflect a given day, month or year. (It will be interesting to see how good Apple is at selecting these photos without access to the huge personal data stores of Facebook or Google. You may just have told your phone your loved-ones\u2019 birthdays, but can it easily tell a meaningful shot from a half-arsed selfie?) iMessage users can now choose to share their name and memoji (the dead-eyed avatars that Apple introduced two years ago) with people when they text them for the first time. And memoji get yet more variations: make-up, accessories and a variety of haircuts and colours are added to the options. If you don\u2019t want to film yourself making odd faces, Apple\u2019s now adding a sticker pack of your own personal memoji letting you send yourself in pre-made poses. (Like Bitmoji, if you\u2019ve ever used that Snapchat feature before.) And those features are coming to any Apple device with an A9 chip or newer \u2013 iPhone 6 or later. And Apple now takes the fight to Amazon and its Ring subsidiary, offering a new API for smart home security cameras. HomeKit Security Cameras will share footage with your Apple devices, in a way that means the manufacturer can\u2019t watch the footage, even if they wanted to. But not everything is about competition: a new feature for secure routers is being built with another Amazon subsidiary, Eero. Craig Federighi returns, to hit Google and Facebook with a big stick labelled Privacy. Users will be able to select a new \u201cjust once\u201d option for requests like location tracking. Apps which try to sneakily find out where you are using Bluetooth or Wifi now won\u2019t be able to get that data. And Apple introduces a new federated login service, competing with \u201csign in with Google\u201d and \u201csign in with Facebook\u201d: \u201cSign in with Apple\u201d. \u201cJust tap it and you\u2019re authenticated with FaceID, logged in with a new account without revealing any personal information\u2026 Some apps may want your name or even your email \u2013 you can choose to share your real email address, or you can choose to hide it, and we\u2019ll create a unique random email address that forwards to your real address. And we give each app a new unique random address\u201d That last one is a big, big threat to the business model of not just Google and Facebook, but a whole host of companies that require all the personal information of their users to monetise their services. So what does \u201cDark Mode\u201d mean for iOS? A new wallpaper for the background and slightly darker see-through widgets leaves the lock screen looking barely different, but open an app and the change is more obvious: apps are black, not white. It\u2019s pretty, but fairly obvious, so it\u2019s no surprising that Craig Fed drops other reveals in the dark mode walkthrough as well: Swipe-to-type is coming to the iOS keyboard. Photos will now automatically suggest people to share pictures with, based on who\u2019s in the image. Music automatically syncs lyrics as you listen. And then on to the other apps. Mail gets \u2018desktop-class formatting\u2019, Notes gets a new filing system, and Reminders gets an almost total rewrite: quick entry, links to people, and an advanced tracking system. Maps has been rebuilt \u201cfrom the ground up\u201d (in California), and will be across the US by the end of 2019, and \u201cselect other countries\u201d in 2020. Meg Frost, a director of product research at Apple, works through more changes to Maps. Users can make add favourites to their app, or put locations in \u201ccollections\u201d, letting them collect groups of places when, for instance, planning a trip. They can then take a closer look using Street View \u2013 sorry, \u201cLook Around\u201d, Apple\u2019s own version of the venerable Google feature. Tim Cook turns to iOS, with a direct swipe at Google: 85% of iPhone users are using iOS 12, while just 10% of Android users are on Android 9. Ouch. And introuduces Craig Federighi to introduce iOS 13. Fed says the new iOS is faster. How much faster? 30% faster to unlock with FaceID; 50% smaller app downloads; 60% smaller app updates; 2x faster at launching apps. But the first big new feature gets introduced with a video of some jellyfish: it\u2019s dark mode. And there\u2019s more \u2013 too much more for Apple to read out, or me to transcribe. Take a look at the feature wall: Health and fitness on the Apple Watch gets a whole sub-keynote: Activity Trends is coming to the Activity app on the iPhone, showing Watch users how their recent activity habits compares with the past year. A new Noise app will use the watch\u2019s microphone to warn you if you\u2019re in a loud environment where your hearing health is under threat. And cycle tracking comes to the Apple Watch. \u201cA simple, discreet way to visualise your menstrual cycle right on your wrist\u201d. The feature is also being (re)launched in the Health app on iOS. Moving quickly on to the Apple Watch, then. Cook introduces Kevin Lynch to run through the new features of watchOS 6: New watch faces! Some purely visual updates, others with a few more smarts, including a solar clock \u201cTaptic chimes\u201d: the watch will buzz your wrist on the hour. It will also, if you want to be hated, play audible birdsong on the hour. New apps: a calculator, voice memo, and audiobook apps. The calculator can automatically add a tip and split the bill. And a new App Store, just for the Apple Watch, letting you install Apps directly on your watch. The nerdy bit: The app store is necessary because app developers can now make apps that run fully on the watch for the first time. They\u2019re also now allowed to stream audio directly from the internet, as well as access have longer access to sensors than previously. Cook runs through the tvOS features himself: Multi-user support for tvOS, letting the company personalise recommendations to each member of the household. Support for the XBox One and PlayStation 4 controllers on Apple TV, letting users who already have game consoles in the house use their own controllers on the box. And\u2026 new screensavers filmed underwater. Cook opens by running through the services that Apple already announced earlier this year: Apple News+, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and so on. Some of these won\u2019t be arriving until \u201cfall\u201d, likely alongside iOS 13, so don\u2019t expect much more on them today. Other, that is, than a new trailer for a fun-looking alt-history series, For All Mankind, coming exclusively to Apple TV+. The show imagines a world where the space race never ended after a Soviet cosmonaut became the first man on the moon. But really, that\u2019s just a segue into the first item on the agenda: tvOS. As ever, we open with some natty promos: first, a cute animation featuring a load of emojis scrolling across the screen (a reminder, perhaps, that the small icons are the single best thing Apple has to get people to update their iOS), and then a classy black-and-white video showing developers working on their apps deep into the night (a reminder that this is, after all, the worldwide developers\u2019 conference). And then Tim Cook takes the stage, thanking \u201cthe millions of incredible Apple developers across the world\u201d. iOS 13: the headline will be a new dark mode for iPad and iPhone, letting users turn everything shady with one click. Elsewhere, look for new Siri integrations, an upgrade to Find My iPhone, and maybe the death of 3D Touch. iPadOS: a last-minute leak suggests the iPad version of iOS is being spun off into a whole new line, letting Apple more easily launch features that only affect iPads or iPhones, rather than lumping everything together. What sort of features? Well, maybe real app windows (that\u2019s a lower-case W) for iPad users who want to get real work done. Mac Pros: Don\u2019t expect a release, or even a release date, but if Apple doesn\u2019t at least give a glimpse of the long-awaited upgrade to its most powerful computer, then something\u2019s gone wrong. MacOS 10.15: Marzipan, marzipan, marzipan. That\u2019s the codename for the project to port iOS apps to the Mac, and expect that to be front and centre of the conference. The most obvious outcome? The (overhyped) death of iTunes. It\u2019s not really going anywhere (the core app is probably just being renamed Music), but features including Podcasts, TV and the App Store are all likely to be spun-off into their own apps. WatchOS 6: Period tracking could go prime-time, as Apple finally graduates reproductive health from an embarrassed sub-menu in its Health app to a full-blown feature in its own right. The name \u201cCycles\u201d is being suggested. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s liveblog of Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers\u2019 Conference. We\u2019ll be kicking off at 10am Pacific Time \u2013 that\u2019s 6pm UK time, and 3am in New South Wales if you\u2019re staying up for all the latest news. If you want to watch along live, Apple is streaming the event on its website. Otherwise, stick around, and we\u2019ll digest two hours of back-slapping, stat-crunching and buzzword-dropping into one easy feed.",

Users can hide their email addresses from apps, using Apple\u2019s random email address generator, which creates unique addresses that forward emails to your real address.</p> <p>The new HomeKit Secure Video system can encrypt and upload video from compatible home security cameras, via your iPad, Apple TV or HomePod speaker, to your iCloud account. </p> <p>The developer beta of iOS 13 is available now, with a public beta available in July.

      "bodyText": "Apple has announced that the iPhone is going to get faster with iOS 13, the iTunes app is dead on the Mac with the new macOS 10.15 Catalina, and the iPad is getting its own operating system. On stage at the firm\u2019s annual developer conference in San Jose McEnery Convention Center, California, Apple\u2019s CEO Tim Cook unveiled the next versions of iOS, iPad OS, watchOS, macOS and the long-awaited Mac Pro, which becomes Apple\u2019s most expensive computer. Here\u2019s everything you need to know. iOS 13 - faster and more private Apple said iOS 13 would reduce app sizes by 50%, app updates by 60% and make them launch up to twice as fast. Face ID has also been sped up, unlocking the iPhone up to 30% faster. \u201cNothing is more important to our iPhone users than performance,\u201d said Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of software engineering. Following macOS, iOS 13 also gains a system-wide \u201cdark mode\u201d, which turns the user interface into white text on a black background, as has become popular in a variety of apps and systems. Apple also introduced a new Apple social login system, which works in a similar way to that used by Google and Facebook but \u201cwithout all the tracking\u201d, according to Federighi. Users can hide their email addresses from apps, using Apple\u2019s random email address generator, which creates unique addresses that forward emails to your real address. The new HomeKit Secure Video system can encrypt and upload video from compatible home security cameras, via your iPad, Apple TV or HomePod speaker, to your iCloud account. The developer beta of iOS 13 is available now, with a public beta available in July. A final release is expected in the autumn. iPad OS \u2013 more like a computer Apple is splitting iOS into two, one for the iPhone and a new one for the iPad called iPad OS. Immediate changes are tighter home screen app grids, the ability to pin widgets on the home screen, and new copy and paste gestures \u2013 three-finger pinch to copy, spread to paste and swipe to undo. Most of the changes are to make the iPad more like a desktop computer, particularly Apple\u2019s large iPad Pro. The app expose function is now on the iPad, similar to the Mac, multi-window compatibility has been enabled for placing two Word documents or similar side-by-side, and multiple slide-over apps can be stacked and switched between via swipes. There are also 30 new keyboard shortcuts. Flash drive and memory card support has been added to the Files app, as well as direct camera import into apps such as Adobe\u2019s Lightroom. Apple is also adding desktop-class browsing to Safari on the iPad, which automatically sizes true desktop sites to the screen and makes them touch-friendly, instead of sticking users with a blown-up mobile site. The developer beta of iPad OS is available now, with a public beta available in July. A final release is expected in the autumn. macOS 10.15 Catalina \u2013 free of the iTunes app Apple has split iTunes into three apps: Apple Music, Podcasts and Apple TV. \u201cThe future of iTunes is not one app but three: Apple Music, Podcasts and Apple TV,\u201d said Federighi. Users who sync their iPhone with a Mac now do so in the Finder app. ScreenTime, the usage monitoring system introduced to iOS last year, has been brought to macOS. Apple is also allowing users to use their iPad as an external screen on their Mac using its new Sidecar system. The big addition for Catalina is Apple\u2019s Project Catalyst, which allows iPad app developers to port their apps to macOS. It\u2019s the same system Apple uses for its Apple News, Stocks, Home and Voice Memo apps, but is now available to third-party developers, which the firm hopes will boost the number of available Mac apps. Macs with Apple\u2019s T2 security chip also now have Activation Lock similar to the iPhone, which Apple hopes will make Macs a less appealing target for thieves. Plus Apple\u2019s new Find My system anonymously uses other people\u2019s iOS devices to find offline Macs and other lost devices via Bluetooth beacons. Apple also introduced full voice control for the whole of macOS and iOS as part of its accessibility tools. The developer beta of macOS 10.15 Catalina is available now, with a public beta available in July. A final release is expected in the autumn. Mac Pro \u2013 pro-level super Mac Apple has finally unveiled its new Mac Pro computer starting at $5,999 in the autumn. The new stainless steel desktop machine supports up to 28-core Intel Xeon processors, 1.5TB of RAM, eight PCI expansion slots and modular configuration. The Mac Pro can also come with Apple\u2019s new MPX Module, a custom graphics system that can support up to two pairs of AMD\u2019s Radeon Pro Vega II cards, plus a custom Afterburner video processing chip. The machine has been publicly in the works since April 2017 when Apple announced it was \u201ccompletely rethinking the Mac Pro\u201c. The company hopes it will appease its core of creatives and developers, which bought into the last version of the Mac Pro released in December 2013 resembling a small, sleek dustbin and then failed to make it upgradeable. Apple also announced its new Pro Display XDR screen costing $4,999 from the autumn. The new 32in 6K HDR LCD screen is designed for professional video editors that use professional monitors. Apple said it checked professional wishlists, including up to 1,000nits of constant brightness and 1,600nits at peak, calibrated at the factory for P3 wide colour, 10-bit and with a reference mode watchOS 6 \u2013 more independent The Apple Watch is becoming more independent from the iPhone. WatchOS 6 adds an on-watch App Store and the ability for developers to create apps that no longer need iPhone app companions. Apple is also bringing a voice memo app, audiobooks and a calculator to the Apple Watch, alongside some new watch faces.

      "bodyText": "Canadians can no longer turn a blind eye to the \u201cgenocide\u201d of Indigenous peoples in the country, a landmark report on missing and murdered women has concluded. Indigenous communities across the country have for decades attempted to convey the depth and scope of a tragedy that has haunted thousands of families. As many as 4,000 Indigenous women and girls are believed to have been killed or gone missing in Canada over the past 30 years \u2013 although the true number of victims is unlikely ever to be known. On Monday the findings of a three-year inquiry were released at a solemn ceremony in Quebec, attended by victims\u2019 families, survivors, Indigenous leaders and senior government officials. \u201cThis is an uncomfortable day for Canada,\u201d said the prime minister, Justin Trudeau. \u201cWe have failed you. We will fail you no longer.\u201d The inquiry\u2019s final report, a 1,200-page catalogue of historical and contemporary injustices, concludes that decades of policy and state indifference amounted to genocide against Indigenous peoples. The report\u2019s authors were blunt in their assessment: \u201cIf you\u2019re not outraged, you\u2019re not paying attention \u2026 This is every Canadian\u2019s responsibility not to turn a blind eye.\u201d The report, called Reclaiming Power and Place, marks the government\u2019s most signifiant attempt at determining the scope of the epidemic of violence that has claimed the lives of thousands of indigenous women. \u201cThe violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA [two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex and asexual] people is a national tragedy of epic proportion,\u201d wrote the chief commissioner, Marion Buller.

The report also includes 231 recommendations for future action. \u201cIt must be understood that these recommendations, which we frame as \u2018Calls for Justice,\u2019 are legal imperatives \u2013 they are not optional,\u201d said the report. The wide-ranging recommendations include overhauling policing practices in Indigenous communities, giving Indigenous languages official status, creating a universal basic income and investing in early childhood programs for Indigenous youth. While the document exposes a damning narrative of the country\u2019s history, it also encourages a path forward. \u201cFor many non-Indigenous people, it\u2019s important to be ready to \u2018unlearn\u2019 some learned behaviours,\u201d said the report. Veldon Coburn, who teaches Indigenous studies at Carleton University, said Canadians need to understand the role of state institutions such as residential schools where more than 150,000 aboriginal children were taken in an attempt to forcibly assimilate them into Canadian society \u2013 and work to dismantle those practices.

Fox host Ainsley Earhardt amplified the lie, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/fox-news-democrats-kill-baby-abortion-infanticide-1423779\">saying</a> :\u201cI think it backfired on those Democrats when they all said you can have an abortion even after the baby is born or kill the baby after the baby is born.\u201d</p> <p>This kind of procedure has never been considered abortion, but it\u2019s a framework that helps portray abortion at any stage for any reason as murder.</p> <p>Crucially, this new lie may have contributed to a climate in which lawmakers in Georgia and Alabama were willing to criminalize medical caregivers and make them subject to new kinds of scrutiny. Under a new Alabama law, as CNN <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/15/us/alabama-abortion-law-felony-trnd/index.html\">put it</a>: \u201cAny physician who is convicted of performing an abortion in the state would be a Class A felon \u2013 the highest level in Alabama.\u201d The 10th anniversary of the murder of abortion provider <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/31/george-tiller-doctor-kansas-abortion\">George Tiller</a> in Wichita, Kansas, just passed; in late 2015 a white gunman with a history of domestic violence shot up a Colorado Planned Parenthood, killing three parents of young children and injuring several others. He called himself \u201ca warrior for the babies\u201d. Planned Parenthood provides abortions and, as the nation\u2019s frontline supplier of reproductive healthcare, including contraception and sex education, prevents them.</p> <p>Around the time that this myth of infanticide was being promoted, House whip Steve Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana, had a \u201cborn alive discharge petition tracker\u201d on the top of his official government webpage. It is part of a campaign suggesting that abortions result in live births of viable fetuses who are then killed or allowed to die. The huge majority of abortions take place before the embryo or fetus is viable outside the womb; fetuses emerging from abortion procedures alive are extremely rare, but there are federal and state laws regulating these cases, often framed in ways that make them sound both more common and the consequences more homicidal. In <a href=\"https://www.health.state.mn.us/data/mchs/pubs/abrpt/docs/2017abrptr2.pdf\">Minnesota in 2017</a>, for example, out of more than 10,000 abortions, three live fetuses were recorded, but died soon after.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/24/its-not-a-little-child-gynecologists-join-the-fight-against-six-week-abortion-bans\">'It's not a little child': gynecologists join the fight against six-week abortion bans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s another lie built into a lot of the new bills: the idea that they stop the abortion of fetuses with heartbeats. In actual fact, so-called \u201cheartbeat bills\u201d would also apply to embryos that haven\u2019t yet become fetuses and whose cells haven\u2019t yet multiplied or formed complex organs, including a fully formed heart. These bills seem designed to influence public imagination, not accurately register development in utero. Despite that, the Georgia law is supposed to \u201cprovide for advising women seeking an abortion of the presence of a detectable human heartbeat\u201d.</p> <p>Some fear the new laws may lead to more widespread criminalization of miscarriages. There are about a thousand cases to date of women whose miscarriages have been criminalized; Jezebel <a href=\"https://theslot.jezebel.com/every-pregnancy-is-a-risk-of-harm-how-criminalizing-mi-1834810320\">reported</a> last month: \u201cBlack women and low-income women <a href=\"http://dvocatesforpregnantwomen.org/main/publications/articles_and_reports/executive_summary_paltrow_flavin_jhppl_article.php\">are more likely to be arrested for these</a> pregnancy-related charges.\u201d Up to 20% of known pregnancies, perhaps half of all pregnancies, according to a <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/372193v1\">2018 study</a>, result in miscarriage. Criminalizing them would mean that women having sex with men would run the risk of being treated as murderers for common biological events beyond their control. In that world, it\u2019s conceivable that if the authorities know you\u2019re pregnant, thanks to medical visits (or fertility apps), you run the risk of being charged with the \u201ccrime\u201d of having a miscarriage or an abortion, which would be an incentive to avoid healthcare services.</p> <p>Like many other states\u2019 new laws, the Georgia law bans abortion at a stage of pregnancy so early some women don\u2019t know they\u2019re pregnant and if they do find out, they will have to move fast to make the deadlines. So abortions will remain available, but under increasingly impossible terms because of abortion laws driven by stories about things that don\u2019t actually happen.</p> <p>Some abortions are to complete the process of a miscarriage to protect the mother\u2019s life; the 2018 Irish abortion referendum overturning the ban on the procedure was prompted in part by the death of a woman, Dr Savita Halappanavar, who was having a miscarriage, was denied a medically necessary abortion as long as there was a fetal heartbeat, even though the fetus would die anyway, and who developed a fatal infection as a result.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Texas is in the process of passing a law that will make women into living coffins, forced to carry dying or doomed fetuses to term. The Texas Tribune reports: \u201cThe Texas Senate passed a bill on Tuesday that would ban abortions on the basis of the sex, race or disability of a fetus, and criminalize doctors who perform what opponents call \u2018discriminatory abortions\u2019. Current state law prohibits abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but there are certain exceptions, such as when the pregnancy is not viable or the fetus has \u2018severe and irreversible\u2019 abnormalities. <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=86R&amp;Bill=SB1033\">Senate Bill 1033</a> would do away with those exceptions.\u201d</p> <p>It seems unlikely anyone is seeking an abortion because of the race of the baby, but it does tie into the myth that abortion is part of a eugenics campaign, though US supreme court justice Clarence Thomas just made that charge. (The Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/05/31/clarence-thomas-tried-link-abortion-eugenics-seven-historians-told-post-hes-wrong/?utm_term=.4fba873bd512\">cited</a> \u201cseven scholars of the eugenics movement; all of them said that Thomas\u2019s use of this history was deeply flawed\u201d.)</p> <p>Sometimes the mostly white, mostly male legislators pushing these lies seem like amoral strategists. Sometimes they just seem like idiots. NBC reports: \u201cThe new bill currently introduced by Republicans in the Ohio state house would preclude doctors from pursuing the standard of care in cases of life-threatening ectopic pregnancies\u201d \u2013 when a fertilized egg grows outside of the uterus \u2013 \u201cand ban private insurance companies from covering it by calling it an abortion and forcing them, instead, to cover a re-implantation procedure whether the woman wanted that or not\u201d. Except you can\u2019t save an ectopic pregnancy, but by delaying abortion you risk letting the mother die. So this is a bill to force a procedure that doesn\u2019t exist to save an embryo or fetus who\u2019s doomed while risking the life of the mother who can be saved. It isn\u2019t pro-life, but it is pro-lie.</p> <p>Michelle Alexander made a really important point in the New York Times, recently: all that palaver about exemptions for rape just mean that rape victims who want abortions will have to try to prove they were raped. Given how rarely men are convicted of rape, and how slow and intrusive and hostile to victims the legal process is, one can imagine the fetus reaching preschool age or maybe kindergarten or possibly law school before the court case is concluded.</p> <p>It is another way to intrude into women\u2019s lives and terminate their rights. It puts women\u2019s lives in the hands of law enforcement and entangles medical decisions with bureaucracies and regulations. And under the Alabama law, there is no incest and rape exemption: the 11-year-old raped by her father will be sentenced to nine months pregnancy with all the health risks that entails, as well as the horror.</p> <p>Women\u2019s reproductive rights activists have been noting for decades that it would be easier to believe that anti-choice politicians cared about babies if they supported prenatal health, maternal healthcare, early childhood development and education and other resources that support the wellbeing of mothers and children. But you can go further than that. Two scholars noted in the New England Journal of Medicine 18 years ago that \u201chomicide was in fact the leading cause of mortality during pregnancy and the first postpartum year, accounting for one out of five deaths. Simultaneously, a study in the Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women\u2019s Health found that an astounding 43% of maternal deaths over eight years in Washington DC, were homicides.\u201d</p> <p>One key way to address this would be gun control, but of course anti-abortion and gun control are often brought to us by the same people, and together the two positions seem to be about unlimited, unfettered power for men, who own and use guns (and kill people) at much higher rates than women. Pew <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/the-demographics-of-gun-ownership/\">reported</a> that in 2017, \u201cwhite men are especially likely to be gun owners: about half (48%) say they own a gun, compared with about a quarter of white women and nonwhite men (24% each) and 16% of nonwhite women\u201d.</p> <p>Anti-abortion advocates have often suggested that an unwanted, unplanned pregnancy is somehow a thing malicious women do on their own. There are intentional, wanted pregnancies achieved through sperm donors and in-vitro fertilization, but pretty much every other pregnancy is due to a person injecting sperm into a person with eggs through penetrative vaginal sex. There may be cases where the carelessness is hers, there are cases where it\u2019s his, there are cases where careful precautions fail, or where wanted pregnancies go terribly wrong.</p> <p>What we don\u2019t talk about often enough is how blurry the boundaries are, how often women are cajoled and pressured and lied to in order to allow, for the sake of penile pleasure, unprotected penetrative sex that can result in pregnancy. The last time I heard a story about a man who violated the agreement to use a condom was last week. The idea of holding men responsible for unwanted pregnancy is beginning to take hold in some quarters. Imagine if those who impregnate were held as responsible as those who are impregnated. It\u2019s a slippery slope, since the decision to terminate should belong to the pregnant person, and of course the goal should not be to criminalize anyone. But recognizing that no one gets pregnant alone and many pregnancies are as much the responsibility of the person with sperm as the person with an egg might be interesting.</p> <p>An extraordinary story hit the news the other day. \u201cA <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2019-05-21/report-mississippi-lawmaker-punched-wife-in-face-over-sex\">police report</a> says a south Mississippi lawmaker punched his wife in the face after she didn\u2019t undress quickly enough when the lawmaker wanted to have sex.\u201d Republican representative Doug McLeod allegedly bloodied his wife\u2019s nose, she bled all over the bed and floor, and fled the room, and the police were called. (He has said reports mischaracterize what happened.) It\u2019s hard to regard the kind of sex he intended to have as consensual, if a frightened partner was punished for not obeying orders with enough alacrity. It\u2019s a little window into the kind of marriage in which women have little bodily self-determination, in which their decision to use birth control or refrain from sex during their most fertile time may be overridden. I looked up McLeod; sure enough he had introduced a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d anti-abortion bill earlier this year.</p> <p>Reproductive rights are what make women in their fertile years able to participate fully in public and economic life, to have the same bodily sovereignty men take for granted, to be free and equal. I believe the hatred of abortion is often because it makes women free and equal, and it is often advocated by people who show no interest in the health of infants or wellbeing of children. Or women. And at this point, in science, facts and truth. Their lies pave the way for their laws.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rebecca Solnit is a freelance writer, and author of Men Explain Things to Me and The Mother of All Questions.

There are about a thousand cases to date of women whose miscarriages have been criminalized; Jezebel reported last month: \u201cBlack women and low-income women are more likely to be arrested for these pregnancy-related charges.\u201d Up to 20% of known pregnancies, perhaps half of all pregnancies, according to a 2018 study, result in miscarriage. Criminalizing them would mean that women having sex with men would run the risk of being treated as murderers for common biological events beyond their control. In that world, it\u2019s conceivable that if the authorities know you\u2019re pregnant, thanks to medical visits (or fertility apps), you run the risk of being charged with the \u201ccrime\u201d of having a miscarriage or an abortion, which would be an incentive to avoid healthcare services. Like many other states\u2019 new laws, the Georgia law bans abortion at a stage of pregnancy so early some women don\u2019t know they\u2019re pregnant and if they do find out, they will have to move fast to make the deadlines. So abortions will remain available, but under increasingly impossible terms because of abortion laws driven by stories about things that don\u2019t actually happen. Some abortions are to complete the process of a miscarriage to protect the mother\u2019s life; the 2018 Irish abortion referendum overturning the ban on the procedure was prompted in part by the death of a woman, Dr Savita Halappanavar, who was having a miscarriage, was denied a medically necessary abortion as long as there was a fetal heartbeat, even though the fetus would die anyway, and who developed a fatal infection as a result. Meanwhile, Texas is in the process of passing a law that will make women into living coffins, forced to carry dying or doomed fetuses to term. The Texas Tribune reports: \u201cThe Texas Senate passed a bill on Tuesday that would ban abortions on the basis of the sex, race or disability of a fetus, and criminalize doctors who perform what opponents call \u2018discriminatory abortions\u2019. Current state law prohibits abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but there are certain exceptions, such as when the pregnancy is not viable or the fetus has \u2018severe and irreversible\u2019 abnormalities. Senate Bill 1033 would do away with those exceptions.\u201d It seems unlikely anyone is seeking an abortion because of the race of the baby, but it does tie into the myth that abortion is part of a eugenics campaign, though US supreme court justice Clarence Thomas just made that charge. (The Washington Post cited \u201cseven scholars of the eugenics movement; all of them said that Thomas\u2019s use of this history was deeply flawed\u201d.) Sometimes the mostly white, mostly male legislators pushing these lies seem like amoral strategists. Sometimes they just seem like idiots. NBC reports: \u201cThe new bill currently introduced by Republicans in the Ohio state house would preclude doctors from pursuing the standard of care in cases of life-threatening ectopic pregnancies\u201d \u2013 when a fertilized egg grows outside of the uterus \u2013 \u201cand ban private insurance companies from covering it by calling it an abortion and forcing them, instead, to cover a re-implantation procedure whether the woman wanted that or not\u201d. Except you can\u2019t save an ectopic pregnancy, but by delaying abortion you risk letting the mother die. So this is a bill to force a procedure that doesn\u2019t exist to save an embryo or fetus who\u2019s doomed while risking the life of the mother who can be saved. It isn\u2019t pro-life, but it is pro-lie. Michelle Alexander made a really important point in the New York Times, recently: all that palaver about exemptions for rape just mean that rape victims who want abortions will have to try to prove they were raped. Given how rarely men are convicted of rape, and how slow and intrusive and hostile to victims the legal process is, one can imagine the fetus reaching preschool age or maybe kindergarten or possibly law school before the court case is concluded. It is another way to intrude into women\u2019s lives and terminate their rights. It puts women\u2019s lives in the hands of law enforcement and entangles medical decisions with bureaucracies and regulations. And under the Alabama law, there is no incest and rape exemption: the 11-year-old raped by her father will be sentenced to nine months pregnancy with all the health risks that entails, as well as the horror. Women\u2019s reproductive rights activists have been noting for decades that it would be easier to believe that anti-choice politicians cared about babies if they supported prenatal health, maternal healthcare, early childhood development and education and other resources that support the wellbeing of mothers and children. But you can go further than that. Two scholars noted in the New England Journal of Medicine 18 years ago that \u201chomicide was in fact the leading cause of mortality during pregnancy and the first postpartum year, accounting for one out of five deaths. Simultaneously, a study in the Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women\u2019s Health found that an astounding 43% of maternal deaths over eight years in Washington DC, were homicides.\u201d One key way to address this would be gun control, but of course anti-abortion and gun control are often brought to us by the same people, and together the two positions seem to be about unlimited, unfettered power for men, who own and use guns (and kill people) at much higher rates than women. Pew reported that in 2017, \u201cwhite men are especially likely to be gun owners: about half (48%) say they own a gun, compared with about a quarter of white women and nonwhite men (24% each) and 16% of nonwhite women\u201d. Anti-abortion advocates have often suggested that an unwanted, unplanned pregnancy is somehow a thing malicious women do on their own. There are intentional, wanted pregnancies achieved through sperm donors and in-vitro fertilization, but pretty much every other pregnancy is due to a person injecting sperm into a person with eggs through penetrative vaginal sex. There may be cases where the carelessness is hers, there are cases where it\u2019s his, there are cases where careful precautions fail, or where wanted pregnancies go terribly wrong. What we don\u2019t talk about often enough is how blurry the boundaries are, how often women are cajoled and pressured and lied to in order to allow, for the sake of penile pleasure, unprotected penetrative sex that can result in pregnancy. The last time I heard a story about a man who violated the agreement to use a condom was last week. The idea of holding men responsible for unwanted pregnancy is beginning to take hold in some quarters. Imagine if those who impregnate were held as responsible as those who are impregnated. It\u2019s a slippery slope, since the decision to terminate should belong to the pregnant person, and of course the goal should not be to criminalize anyone. But recognizing that no one gets pregnant alone and many pregnancies are as much the responsibility of the person with sperm as the person with an egg might be interesting. An extraordinary story hit the news the other day. \u201cA police report says a south Mississippi lawmaker punched his wife in the face after she didn\u2019t undress quickly enough when the lawmaker wanted to have sex.\u201d Republican representative Doug McLeod allegedly bloodied his wife\u2019s nose, she bled all over the bed and floor, and fled the room, and the police were called. (He has said reports mischaracterize what happened.) It\u2019s hard to regard the kind of sex he intended to have as consensual, if a frightened partner was punished for not obeying orders with enough alacrity. It\u2019s a little window into the kind of marriage in which women have little bodily self-determination, in which their decision to use birth control or refrain from sex during their most fertile time may be overridden. I looked up McLeod; sure enough he had introduced a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d anti-abortion bill earlier this year. Reproductive rights are what make women in their fertile years able to participate fully in public and economic life, to have the same bodily sovereignty men take for granted, to be free and equal. I believe the hatred of abortion is often because it makes women free and equal, and it is often advocated by people who show no interest in the health of infants or wellbeing of children. Or women. And at this point, in science, facts and truth. Their lies pave the way for their laws. Rebecca Solnit is a freelance writer, and author of Men Explain Things to Me and The Mother of All Questions.

The comparison was grossly unfair, ran the narrative from the boardroom, but Kier declared that it would be a model of prudence anyway. It would strengthen its balance sheet to please its bankers, stakeholders and anybody else worried about risks in the construction and outsourcing sectors.</p> <p>The pitch wasn\u2019t entirely convincing, which is why underwriters to the fundraising were left with a slug of unwanted stock, and why chief executive Haydn Mursell was dumped soon afterwards. But, hey, at least the debt question had been answered, right?</p> <p>Well, not exactly.

There are \u201cvolume pressures\u201d \u2013 meaning not enough work \u2013 in the highways, utilities and housing maintenance division. Revenues in the building business will also be lower than forecast. And the worst part was the junking of the promise to show net cash at the end of this month, the most flattering point of the year for a business with huge seasonal cash swings. There is \u201clikely\u201d to be net debt instead. In other words, the chat \u2013 still \u2013 is about borrowings.</p> <p>True believers will argue that the shares are absurdly cheap if \u201cunderlying\u201d profits arrive at the \u00a3130m-ish implied by the latest statement. And Kier can still boast that its chief difference from Carillion is intact and permanent: most of its contracts are smaller in size, so there isn\u2019t the same concentration of risk.</p> <p>Yet one can understand why outsiders are alarmed by the pace of events. Only nine months ago, with its share price at \u00a310, Kier cheerfully declared a 69p-a-share dividend, a decision that looks terrible in hindsight. The chairman, Philip Cox, will have to explain how it was made.</p> <p>In the meantime, Davies\u2019 \u201cstrategic review\u201d, due next month, is suddenly a key moment.

Woodford has been a refreshingly contrarian presence in the investment world for three decades and made his name by sitting out the turn-of-the-century dotcom mania in brave and brilliant style. But those triumphs feel a long time ago. One hopes he can turn things around but there is, sad to say, a strong sense that most of these difficulties are self-inflicted. Woodford should have stuck to what he knew best. Is net debt yet to surface at Kier Group? Kier Group\u2019s \u00a3264m rights issue at the end of last year was designed to kill dangerous talk about \u201cthe next Carillion\u201d. The comparison was grossly unfair, ran the narrative from the boardroom, but Kier declared that it would be a model of prudence anyway. It would strengthen its balance sheet to please its bankers, stakeholders and anybody else worried about risks in the construction and outsourcing sectors. The pitch wasn\u2019t entirely convincing, which is why underwriters to the fundraising were left with a slug of unwanted stock, and why chief executive Haydn Mursell was dumped soon afterwards. But, hey, at least the debt question had been answered, right? Well, not exactly. Monday\u2019s profits warning sent the share price down 41% to 164p, its lowest level for 20 years, and a far cry from the 409p rights price. Kier is now valued at \u00a3270m only six months after it received a cash injection of almost equivalent size. New chief executive Andrew Davies arrived with bad news on many fronts. There are \u201cvolume pressures\u201d \u2013 meaning not enough work \u2013 in the highways, utilities and housing maintenance division. Revenues in the building business will also be lower than forecast. And the worst part was the junking of the promise to show net cash at the end of this month, the most flattering point of the year for a business with huge seasonal cash swings. There is \u201clikely\u201d to be net debt instead. In other words, the chat \u2013 still \u2013 is about borrowings. True believers will argue that the shares are absurdly cheap if \u201cunderlying\u201d profits arrive at the \u00a3130m-ish implied by the latest statement. And Kier can still boast that its chief difference from Carillion is intact and permanent: most of its contracts are smaller in size, so there isn\u2019t the same concentration of risk. Yet one can understand why outsiders are alarmed by the pace of events. Only nine months ago, with its share price at \u00a310, Kier cheerfully declared a 69p-a-share dividend, a decision that looks terrible in hindsight. The chairman, Philip Cox, will have to explain how it was made. In the meantime, Davies\u2019 \u201cstrategic review\u201d, due next month, is suddenly a key moment. Is even deeper cost-cutting in prospect? Sales of businesses? Whatever it is, the plan needs to be decisive and convincing. His predecessor\u2019s plan A wasn\u2019t.",

Joe Root saw four overthrows result from a similar shy late on while James Vince, on as a sub, was nutmegged by a Sarfaraz pull shot to the delight of the supporters in green. With 11 wides also sent down \u2013 Jofra Archer grew visibly agitated by some of the calls from the square-leg umpire amid 10 overs that leaked 79 runs \u2013 England\u2019s target was significantly greater than they might have otherwise expected. Wrapping up the innings 19 minutes late meant the over-rate was flirting with possible sanctions too. It was not all doom and gloom. As well as the hands of Woakes proving so adhesive, Jonny Bairstow typically excelled on the boundary rope. Jos Buttler also picked up a sharp stumping, having drilled hard with coach Bruce French over the past few days in response to some problems against South Africa and in last month\u2019s ODIs. Moeen Ali was the beneficiary of this amid a fine return of three for 50 that offset Pakistan taking a particular fancy to Adil Rashid. England possibly overdid the short-ball tactic, sending down 88 bumpers that produced two wickets for 102, but Mark Wood was excellent on his return to the side, showing good pace in his two for 53. But ultimately, with the margin of defeat a mere 14 runs, England will head to Cardiff for Saturday\u2019s meeting with Bangladesh \u2013 and their similarly vocal supporters \u2013 harbouring a sense of regret. As Morgan keeps stressing, there remains much work to do.",

Federighi said app updates in iOS 13 would be up to 50% smaller with 60% fewer updates and the new system would speed up other tasks, too, such as Face ID facial recognition unlocking the iPhone XS 30% faster. The big crowd pleaser, however, appeared to be the introduction of Apple\u2019s system-wide \u201cdark mode\u201d, which turns the user interface from black text on a white background to white text on a black background, as has become popular in a variety of apps. Dark mode reduces eye strain in low light conditions and saves battery power on top-end smartphones because black pixels on OLED screens \u2013 such as those on the iPhone X and XS \u2013 consume no power. Apple also introduced a new Apple social login system, which it compared to Google and Facebook\u2019s system of login to third-party services. \u201cSign in with Apple has all the convenience without giving away all your data,\u201d said Federighi. \u201cIt\u2019s the fast way to sign in without all the tracking, authenticated on device and logged in with a new account without giving away any information to a third party.\u201d If an app would like access to names or email addresses, it can ask and users have the choice to give the developer the data. \u201cBut if you choose to hide your email address, we\u2019ll create a unique random address that forwards to your real email address, and it\u2019s unique to the app so you disable it at any time,\u201d said Federighi. Apple announced a new HomeKit Secure Video system, which it says can encrypt and upload video from compatible home security cameras to iCloud accounts via iPads, Apple TV or HomePod speakers. Apple also added new portrait lighting effects, new Memoji stickers, smarter photo organisation and more advanced video editing to iOS, and it said it was working on a new updated Maps app for the US by the end of the year and other markets in 2020.",

London-based fund managers Marshall Wace and Kuvari Partners were the biggest winners, with shorts of about 1.5% each.</p> \n<p>The slump dealt another blow to star investment manager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/03/neil-woodford-blocks-investors-from-pulling-cash-from-flagship-fund\">Neil Woodford, who suspended shares</a> in his LF Woodford Equity Income Fund after markets closed on Monday. His funds, which own more than 20% of shares in Kier, lost \u00a337m during the day.

      "bodyText": "Investors dumped shares in Kier Group on Monday after a profit warning from the construction and services company prompted comparisons with Carillion, its former rival that collapsed last year. Kier, which employs 20,000 people and works on large infrastructure projects such as HS2 and London\u2019s delayed Crossrail , said its underlying full-year profits would be substantially below earlier forecasts, at about \u00a3129m rather than \u00a3169m. Shares in the FTSE 250 company plummeted by 41% to 163.8p, their lowest level since February 1999. This is less than half the 409p a share investors paid in December, when Kier launched a \u00a3264m emergency fundraising in an attempt to avoid the same fate as Carillion, the construction and services company that collapsed into insolvency in January 2018. John Moore, a senior investment manager at investment firm Brewin Dolphin, said: \u201cKier is in a dark place. At the turn of the year the business set out its financials, trading performance and future plans as part of its unsuccessful rights issue, only to now say that this information was largely wrong. It has broken trust with investors, which does not bode well. \u201cComparisons will be made with the likes of Carillion and, indeed, Kier has lots of complex long-term contracts and individual subsidiaries, which makes for an opaque situation where clarity and stability are desired. Where it goes from here is hard to say.\u201d Kier investors shunned December\u2019s cash call, with only 38% of the shares taken up, and financial institutions had to step in. Its chief executive Haydn Mursell quit the following month after eight years in the job. Hedge funds betting against the company have started to circle, with at least 4.8% of shares \u2013 equivalent to \u00a321.4m before Monday\u2019s share price fall \u2013 on loan to short sellers, who profit when the share price falls. London-based fund managers Marshall Wace and Kuvari Partners were the biggest winners, with shorts of about 1.5% each. The slump dealt another blow to star investment manager Neil Woodford, who suspended shares in his LF Woodford Equity Income Fund after markets closed on Monday. His funds, which own more than 20% of shares in Kier, lost \u00a337m during the day. Woodford bought shares in Kier as recently as 16 May, according to market disclosures. Ian Forrest, an investment research analyst at the stockbroker the Share Centre, said: \u201cThe shares are now down 85% over the past year and there are clearly fears in the market that the company could be heading for the same fate as Carillion.\u201d Kier, which took on Carillion\u2019s share of the HS2 high-speed rail project and took sole ownership of Highways England\u2019s smart motorway programme in Cheshire, is also the UK\u2019s leading regional builder of schools and hospitals. It said revenue growth at its regional buildings business would be lower than forecast. In March, Kier reported a first-half pre-tax loss of \u00a335.5m and flagged up problems in its highways, utilities and housing maintenance divisions. It has been hit by Highways England cutting back on maintenance spending and delays in telecoms companies\u2019 fibre rollout. As a result, the company said underlying operating profit for the year to 30 June would be \u00a325m lower than City forecasts of \u00a3169m, with revenues unchanged from last year at \u00a34.5bn. In addition, Kier is taking a \u00a315m hit from higher restructuring costs this year. The company\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Davies, who joined from construction group Wates in March and had been lined up to take over at Carillion before the latter collapsed, is ramping up a programme to streamline Kier. The group also warned on its debt. Analysts at stockbroker Peel Hunt had expected Kier to have \u00a315m of net cash at the end of its year in June but now forecasts net debt of \u00a360m.

We need you to leave alive to tell the world what our government did to us tonight.\u201d Because of the freedom Hong Kong citizens enjoyed before the handover of 1997, citizens of Beijing hoped that Liane would bear witness for them.

Some called for her to get the job full-time, others said she did not want it. Regardless, she has taken charge of the Under-21s since Neville\u2019s appointment and is feeding him players.

That\u2019s not just the core that went to Belarus. I\u2019ve know Ellen White since we were 13 years old \u2013 I can say the same for probably 80% of this team. That goes a long way on the pitch when you really need to pull together and you\u2019re in tough times.\u201d Bronze attributes her winning mentality to being a part of that generation. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said the younger generation has this crazy winning mentality. Not only did we win that but we made the final the following year, we made the semi\u2011final of a World Cup at under\u201117s \u2026 I think that\u2019s been brought through now. \u201cYou look at maybe not senior international level but senior domestic level, and every single one of those players probably has a trophy now in some way, shape or form and every single one of those players is hunting for trophies. \u201cWe\u2019ve got so many good teams with so many good players and now most of the England players have played in cup finals, they\u2019ve been top of the league, they play in the Champions League. We\u2019ve got that success running through our veins now at England.\u201d Marley, the second woman in England to have been awarded a Uefa Pro Licence (after Hope Powell), is credited with much of the patient nurturing of players through the system. The under-19 manager for 16 years, she stepped into the breach for the senior team on an interim basis after Mark Sampson was fired. Some called for her to get the job full-time, others said she did not want it. Regardless, she has taken charge of the Under-21s since Neville\u2019s appointment and is feeding him players. Marley is known for a holistic approach. She works with players, parents, clubs and coaches to ensure they have the right work\u2011school-life balance. The 2009 team continue to share the memories of that win with her. \u201cWe still speak about it now,\u201d says Duggan. \u201cA couple of years later we were still having a reunion to celebrate it \u2013 we seriously were. Every time we see Mo Marley we mention it to her because we achieved something special together and it\u2019s something we\u2019ll never forget.\u201d Knowing each other inside out means that they never doubt they can win. \u201cWe\u2019ve trained together every single day so we know the potential in the squad,\u201d says Duggan. \u201cWe knew that in Canada. We had a lot of youngsters that could stick together and go a long way together and that\u2019s where you see us now. \u201cWe showed in the Netherlands [at Euro 2017] that it wasn\u2019t a one\u2011off. Unfortunately we couldn\u2019t get over the line \u2013 we got to the semi\u2011finals \u2013 but it\u2019s coming and we know it\u2019s coming, it\u2019s just a case of when.\u201d",

Marcus Trescothick started the innings with a sparkle, upper cutting Morne Morkel for four from the first ball of the day, but when he fell, swiftly followed by James Hildreth, Somerset were 35 for three. </p> <p>Bartlett was then dropped on nought and never looked back, scoring his second hundred of the season, and a career best, in front of Andy Flower. Morkel, four for 64, and Rikki Clarke cleaned up the Somerset tail, all out for 344.</p> <p>The game at Edgbaston between <strong>Warwickshire</strong> and <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong>, the Division One wooden spoonists, threatened to eat itself as runs disappeared in a haze of caution. Between lunch and tea, the hosts crawled their way to 39 runs from 35 overs, the evening session a positive riot of 67 in comparison. Dominic Sibley finished not out on 81; only 15 boundaries were hit all day.</p> <p><strong>Yorkshire</strong> ploughed ahead at <strong>Headingley</strong> against Essex, finishing on 289 for six. Little partnerships ran through the day, the largest 127 between Tom Kohler-Cadmore (83) and Adam Lyth (95). Essex struck in the evening session, taking four wickets after tea.</p> <p>In Division Two, <strong>Lancashire</strong> finished strongly on 347 for seven against <strong>Leicestershire</strong> at Aigburth, where a brisk wind from the Mersey chilled the bones of those in its path. Liam Livingstone\u2019s powerful hitting dominated the day as he moved to his first hundred since August 2017 . His 136-run stand with Steven Croft stabilised a fragile start \u2013 Keaton Jennings was run out off the third ball of the day.</p> <p><strong>Durham</strong>\u2019s batsmen showed some staying power at Chester-le-Street, with fifties from Alex Lees and Liam Trevaskis; <strong>Derbyshire</strong>\u2019s Ravi Rampaul took four for 56.</p> <p>It was day two at Lord\u2019s and Northampton. <strong>Middlesex</strong> slithered into the mire after Glamorgan declared at 481 for nine, a lead of 343. Stiaan van Zyl made a stoical 173 and Ben Brown a frisky 107, hitting 17 fours, mostly against the second new ball.</p> <p>At the County Ground, Billy Root went one further than brother Joe by going Daddy with his 229 coming off 252 balls after being badly dropped on nought by Ricardo Vasconcelos at second slip, and guiding <strong>Glamorgan </strong>into the unusual position of a substantial first-innings score, a lead of 243 over <strong>Northamptonshire</strong>. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cf561118f082f7da1f2d339\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-03T18:06:24.825Z\">7.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Well that has made things very interesting World Cup wise! </strong>And I love the duality with the Warwickshire v Notts less-than-two-an-over one-for-the-red-ball specialists.

      "bodyText": "A century from George Bartlett started Somerset\u2019s recovery from a precarious start against Surrey at Guildford. Marcus Trescothick started the innings with a sparkle, upper cutting Morne Morkel for four from the first ball of the day, but when he fell, swiftly followed by James Hildreth, Somerset were 35 for three. Bartlett was then dropped on nought and never looked back, scoring his second hundred of the season, and a career best, in front of Andy Flower. Morkel, four for 64, and Rikki Clarke cleaned up the Somerset tail, all out for 344. The game at Edgbaston between Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire, the Division One wooden spoonists, threatened to eat itself as runs disappeared in a haze of caution. Between lunch and tea, the hosts crawled their way to 39 runs from 35 overs, the evening session a positive riot of 67 in comparison. Dominic Sibley finished not out on 81; only 15 boundaries were hit all day. Yorkshire ploughed ahead at Headingley against Essex, finishing on 289 for six. Little partnerships ran through the day, the largest 127 between Tom Kohler-Cadmore (83) and Adam Lyth (95). Essex struck in the evening session, taking four wickets after tea. In Division Two, Lancashire finished strongly on 347 for seven against Leicestershire at Aigburth, where a brisk wind from the Mersey chilled the bones of those in its path. Liam Livingstone\u2019s powerful hitting dominated the day as he moved to his first hundred since August 2017 . His 136-run stand with Steven Croft stabilised a fragile start \u2013 Keaton Jennings was run out off the third ball of the day. Durham\u2019s batsmen showed some staying power at Chester-le-Street, with fifties from Alex Lees and Liam Trevaskis; Derbyshire\u2019s Ravi Rampaul took four for 56. It was day two at Lord\u2019s and Northampton. Middlesex slithered into the mire after Glamorgan declared at 481 for nine, a lead of 343. Stiaan van Zyl made a stoical 173 and Ben Brown a frisky 107, hitting 17 fours, mostly against the second new ball. At the County Ground, Billy Root went one further than brother Joe by going Daddy with his 229 coming off 252 balls after being badly dropped on nought by Ricardo Vasconcelos at second slip, and guiding Glamorgan into the unusual position of a substantial first-innings score, a lead of 243 over Northamptonshire. Well that has made things very interesting World Cup wise! And I love the duality with the Warwickshire v Notts less-than-two-an-over one-for-the-red-ball specialists. Ain\u2019t cricket great? Thanks for all your comments and for sticking with us while fireworks were going on elsewhere. See thee tomorrow. And bring your brollies. Division One Somerset 344 v Surrey 0-0 Warwickshire 181-3 v Nottinghamshire Yorkshire 289-6 v Essex Division Two Durham 254-8 v Derbyshire Lancashire 347-7 v Leicestershire Middlesex 138 &amp; 9-0 v Sussex 481-9 dec (after day two) Middlesex trail by 334 with 10 wickets remaining Northamptonshire 209 v Glamorgan 452-9 (after day two) Glamorgan lead by 243 with one wicket remaining Tom Bailey steps onto his huge back foot and guides Abass down to the boundary. Lancashire step on, and I step off to write the round-up. Keep an eye on things for me, and do follow Rob, who is beside himself with excitement on the OBO - the game\u2019s a thriller. Is Billy Root going to go Daddy? 181 not out against Northants, and the move across the border seems to be suiting him well. Sussex pass 450, with van Zyl the man in possession, 166 not out. And Abass takes the new ball here at Aigburth, with Lancashire 294/7. Is George Bartlett the real thing? Hell, yeah! Go George: 129 not out at Guildford against Morkel and the rest. The game where Ollie Pope made a hundred against the watching Ed Smith last year. Somerest 276-5. I\u2019m not sure run-out is the correct term at Edgbaston, what with everything happening in sepia,but Hain managed it nonetheless. Warwicks 151 for 3 off 79 overs. And that\u2019s a breakthrough for Parky! (No not that one.) Croft b Parkinson for 51. Lancashire 283 for 7. Those Yorkshire batsmen, they just can\u2019t get their fingers round that hundred. First Lyth gone for 95, then Kohler-Cadmore for 83. Yorks 249/5 And Finbar Anslow writes: \u201cHi Tanya from pleasantly hot Pavia.\u201d Hi from windy Aigburth! \u201cI was wondering if your good self or anyone else knows what exactly counties get out of their players being picked for England? It certainly didn\u2019t do Hampshire any favours in the recent final ( although of course Somerset would have won anyway ) and sad as I was to see Joss Buttler go he doesn\u2019t seem to play for Lancashire very often.\u201d Finbar, I\u2019m pretty sure there is a compensation scheme, which I\u2019ve just googled but can\u2019t find... so maybe I\u2019m wrong...and by the way, I think Jos will be on his way back to Somerset - he\u2019s out of contract at the end of the season. John Atherton has a guess on Liverpool cricketers A guess at three in my lifetime: Horton Paddy McKeow Ian Cockbain Paul says good work! Apologies all, technical problems again. Another quick lap, add salt and vinegar to the smell sensation . Lancashire moving onward rapidly. Livingstone makes his hundred with a vigorous cut but there falls for 114, hitting into the comfortable hands of Cosgrove. Lanes 264 for 6. ENGLAND V PAKISTAN: PAKISTAN 348-8; ENGLAND 86-2 OFF 14 DIVISION ONE Yorkshire v Essex: Yorks 207/2 (Lyth 85 not out, Kohler-Cadmore 68 not out) Warwickshire v Nottinghamshire: Warwicks 114/2 (Sibley 50 not out) Surrey v Somerset: Somerset: 214/4 (Bartlett 100 not out) DIVISION TWO Lancashire v Leicestershire: Lancs 238/5 (Livingstone 96 not out) Durham v Derbyshire: Durham 172/4 (Lees 63) day 2: Northants v Glamorgan: Northants 209 (Rossington 77; de Lange 4-64); Glamorgan 287-6 (Billy Root 146 not out; Sanderson 4-31) day 2: Middlesex v Sussex: Middlesex 138 (Wiese 5-26); Sussex 412/7 (van Zyl 142 not out; Brown 107; Murtagh 3-64) Here\u2019s George Bartlett, looking whippet-like and not at all like a farmhand: Croft plays an immaculate defensive shot into the ground and Livingstone will have to sup on 96. Tea-scores to follow A calamitous over for Leicestershire: Colin Ackermann comes on, Livingstone skies him miles across the line, Calum Parkinson drops it. Livingstone, emboldened, then slog sweeps for six, then again, for four. He finishes the next over with a six and a four and that\u2019s the hundred partnership between him and Croft and Livingstone wants those three figures and he wants them NOW. (beats chest) At 95 this is his highest first-class score since his 224 against Warwickshire in August 2017. Glamorgan go into the lead at the County Ground, Billy Root 108 not out. Meanwhile Joe has just been dropped by Barbar. Oh brother. England 54/1 off eight. Kohler-Cadmore (60) and Lyth (82) going very nicely indeed at Headingley, Yorkshire 196 for 2. Warwickshire have hitched their wagon to a sloth, 104 for 2, that\u2019s 29 runs since lunch. I\u2019d forgotten about Sussex. Sorry Sussex. Basically they lead Middlesex by a gazillion with four wickets in hand. Two centurions - more runs for Ben Brown - 107, while Stiaan van Zyl is still unbeaten on 131. And applause all around the ground for Liam Livingstone\u2019s fifty as he raises his bat to the pavilion - that\u2019s 106 balls, eight mighty fours. Romeo (w)rites: \u201cGeoff Lemon\u2019s observation is why I use a Willow stream rather than a Sky one ( and won\u2019t pay for Sky on Now TV). \u201cOn Willow, you get ads to take out credit and private health insurance, but if you aren\u2019t in the US, you can\u2019t do either and thus it\u2019s safe.\u201d How long will they allow on-line betting ads for? I think they\u2019ll be gone from TV in ten years. I\u2019ve never seen that before! The ball slipped out of Klein\u2019s hand, went looping into the air, Livingstone scampers out of his crease and boom, tennis-slogs the ball over the point boundary. And the umpire gives it as a no ball. Don\u2019t mess with Mr Livingstone today. There\u2019s a distinctive smell that wafts off the Aigburth turf - beer, grass and bacon. The sun has reached my toes. Glamorgan putting on their sensible shoes and batting this out. Billy Root putting his illegal bowling action behind him, 75 not out - Glam 168 for five, just 41 behind. The final Pakistan score - 348 for 8. If England beat it, it will be the highest run-chase in World Cup history. Going back to Paul Edward\u2019s piece on Liverpool cricketers- only ten cricketers either born or bought up in Liverpool have played more than 20 games for Lancashire since 1900. And very very few of them were state educated. Can you name them? Paul\u2019s reasoning: a mixture of things, partly a suspicion of Merseyside generally from Manchester, a suspicion of Lancashire cricket from Merseyside, and the fact there was very strong club cricket in Liverpool but not much in schools. A pied wagtail hops about the pitch in front of me. Ah shame, Tom Banton out for 44 at Guildford after a partnership of 95 with George Bartlett. Tom, I imagine, is willowy and pale, George a pespiring farm hand with hams for hands. I don\u2019t want to look in case that\u2019s not true. Somerset 130/4. This strikes a chime with me, and I think with you. Fed up of trying to tell my kids how the bookies always win in an attempt to stop the brainwashing. A wicket at the bargain basement - Yates b Broad for 24. Warwicks 87 for 2. And a fifty for Alex Lees at Durham, which is good to see. Durham 94/3. I admit, I\u2019d just bent down to pick up my pen, but Vilas has gone. Caught behind for 34, flailing at one, after a couple of powerful drives. Lancashire 128/5, as Abbas beats Croft\u2019s outside edge first ball. Better, second ball, a drive for a couple. Adam Lyth gets his fifty, off 99 balls, against Essex. Tom Kohler-Cadmore, who looked good against Hampshire last week, 6 not out. Bartlett and Banton still having a good go at the Surrey bowlers - Banton has hit nine fours in his 44 not out. A quick lap of the ground at lunch in an attempt to warm-up. Busy round the boundary: tinies and grandads playing kind cricket, old buddies with rounded middles and greying whiskers chatting over lunch and a dad showing his son how to use the seam with the shiny new cherry he\u2019d just bought from the shop. Some smashing looking grass tennis courts at the River End too. Abbas restarts from the River End. ENGLAND V PAKISTAN: PAKISTAN 218-3 off 35 DIVISION ONE Yorkshire v Essex: Yorks 98/2 (Lyth 44 not out) Warwickshire v Nottinghamshire: Warwicks 75/1 Surrey v Somerset: Somerset: 100/3 (Banton 42 not out) DIVISION TWO Lancashire v Leicestershire: Lancs 102/4 (Klein 2-25) Durham v Derbyshire: Durham 68/2 day 2: Northants v Glamorgan: Northants 209 (Rossington 77; de Lange 4-64); Glamorgan 115-4 (Sanderson 4-31) day 2: Middlesex v Sussex: Middlesex 138 (Wiese 5-26); Sussex 252-4 (van Zyl 81 not out; Brown 51; Murtagh 3-41) Yorkshire lose their second wicket - Ballance run out after being sent back by Lyth, and that\u2019s lunch! Scores to follow. The word on Josh Bohannon as requested BTL: Lancs think the seamers will do the job on this wicket, and they need another batsman. There\u2019s a twinkle in Mark Cosgrove\u2019s fielding eye. He looks like cricketers used to look, upholstered in a way that doesn\u2019t involve too much strain. Last over before lunch here, Livingstone and Vilas surviving the penultimate one from Abbas. Just a few more breaths. And at twenty minutes to lunch, the bowling change works and Abbas makes the breakthrough in the first over of his second spell - Jones for 11. Lancashire four down and a nervy turn before sandwiches. It is peculiar how few Liverpool cricketers have gone on to play for Lancashire. Paul Edwards investigated for The Nightwatchman - details to follow as the wind dies briefly. I wish I\u2019d worn two pairs of socks. Abbas back at the River End. Tight bowling from Leicestershire this morning and smart fielding. You wouldn\u2019t guess, at the moment, the 38 point gap between them and Lancs in the Div 2 table. Liam Livingstone looking mighty fine though. A couple of powerful drives in his ten not out and an appreciative crowd in shorts and fleeces. Oh Hass. A regulation slip catch. Head down, right arm flapping forlornly, slender figure\u2019s shoulders slumped, he trudges off the pitch. Lancashire 55/3. Enter Liam Livingstone, off the mark with a four. Cameron Bancroft gone for 18, another for Rampaul at Chester-le-Street. Wonder how he feels, captaining struggling Durham as Warner and Smith bustle out for Australia. I felt like he hadn\u2019t scored many runs so just checked the averages - turns out he\u2019s topping the Durham averages, at 31.67, with one fifty - a highest score of 70. Somerset stutter; losing Trescothick and Hildreth in consecutive overs to Rikki Clarke and Matt Dunn. 39/3. Scorecards blowing everywhere in the press tent, Abbas has been seen off and Dieter Klein, in his first over, demolishes Jake Lehmann\u2019s stumps! He walks off, replaying his stroke. Lancashire 46/2. Adam Lyth and debutant Fraine are galloping away at Headingley against Essex - 43/0 in ten overs. Rhodes out in the battle of the doldrums, Warwicks 33/1, Sibey 11 not out. Tres still there at Guildford, but Abell Morkelled. Somerset 27/1. Bancroft and Lees plodding away in Div 2 - Durham 17/1. Glamorgan, oh, Glamorgan - 29/3 - Billy Root and Hemphrey still there. Ben Sanderson 3-14. And Sussex\u2019s lead at Lords now 62 - Van Zyl 64 not out. An absolutely cracking back foot drive by Lehmann off Abbas - four all the way. Lancashire 36 for one. Emma John\u2019s eye-witness report from the Bangladesh v South Africa game yesterday: What a fillip it would be if the old carthorse could get stuck in at Guildford. Short boundaries, fast pitch, not unusual for balls to get toppled through the trees and into Woodbridge Road. Somerset 20/0 - Trescothick three boundaries in his 14. Another edge through the slips by Hass, as the wind whittles the fielders trousers and Abass looks a tricky beast to tame. A wicket at Chester-le-Street, Ravi Rampaul dismissing Michael Jones for a duck. Durham four for 1. Et tu Marcus? Life in the old dog yet - an upper-cut at Woodbridge Road - and to Morkel\u2019s first ball! A debut too for Essex\u2019s Will Buttleman. Good luck! And here\u2019s that fielding in full. Poor Keaton left splayed on the grass: And with that Hameed edges Abass through the slips. Will Fraine is making his first-class debut for Yorkshire. And oh my gosh, an astonishing bit of fielding at short leg by Hasan Azad to the third ball of the day after Keaton Jennings just tipped the ball to him, he snapped it up and threw down the stumps with Jennings just out his crease. Lancashire 0/1. It\u2019s an uncontested toss here and Keaton Jennings and Haseeb Hameed get the, er, early pleasure of Abbas under cloudy skies. Lancashire\u2019s last victory here was in golden 2011, their last game before the Taunton triumph, since then they haven\u2019t won in eight first-class games at Aighburth. The diddy green stands, wheeled straight outta of Trumpton, are slowly filling and there\u2019s a good queue for the breakfast barms - \u00a33 for the salivating. Today it\u2019s Aigburth - where the camellias have faded but the flags are still flying from Saturday\u2019s triumph. The sun is in, and sometimes out, and I\u2019m concerned I\u2019ve come underdressed, as Cricinfo\u2019s Paul Edwards is in an anorak, scarf and flat cap, and Lancashire\u2019s Ken Grime has a bobble cap in his laptop bag. The wind off the Mersey can apparently be quite tasty. Here, at Aighburth\u2019s 200th first-class game, top-of-Division-Two Lancashire play eighth-place Leicestershire - beware Mohammad Abbas. About the counties, it\u2019s another uneven round so two games are already underway \u2013 Northampton v Glamorgan at a verdant County Ground and Middlesex v Sussex at Lord\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t a good day for the sides batting first \u2013 Middlesex were skittled for 138, where at least one South African was smiling, David Wiese walking off with five for 26. Sussex already have a 31- run lead with six wickets in hand. Northants were held together by Adam Rossington\u2019s 77 \u2013 all out for 209, Glamorgan 5/0 in reply. Otherwise: Surrey play Somerset at lovely Guildford, Warwickshire play Nottingham in an intriguing battle of the faded giants and Yorkshire take on Essex at Headingley. In Division Two, Durham entertain Derbyshire. World-Cup wise, after that thrilling match where Bangladesh upset the South African apple cart yesterday at The Oval, England play Pakistan today \u2013 on the pitch where they scored 481 for six against Australia last year. Mark Wood is expected to pull on his bowling boots. Follow the bounce-fest with the knock-me-down-fabulous duo of Tim de Lisle and Rob Smyth here. But for the thread beneath the cloth of gold, do pop in below the line. All refugees from the World Cup welcome, at lunch-breaks or whenever the diet of easy wins gets a little dull.",

      "body": "<p>On the night before we were due to meet, Andy Woodward took himself away to spend some time alone. He wasn\u2019t feeling great, was the truth. He wanted to find a bit of peace and he wanted to be in a place where he could remember a time in his life when everything felt so much more innocent.</p> <p>His old primary school was pulled down a few years ago to make way for a housing estate. But the playing fields are still in use and it was here, as a 10-year-old, that he remembers bringing the ball out of defence, playing for his first junior football team, and trying a shot from the halfway line. The ball flew into the top corner and his father, Terry, ran on the pitch to give him a hug. And now, more than 35 years on, something drew Andy back to that same spot. He found a place to sit under a tree and stayed there for longer than he could even remember, lost in his own thoughts.</p> <p>When he turns up for lunch the next day his mother, Jean, drops him off. We have a hug and he tells me he is OK. And he is, I hope \u2013 at least, as far as can be expected when you stop to think about the reasons why he lives with post-traumatic stress disorder. On the surface, he seems OK-ish. It is what goes on beneath the surface, in common with all Barry Bennell\u2019s victims, that worries me.</p> <p>Andy has his own analogy for it. \u201cIt\u2019s like being chained to a wolf. Every day, I\u2019m chained to this huge, terrifying beast. It never leaves me. Sometimes you might feel like you have tamed it, that you have got it under control and everything\u2019s fine. But you\u2019re kidding yourself. Then something happens and it\u2019s baring its teeth again. And when it bites you, it bites you hard.\u201d</p> <p>At the last count, Operation Hydrant, the specialist police unit investigating the sexual abuse of children in football, had received 2,807 referrals since Andy waived his anonymity, in November 2016, to detail his shattering experiences as a boy in Crewe Alexandra\u2019s youth system and set off what the Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, has described as a \u201ctidal wave\u201d.</p> <p>Clarke called it the biggest crisis in the history of the sport and the police statistics are mind-boggling: 300 suspects identified, 849 victims and 340 clubs named. Except those figures have not been updated since March 2018 and will be much higher now. Bennell, as a direct result, is serving a 31-year prison sentence with the possibility of another criminal trial next year for the man described by a judge as \u201cthe devil incarnate\u201d. As of January 2018, at least 97 others had reported him on the back of Andy\u2019s interview \u2013 though, again, that number is likely to be substantially higher now.</p> <p>Without Andy, none of this would have happened and Bennell, in theory, would still be living in Milton Keynes, going by the name of Richard Jones and working locally as a laptop repairer. Yet it goes wider than that. Almost every time another of football\u2019s paedophiles appears in court \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/23/football-coach-bob-higgins-guilty-of-45-counts-of-indecent-assault\">Bob Higgins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/04/paedophile-football-coach-george-ormond-jailed-for-20-years\">George Ormond</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/20/manchester-city-investigate-sex-abuser-links-william-toner-barry-bennell\">William Toner</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/13/ex-celtic-youth-coach-jim-mccafferty-jailed-admitting-sexual-assault\">Jim McCafferty</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/05/ex-football-coach-jailed-for-abusing-three-boys-in-1980s-and-90s\">James Torbett</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-46785576\">Gerald King</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-47157008\">Frank Cairney</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-46881678\">Norman Shaw</a> and on and on \u2013 Andy\u2019s story has been cited as the reason why victims were emboldened to come forward.

As a boy, Andy was raped more times than he can possibly remember, but certainly in the hundreds. Terry, who had motor neurone disease, died last August. Jean, a tremendously stoic woman, has been fighting cancer. Bennell \u2013 cynical, controlling and predatory - had become part of the Woodward family, marrying Andy\u2019s sister, before his luck ran out. It is a struggle for Andy and all the family sometimes. Of course it is.</p> <p>Plus there is another element to this story that, until now, we deliberately held back. A secret that goes back to the day we met in 2016 when he told me what had happened to his aunt, Lynda, and we decided it was better, at that time, to keep it out of print. Mostly to spare his mum any more anguish when Andy\u2019s interview was already going to be seismic enough. But also because it was not the sort of thing that could be squashed into a couple of paragraphs in a much wider piece.</p> <p>Lynda was 22, Jean\u2019s older sister, when she went out one Friday night in 1970 to the Princess hotel in Fallowfield, south Manchester. She was also seven months pregnant and when she missed the bus she and a friend decided to walk home, saying goodbye on Kingsway, a dual-carriageway running in and out of the city. \u201cLynda\u2019s body was discovered the next morning in the garden of number 285,\u201d Andy takes up the story. \u201cShe\u2019d been dragged through a hedge, raped, bitten and then beaten to death. She was just a few minutes\u2019 walk from home.\u201d</p> <p>Andy was born three years later and, growing up, he says the murder was never spoken about. \u201cIt was something awful to be buried, kept out of sight. Mum used to break down sometimes when we were kids: shaking and crying, Dad holding her tight. But it was only later I found out those tears were for her sister.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f29c04b13e320d6e1c6059cf39e30537378457a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f29c04b13e320d6e1c6059cf39e30537378457a1/0_0_286_1487/192.jpg\" alt=\"The Guardian\u2019s report of the sentencing of Ronald Bennell for the murder of Andy Woodward\u2019s aunt.\" width=\"192\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian\u2019s report of the sentencing of Ronald Bennell for the murder of Andy Woodward\u2019s aunt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He can understand now why his mum found it easier to cope by not talking about it, and why the police called it one of the most shocking murders they had ever dealt with. \u201cIt was so violent and it seemed like there was no explanation for it. It was random and unbelievably savage. An unborn baby died that night, too. It was a completely unprovoked, opportunist attack. The guy was a psychopath, no question.\u201d</p> <p>The killer left a ring at the scene, engraved with his name, and the police matched up the bootprints and teeth-marks. His name was Ronald Bennell, an 18-year-old apprentice engineer who was sentenced to life in prison but got out after 12 years and, in 1989, murdered again. The victim that time was a mum-of-three, Pamela Noone, 42, walking through the park under the Seven Arches viaduct in Bramhall, near Stockport. He raped her as well. He was arrested and, a few weeks later, he hanged himself on remand at Strangeways.</p> <p>By then, Andy was 16 and still being abused at the football club where various first-teamers called him \u201cBarry\u2019s bum-boy\u201d, opposition players referred to Crewe as the \u201cpaedo club\u201d and he says the manager, Dario Gradi, once walked in on him, aged 13, sitting on the knee of the youth-team coach, without apparently thinking it necessary to ask what was going on.</p> <p>That, however, tells only part of the story. Andy\u2019s older sister, Lynda \u2013 named after their aunt \u2013 had been dating his abuser for the previous two years. The wedding took place in 1991 and Andy had to go through the hellish ordeal of seeing the man who had exploited, controlled and abused him for years becoming his brother-in-law.</p> <p>Photographs from the day show the church filled with Bennell\u2019s young victims, all living their own secrets. Andy, I note, is not smiling on any of the pictures. Bennell is though. \u201cI remember him grinning at me when he walked down the aisle to say his vows with my sister. He had it all \u2026 and here he was, getting away with it. Celebrating a wedding? For him, it was a celebration of his power over everyone there.\u201d</p> <p>It was 1994 when the truth emerged and Bennell was sent to prison for seven years for raping a 13-year-old boy on a tour to Florida. What nobody had ever done was make the connection between the two men \u2013 one dead, another in prison \u2013 who had shattered Andy\u2019s family and the fact they had the same surnames. Until, that is, the police pieced it all together. And this, I suppose, is possibly the most shocking part of this entire story. Barry Bennell and Ronald Bennell were cousins, separated by two years. One a cold-blooded murderer, the other described by the police among the worst paedophiles, numbers-wise, in UK criminal history.</p> <p>\u201c[Barry] Bennell would have known what his cousin did, I\u2019m 100% sure,\u201d Andy says, and for the first time there is a crack of emotion in his voice. \u201cI can only think he took some kind of twisted pleasure out of it: knowing what we didn\u2019t.

      "bodyText": "On the night before we were due to meet, Andy Woodward took himself away to spend some time alone. He wasn\u2019t feeling great, was the truth. He wanted to find a bit of peace and he wanted to be in a place where he could remember a time in his life when everything felt so much more innocent. His old primary school was pulled down a few years ago to make way for a housing estate. But the playing fields are still in use and it was here, as a 10-year-old, that he remembers bringing the ball out of defence, playing for his first junior football team, and trying a shot from the halfway line. The ball flew into the top corner and his father, Terry, ran on the pitch to give him a hug. And now, more than 35 years on, something drew Andy back to that same spot. He found a place to sit under a tree and stayed there for longer than he could even remember, lost in his own thoughts. When he turns up for lunch the next day his mother, Jean, drops him off. We have a hug and he tells me he is OK. And he is, I hope \u2013 at least, as far as can be expected when you stop to think about the reasons why he lives with post-traumatic stress disorder. On the surface, he seems OK-ish. It is what goes on beneath the surface, in common with all Barry Bennell\u2019s victims, that worries me. Andy has his own analogy for it. \u201cIt\u2019s like being chained to a wolf. Every day, I\u2019m chained to this huge, terrifying beast. It never leaves me. Sometimes you might feel like you have tamed it, that you have got it under control and everything\u2019s fine. But you\u2019re kidding yourself. Then something happens and it\u2019s baring its teeth again. And when it bites you, it bites you hard.\u201d At the last count, Operation Hydrant, the specialist police unit investigating the sexual abuse of children in football, had received 2,807 referrals since Andy waived his anonymity, in November 2016, to detail his shattering experiences as a boy in Crewe Alexandra\u2019s youth system and set off what the Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, has described as a \u201ctidal wave\u201d. Clarke called it the biggest crisis in the history of the sport and the police statistics are mind-boggling: 300 suspects identified, 849 victims and 340 clubs named. Except those figures have not been updated since March 2018 and will be much higher now. Bennell, as a direct result, is serving a 31-year prison sentence with the possibility of another criminal trial next year for the man described by a judge as \u201cthe devil incarnate\u201d. As of January 2018, at least 97 others had reported him on the back of Andy\u2019s interview \u2013 though, again, that number is likely to be substantially higher now. Without Andy, none of this would have happened and Bennell, in theory, would still be living in Milton Keynes, going by the name of Richard Jones and working locally as a laptop repairer. Yet it goes wider than that. Almost every time another of football\u2019s paedophiles appears in court \u2013 Bob Higgins, George Ormond, William Toner, Jim McCafferty, James Torbett, Gerald King, Frank Cairney, Norman Shaw and on and on \u2013 Andy\u2019s story has been cited as the reason why victims were emboldened to come forward. Plus it has gone viral now: other footballers or former footballers speaking about their own ordeals and triggering movements in Australia, Brazil, Germany, the Netherlands and many other countries. All of it comes back to the man sitting in front of me for this interview. That doesn\u2019t change the fact, however, that every day is a battle, or that it is not the life he, or anybody, would have wanted. As a boy, Andy was raped more times than he can possibly remember, but certainly in the hundreds. Terry, who had motor neurone disease, died last August. Jean, a tremendously stoic woman, has been fighting cancer. Bennell \u2013 cynical, controlling and predatory - had become part of the Woodward family, marrying Andy\u2019s sister, before his luck ran out. It is a struggle for Andy and all the family sometimes. Of course it is. Plus there is another element to this story that, until now, we deliberately held back. A secret that goes back to the day we met in 2016 when he told me what had happened to his aunt, Lynda, and we decided it was better, at that time, to keep it out of print. Mostly to spare his mum any more anguish when Andy\u2019s interview was already going to be seismic enough. But also because it was not the sort of thing that could be squashed into a couple of paragraphs in a much wider piece. Lynda was 22, Jean\u2019s older sister, when she went out one Friday night in 1970 to the Princess hotel in Fallowfield, south Manchester. She was also seven months pregnant and when she missed the bus she and a friend decided to walk home, saying goodbye on Kingsway, a dual-carriageway running in and out of the city. \u201cLynda\u2019s body was discovered the next morning in the garden of number 285,\u201d Andy takes up the story. \u201cShe\u2019d been dragged through a hedge, raped, bitten and then beaten to death. She was just a few minutes\u2019 walk from home.\u201d Andy was born three years later and, growing up, he says the murder was never spoken about. \u201cIt was something awful to be buried, kept out of sight. Mum used to break down sometimes when we were kids: shaking and crying, Dad holding her tight. But it was only later I found out those tears were for her sister.\u201d He can understand now why his mum found it easier to cope by not talking about it, and why the police called it one of the most shocking murders they had ever dealt with. \u201cIt was so violent and it seemed like there was no explanation for it. It was random and unbelievably savage. An unborn baby died that night, too. It was a completely unprovoked, opportunist attack. The guy was a psychopath, no question.\u201d The killer left a ring at the scene, engraved with his name, and the police matched up the bootprints and teeth-marks. His name was Ronald Bennell, an 18-year-old apprentice engineer who was sentenced to life in prison but got out after 12 years and, in 1989, murdered again. The victim that time was a mum-of-three, Pamela Noone, 42, walking through the park under the Seven Arches viaduct in Bramhall, near Stockport. He raped her as well. He was arrested and, a few weeks later, he hanged himself on remand at Strangeways. By then, Andy was 16 and still being abused at the football club where various first-teamers called him \u201cBarry\u2019s bum-boy\u201d, opposition players referred to Crewe as the \u201cpaedo club\u201d and he says the manager, Dario Gradi, once walked in on him, aged 13, sitting on the knee of the youth-team coach, without apparently thinking it necessary to ask what was going on. That, however, tells only part of the story. Andy\u2019s older sister, Lynda \u2013 named after their aunt \u2013 had been dating his abuser for the previous two years. The wedding took place in 1991 and Andy had to go through the hellish ordeal of seeing the man who had exploited, controlled and abused him for years becoming his brother-in-law. Photographs from the day show the church filled with Bennell\u2019s young victims, all living their own secrets. Andy, I note, is not smiling on any of the pictures. Bennell is though. \u201cI remember him grinning at me when he walked down the aisle to say his vows with my sister. He had it all \u2026 and here he was, getting away with it. Celebrating a wedding? For him, it was a celebration of his power over everyone there.\u201d It was 1994 when the truth emerged and Bennell was sent to prison for seven years for raping a 13-year-old boy on a tour to Florida. What nobody had ever done was make the connection between the two men \u2013 one dead, another in prison \u2013 who had shattered Andy\u2019s family and the fact they had the same surnames. Until, that is, the police pieced it all together. And this, I suppose, is possibly the most shocking part of this entire story. Barry Bennell and Ronald Bennell were cousins, separated by two years. One a cold-blooded murderer, the other described by the police among the worst paedophiles, numbers-wise, in UK criminal history. \u201c[Barry] Bennell would have known what his cousin did, I\u2019m 100% sure,\u201d Andy says, and for the first time there is a crack of emotion in his voice. \u201cI can only think he took some kind of twisted pleasure out of it: knowing what we didn\u2019t. He even took me to where his cousin lived, visiting his auntie and uncle \u2013 Ronald\u2019s mum and dad. There was a picture on the wall of a young man with dark hair and I remember this old couple kept referring to \u2018Ronnie\u2019. I didn\u2019t know who he was, or why he wasn\u2019t there. But I know now that the face on the wall was Ronald Bennell.\u201d The story is told in full in the autobiography, Position of Trust, that Andy brings out on Thursday, and the book is certainly an eye-opener for anyone who might have presumed his life had dramatically changed for the better since he, a former pro at Crewe, Bury and Sheffield United, sat down with me for the first time, two and a half years ago, and asked for the Guardian\u2019s help to persuade others to speak out. True, there is immense satisfaction about the number of people he has helped and, recalling some of the conversations with other abuse victims, the lives he may have saved. He will always be grateful for the kindness he has been shown. But the emotional damage is catastrophic and will never go away. Plus he has experienced the worst of the social-media era and, in some cases, it has been downright sinister. The time, for example, he checked his Twitter account a few days after going public and there was a message from an account using Bennell\u2019s name and photograph. \u201cHi Andy. Am feeling horny. Fancy popping round mine?\u201d it read, attached to a clip of a man sucking a lollipop. It turned out it was some troll from Crewe who ended up in court and, together with his dad, got sent down for perverting the course of justice. But Andy wasn\u2019t to know that at the time. \u201cBennell hadn\u2019t been locked up by that stage. As far as I knew, that was him coming after me. I could feel the panic rising through my body. I just dropped to the floor. Even the possibility it was him tipped me over the edge.\u201d Another time, Andy looked through his friend requests on Facebook and found one from Richard Barry, another of Bennell\u2019s aliases. \u201cWhat did he want from me? Did he really think we could be friends? Or was there some other sinister reason? I guess I will never know. How do you read a mind that twisted, anyway?

      "bodyText": "An attempt to extradite Julian Assange to Sweden has suffered a setback after a court in Uppsala said he did not need to be detained. The ruling by the district court prevents Swedish prosecutors from applying immediately for an extradition warrant for Assange to face an allegation of rape dating back to 2010. Assange denies the accusation. Assange is serving a 50-week sentence in Britain for skipping bail after he spent seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy in London attempting to avoid extradition to Sweden. Swedish prosecutors dropped their rape investigation in 2017 but reopened it after Ecuador rescinded its grant of asylum to Assange in April this year and allowed British police to arrest him. The 47-year-old Australian was too ill to appear last week at the latest hearing at Westminster magistrates court in relation to a rival US extradition request. US government lawyers are seeking his removal to the US where he is charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, which carries a maximum penalty of five years. He also faces additional charges of violating the Espionage Act by publishing classified information through WikiLeaks. If both Sweden and the US present competing extradition requests, it will be up to the UK home secretary, Sajid Javid, to decide which application takes priority. At the Swedish court on Monday, a judgment was read out saying that since Assange was already in a British prison he did not need to be formally detained to be questioned by Swedish prosecutors. \u201cAs Julian Assange is currently serving a prison sentence, the investigation can proceed with the help of a European investigation order, which does not require Julian Assange\u2019s detention (in Sweden). The court therefore does not find it proportional to detain Julian Assange,\u201d the judgment said. Assange\u2019s Swedish defence lawyer, Per Samuelson, argued that Assange\u2019s imprisonment in Britain meant there was no flight risk. \u201cHe is in prison for half a year at least, and he is detained on behalf of the United States.

Cleverly, a Brexit minister who is running a campaign as a new generation candidate, said the Conservative membership needed to be given \u201cthe chance to be gutsy\u201d and warned against \u201crushing\u201d the contest. \u201cThis is a real opportunity for us to properly test ideas and people and we are looking for somebody who will not only deliver Brexit but be leader of the party for years into the future and has to reach out to a lot of voters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to win the next general election and I think rushing it could be counterproductive. Investing maybe an extra five days in the process to make sure we get it right for the next five years is time well spent.\u201d One supporter of an outsider candidate said they believed some on the 1922 Committee were trying to rig the rules in favour of Johnson, arguing it was highly unfair on some hopefuls to change the rules before any hustings had taken place to let them demonstrate their potential. But one of the leading candidates said it made sense to knock out the \u201cminnows\u201d in the race and concentrate on those who had a chance of winning. Supporters of Johnson increasingly believe the race is likely to head for a \u201cpsychodrama\u201d of a run-off between their candidate and Michael Gove, who knocked him out of the race in 2016. However, those around Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab, Sajid Javid and Matt Hancock all insist they are in with a chance of prevailing, with about 150 Conservative MPs still to say who they are backing. In Johnson\u2019s video, released on Monday morning, he meets voters and promises one former Conservative voter that he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October, deal or no deal. The video expresses support for increased education funding and police numbers and shows Johnson agreeing with a voter on the need for more stop and search. The launch was not entirely without a hitch. Johnson was criticised for claiming that crime in London went down 20% while he was mayor. The Liberal Democrats pointed to official government figures suggesting police-recorded crime in London fell by 15% from 2007-08 to 2015-16. Ed Davey, a Lib Dem leadership candidate, said: \u201cFor Johnson to kick off his leadership campaign with a lie is at least very on-brand.\u201d Liz Truss, the former chief secretary to the Treasury, who had been considering a run at the leadership herself, was the first of the current cabinet to endorse Johnson over the weekend. It is believed unlikely that Johnson will secure the backing of the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd \u2013 a joint ticket that had been nicknamed \u201cBamber\u201d \u2013 because of Rudd\u2019s discomfort at serving in a cabinet that could pursue a no-deal Brexit. Other prominent names backing Johnson include the chair of the European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former defence secretary Gavin Williamson and the backbencher Zac Goldsmith. \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 4 June 2019 to reflect updated content.",

They had to dispose of it on their own property.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe kids were playing in the kitchen and mum is there with the dimethoate, dipping the bananas or pawpaws. They said, \u2018If we can\u2019t do this, we can\u2019t send our fruit away, then we can\u2019t get any money and we\u2019ll be broke.\u2019</p> \n<p>\u201cThey had no alternative. I said, \u2018At least wear gloves. Don\u2019t go dipping your hands in the stuff. Don\u2019t go dumping it in pits near the house.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Cunningham recalls workers getting sick and walking off the job, residents near the fumigation chambers being poisoned by clouds of gas. In her files are letters from workers expressing their concerns. One man, Brian Warn, a father of threee from Bilyana, told the ABC in 1996<strong> </strong>he had been poisoned by fumes from a nearby fumigation chamber.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4e2fc011-34c6-4c84-971a-b22cc48307c8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SgqwuBsTi-k?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In another letter, a 23-year-old woman, V Eller, talks about \u201cgetting severe headaches, to the point of convulsions\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I have expressed this concern to doctors, I have been told the chemicals aren\u2019t dangerous and they use them themselves in their gardens,\u201d she wrote.</p> \n<p>With farms facing ruin and livelihoods at stake, Cunningham says her concerns about chemicals were often unwelcome. She recalls being thrown out of a fruit packing shed during a meeting of growers and farmworkers near Tully after she attempted to speak.</p> \n<p>\u201cI stood up to speak and \u2026 two heavies moved over and picked me up, one under each arm, and carried me out of the shed,\u201d she remembers.</p> \n<p>Cunningham, who was later appointed to a government health liaison committee, says the DPI wouldn\u2019t consider alternatives to chemicals: \u201cThe politicians were standing up in parliament saying these chemicals are safe.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019d already bought the chemicals. So they had this huge stockpile of chemicals and they had to use it. They ordered the chemicals right at the outset, at day one.\u201d </p> \n<h2>Compensation rejected</h2> \n<p>In a 2015 report the Cancer Council highlighted the difficulties in obtaining compensation for chronic occupational illnesses, in which symptoms often manifest years or decades later. The report estimated that <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org.au/content/pdf/News/MediaReleases/2015/web%20%20Occupational%20report.pdf\">92 out of 100 people who contract occupational-derived cancers do not receive any sort of workers\u2019 compensation</a>.</p> \n<p>The report concluded there were \u201cinherent difficulties in assigning a specific case to an occupational cause\u201d.</p> \n<p>In Sharman\u2019s case, WorkCover Queensland has accepted he was exposed to EDB for a nine-month period \u2013 including after it was banned.

      "bodyText": "Robert Paul Sharman remembers how the smell of the gas would linger. Outside the fumigation chambers it hung around, bonded to the tropical north Queensland air, amid the hottest November on record. When Sharman went home, and nursed his baby son to sleep, the odour of the gas was still there. \u201cIt would stick around on my clothes when I\u2019d go home at night,\u201d Sharman recalls. \u201cA garlicky sort of smell. A specific smell, I\u2019ve never smelled it before or since [but] it\u2019s a smell you wouldn\u2019t forget.\u201d Sharman was unemployed in October 1995, when he heard about the discovery of the papaya fruit fly (Bactrocera papayae) in north Queensland and offered to help out. Within days he was on the government payroll, working in a makeshift fumigation tent near Innisfail, disinfesting fruit with ethylene dibromide (EDB). The fumigation chambers were converted PVC tents that routinely leaked. They had no exhaust vents. In the corner, sitting on an old milk crate, was an aluminium electric frypan. \u201cThe sort you use to cook your roast chook on a Sunday,\u201d Sharman says. \u201cYou\u2019d be handed the chemical \u2026 in a five-litre plastic container, unlabelled, like water. We used to pour \u2026 an amount into a beaker, pour it into a frypan and let it boil off. \u201cWe wore shorts and T-shirts. We were told, \u2018Just don\u2019t spill it on yourself, on your skin. Don\u2019t worry about breathing it, breathing it won\u2019t hurt you.\u2019\u201d When Sharman speaks, his racing thoughts escape like mismatched puzzle pieces. He is easily frustrated when others don\u2019t seem to understand how they join together. He\u2019s used to being misunderstood and disbelieved. Three years ago Sharman was sent to a mental health facility for a month, diagnosed with delusional disorder, after claiming he had been poisoned by EDB. But he is not delusional. His psychologist, Marged Goode, describes him as someone who was \u201cfunctioning fairly effectively before the chemical contamination and has been dysfunctional since\u201d. Sharman describes it as \u201cjust 20 years of confusion, torment\u201d. He has been diagnosed with a long list of chronic conditions that he says contributed to the breakdown of his marriage and left him unable to work. The occupational medicine specialist Bruce Hocking says there is \u201cgood evidence\u201d that some of Sharman\u2019s conditions were caused by overexposure to EDB. Authorities have known about the effects of the highly toxic chemical \u2013 a known carcinogen with properties similar to mustard gas, capable of mutating DNA \u2013 for more than 40 years. In Australia, moves to ban EDB as a fumigant started in 1984. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws show the Queensland department of primary industries (DPI) was warned bluntly \u2013 about seven months before Sharman was last exposed \u2013 about significant health and safety concerns related to the EDB fumigation chambers. Sharman\u2019s work and medical records indicate his exposure continued for six months after licensing authorities withdrew permits for EDB. \u201cNone of that information ever filtered through to us,\u201d Sharman says. \u201cWe were just out in the field just working in the tent.\u201d \u201cImagine finding this out 22 years later and that it was all hidden, that they knew all about it. Not only that, they were there and showed us how to use it. These are professional people in their fields. With prior knowledge, how could you do that? \u201cOf course I\u2019m devastated about myself and my own family, coming home every day and poisoning my family, I really have no words for it. Heinous in nature. It was state-sanctioned poisoning.\u201d Chemical warfare On 17 October 1995 a farmer near Cairns found fruit fly maggots under the skin of a pawpaw. Within days, the papaya fruit fly, an exotic species likely to have come from the Papua New Guinea highlands and the Torres Strait, had been detected as far south as Bingil Bay, and inland at Mareeba. The response to the outbreak was necessarily aggressive, given the existential threat to agricultural industries in the wet tropics. Workers called themselves \u201cfruit fly fighters\u201d and the offensive \u2013 implemented by north Queensland DPI managers who sidelined the department\u2019s own fruit fly scientists \u2013 relied on the indiscriminate use of pesticides. Extraordinary quantities of chemicals were used. Documents obtained under FoI show 80,000L and 114,000kg of EDB were purchased in Australia in 1995. Huge amounts of malathion, methyl bromide, fenthion and dimethoate, which were all used as pesticides, were also brought into the country. The DPI was granted several \u201coff-label\u201d permits for the emergency use of certain chemicals, which would allow them to be used in unconventional ways. On 9 November 1995, the then Queensland premier, Wayne Goss, met fruit growers in Cairns to address concerns about the chemicals, mainly because some international and domestic markets \u2013 including Japan, New Zealand and the Australian Capital Territory \u2013 had refused to accept produce that had been treated with pesticides after being harvested. It later emerged more than 10,000 pallets of fruit had to be dumped, after reaching markets with damage caused by fumigation. The front page of the following day\u2019s Cairns Post quoted Goss speaking about \u201cunnecessary fears\u201d regarding the use of chemicals, and saying there was \u201cno health risk\u201d. Goss did acknowledge the chemicals could be dangerous to workers \u201cif safety precautions were not adhered to\u201d. In those first few weeks, workers began to show signs of acute exposure. Sharman\u2019s medical records show that on 10 and 22 November he saw his local GP, who logged his overexposure with the tropical health unit. The doctor\u2019s notes record: \u201cheadaches, giddy, sleepy\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was happening,\u201d Sharman says. \u201cAll my skin was burned, I was all burned up inside my shorts, in my genital area, on the inside of my elbows and the back of my knees. I\u2019d worked out in the sun before ... but I\u2019d never been burned in those places before.\u201d \u2018Soaked in chemical\u2019 Mark Trinca was a health nut. He ran a nutrition business with his wife and cycled up to 1,000km a week. In 2011, while riding, he noticed a lump in his groin. The diagnosis was Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, his first bout of aggressive cancer. Trinca recalls: \u201cI just looked at the doctor and my question to him was, \u2018How the hell did I get this? I do everything right.\u2019\u201d The doctor responded with a question of his own. \u201cDo you work in agriculture?\u201d Trinca had spent six years \u2013 from 1997 to 2003 \u2013 working for the DPI and most of that time \u201csoaked in chemical\u201d; manufacturing canite blocks doused in the organophosphate malathion, installing the blocks and using pesticide sprays. He says he went years without being monitored for symptoms of exposure. Trinca was shown chemical procedures by veterans of the papaya fruit fly program. They told him \u201cto blanket the whole place \u2026 to put as much chemical out as we can, and that way, we\u2019re going to eradicate it fast and hard\u201d. By 2002, Trinca\u2019s work diaries show he would regularly get sick when he came back from extended periods in the Torres Strait, where he worked on Northwatch, a successor to the fruit fly eradication program. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t flu-like symptoms. I was getting nauseous. It was quite an interesting feeling where it was a deep fatigue. I can only explain it as a deep bone fatigue.\u201d Last year Trinca underwent an operation for a liposarcoma, his second rare cancer. Doctors say if it returns \u2013 and there is a high chance it will \u2013 there will be nothing more they can do. \u201cI really can\u2019t see a reason,\u201d Trinca says. \u201cI did the right thing for the right people. I worked my arse off for the government. I followed the procedures, I did everything that I was supposed to. \u201cI\u2019m probably one of those people who can show from a lifestyle point of view there was no other risk factors. I had two \u2026 extremely high-grade cancers. The research links both of them to pesticide and herbicide exposure. Doctors who I\u2019ve spoken to say there\u2019s no doubt that\u2019s what it is. But I can\u2019t get anyone to put it in writing.\u201d Cowboys and guinea pigs Elizabeth Bors was working at a local market in Mareeba in late 1995 when she applied for a job on the eradication campaign. She worked mainly with malathion, used in efforts to attract and kill the male papaya fruit fly, installing blocks soaked in the chemical and spraying it on to crops around the Atherton Tablelands community. \u201cI recall being told by a DPI representative that there was no real data on the handling and use of the chemicals and that we were guinea pigs,\u201d Bors said in a signed statement to the Queensland supreme court in 2006. The statement, made in a civil case about damaged coffee crops, detailed a common complaint about the program\u2019s operation; a lack of informed consent from people instructed to work with chemicals. Bors said many were otherwise long-term unemployed, thankful for the steady work and reluctant to ask questions. \u201cI recall being told the names of the chemicals we were using but was not given any real data on them,\u201d Bors said in her statement. Bors said DPI managers had been \u201ctight\u201d with expenditure and did not provide proper protective equipment. She said workers had been told to reuse rubber gloves and had to \u201cfight to get supplies, like soap and other necessities\u201d. One former DPI manager tells Guardian Australia he was aware of claims made by workers for compensation owing to chemical exposure. He said he would have opposed any such claims. \u201cThey were slackers, they knew it was coming to an end, the money was coming to an end and they tried everything they possibly could to keep that going,\u201d the former manager says. \u201cI bought protective equipment and everything myself, on my credit card for the government and it was available. If they didn\u2019t use it, then we know who is to blame for that.\u201d \u2018We\u2019ll be broke\u2019 In the far north, between the beach and the rainforest, between the bustling tourist towns and the snaking hinterland roads, is some of Australia\u2019s most productive farmland for cane and tropical fruit. \u201cChemicals have always been part and parcel of farming in this part of the world,\u201d says Yvonne Cunningham, a long-term Innisfail resident and environmentalist, who has been a local critic of agricultural chemical practices since the 1970s. After the papaya fruit fly outbreak, farm workers began to contact Cunningham to raise the alarm about the required pesticide treatments, and she began to advocate on their behalf. \u201cPeople were told they had to dip their fruit in this organochlorine, dimethoate, and they had no protective clothing,\u201d she says. \u201cThey had big vats of this chemical. They had to dispose of it on their own property. \u201cThe kids were playing in the kitchen and mum is there with the dimethoate, dipping the bananas or pawpaws. They said, \u2018If we can\u2019t do this, we can\u2019t send our fruit away, then we can\u2019t get any money and we\u2019ll be broke.\u2019 \u201cThey had no alternative. I said, \u2018At least wear gloves. Don\u2019t go dipping your hands in the stuff. Don\u2019t go dumping it in pits near the house.\u2019\u201d Cunningham recalls workers getting sick and walking off the job, residents near the fumigation chambers being poisoned by clouds of gas. In her files are letters from workers expressing their concerns. One man, Brian Warn, a father of threee from Bilyana, told the ABC in 1996 he had been poisoned by fumes from a nearby fumigation chamber. In another letter, a 23-year-old woman, V Eller, talks about \u201cgetting severe headaches, to the point of convulsions\u201d. \u201cWhen I have expressed this concern to doctors, I have been told the chemicals aren\u2019t dangerous and they use them themselves in their gardens,\u201d she wrote. With farms facing ruin and livelihoods at stake, Cunningham says her concerns about chemicals were often unwelcome. She recalls being thrown out of a fruit packing shed during a meeting of growers and farmworkers near Tully after she attempted to speak. \u201cI stood up to speak and \u2026 two heavies moved over and picked me up, one under each arm, and carried me out of the shed,\u201d she remembers. Cunningham, who was later appointed to a government health liaison committee, says the DPI wouldn\u2019t consider alternatives to chemicals: \u201cThe politicians were standing up in parliament saying these chemicals are safe. \u201cThey\u2019d already bought the chemicals. So they had this huge stockpile of chemicals and they had to use it. They ordered the chemicals right at the outset, at day one.\u201d Compensation rejected In a 2015 report the Cancer Council highlighted the difficulties in obtaining compensation for chronic occupational illnesses, in which symptoms often manifest years or decades later. The report estimated that 92 out of 100 people who contract occupational-derived cancers do not receive any sort of workers\u2019 compensation. The report concluded there were \u201cinherent difficulties in assigning a specific case to an occupational cause\u201d. In Sharman\u2019s case, WorkCover Queensland has accepted he was exposed to EDB for a nine-month period \u2013 including after it was banned. WorkCover accepts medical evidence that Sharman has suffered from multiple medical conditions, including two cancer precursor conditions, diseases affecting his lungs and teeth, skin conditions, migraines and various psychiatric illnesses. Sharman now has three separate medical opinions \u2013 from a pathologist, a psychologist and an occupational doctor \u2013 which say his symptoms may have been caused by exposure to EDB. Dr Bruce Hocking, a leading occupational medical specialist, says it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that some conditions were the result of overexposure. But WorkCover has twice rejected Sharman\u2019s compensation claim. Most recently, he was told \u201cthe available medical evidence\u201d does not prove that the conditions were the result of his employment with the DPI. In an email to Sharman last year, the pathologist Charles Appleton, the head of biochemistry at QML Pathology, wrote that \u201ccausality is difficult to establish\u201d. \u201cThe fact is that EDB can cause [these conditions] and you have been exposed to EDB and you have so many of them \u2026 it can be argued that the whole picture suggests abnormal toxic exposure.\u201d The DPI no longer exists. Its modern iteration, Queensland\u2019s Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, said it had difficulty commenting about past practices given the amount of time that had passed, the fact many of the staff concerned had since retired, and that some records relating to the papaya fruit fly program had been destroyed in Cyclone Yasi in 2011. The new asbestos Many in the agricultural industry are watching developments in the US, where a groundbreaking civil ruling against the chemical company Monsanto, in relation to the commonly used weedkiller glyphosate (Roundup) has prompted a string of litigation relating to agricultural chemicals. Pesticides and herbicides have been called \u201cthe next asbestos\u201d. Kate Hughes, an environmental advocate and researcher with a focus on hazardous chemicals who spent time in north Queensland during the papaya fruit fly eradication program, says regulators in Australia \u201chad to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 20th century\u201d. \u201cWith the acutely toxic [chemicals] like EDB you could only shake your head and say, \u2018Don\u2019t they have any compassion for working-class people, for working people who can\u2019t rush off to a lawyer and say I\u2019ve been poisoned.\u2019 \u201cIt was 1995 \u2013 it wasn\u2019t as if it was 1975. It was quite shocking to know the conditions under which people were obliged to apply [chemicals]. It\u2019s very hard to apply toxic pesticides in a tropical climate.

She agrees emergency measures were needed in some circumstances but that these \u201cclearly weren\u2019t balanced with the need to protect health\u201d. \u201cEDB is incredibly acutely toxic. It\u2019s a shockingly strong nerve poison or neurotoxin, it can damage the brain in various ways [and] affect our emotions, learning and behaviour.\u201d Hughes was one of the first researchers to write about the mental health impacts of chemicals, now well established by research, and also the effects of prolonged exposure to amounts considered harmless by regulators. Her 1994 book, Quick Poison, Slow Poison, was ahead of its time in recognising the way chemicals act as \u201cslow poisons ... that cause sickness in people who are regularly exposed to small doses over long periods of time\u201d. But she maintains chemicals \u2013 including Roundup \u2013 are useful and necessary to support farmers to produce food and protect biodiversity from invasive species. \u201cThe whole modern food production system, whether you like it or don\u2019t like it, requires the use of pesticides,\u201d she says. But she adds that the fact those same chemicals are sold in supermarkets \u201can aisle over from the bread\u201d is \u201can obscenity\u201d. \u201cDoctors now know about lead but it took a long time,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cDoctors know now about asbestos but it took a long time. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not alarmist on this but I certainly am alarmed.

      "bodyText": "This week is a big one for the economy \u2013 both looking forward and back. On Tuesday the Reserve Bank is expected to cut interest rates to a record low of 1.25% and on Wednesday the GDP figures for the first quarter of this year are due to be released showing the economy continues to grow weakly. The latest business indictors released on Monday by the Bureau of Statistics showed that while the total amount of company profits remain strong, workers are not really seeing anywhere near the level of wages growth they should expect. The economy, it should be clear to anyone who ignored what was said by politicians during the election campaign, is not doing well. It is not complete doom and gloom \u2013 a recession still seems less than likely to occur \u2013 but anything like the level of growth we once took for granted still appears a long way off. The big worry is that while right now things are not great, over the past couple of years companies actually did do quite well and yet workers saw little return. The latest figures show that since the middle of 2016 annual company profit growth has easily outstripped total wages growth. In the past year, company profits rose 8.8% in trend terms while wages grew 4.1%: But because wages growth is relatively stable and profits can bounce around it is best not to compare wages and profits growth directly. Instead I always prefer to lok at average profit growth over a three-year period to wash out some of the normal business cycle booms and busts. But here we see the real disparity between profit and wages growth. Since June 2016, total profits have increased 49% while the total amount of wages rose just 9.5%. It makes for an average annual growth in company profits of 13.4%. For comparison, when profits averaged that growth in the three years to December 2008, wages were growing at double the rate they are now: During the election campaign the prime minister sought to downplay the disparity by suggesting that the issue was mining profits were booming while profits in the rest of the economy were basically in line with wages. He suggested in the second leaders\u2019 debate that \u201cif you strip the mining companies out, compensation of employees and the gross operating surplus on the national accounts \u2026 have moved at the same level\u201d. And Scott Morrison is correct, mining profits have boomed much more than the rest of the corporate sector: Mining profits since the middle of 2016 have risen an astonishing 126%. But there are two problems with Morrison\u2019s explanation. The first is that while mining profits massively skew total profits, focusing on non-mining profits only serves to highlight just how poorly the economy is performing. In the past year non-mining company profits grew just 1.5% in trend terms and a mere 0.3% seasonally adjusted. Either way that is the worst growth since 2016: And secondly, the three-year average annual growth of non-mining profits are growing much faster than wages and are also trending up while wages are trending down: But if profits in the non-mining sector are falling, that does not suggest total wages \u2013 either through greater employment or actual wage rises \u2013 are going to start growing faster than they currently are. The lack of growth in the economy was also highlighted by the latest private new capital expenditure figures out on Thursday. In all sectors of the economy there has been either a slowing in the growth of investment or an actual fall: And we know from past experience during the mining boom that the best route to strong employment and wages growth is when investment is rising. And this is where there are some positive signs. The latest estimate for investment in 2019-20 financial year has shown a significant jump over the estimates this time last year for 2018-19. Currently firms expect investment in mining infrastructure to be 21% above this year \u2013 the first such increase for seven years. Even the non-mining sectors predict a 9% increase \u2013 the best growth since before the GFC: And don\u2019t believe any spin about this being due to the re-election of the government. The ABS conducted these surveys during March and April \u2013 at a time when most thought the ALP would win. The improved outlook for investment is certainly heartening, but the results will take some time to filter down to wages. The GDP figures out released on Wednesday will likely confirm that real household incomes remain flat. Should the increased investment lead to stronger demand for workers and thus higher wages it is likely it will take a year or so to flow through. So the wait continues, but at least amid the gloom, there is some hope that things might improve. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "It was always going to be this way. From the moment it was revealed how the 2019 Super Netball season would be structured to accommodate July\u2019s World Cup , it was inevitable certain individual performances would be viewed through the prism of the global tournament. The quadrennial World Cup, to be held in Liverpool, is one of netball\u2019s pinnacle events and its spectre has loomed large over the world\u2019s best league since round one. The season will pause after round nine is complete on 23 June and re-start on 27 July for five more rounds, before finals. Historically, the elite domestic competition has been moved forward or back to make room, so when it was announced last year, the unorthodox format prompted many questions and quandaries. Would an Australian star or any of the internationals who play in the league, from New Zealand, England, Jamaica, Uganda, Trinidad or South Africa, injure themselves pre-Cup and ruin their nation\u2019s chances? Would the measly six-day break between the final day of competition in the UK and round 10 hurt one franchise more than another? What about the psychological weight of potentially losing the final and having to front up for domestic duties for the rest of the season? Would players be rested before or after, with an impact on results? Or would players pick up season-ending injuries in Liverpool? The constant speculating has been the underlying theme of the season. And never has the shadow of the World Cup been longer than in round six last weekend, which began 48 hours after the Diamonds squad was revealed by coach Lisa Alexander. Looking through an Australian lens, it was impossible to miss three scintillating individual performances \u2013 from Firebird Gabi Simpson and Vixens Emily Mannix and Kate Moloney, who all missed out \u2013 which could comfortably be filed under \u201cHow do you like me, now?\u201d. Standout games from another Firebird, the polarising Gretel Tippett, and NSW Swifts duo Sarah Klau and Paige Hadley should have silenced any doubters questioning their inclusion. And less-than-stellar minutes from Magpies Ash Brazill and Kim Ravaillion in their side\u2019s 68-52 thrashing by the Swifts might just have validated their exclusion. The biggest shock of the squad announcement was the dropping of Simpson, who was vice-captain in the Diamonds\u2019 most recent Quad Series. Most pundits had her in the 12, despite a few niggling injuries, but on Thursday, her name was missing, with Alexander favouring Jamie Lee Price. Simpson, however, wasn\u2019t missing on the stats sheet for her side\u2019s 62-all draw with the West Coast Fever in Brisbane on Saturday night. A clearly fired-up Simpson, already one of the game\u2019s most animated characters, looked like a woman on a mission from the first whistle. The 26-year-old played every minute, picked off three intercepts and affected three deflections which resulted in a gain. She also didn\u2019t give away a single obstruction, impressive for a wing defence. The 40-Test veteran was instrumental in getting her injury-ravaged and winless side the draw. While the game was drawn, the Firebirds walked away with four points; two bonus points for winning the first and last quarters and two premiership points for the draw. The Fever got three, after winning just one quarter. It\u2019s believed to be the first time a side has \u201cwon\u201d a draw, points-wise, in Super Netball. Also on Saturday, Vixens goal keeper Mannix, who was overlooked in favour of 24-year-old Klau, and her captain Moloney, who didn\u2019t make the cut in the midcourt, shone in their side\u2019s 62-52 win over the Sunshine Coast Lightning in Queensland. Mannix started on Ugandan Peace Proscovia and had two important intercepts before the main break, by which time the Lightning import was benched. Also a member of the most recent Quad Series squad and seen as an understudy for Courtney Bruce, Mannix recorded two deflections resulting in a gain and a rebound and only had one obstruction. She was instrumental in causing several held balls, working seamlessly with Jo Weston. Moloney, playing on Kiwi superstar Laura Langman in her 200th match, had 27 feeds and 20 goal assists, but it was her defensive pressure, which netted two intercepts and caused five general play turnovers from Langman, that stood out. Her lead-from-the-front style also played a key role in the win. Putting their names on the \u201cwell and truly justified their inclusion\u201d list were Tippett and Klau \u2013 both named MVPs in their matches \u2013 and Hadley. In her side\u2019s draw with the Fever, Tippett continued her extraordinary run of form, shooting 35 from 36 to take her season tally to 192 from 196, for a mind-blowing 98% accuracy. She was again the most accurate shooter across the competition for the round and continues to be unfazed by pairing with Abigail Latu-Meafou, who the Firebirds brought in just two weeks ago to cover for an injured Romelda Aiken. Surely the number of people doubting Tippett is dropping as her form trajectory goes in the opposite direction. A clearly-elated Klau had her best game yet in the Swifts\u2019 16-goal win over Collingwood. She had a round-high four intercepts and affected three deflections which resulted in a gain. And she did it all while looking like she was having the time of her life. With first-string Diamonds keeper Courtney Bruce appearing to re-injure her arm in the last quarter in Fever\u2019s match against the Firebirds, Klau might be seeing more court time in Liverpool than many expected. Her teammate Hadley swung between centre and wing attack in the Swifts\u2019 thumping of Collingwood, but regardless of the bib, the result was the same \u2013 dominance. She had 42 feeds, 19 goal assists and a deflection. As the play maker and pace setter, Hadley worked in beautifully with Helen Housby, who dominated at goal attack.

      "bodyText": "Australia would need to adopt a carbon price for nuclear power to be economically viable, a peak lobby group for the sector says, as it welcomes a push by the Nationals for a fresh Senate inquiry into the idea. The Australian Nuclear Association, which advocates for nuclear science and technology, said nuclear power could provide cheap, reliable, carbon-free energy in Australia, but it would only be cost competitive with gas and coal generation if pollution was priced. \u201cThey [reactors] don\u2019t stack up in the current environment unless you have got some direct government intervention or a carbon price,\u201d the ANA\u2019s vice president, Robert Parker, said, suggesting a carbon price of about $20 a tonne would be sufficient for the sector to be competitive. He said \u201cif people want to take climate change seriously\u201d, then nuclear would enable the country to reduce CO2 emissions in line with the recommendations of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which requires human-caused emissions to reach \u2018net zero\u2019 by 2050. \u201cIf we are going to go down that road of trying to decarbonise as much as practically possible, then our analysis shows nuclear is the way to go,\u201d he said. Nuclear power becomes cheaper than wind or solar power generation the more the electricity sector switches to carbon-free generation, according to the ANA\u2019s analysis, with the cost of reactors about half what they were a decade ago. \u201cThe more you try to reduce your emissions across the electricity sector, the cheaper nuclear will be.\u201d The ANA\u2019s comments come as Nationals MPs push for a new Senate inquiry into the potential of nuclear power in Australia, ahead of a statutory review of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act due this year. The Minerals Council of Australia has flagged it will use the EPBC Act review to push for a removal of the country\u2019s nuclear ban, saying Australia is the only high electricity consuming country without nuclear power in its energy mix. But as the sector suggests pricing pollution could help incentivise nuclear power generation and encourage Australia to cut its emissions, the resources minister, Matthew Canavan, is arguing against a carbon price, criticising business for its support of a market mechanism. The Nationals MP Keith Pitt, who is leading the charge for the new Senate probe, said he was open to the idea that a carbon price may be necessary for nuclear power to stack up. \u201cThis is the purpose of having the select committee, I think it is past time we had the conversation with the Australian people about nuclear energy,\u201d Pitt said. He said he wanted the select committee to also look at the lifetime costs of renewable technologies in comparison to nuclear, saying solar panels only had a life expectancy of up to 20 years and there were \u201ctens of millions\u201d of them already in the system. \u201cWe have got a real risk particularly with solar panels and lithium batteries that they could turn out to be this generation\u2019s asbestos,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to look at the life cycle in its entirety and we need to have a balanced approach moving forward with energy in this country.\u201d On Monday, the former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce said he agreed with Pitt\u2019s push for Australia to use nuclear power. \u201cWe dig it up, semi process it, send it to others to use and SA Labor believes we can take the scraps back and bury them. We believe in a reactor for medical purposes smack in the middle of Sydney BUT we must not use it for our power,\u201d he said on Twitter. During the election campaign, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, appeared to open the door to Australia having a nuclear industry, saying \u201cif it can pay its way\u201d, the industry should be allowed to operate. But after facing a backlash from Labor, Morrison said the government had \u201cno plans\u201d to change the law to allow nuclear power in Australia. Morrison referred to the federal review of nuclear power undertaken by Ziggy Switkowski in 2006, saying the taskforce found it could not \u201csupport itself\u201d. The report concluded that nuclear could help with emissions reduction, but the power would be on average 20\u201350% more expensive to produce than coal-fired power \u201cif pollution, including carbon dioxide emissions, is not priced\u201d. However, the total cost of building a nuclear power station could still be prohibitive.

Morrison looks set to govern with 77 seats in the House of Representatives when parliament returns in July, which is similar to Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s position after the 2016 election. Labor has 68 seats in the lower house, and the crossbench numbers six. Both the Coalition and Labor have reshuffled their ministerial line ups post-election and Anthony Albanese has taken the ALP leadership from Shorten, who remains on the opposition frontbench. The Coalition is making a priority of getting income tax cuts passed when parliament resumes, and Albanese says Labor needs to listen to the voter feedback from the recent contest, and recalibrate its program. Morrison is on a trip to the Solomon Islands, the United Kingdom and Singapore, and Labor\u2019s shadow cabinet will meet for the first time since the election in Brisbane on Tuesday. None of the major opinion polls \u2013 Newspoll, Ipsos, Galaxy or Essential \u2013 correctly predicted a Coalition win on May 18, projecting Labor in front on a two-party-preferred vote of 51-49 and 52-48. The lack of precision in the polling has prompted public reflection at Essential, as has been flagged by its executive director Peter Lewis.

      "body": "<p>About half of all property crime in the developed world <a href=\"https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2019/05/30/the-changing-cost-of-cybercrime/\" title=\"\">now takes place online</a>. When so much of our lives, and almost all of our money, have been digitised, this is not surprising \u2013 but it has some surprising consequences. For one thing, the decline in reported property crimes trumpeted by successive British governments between 2005 and 2015 turns out to have been an illusion. Because banks were not required to report fraud to the police after 2005, they often didn\u2019t. It would have made both banks and police look bad to have all that crime known and nothing done about it. The cost of the resulting ignorance was paid by the rest of government, and by the public, too, deprived of accurate and reliable knowledge. Since then, the total number of property crimes reported has risen from about 6m to 11m a year as the figures have taken computerised crime into account.</p> <p>The indirect costs to society are very much higher than the hundreds of millions that individuals lose. One example is the proliferation of plagiarism software online, which <a href=\"https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001319697/paypal-move-hurts-kenya-s-commercial-academic-writers\" title=\"\">developed an entire industry</a> in poor, English-speaking countries like Kenya, serving idle or ignorant students in England and North America. The effort required by schools and universities to guard against such fraud has been considerable, and its cost entirely disproportionate to the gains made by the perpetrators.</p> <p>There is worse, too: the fact that recorded crime figures continued to fall throughout Theresa May\u2019s tenure as home secretary, all while she cut 20,000 police jobs, was an important fact in making her appear a competent candidate for prime minister in 2015. </p> <p>A recent <a href=\"https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_25.pdf\" title=\"\">paper from Cambridge University</a> has examined the changing landscape of crime online since 2012. The news is not all bad. Although the general level continues to rise, some forms have diminished. Sometimes this is the result of deliberate effort: credit card fraud has grown in absolute terms, but it is now a smaller proportion of a much larger pie. More often it is the result of developments in the law-abiding world that have made some older crimes unprofitable.

      "bodyText": "About half of all property crime in the developed world now takes place online. When so much of our lives, and almost all of our money, have been digitised, this is not surprising \u2013 but it has some surprising consequences. For one thing, the decline in reported property crimes trumpeted by successive British governments between 2005 and 2015 turns out to have been an illusion. Because banks were not required to report fraud to the police after 2005, they often didn\u2019t. It would have made both banks and police look bad to have all that crime known and nothing done about it. The cost of the resulting ignorance was paid by the rest of government, and by the public, too, deprived of accurate and reliable knowledge. Since then, the total number of property crimes reported has risen from about 6m to 11m a year as the figures have taken computerised crime into account. The indirect costs to society are very much higher than the hundreds of millions that individuals lose. One example is the proliferation of plagiarism software online, which developed an entire industry in poor, English-speaking countries like Kenya, serving idle or ignorant students in England and North America. The effort required by schools and universities to guard against such fraud has been considerable, and its cost entirely disproportionate to the gains made by the perpetrators. There is worse, too: the fact that recorded crime figures continued to fall throughout Theresa May\u2019s tenure as home secretary, all while she cut 20,000 police jobs, was an important fact in making her appear a competent candidate for prime minister in 2015. A recent paper from Cambridge University has examined the changing landscape of crime online since 2012. The news is not all bad. Although the general level continues to rise, some forms have diminished. Sometimes this is the result of deliberate effort: credit card fraud has grown in absolute terms, but it is now a smaller proportion of a much larger pie. More often it is the result of developments in the law-abiding world that have made some older crimes unprofitable. It is no longer worth anyone\u2019s while to counterfeit Viagra now that it has come out of patent and is sold without prescription; the fraudulent copying of music has been almost eliminated by digital streaming services. Even software is now largely sold on subscription and no longer pirated. Some forms have grown immensely. Bitcoin and other digital currencies have no real application as a means of exchange except for things that may not be legally sold, like drugs, or to pay ransoms to criminals \u2013 both the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware demanded payment in bitcoin from their victims. The invention of this payment mechanism has led to a corresponding boost in the profitability and supply of these ransomware. We are not helpless against this onslaught, but the police in Britain still act as if we were. Because much of cybercrime is international, it requires close and quick collaboration between national police forces, and even within the EU this is not the case. The British police are reluctant to investigate property crimes in the real world and still more so online. This reluctance is backed up by a lack of resources. But until it can be overcome, crime will continue to flourish online since there is no detectable law enforcement there. It took 10 years for the British government to acknowledge that so much crime was taking place online. How many more years will it take before any government sets out to fight it?",

When he decided to quit Invesco and go it alone in 2013 it was a huge shock for the fund management industry. Invesco shares slumped by 7% on the day he announced his departure.</p>\n    <p>At Invesco Woodford held control of huge stakes in some of the UK\u2019s biggest firms, and his opinions mattered. His criticism of AstraZeneca chief executive David Brennan in the 2012 shareholder spring was widely regarded to have cost him his job, and his critique of BAE\u2019s attempted \u00a328bn merger with Airbus is acknowledged as one of the reasons the deal collapsed.</p>\n    <p>Woodford, who was widely referred to in the media as an investment \u201chero\u201d and fund management \u201cstar\u201d, had done exceedingly well over his quarter century there. A \u00a31,000 investment placed when he started at the firm in 1988 would have risen to \u00a323,000 by the time he left.</p>\n    <p>Woodford accidentally fell into fund management and hadn\u2019t heard of the term until he rocked up in the City in the 1980s sleeping on his brother\u2019s floor while looking for a job. He got his first break in insurance, before drifting into fund management. He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn\u2019t pass the RAF\u2019s aptitude test, and instead read economics and agricultural economics at the University of Exeter.</p>\n    <p>Feeling he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, he set up his own firm Woodford Investment Management in 2014, on an industrial estate near Oxford. Within two weeks of launching, he had raised \u00a31.6bn, a UK record, and it quickly grew to \u00a316bn. In its first full year his flagship fund returned 16% and Woodford, a devotee of veteran US investor Warren Buffett, was dubbed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/oracle-of-oxford-sees-red-as-stock-picking-powers-misfire\">\u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p>Asked if he ever doubted his judgment, Woodford once said: \u201cDaily. You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying \u2018everybody go away, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u2019. You\u2019ve always got to expose yourself to criticism and the analysis that you may be wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Woodford went on to say that the secret of successful fund management was a balance of arrogance and humility. \u201cYou have to have a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction. If you didn\u2019t, you would end up with a portfolio that looks very much like the index. But, equally, you must have the humility to accept that you will get things wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rupertneate\"><b>Rupert Neate</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The suspension means that thousands of retail investors are unable to cash out of their investments for at least 28 days.</p> \n<p>Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown announced on Monday that it was removing the suspended Woodford quity Income Fund from its Wealth 50 list of favourite funds, which is used to help customers choose their investments.

      "bodyText": "Name: May 1972. Age: 47 years and one month old. Appearance: When history became boring. I\u2019m pretty sure you are wrong. I\u2019m pretty sure you are wrong. Loads of interesting things have happened since May 1972. Rubbish. Name three. OK: the Challenger disaster, the fall of the Soviet Union and the death of Grumpy Cat. What is a Grumpy Cat? Ah, right. There\u2019s a fourth thing, then: the birth of Grumpy Cat. I\u2019m so confused. You\u2019re confused? I\u2019m not the one insisting that history suddenly stopped being interesting nearly five decades ago. But it\u2019s what the American crime writer James Ellroy insists, too, and I love James Ellroy. What did Ellroy say? Shall I look it up on the internet? What\u2019s an internet? Shut up. Look, I\u2019ll save you the trouble. Ellroy was speaking at the Hay festival this weekend, and he said that he stopped being emotionally and intellectually curious about the world in May 1972. Is that really what he said? Yes, and then he said: \u201cNothing after May of 72 vibrates my vindaloo.\u201d James Ellroy sounds like hard work. Nevertheless, we must take him at his word. In the world of Ellroy, the last major world incident must logically be the conclusion of Nixon and Brezhnev\u2019s Moscow summit that resulted in the anti-ballistic missile treaty. But why? Who really knows? My guess is that, as a prolific novelist, Ellroy has to hold an unbelievable amount of information in his head. His stories must take up the entire capacity of his mind, which is why he has essentially spent his entire adult life protecting himself against the suffocating tide of news that swamps the rest of us. And he loves Chandler, too, and Chandler exists in the past. He doesn\u2019t love Chandler. He told Hay: \u201cRaymond Chandler is the most overrated writer in the American canon.\u201d So what prompted this whole \u201cMay 1972\u201d outburst? By all accounts, it seems to be his way of wriggling out of any audience members asking about his feelings for Donald Trump. Why? Is he a Trump supporter? It\u2019s not out of the question. This is a man who, after all, told Rolling Stone that he spent the 1960s and 1970s as a rightwinger, and also denied that the police officers in the Rodney King scandal \u201cdid anything wrong\u201d. So, you know, Donald Trump probably fits his personal brand. So why not just admit it? Come on now. Ellroy might be a famed anti-liberalist who owns dozens of guns and writes books about murder and immorality, but he\u2019s not an idiot. Do say: News ended in May 1972. Don\u2019t say: So did James Ellroy\u2019s relevance.",

When the scrambled eggs are just milk. Prince Andrew is the manager of a jeweller\u2019s who follows you around the display cases and deftly ushers you towards the rings he thinks you might be able to afford, ie ones found in Kinder Eggs from the newsagent\u2019s next door. Jared Kushner can\u2019t focus because of the continuous hard-on he\u2019s had since finalising his plan that will definitely solve the Middle East crisis. I\u2019ve spent a long time looking at this picture, and I am convinced Trump is giving the Queen a fist bump. Liz wears the fixed grin of someone who has just received a present she absolutely hates. And she 100% has pepper spray in that handbag. It has also been pointed out that she doesn\u2019t always wear gloves to shake hands with world leaders and dignitaries, but has chosen to this time. Props to the photographer who took this picture, who has watched Trainspotting at least 14 times. I feel the aesthetic Ivanka is going for here is Rapunzel in the tower \u2013 even though, to my knowledge, Rapunzel never declared herself a feminist and then served in an administration that did its best to repeal universal women\u2019s rights. In fact, Ivanka looks more like the Lady in White, aka the lead character in the horror film of the same name. And that makes much more sense. When someone tells you it\u2019s mufti day as a joke. Melania is changed again, and this time she is cosplaying as Rose DeWitt in Titanic. It\u2019s possible this is a cry for help, given that her entire life must feel like drowning and waiting to be rescued. Why do Melania, the Queen and Camilla look like three auditionees who didn\u2019t quite make the cut as solo singers, but are summoned in front of the judges to be told they are being put together as a girl group? In 30 seconds Camilla will drop to her knees and Take That\u2019s Rule the World will play. Can you imagine, just for a second, thinking that Sadiq Khan is unfit for office and Donald Trump fine? Trump is a one-man-round of Cards Against Humanity and yet this woman thinks Khan is the problem. This is the kind of thing that makes me want to join Tiffany in the basement, and just wait this whole thing out. Just two more days in this hell, the orange flames licking. \u2022 Hannah Jane Parkinson is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>The biologist Jack Cohen, who has died aged 85, worked on animal reproduction and the development of feathers and hair; his Living Embryos (1963) became a standard university text. He also co-authored popular science books and science fiction, and designed alien creatures and ecosystems for science fiction writers. But he will be best remembered for the bestselling four-book series The Science of Discworld, which he wrote with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/12/terry-pratchett\" title=\"\">Terry Pratchett</a> and me.</p> <p>I first met Jack in 1990, when he phoned me at Warwick University. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Jack Cohen. I have a question about your book on chaos theory. Can we meet?\u201d We had lunch at a pub in Kenilworth, and four hours later we were still there, having discovered that a mathematician and a biologist could have far more in common than they expected.</p> <p>We became close friends and collaborators, writing three popular science books together: The Collapse of Chaos (1994), based on four years of pub conversations, Figments of Reality (1997) and What Does a Martian Look Like? (2002).</p> <p>We wrote two science fiction novels: Wheelers (2000), whose complex plot we invented during a long car journey to appear on a scientific game show on BBC radio, and a sequel, Heaven (2004). We also collaborated on scientific papers: mathematical models of evolution, the supposed decline of the human sperm count, and an article on alien life for a Nature astrobiology supplement.</p> <p>The culmination of these activities was, for us both, the Discworld books. Jack and Terry had been friends since Terry was a struggling young journalist, brought together by a common love of science fiction. After Terry became famous for his humorous fantasy books, he would often phone Jack to discuss biological curiosities. Jack introduced me to Terry at the <a href=\"http://www.birminghamsfgroup.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Birmingham Science Fiction Group</a>\u2019s annual SF convention Novacon in 1990.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6eef70af93edcf121b54c4b204017655e678822f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eef70af93edcf121b54c4b204017655e678822f/0_92_2356_1413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Cohen, left, with Terry Pratchett, centre, and Ian Stewart at a book signing in Warwick.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Cohen, left, with Terry Pratchett, centre, and Ian Stewart at a book signing in Warwick.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warwick University</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At another convention we ended up at a Mongolian restaurant near Dudley. The conversation turned to books \u201cexplaining\u201d the alleged real science behind TV series such as Star Trek, and we wondered about doing the same for Discworld.</p> <p>We agreed that it would make good use of Terry\u2019s much-loved stories of wizards and witches and trolls and vampires to explain some real science to a general readership. But Terry foresaw a problem. \u201cThere\u2019s no science in Discworld. It runs on magic. Dragons don\u2019t breathe fire because they swallow combustible material. They breathe fire because that\u2019s what dragons do.\u201d</p> <p>Six months later, we figured it out: \u201cTerry: if there\u2019s no science in Discworld, can you put some there?\u201d</p> <p>The wizards of Unseen University, we suggested, should bring into being the Roundworld Project, a magical force field the size of a football that contains the whole of the real universe.

      "bodyText": "The biologist Jack Cohen, who has died aged 85, worked on animal reproduction and the development of feathers and hair; his Living Embryos (1963) became a standard university text. He also co-authored popular science books and science fiction, and designed alien creatures and ecosystems for science fiction writers. But he will be best remembered for the bestselling four-book series The Science of Discworld, which he wrote with Terry Pratchett and me. I first met Jack in 1990, when he phoned me at Warwick University. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Jack Cohen. I have a question about your book on chaos theory. Can we meet?\u201d We had lunch at a pub in Kenilworth, and four hours later we were still there, having discovered that a mathematician and a biologist could have far more in common than they expected. We became close friends and collaborators, writing three popular science books together: The Collapse of Chaos (1994), based on four years of pub conversations, Figments of Reality (1997) and What Does a Martian Look Like? (2002). We wrote two science fiction novels: Wheelers (2000), whose complex plot we invented during a long car journey to appear on a scientific game show on BBC radio, and a sequel, Heaven (2004). We also collaborated on scientific papers: mathematical models of evolution, the supposed decline of the human sperm count, and an article on alien life for a Nature astrobiology supplement. The culmination of these activities was, for us both, the Discworld books. Jack and Terry had been friends since Terry was a struggling young journalist, brought together by a common love of science fiction. After Terry became famous for his humorous fantasy books, he would often phone Jack to discuss biological curiosities. Jack introduced me to Terry at the Birmingham Science Fiction Group\u2019s annual SF convention Novacon in 1990. At another convention we ended up at a Mongolian restaurant near Dudley. The conversation turned to books \u201cexplaining\u201d the alleged real science behind TV series such as Star Trek, and we wondered about doing the same for Discworld. We agreed that it would make good use of Terry\u2019s much-loved stories of wizards and witches and trolls and vampires to explain some real science to a general readership. But Terry foresaw a problem. \u201cThere\u2019s no science in Discworld. It runs on magic. Dragons don\u2019t breathe fire because they swallow combustible material. They breathe fire because that\u2019s what dragons do.\u201d Six months later, we figured it out: \u201cTerry: if there\u2019s no science in Discworld, can you put some there?\u201d The wizards of Unseen University, we suggested, should bring into being the Roundworld Project, a magical force field the size of a football that contains the whole of the real universe. It keeps magic out, so inside it, everything runs on scientific rules. The wizards would be puzzled by the weird ways that rules work, such as round worlds with something called \u201cgravity\u201d to stop people falling off the bottom, instead of sensible flat worlds like the Disc. The science chapters would be about real science in this universe, narratively embedded in Discworld. Terry could write a Discworld short story, with hooks on which Jack and I could hang the science, intercut with the story like \u201cvery big footnotes\u201d. It worked like a charm. The Science of Discworld was published in 1999, with three further books following in 2002, 2005 and 2013. The series sold more than a million copies and changed our lives; Jack considered it one of his proudest achievements. He and I became regulars at Discworld conventions.

With help from Jack, Warwick University awarded Terry his first honorary degree in 1999.

The Treasury has been squeezing schools\u2019 spending since 2010 as part of the government\u2019s austerity drive, so would Philip Hammond (no big fan of the former foreign secretary) simply say no?</p> <p>In reality, that is the wrong question. The precise details of Johnson\u2019s proposal to even up secondary school spending are not entirely clear, but look much more modest than the promise by one of his rivals, Michael Gove, to spend an extra \u00a31bn a year on education.</p> <p>Under current government plans, secondary schools are supposed to receive at least \u00a34,800 per pupil this year. Analysis by the <a href=\"https://schoolsweek.co.uk/johnsons-school-funding-pledge-amounts-to-0-1-increase/\">Schools Week </a>education website suggests that only 35 of 150 local education authorities are on course to spend less than \u00a35,000 per pupil.</p> <p>It adds that to increase funding to \u00a35,000 for the 755,000 pupils in those areas would cost \u00a348.6m. That is small change in the context of a schools budget that currently stands at \u00a343.5bn \u2013 an increase of the order of 0.1%. By comparison, Johnson said in 2016 that Britain leaving the EU would save \u00a3350m per week, in one of the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week\">contentious claims of the referendum campaign</a>.</p> <p>Grammar schools would potentially gain most from the Johnson plan, since they have lower per pupil spending than non-grammar secondary schools.</p> <p>But even if the promise were acted upon immediately \u2013 and no time scale has been announced so far \u2013 the financial cost would be minimal. The real question is whether it would make any real difference.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Given that he has a bit of form with such pledges, Boris Johnson\u2019s promise that he would ensure every secondary school in England would spend \u00a35,000 per pupil per year was bound to raise an eyebrow or two. The first \u2013 and most obvious \u2013 question to be raised by the promise made by the frontrunner to replace Theresa May as prime minister is whether the money is there to fund it. The Treasury has been squeezing schools\u2019 spending since 2010 as part of the government\u2019s austerity drive, so would Philip Hammond (no big fan of the former foreign secretary) simply say no? In reality, that is the wrong question. The precise details of Johnson\u2019s proposal to even up secondary school spending are not entirely clear, but look much more modest than the promise by one of his rivals, Michael Gove, to spend an extra \u00a31bn a year on education. Under current government plans, secondary schools are supposed to receive at least \u00a34,800 per pupil this year. Analysis by the Schools Week education website suggests that only 35 of 150 local education authorities are on course to spend less than \u00a35,000 per pupil. It adds that to increase funding to \u00a35,000 for the 755,000 pupils in those areas would cost \u00a348.6m. That is small change in the context of a schools budget that currently stands at \u00a343.5bn \u2013 an increase of the order of 0.1%. By comparison, Johnson said in 2016 that Britain leaving the EU would save \u00a3350m per week, in one of the most contentious claims of the referendum campaign. Grammar schools would potentially gain most from the Johnson plan, since they have lower per pupil spending than non-grammar secondary schools. But even if the promise were acted upon immediately \u2013 and no time scale has been announced so far \u2013 the financial cost would be minimal. The real question is whether it would make any real difference.",

Her research was undertaken during a sabbatical from the Guardian on behalf of Church Action on Poverty, during the heady days of the first New Labour government with a massive majority, when they could have accomplished anything but instead continued much Tory policy. She lived in a council flat and worked at menial, low-wage jobs, much as Barbara Ehrenreich had done before in the US for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nickel-Dimed-Barbara-Ehrenreich/dp/1847082629\" title=\"\">Nickel and Dimed</a>, which Toynbee says inspired her.

      "bodyText": "In 2003 Polly Toynbee published the informative and highly moving book Hard Work. Her research was undertaken during a sabbatical from the Guardian on behalf of Church Action on Poverty, during the heady days of the first New Labour government with a massive majority, when they could have accomplished anything but instead continued much Tory policy. She lived in a council flat and worked at menial, low-wage jobs, much as Barbara Ehrenreich had done before in the US for Nickel and Dimed, which Toynbee says inspired her. I can\u2019t imagine Toynbee\u2019s book had anything other than glowing reviews from the Guardian. So how it is that when Rory Stewart, clearly an oddball but the most human by a long way of the shower of Tory candidates to replace Theresa May, says he would like to spend a year living on a council estate to see how others live, this is dismissed as evidence of a \u201ccolonialist mindset\u201d (Is Stewart just another old Etonian or the man to take No 10?, 1 June)? Not by the Guardian, admittedly \u2013 by nameless \u201cothers\u201d who may have their own campaign to promote. But the Guardian reports it without comment, and without apparently asking different \u201cothers\u201d for their view on the matter. In fact, it should probably be a requirement for anyone wanting to lead a political party, or at least one that has cut benefits and increased despair, to spend a year seeing how poor people live. The only current drawback is that there are so many Tory leadership candidates that it would contribute even further to the social housing shortage.

Mohammed, who was appointed second in command at the UN in 2016, said faith leaders had to \u201cget back to basics. Congregations will follow, but they\u2019ll only follow a narrative that calls for core values of tolerance, peace, respect, dignity to be adhered to. This is not going to be an easy journey because we have fallen behind considerably.\u201d But faith organisations had the potential to \u201cbreak across silos\u201d, she said, adding that countries were no longer just dealing with issues within their borders. She said leaders from different religions and different parts of the world needed to find common ground and work from there. Mohammed later told a meeting at Christian Aid\u2019s London headquarters: \u201cWith a rise in xenophobic rhetoric, antisemitism and anti-Muslim hatred, there is a growing global interest in engaging religious actors as peace mediators and as builders of inclusive and peaceful societies. \u201cTime and time again, faith-based organisations have stood in the face of rising tensions and conflict. They have provided space for open and constructive dialogue.\u201d Speaking to the Guardian, she acknowledged \u201clegitimate\u201d criticism of the UN as overly bureaucratic and top-heavy. \u201cA lot of the time, with good intention, we thought we knew best \u2013 we prescribed a lot and didn\u2019t listen enough. And we weren\u2019t able to bring the resources on the scale needed to deal with the issues.\u201d But she added: \u201cThere is a need for that space where all voices come together, 193 countries, to discuss challenges that can only be resolved in that kind of a space.\u201d Changes begun in the past two years needed to speed up, Mohammed said: \u201cThe challenges [we face] are not waiting for a reform that is going to take a decade.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Finally, a late recovery has seen the FTSE 100 index close up 23 points at 7,184, a gain of 0.3%. Goodnight! GW Time for a recap The US-China trade war continues to rumble on, worrying investors and fuelling concerns that the global economy is weakening. Beijing has launched a fresh criticism of Washington, releasing a trade white paper which blamed US belligerence for the failure to reach a deal. It accused America of: Resorting to intimidation and coercion, it persisted with exorbitant demands . . . and insisted on including mandatory requirements [that infringe on] China\u2019s sovereign affairs in the deal.\u201d President Trump has hit back, insisting that his tariffs are bringing in billions of dollars of revenue without driving up prices. Mexican restaurant chain Chipotle, though, has warned that Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on imports from Mexico would hurt profits or push up burrito prices. Traders have also been jolted by reports that America considered imposing tariffs on Australia - a key ally - to prevent aluminium being dumped on the US markets. Trump also took time out of his state visit to the UK to call for a boycott of CNN - seemingly unhappy that he couldn\u2019t get Fox News at the US embassy. There are also fresh signs that global manufacturers are struggling. In Britain, factory growth went into reverse in May for the first time since July 2016. Companies have stopped stockpiling goods, now that the immediate threat of a no-deal Brexit has faded. Some say that overseas companies are taking their business elsewhere as they adjust their supply chains. Dave Atkinson of Lloyds Banking Group, warns: It\u2019s clear that challenges are starting to bite and we\u2019ll all be monitoring the evolving situation in the coming months \u2013 from the escalating trade war between the US and China affecting the sector\u2019s confidence to the fall in the volume of orders of UK manufactured goods domestically and globally. Recent stockpiling, partly driven by the uncertainty from the UK leaving the EU, is also now impacting on new orders as businesses show caution in managing stock levels. Eurozone manufacturing also had another bad month, with output shrinking again. Germany suffered the biggest fall in activity, with output and new orders both down. America\u2019s factories are also being dragged back, fuelling concerns that the trade war is hurting demand across the board. Wall Street has now slid into the red, following the news that America\u2019s manufacturing growth weakened last month. The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 109 points, or 0.4%, as the early rally fizzles out. America\u2019s Institute of Supply Management has given a slightly more optimistic view of the US factory sector. Its US manufacturing PMI, just released, has dropped to 52.1 for May, down from 52.8 in April. That suggests stronger growth than implied by the rival (gloomier) Markit PMI, but is also ISM\u2019s lowest reading since summer 2016. Newsflash: America\u2019s factory sector has grown at its weakest rate since the global recession a decade ago. Data firm Markit\u2019s US manufacturing PMI, just released, has dropped to just 50.5, from 50.6 in April. That\u2019s the lowest reading since September 2009, and a level that is barely above stagnation. Factory bosses reported that their output growth slowed, while new orders actually fell for the first time since August 2009. The US trade was blamed by many firms, Markit says: The headline PMI fell to its lowest level since September 2009 as output growth eased and new orders fell for the first time since August 2009. Weak demand conditions and ongoing trade tensions led firms to express the joint-lowest degree of confidence regarding future output growth since data on the outlook were first collected in mid-2012. Uh-oh! Brazil\u2019s factory sector has slowed to near-stagnation last month, another sign that global growth is weakening. That follows the surprise contraction in the UK last month, and the ongoing weakness in the eurozone., and beyond... The New York stock exchange has opened cautiously, as investors fret about the prospects of a deeper trade war. The tech-focused Nasdaq dipped by 0.15%, adding to last month\u2019s losses. Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company) has shed 4%, following reports that it could face an antitrust probe from the US Justice Department. The Dow Jones industrial average, though, has gained 65 points, or 0.26%, to 24,880. Mexican-themed restaurant chain Chipotle has just undermined Donald Trump\u2019s claim that his trade war won\u2019t hurt consumers. Mexican Grill Chipotle has sad that it could cover the cost of Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on Mexican imports by raising the cost of a burrito by around 5 cents. The company also suggested (to Reuters) that a new 10% levy on goods from Mexico - such as avocados - could push up its costs by around $15m this year. That means Chipotle must choose between pushing up prices, or letting its profits suffer. Chief financial officer Jack Hartung said a hit to earnings was one option, adding: \u201cWe could also consider passing on these costs through a modest price increase, such as about a nickel on a burrito\u201d. A 5c price rise won\u2019t make much impact on the cost of living (unless you\u2019re really keen on burritos). But it does show how tariffs can drag on the economy. Copper, another gauge of global growth prospects, has hit a five-month low today. The price of a tonne of copper, traded in London, fell to $5,801 this morning, the lowest since early January. Anxiety over the global economy are also driving investors into US government bonds. This is pushing the price of Treasury bonds up, and driving down the interest rate on the debt. The yield on 10-year T-bills has now fallen to 2.1%, from over 3% last November. That suggests investors are cutting their expectations for growth and inflation. Many now expect the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year, rather than keep raising borrowing costs. Mexico is pushing back against Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on its goods unless it reduces migration to the US. Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, is in Washington today. He\u2019s told a news conference that such tariffs could be \u2018counterproductive\u2019. Mexico\u2019s US ambassador, Martha B\u00e1rcena Coqui, has also hammered home that message: Selling at the start of May would have been a good investment strategy this year.... European stock markets have recovered some of this morning\u2019s losses, but are still in the red as lunchtime approaches. The prospect of Mexico, and even Australia, being dragged into the US-led trade war continues to worry investors. China\u2019s attack on Washington over the weekend (blaming US \u2018intimidation and coertion\u2019 for the breakdown in negotiations) is also a worry. Wall Street is expected to drop when trading begins in 90 minutes. May was a grim month for the markets, and June isn\u2019t starting much better. Rupert Thompson, head of research at Kingswood, explains how the latest trade conflict has worried the markets: \u201cEquity markets have retreated further and are now down some 6% in local currency terms from their late April high. In sterling terms, the decline has been cushioned somewhat by the weakness of the pound and is a more moderate 4%. The escalation in trade tensions continues to be the main factor driving equities lower. Indeed, there was talk of China restricting exports of rare earth minerals and soybeans in response to the recent moves by the US against Chinese telecom companies. In addition, Trump out of the blue announced he was imposing tariffs on all Mexican imports until Mexico \u2018substantially stops the illegal flow of aliens\u2019. But Thompson also hopes that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping can end the dispute, before the global economy really suffers: \u201cThe best that can now realistically be hoped from the end-June G20 summit is that Presidents Trump and Xi agree to restart negotiations and postpone the tariff increases set to be implemented in July. Longer term, we still believe China and the US will reach some kind of agreement \u2013 not least because neither side will want to risk a recession. With the Presidential election next November, Trump will have every incentive to reach a deal rather than risk triggering a downturn in the economy. Back in the markets, the gold price has hit a two-month high as nervous investors scamper for safe places to put their money. Spot gold has jumped 1% today, and just hit $1,317.6 a troy ounce. That\u2019s its highest levels since late March. Analysts are blaming the latest tensions in the trade war -- especially Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on Mexican imports. Analysts at OCBC Bank told clients: The Mexican tariffs were probably the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. \u201cTariffs on Mexico also showed that no country is safe from the US weaponising trade to meet objectives of the Trump administration, stretching the possibility of the global economy losing growth steam.\u201d China\u2019s latest criticism of the US\u2019s approach to the trade talks is also worrying the market, of course, driving people out of shares and into safer assets. President Trump began his trip to London by settling down in front of the TV, before making the short trip by helicopter to Buckingham Palace. Unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t pleased to find himself watching CNN -- and has just bashed one of his least-favourite news channels: Donald Trump would rather have watched Fox News, I suspect. Unfortunately (for him), Fox pulled its UK feed in 2017, after communications regulator Ofcom criticised its coverage several times. Back in November 2017, Ofcom ruled that the Fox News programmes Hannity and Tucker Carlson Tonight breached impartiality rules covering British broadcasting. This related to its coverage of the Manchester Arena bombing, and Trump\u2019s executive order that restricted travel to the US from seven majority-Muslim countries. UK politicians are distracted by Donald Trump\u2019s state visit, but they really should take a closer look at the downturn in UK manufacturing last month. Our economics editor Larry Elliott says: The government has been sent a warning signal that Brexit uncertainty is pushing Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector into recession as the latest industry health check showed the weakest performance since the aftermath of the EU referendum three years ago. Order books shrank rapidly after a period when businesses had been stockpiling goods in the run-up to the original Brexit deadline at the end of March, according to the regular monthly survey conducted for the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply by the research group IHS Markit. The purchasing managers\u2019 index \u2013 a closely watched guide to the strength of the manufacturing sector \u2013 fell from 53.1 points in April to 49.4 in May. A finding below 50 indicates contraction. With the deepening global trade war adding to industry\u2019s woes, Cips/Markit said it was one of the sharpest declines in the index in six and a half years. More here: Just in: Donald Trump has just accused China of subsidising its industries to help them cope with the trade war. The US president, at the start of his state visit to the UK, tweeted: Unfortunately, most of those \u201cbillions\u201d are coming from American firms, not Chinese ones, as they\u2019ve been picking up the tab. Late last month, the International Monetary Fund showed that the tariff revenue collected has been borne almost entirely by US importers. IMF researchers found that US and Chinese consumers are \u201cunequivocally the losers from trade tensions\u201d. They explained: Some of these tariffs have been passed on to US consumers, like those on washing machines, while others have been absorbed by importing firms through lower profit margins. Brexit stockpiling helped the UK economy to grow by a meaty 0.5% in the first three months of 2019. Today\u2019s weak PMI report suggests growth may be rather slower in the current quarter, points out Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson: We\u2019ll have a clearer picture by Wednesday, when the Service Sector PMI is released (we also get the UK construction PMI tomorrow). Lee Collinson of Barclays Corporate Banking says UK factories have fallen into a dip as Brexit stockpiling unwinds: Manufacturers have been warning for some time that they are trying to navigate a number of headwinds, and the hard to predict Brexit negotiations have certainly made investment decisions more difficult, with falling car production indicative of the issues being faced. It\u2019s not all about Brexit though, with weaker global demand already taking a bite out of exports. KPMG\u2019s Stephen Cooper agrees that Brexit isn\u2019t the only reason the UK manufacturing PMI has tumbled: \u201cAny potential benefits from the auto shutdowns [in April] have been outweighed with falling orders, high inventory levels - from previous stockpiling - and worryingly, a reported shift with some EU customers moving their supply chains away from the UK amidst continued Brexit uncertainty. The global backdrop is also one of uncertainty - with trade wars, geopolitical events, automotive developments and Brexit \u2013 all of these factors are weighing on manufacturing in Europe and Asia and they are reflected in May\u2019s readings. Here\u2019s Howard Archer, economist at EY Item Club, on this morning\u2019s worrying fall in UK factory growth: On the export front, manufacturers are hampered by recently slower global growth. Global trade conflicts and tensions are also a concern for UK manufacturing exporters. On the positive side, the weakness in the pound may provide some help to UK manufacturing exporters. UK manufactures could be hurt by EU companies switching supply chains away from the UK. This may be countered though by UK companies switching their supply chains from the EU to the UK If the UK does ultimately leave the EU with a \u201cdeal\u201d at the end of October manufacturers will clearly hope that this reduces uncertainty, boosts confidence and lifts business demand for capital goods as well as consumer demand for big-ticket manufactured goods. There is one glimmer of good news amid the gloom -- half of the factory bosses interviewed by Markit expect output to be higher in a year. Duncan Johnston, UK manufacturing industry leader at Deloitte, says: \u201cThis month\u2019s disappointing PMI figure of 49.4 is undoubtedly a combination of ongoing Brexit uncertainty and underlying macro and global trade factors. However, it is hard to unpick what has had the larger impact. This backdrop of uncertainty is expected to continue for some months, but there is cause for optimism. Purchasing managers remain positive, with almost half expecting output to be higher in a year\u2019s time and only 10% expecting it to be lower.\u201d Make UK, which represents British manufacturers, says customers are taking their business elsewhere, driven away by Brexit worries. Seamus Nevin, their chief economist, says this helped to pull manufacturing output down last month. \u201cThe extent to which stockpiling was artificially boosting output earlier in the year is now clear with the PMI plunging into negative territory for the first time since the Referendum. Manufacturers are reporting export demand is weakening as customers look to buy goods from other countries which they once bought from the UK. This is not only the case with European customers but also from countries in Asia with which UK manufacturers trade under the terms of EU free trade deals. Nevin also points out that Europe\u2019s factories are also slowing (see 9.32am for details), hit by the global slowdown. \u201cThe weakness in manufacturing output in the UK is also clearly linked to what is happening in our main trading market, the EU. Eurozone PMI remained in negative territory for the fourth consecutive month with both Germany and Italy struggling as the global economic slowdown gathers pace. \u201cThis is not a good time for our economy to be preparing to go it alone. Once again the data is showing a consistently downward trend and, in this context, continued political uncertainty at home can only make an already difficult situation worse.\u201d Britain\u2019s factories could be heading into a recession now that they\u2019re no longer scrambling to protect themselves from a cliff-edge no-deal Brexit. Capital Economics fear that the stockpiling boost that supported manufacturing earlier this year has now faded. Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, is also concerned that Britain\u2019s factories contracted last month: With one of the fastest shrinking rates seen in six and a half years and the biggest drop since July 2016, straight after the referendum result, based on this result, there is the likelihood of more bad news to come. \u201cSupply chain managers voiced their deep anxieties over Brexit\u2019s continuing impacts as some supply chains were re-directed away from the UK resulting in a drop in total new orders for the first time since October. Clients from Europe and Asia were particularly reluctant to commit to new business across all sectors but the intermediate sector suffered the worst fall in seven years as the pipeline of work dried up. It has now become obvious that the stockpiling activities of the last few months were propping up the sector\u2019s performance. The UK factory sector was buffeted by ongoing Brexit uncertainty again in May, says Rob Dobson, dragging the PMI to a near three-year low. He also fears that British manufacturing could continue to shrink in the comping months. The trend in output weakened and, based on its relationship with official ONS data, is pointing to a renewed downturn of production. \u201cNew order inflows declined from both domestic and overseas markets, as already high stock levels at manufacturers and their clients led to difficulties in sustaining output levels and getting agreement on new contracts. Demand was also impacted by ongoing global trade tensions, as well as by companies starting to unwind inventories built up in advance of the original Brexit date. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s factory sector has suffered its worst contraction since the EU referendum almost three years ago. Data firm Markit reports that new orders and employment both declined last month, hit by Brexit uncertainty and the knock-on impact of the US-China trade war. Firms also reported that they have slowed their recent flurry of stock-piling, following the latest Brexit extension to the end of October. Markit says: New order inflows deteriorated from both domestic and overseas sources. New export business fell for the second month running and at the quickest pace in over four-and-a- half years. Manufacturers reported lower demand from Asia and Europe. There was also mention of Brexit uncertainty, including clients diverting supply chains away from the UK, leading to lower demand from within the EU. This pulled Markit\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI down to 49.4 -- the lowest reading since July 2016, when factories were reeling from the Brexit vote. That\u2019s worse than the City forecast (of 52), and shows that the sector contracted in May. That suggests that Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector has weakened, which is a worrying sign for the wider economy. Reaction to follow! We have confirmation that Europe\u2019s factory sector continued to struggle last month. Data firm Markit has reported that its eurozone manufacturing PMI fell to 47.7 in May, down from 47.9 in April. That shows the sector is shrinking (as it\u2019s below the 50-point mark showing stagnation). Factory bosses reported that output and new orders continued their recent decline - a sign that trade war worries is hurting the European economy. Germany - traditionally Europe\u2019s powerhouse - suffered the sharpest contraction: Britain\u2019s smaller FTSE 250 index, is also having a bad morning - down 1% at 18,781 points. Troubled outsourcing group Kier is doing some of the damage - it has slumped by 40% this morning to a 20-year low after issuing a profits warning. Kier, which build roads and runs public sector services, says revenue growth is weaker than expected, knocking \u00a325m off profits this year. In another blow, the cost of its restructuring programme has jumped by 15%. Otherwise, energy firms and tech companies are among the top fallers on the mid-cap index, matching the moves on the FTSE 100. The sell-off is deepening in London. The FTSE 100 is now down 80 points, or over 1%, with only a handful of stocks defying gravity. Every sector has fallen, led by energy (tracking the oil price), technology (China concerns), consumer goods-makers and miners (recession fears). Online grocer Ocado is the top faller, after being downgraded by investment bank Jefferies. Morgan Stanley has also warned investors that the US-China trade war could be worse than feared. Its chief economist, Chetan Ahya, has warned that the global economy could slump into recession if president Trump expands the trade war to all Chinese exports. Ahya wrote: \u201cMy recent conversations with investors have reinforced the sense that markets are underestimating the impact of trade tensions. Investors are generally of the view that the trade dispute could drag on for longer, but they appear to be overlooking its potential impact on the global macro outlook.\u201d Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has become more pessimistic about the trade war. It now believes there\u2019s a 60% chance that America imposes tariffs on ALL Chinese goods (currently around half, or $300bn per year, are exempt from the trade war). That\u2019s up from 40% previously. In a report issued last night, Goldman economists warn: \u201cRhetoric in China has intensified... additional escalation looks likely from both sides, including tariff and non-tariff measures.\u201d European stock markets have fallen in early trading, hit by trade war anxiety. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has shed 66 points, or 0.9%, to 7095, its lowest point since mid-March. China\u2019s latest criticism of America\u2019s trade war policy (see here) is hitting sentiment in the City. The French CAC and Germany\u2019s DAX have both lost 0.75%, adding to Friday\u2019s losses (after America announced new tariffs on Mexican goods). Neil Wilson of Markets.com says a combative speech by Chinese defence minister Wei Fenghe is also hitting share prices. Global stocks were down by around 6% in May \u2013 can we get a better June? The runes are not looking great. European shares are lower today as trade tensions continue to mount and investors exhibit greater fear about the global economy and the risk of recession. Asian markets were generally lower after a big selloff on Wall Street on Friday that saw the S&amp;P 500 decline 37 points, or 1.32%, to finish at 2,752.06, below its 200-day moving average. The trade war is not cooling down; in fact, it looks like the rhetoric is heating up and further escalation seems likely. China is raising tariffs on $60bn of US goods in retaliation for tariffs, coming up with its own blacklist of foreign companies, has accused the US of resorting to \u2018intimidation and coercion\u2019, and begun an investigation into FedEx. And the Chinese defence minister says if the US wants a fight, they will \u2018fight to the end\u2019. No end in sight, and the chances of a G20 d\u00e9tente are slim. Investors are also reeling from the news that America considered beginning a trade war with Australia - a key US ally. The New York Times reported that some of Mr Trump\u2019s top trade advisers had urged the tariffs as a response to a surge of Australian aluminium flowing onto the US market during the past year. Australian PM Scott Morrison has tried to calm nerves, saying his administration is \u201cworking closely with the US officials and the White House\u201d on trade issues. That\u2019s not a denial, though, that something has been threatened..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a new month, but the same old issues. The markets are starting June as they ended May - with anxiety over US trade policy hitting asset prices and driving up volatility. Over the weekend, Beijing stepped up its fightback against Donald Trump by accusing Washington of\u201dintimidation and coercion\u201d. Vice Commerce Secretary Wang Shouwen blasted America\u2019s decision to blacklist Chinese firms such as Huawei, saying: \u201cThe China-US economic and trade consultations have been severely frustrated by the US tariff increases and [the US\u2019s] abuse of export controls by including Chinese companies on the entities list.\u201d In a new white paper on trade, China blames the US government for the failure to reach a trade deal, claiming: Resorting to intimidation and coercion, it persisted with exorbitant demands . . . and insisted on including mandatory requirements [that infringe on] China\u2019s sovereign affairs in the deal.\u201d The white paper also lays out how the trade war between the two economic powers has backfired. Bloomberg has more details: The paper contends that the trade actions have done serious harm to the U.S. economy by increasing production costs, causing prices hikes, damaging growth and people\u2019s livelihoods and creating barriers to U.S. exports to China. In short, Trump\u2019s tariffs aren\u2019t helping, China concluded. \u201cIt is foreseeable that the latest U.S. tariff hikes on China, far from resolving issues, will only make things worse for all sides,\u201d according to the white paper. And rather than backing down, China has just fulfilled its pledge to increase tariffs on $60bn of American good, in response to the latest US tariffs on Chinese goods. Asian markets have reacted badly - Japan\u2019s Nikkei has shed almost 1% today, with China\u2019s Shanghai composite also dipping. European and US markets are also expected to open in the red, ahead of new healthchecks on their factory sectors today. The oil price - a gauge of growth expectations - has taken a tumble too; Brent crude is now just $61.30 per barrel, the lowest since mid-February. Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on Mexico late last week has hit investor confidence too. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank told clients this morning that it has increased the risk that America intensifies its trade dispute with Europe. One of the additional worries would be that if the US has been so quick to escalate the trade war on these two countries [Mexico and China] the bar must be a bit lower to carry out a trade assault on Europe at some point in the future. Interesting times. The latest PMI reports, due today, will show whether manufacturers took a big hit from the trade war last month.

Airlines operating the affected NG planes need to remove faulty parts within 10 days, but can continue to operate them in the meantime. However, the wider worries around the 737 Max led to a $1bn (\u00a3790m) order being put on hold on Monday, as the Azerbaijan airline AZAL postponed an order for 10 planes. Boeing has yet to finalise a software upgrade, which it hopes will convince regulators that it is safe for the plane to return to the skies. Although investigations continue, a controversial automated anti-stall system, MCAS, has been implicated in both crashes. Last week, the head of the global airline trade body, IATA, said it would be at least August before the all clear was given, with regulators outside the US having indicated that they will also expect to give separate clearance rather than accept the FAA ruling. However, Tim Clark, the president of Emirates, told reporters at IATA\u2019s AGM in Seoul that it could take six months to restore 737 Max operations, saying: \u201cIf it is in the air by Christmas, I\u2019ll be surprised.\u201d",

The length of the total path travelled therefore is the distance between chaser and chasee at the start, which is the side of the square.</p> <p>Here\u2019s another way to think about it, suggests Steven Strogatz, author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WkHCba\">Infinite Powers</a>, who suggested the puzzle. Imagine a dog has a GoPro on its head. The footage of its pursuit of its neighbouring dog along the spiral path would be exactly the same, and take the same time as, the footage of the dog if all it did was run directly along the edge of the square to a stationary dog.

In each of those cases, the dogs are not moving perpendicular to each other at any stage.

We need to work out how much of the velocity is taking the chasee towards or away from the chaser.

Following the criticism, McVey hit back, saying her position was not controversial. Asked on the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire programme about her comments, McVey said: \u201cThese were very young children in primary schools and I said the people who should know whether it is age-relevant are the parents not the state. \u201cI believe that parents with very young children \u2026 four- and five-year-olds, and I would say that is a young child \u2026 their parents know for their child what is age-relevant. \u201cAnd by the way, this is not controversial.

The local council secured an interim high court injunction banning protests from taking place within an exclusion zone around the site. The interim injunction covers the streets immediately surrounding the school and bars protesters from printing or distributing leaflets, inviting others to protest and encouraging people to congregate at the entrance. The protesters will have a chance to make their case to a judge next Monday. The order, published on the council\u2019s website, also prohibits the use of social media to make offensive or abusive comments about staff members. The move follows weeks of protests at various schools over the adoption of a programme designed to teach children about characteristics protected by the Equality Act.

You see, in the bizarre sociological experiment that is my life, I have had one child or another in school for about 27 years, and my youngest finishes next week. I have done my time. Obviously I sacrificed my offspring for the sake of my political principles, so these were state schools, of course. I never, ever want to hear another person saying they believe in state education \u2013 but just not for their very special child. Pray that I never need to inhale the stench of that angsty hypocrisy again while some dolt explains it is only \u201cnatural\u201d to want the best for one\u2019s children \u2013 as though I want the worst for mine.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Gentrification is there in the class pictures.

      "bodyText": "School\u2019s out for ever. Just one more week and I will be free. FREE! I cannot tell you how I long for the end of school. You see, in the bizarre sociological experiment that is my life, I have had one child or another in school for about 27 years, and my youngest finishes next week. I have done my time. Obviously I sacrificed my offspring for the sake of my political principles, so these were state schools, of course. I never, ever want to hear another person saying they believe in state education \u2013 but just not for their very special child. Pray that I never need to inhale the stench of that angsty hypocrisy again while some dolt explains it is only \u201cnatural\u201d to want the best for one\u2019s children \u2013 as though I want the worst for mine. Not only do I not understand segregating one\u2019s child in a reinforced bubble; I don\u2019t even like school. It wasn\u2019t my thing as a child. Why would it be as a parent? Why do I have to pretend? If you don\u2019t like school, then these really are not the best days of your life. It all feels like a constant interruption of who you are, and no amount of motivational talks on \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d changes that. As a parent I have watched the evolution of a particular kind of misery that we now impose in the name of \u201cstandards\u201d, under both Labour and Tory governments: the slow squeezing of joy from the curriculum, the reduction of art and music, the decimation of languages, the erasing of creativity in the humanities. I have heard of teachers burning out or going under. The one who used to make each kid stand outside for five minutes, because she would not teach a class with more than 30 pupils. The one who used to sob his way through history. The one who gave them all vodka. All of them gone, replaced by \u201creply teachers\u201d as my children called them. Sad, yes, but I am not sad that I will never have to go to another parents\u2019 evening complete with a list of instructions: \u201cDon\u2019t say anything, don\u2019t make faces, don\u2019t be embarrassing.\u201d No more school quizzes or PTA meetings \u2013 or Tinder for people who can\u2019t be bothered, as I call them.

      "body": "<h2>KLOPP (NEARLY) RUNNETH OVER</h2> <p>More than half a million people are estimated to have lined the streets of Liverpool (population: 552,000) on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2019/jun/03/liverpool-parade-champions-league-trophy-to-ecstatic-fans-video\">to welcome home J\u00fcrgen Klopp and his team of Big Cup winners</a> after their win over Tottenham Hotspur in Madrid on Saturday night. To put that in context, a comparatively paltry 250,000 protestors are expected to converge on the streets of London (population: eight million) to ridicule, mock and barrack the obnoxious, lying, narcissist Donald Trump on his official visit to the UK. While the Fiver\u2019s not so good at sums, even we can tell this proves a hell of a lot more UK citizens chose to turn up to show their appreciation for Klopp and his players than can be bothered to demonstrate their contempt for the current president of the USA. And when you consider just how deeply unpopular that particular whinging, narcissistic man-baby is, you\u2019ve got to say Liverpool\u2019s win has been very well received indeed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2019/jun/03/brilliant-liverpool-are-kings-of-europe-once-again-football-weekly\">Brilliant Liverpool are kings of Europe once again \u2013 Football Weekly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While POTUS whiled away the minutes between touching down in Airforce One and stepping on to the tarmac firing off angry, abusive tweets about the Mayor of London and CNN, Klopp appeared to make better use of his time when Big Cup VI was winging its way from Madrid to Merseyside. Over-served and well refreshed, the Liverpool manager will probably forgive The Fiver for suggesting he may have been completely paralytic by the time the victory parade got under way and sat giggling to himself, swigging from a bottle of lager, singing Salt-N-Pepa songs and coming perilously close to becoming the first manager in football history to meet a grisly end by falling off the top deck of his own team\u2019s open-top victory parade bus. \u201cI cannot really describe it because I cried a little bit as well because it\u2019s so overwhelming what the people are doing,\u201d said a tired and very emotional Klopp. \u201cWhen you have a direct eye contact and you see how much it means to them that\u2019s touching to be honest.

      "bodyText": "KLOPP (NEARLY) RUNNETH OVER More than half a million people are estimated to have lined the streets of Liverpool (population: 552,000) on Sunday to welcome home J\u00fcrgen Klopp and his team of Big Cup winners after their win over Tottenham Hotspur in Madrid on Saturday night. To put that in context, a comparatively paltry 250,000 protestors are expected to converge on the streets of London (population: eight million) to ridicule, mock and barrack the obnoxious, lying, narcissist Donald Trump on his official visit to the UK. While the Fiver\u2019s not so good at sums, even we can tell this proves a hell of a lot more UK citizens chose to turn up to show their appreciation for Klopp and his players than can be bothered to demonstrate their contempt for the current president of the USA. And when you consider just how deeply unpopular that particular whinging, narcissistic man-baby is, you\u2019ve got to say Liverpool\u2019s win has been very well received indeed. While POTUS whiled away the minutes between touching down in Airforce One and stepping on to the tarmac firing off angry, abusive tweets about the Mayor of London and CNN, Klopp appeared to make better use of his time when Big Cup VI was winging its way from Madrid to Merseyside. Over-served and well refreshed, the Liverpool manager will probably forgive The Fiver for suggesting he may have been completely paralytic by the time the victory parade got under way and sat giggling to himself, swigging from a bottle of lager, singing Salt-N-Pepa songs and coming perilously close to becoming the first manager in football history to meet a grisly end by falling off the top deck of his own team\u2019s open-top victory parade bus. \u201cI cannot really describe it because I cried a little bit as well because it\u2019s so overwhelming what the people are doing,\u201d said a tired and very emotional Klopp. \u201cWhen you have a direct eye contact and you see how much it means to them that\u2019s touching to be honest. It\u2019s brilliant.\u201d Meanwhile in the Spurs camp, things were more melancholy although their likeable manager was as gracious in defeat as the aforementioned American president is ungracious in ... well, everything. \u201cIt is so painful but at the same time we have to be calm and be proud,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to congratulate Liverpool too. They did a fantastic season. You want to experience this again and repeat it. It is the best game in the world after the World Cup.\u201d The biggest, maybe, but while Liverpool fans won\u2019t care, the decidedly dreary spectacle that unfolded on the pitch on Madrid on Saturday certainly couldn\u2019t be accused of being anywhere near the best. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI\u2019m sorry but he was over the hill\u201d \u2013 Louis van Gaal gets his chat on with Big Website about Wayne Rooney, Manchester United, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and \u2026 well, let\u2019s just say he\u2019s getting quite a lot off his chest here. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Max got everyone out of bed early again to record the pod, so the least you can do is listen. FIVER LETTERS \u201cThese beauties are still on sale for an eye-watering \u00a355, I\u2019m predicting they\u2019ll be down to \u00a35 by the end of the week\u201d \u2013 Tony Crawford. \u201cHaving printed his letter twice last week, it\u2019s third time lucky for Johnny Connelly and his quest for prizeless letter o\u2019 the day on Monday then. Admittedly it is an amusing viewpoint\u201d \u2013 Johnny Mac. \u201cLetter for publication: Uefa are to be commended for their noble mitigation of fan attendance at Big Vase final. Who\u2019d have thought that the lion\u2019s share of the 2,800 mile journey would be due to the pitch being roughly 2,400 miles away from the stand? A rare win for the armchair pundits on this occasion, provided you managed to avoid the vertigo brought on by the funny camera angles\u201d \u2013 Joe Lowry. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Joe Lowry. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS The Leyton Orient manager Justin Edinburgh is in hospital after unexpectedly falling ill. European Leagues chief suit Lars-Christer Olsson reckons Uefa should take a gigantic jug of cold water and pour it all over greedy clubs\u2019 plans to reshape Big Cup. \u201cThis closed shop is a proposal for the richest clubs to get even wealthier. This is an attempt to form a super league, absolutely,\u201d he roared. West Ham have increased their bid for Barcelona dreamboat Andr\u00e9 Gomes to \u00a320m in the hope that he will choose them over Everton or whoever else went weak at the knees watching him last season. Wydad Casablanca want Caf to investigate the controversial end to the African Big Cup final which was awarded to Esp\u00e9rance after Wydad players refused to play on when VAR was not consulted over a decision to disallow a possible equaliser. \u201cWe are calling for a fair investigation to save the image of football in Africa which was terribly tarnished,\u201d fumed Wydad chief suit Sa\u00efd Naciri. And Philippe Hes, the striker who scored no goals all season for Dutch non-league side AFC Amsterdam, has responded to videos from Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Ruud Gullit and other footballing luminaries who poked fun at him after being egged on by AFC players. \u201cI think the films are very funny, but they are also d!cks,\u201d he parped. STILL WANT MORE? Our latest preview on the Women\u2019s World Cup features Japan. Yoshinori Ebashi on their exciting (but haphazard) tactics and Hikaru Naomoto, the midfielder with a phobia of stink bugs. Suzanne Wrack, meanwhile, has the lowdown on Scotland, who could spring a surprise in France. And Suzanne has also written this fine piece on the tournament as a whole, and why it is harder than ever to pick a winner for the most anticipated World Cup in history, as well as an article on England and why a win a decade ago could play a big part in 2019. Basically, she\u2019s been quite busy. Oh, and do tell us your hopes, dreams, fears and thoughts for the tournament in France, via this handy online form. The best responses will be published later this week. It\u2019s the Adam and Erics 2019! Their comprehensive roundup of the Ligue 1 season sees much praise for Jos\u00e9 Fonte and some stern words for Nacer Chadli. Drab and dreadful: Richard Williams on why domestic duels in European finals just don\u2019t work. Banned former Uefa president Michel Platini claims there was a plot to stop him taking the top job at Fifa. Proper Journalism\u2019s David Conn has more. And Barry Glendenning on Gareth Bale and his gilded cage, and how the Welshman compares to Mesut \u00d6zil and Alexis S\u00e1nchez.

      "bodyText": "Enough of the Donald Trump clown show. Too much of the critique of the US incumbent focuses on his vulgarity, his outrageousness, his supposed demeaning of his office, because being presidential traditionally means observing social norms while raining missiles on black and brown people in foreign climes. From the moment the Trump phenomenon became a \u201chave you heard what he just said?!\u201d circus, from the Republican primaries to the presidential election onwards, it served his purpose: it allowed him to frame the debate, such as it is, on his own terms. When protesters gather in Trafalgar Square on Tuesday, their placards will of course be full of righteous anger over Trump\u2019s record. The \u201cpussy grabbing\u201d misogynist, the man who described neo-Nazis and white supremacists as \u201cfine people\u201d, who retweeted the anti-Muslim propaganda of a British far-right organisation, who called for a ban on Muslims entering the US and then imposed it to the degree the law allowed, who separated children from their parents at the border. But the protests will not simply focus on Trump, the man, but rather on what Trump represents. The far right \u2013 directly emboldened and legitimised by Trump \u2013 is on the ascendancy from Brazil to Hungary, Spain to Sweden. In our country, the hard-right Brexit party is on the rise: Ann Widdecombe, one of their leading lights, this weekend suggested that \u201cscience may produce an answer\u201d to being gay, underlining how this political force threatens to reopen debates about the rights of minorities which were supposedly settled long ago. The anti-Muslim bigotry so vulgarly displayed by Trump is on the rise across the western world: in our own country, the Tories are infested with Islamophobia, and much of our media promote and incite it. Trump\u2019s administration has led a full-frontal assault on trans people, from banning trans soldiers from serving, to attempting to define trans people out of existence. But let\u2019s not pretend that anti-trans bigotry isn\u2019t rampant in the British media: it has even been indulged even in supposedly liberal media. A possible war with Iran beckons: in a fateful echo of the calamitous invasion of Iraq, the risk of British involvement is clearly high. The British government has stood along the US presidency in backing and arming the Saudi dictatorship to the teeth as it rains bombs on Yemen, plunging the country into the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth. A climate emergency \u2013 worsened by Trump pulling the US, the biggest polluter in human history, out of the Paris agreement \u2013 threatens us all, but that doesn\u2019t mean Britain should not be taking far more radical action. There are direct and immediate dangers, of course. The US ambassador made it clear that a trade deal would put our NHS on the block, to be chopped up and fed to hungry, circling US multinationals.

There\u2019s always more you can do, moments you can finesse. You always feel, Oh, just one more week.\u201d</p> <p>How about five more? For most theatres, an eight-week rehearsal represents an impossible luxury, but for RSC artistic director Greg Doran, whose directing career has unfolded in Stratford, and for whom Measure for Measure is his 28th Shakespeare, this is what he knows. Running a hand through his luxuriantly greyed mane, he outlines the process. In the first week, the actors read and discuss the text, translating it into modern English. No one speaks their own lines, so they all imbibe the wider play. Then, scene by scene they develop the show\u2019s architecture (\u201cthe big skeleton\u201d). Over eight weeks, ideas marinate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c6cb175a7c9533f2cf4060d3c46d8eff754e01a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c6cb175a7c9533f2cf4060d3c46d8eff754e01a/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"RSC artistic director Greg Doran in rehearsals for Measure for Measure\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This 400-year-old language is difficult!\u2019 ...

At every pause, he tenderly nestles the mandolin in its case \u2013 so it\u2019s upsetting to read, only a couple of days later, that the 129-year-old instrument was <a href=\"https://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/captain-corellis-mandolin-tour-lost_48782.html\">lost on a train</a> and hasn\u2019t been seen since.

Kenneth Macharia, whose plight prompted more than 100,000 people to sign a petition calling on the Home Office to halt his removal, has been told he must now leave the country \u201cwithout delay\u201d. The 39-year-old \u2013 who plays for Bristol Bisons, a gay and inclusive rugby club \u2013 says he is \u201cfeeling depressed\u201d at the decision, which came as a big surprise, adding: \u201cI am feeling hopeless at the moment.\u201d A Home Office decision letter sent to Macharia\u2019s solicitor acknowledged that gay sex in Kenya was punishable by up to 21 years in prison and that LGBT people have reportedly been subjected to harassment, blackmail and rape. However, the letter added: \u201cWhilst same-sexual activity between men has been criminalised with a penalty of up to 21 years in prison this law is rarely applied and the objective evidence does not establish that LGBT persons are likely to be subjected to persecution or serious harm.\u201d The Home Office\u2019s decision comes days after Kenya\u2019s high court last month upheld laws that criminalise gay sex in what was described by a campaigner as a \u201ca sad day for the rule of law and human rights\u201d. Macharia, who first claimed asylum in May 2016, arrived in the UK on a student visa in 2009. Macharia, a mechanical design engineer, has twice been granted extensions of his leave to remain, as a student and then as a highly skilled migrant. He has been through a legal appeals process, which has dragged on for several years.

In its decision, the Home Office also cited its own March 2017 document on \u201csexual orientation and gender identity\u201d in Kenya, which noted that although \u201csame-sex sexual activity between men is criminalised with a penalty of up to 21 years in prison \u2026 it is not clear if there have been any convictions\u201d.

Here\u2019s our roundup of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/feb/25/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/may/27/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos </a>from last week.</p> <p>Jack Kerouac\u2019s On The Road changed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2599444\">dylan37</a>. Here\u2019s why:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Recently had one of those brilliant moments that any literature loving parent will treasure. My youngest son, 16, expressed an interest in what\u2019s on my book shelves, and asked for some recommendations. Where to start? Anywhere; excited, energised and thrilled.</p> <p>I read On The Road straight through one hot summer night when I was 16. I finished the last few pages as the early blue morning arrived gently. And I was changed. The book had an amazing effect on me, and I dedicated the next few years of my life to travelling, experiencing, writing, being, and living what I thought life was all about to the absolute maximum.</p> <p>I\u2019ve read it a few times again over the last 30 years, and my attitude to it has changed considerably. I\u2019m aware now that it was always out of time and out of step; a book popular in the 60s, written in the 50s about the 40s. I came to it in the 80s. There are still breathtaking passages of sparkling writing, wonderful imagery and a unique energy and beat. But Dean Moriarty is no longer a hero, and a bit of life experience showed me how callow, false, duplicitous and selfish he was - dying a drugged up death on the railroad before middle age - a dismal end to a life of taking everything and giving nothing. And Sal Paradise was an observer, hanging around and only ever half taking part. Kerouac, himself, died at 47, after years of bitter alcoholism and living with his mother.</p> <p>I still think it\u2019s one of the greatest books of the 20th century, and my changing attitude and reaction to it and its story won\u2019t diminish that greatness. I\u2019ll be fascinated to learn what my 21st century boy makes of it.</p> </blockquote> <p>We\u2019ll be fascinated to hear about it here too. Elsewhere, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13903364\">25aubrey </a>has just finished William Peter Blatty\u2019s The Exorcist:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Never thought I\u2019d say this, but every page is as good as every scene in the movie. Powerfully gripping, one of those rare books that become welded to your finger tips.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cVoluptuousness rampant\u201d now, as <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4515468\">vermontlogger</a> reports on Zola\u2019s Nana:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s a highly coloured story of voluptuousness rampant, hurricanes of extravagance, and unhesitating deception all round, with not one honest character, except at moments Nana herself - superbe fille, superbly realized - who is at least forthright about her desires. The writing seems to be freer than in earlier volumes, less drawn from notes, as if it came more easily to him to imagine conversations in the louche world of theatre types and demi-mondaines. This being Zola, there are some very dark passages too, including the final great tableau which neatly ties up a number of story lines amid the noise and alarums of approaching war.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI read Superior: the return of Race Science by Angela Saini in one sitting yesterday,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4660292\">gavernism</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was in turns worried, educated, and fascinated by it. Saini takes you step by step through the history of eugenics and phrenology. She shows the worrisome return of certain theories from the late 19th century that seem to be revivified by a cross current of factors. It\u2019s a real thought provoker and I would like to recommend everyone read it, if only to see if you agree with me that it is clearly a timely and possibly timeless book.</p> </blockquote> <p>The \u201csensational\u201d Lady Audley\u2019s Secret by Mary Elizabeth Braddon has impressed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13472965\">SydneyH</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The author is often paired with Wilkie Collins, but in style and content this novel is a match with <em>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</em> by Dickens. I think the text is often noted for its plot, but what is probably under-acknowledged is that the prose is gorgeous. I don\u2019t want to say too much, because it is a mystery after all, but this is the best book I\u2019ve read so far this year.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2472367\">Brobat </a>recommends Thomas Mann\u2019s Buddenbrooks:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mann\u2019s attention to detail is microscopic, not only does he take you on a voyage into the human history of history a family\u2019s life, but the circumstances in which it lives - right down to the design of the upholstery of the furniture. You may think this rather dense stuff, but once you get all these details, you get drawn into the fabulous world which Mann depicts.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, let\u2019s hand it over to <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1905753\">Besonders </a>who has written an extraordinary summary of War And Peace:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This book is very similar to Pride And Prejudice, if Jane Austen had written Pride And Prejudice for an Eastenders storyline, with all the characters belonging to high society, fretting about Brexit, and if all of Europe and its neighbours were trying to settle Brexit by battles between their armies and coalitions of armies.</p> <p>The novel is divided into five books, each book divided into three or four parts, each part divided into chapters of two or three pages. My copy is 1212 pages long, not including the epilogues.</p> <p>Book three, part one, chapter seven ends with \u201cAnd then the war began\u2026\u201d Literally \u201c\u2026\u201d \u2013 like a sequel is in production. In my copy that\u2019s on page 672.</p> <p>Book three, part two, chapter 29 ends with \u201cThe first shots\u201d. That\u2019s on page 845.</p> <p>That\u2019s 173 pages between the war beginning and the first shots. (Well, the first shots that are part of the novel\u2019s action). And all 173 pages are brilliant.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fantastic.

Finally, let\u2019s hand it over to Besonders who has written an extraordinary summary of War And Peace: This book is very similar to Pride And Prejudice, if Jane Austen had written Pride And Prejudice for an Eastenders storyline, with all the characters belonging to high society, fretting about Brexit, and if all of Europe and its neighbours were trying to settle Brexit by battles between their armies and coalitions of armies. The novel is divided into five books, each book divided into three or four parts, each part divided into chapters of two or three pages. My copy is 1212 pages long, not including the epilogues. Book three, part one, chapter seven ends with \u201cAnd then the war began\u2026\u201d Literally \u201c\u2026\u201d \u2013 like a sequel is in production. In my copy that\u2019s on page 672. Book three, part two, chapter 29 ends with \u201cThe first shots\u201d. That\u2019s on page 845. That\u2019s 173 pages between the war beginning and the first shots. (Well, the first shots that are part of the novel\u2019s action). And all 173 pages are brilliant. Fantastic. Makes it sound like the book isn\u2019t long enough\u2026 Interesting links about books and reading \u201cI\u2019m a grammar-school boy, I do my homework.\u201d Geoff Dyer on the art of non-fiction.

Across Argentina it has integrated itself into the mainstream labour movement, decriminalised sex work in some provinces, and provided peer-to-peer support for more than 20 years. But Macri\u2019s economic policies \u2013 including accepting the largest loan package ever issued by the IMF ($57.1bn) \u2013 have renewed Argentina\u2019s status as the most indebted country in Latin America. Conditions attached to the mammoth IMF loan threaten to roll back the gains that Ammar and other grassroots organisations have made since the last crisis of 2001.</p> <p>Argentinians, however, have never taken things sitting down. On 1 May the fifth general strike against \u201cMacrismo\u201d brought the capital city to a standstill. And women are in open revolt.

The campaign for legal, free and safe abortion has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/aug/07/argentina-abortion-vote-legalisation-senate-mass-rally\">brought millions of women</a> on to the streets, time and time again. Since integrating themselves into the labour movement, women in Ammar have also become increasingly visible in this effervescent feminist movement, taking the stage at women\u2019s assemblies, participating in the national women\u2019s meetings that attract tens of thousands of women from across the country, and building the Women\u2019s Strike which happened on 8 March.</p> <p>The parallels with the UK are striking. We too have been undergoing a massive programme of cuts for over a decade, with the burden <a href=\"http://www.feministfightback.org.uk/why-cuts-are-a-feminist-issue/\">falling disproportionately on the shoulders of women</a>. Significant numbers of women have turned to sex work due to <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/EPoverty/UnitedKingdom/2018/NGOS/English_CollectiveofProstitutes.pdf\">benefits sanctions</a> and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/public-sector-workers-sex-work-prostitution-austerity-cuts-study-a8763016.html\">public sector wage freezes</a>, and the precarious nature of sex work has increasingly come to characterise many of our contemporary experiences of work.</p> <p>Yet despite existing at the coalface of austerity, feminists in the UK have been slow to embrace sex workers as sisters in the struggle against gender and economic injustice. A <a href=\"http://www.feministfightback.org.uk/tag/sex-work/\">small number of groups</a> have stood shoulder to shoulder with sex workers, but the story has largely been one of violence and exclusion.

      "bodyText": "\u201cPuta Feminista\u201d (Feminist Whore) reads the banner taped to the wall, as women stream through the door at the Casa Roja. Freshly painted, the bright red casa is in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Constituci\u00f3n, in the heart of the red-light district. After today, it will be the new centre for Ammar \u2013 the Argentina\u2019s Women\u2019s Sex Workers\u2019 Union. On any one day, up to 200 women arrive \u2013 morning, noon and night \u2013 to find clients on the corners of the neighbourhood. Lilian, 55, has been a sex worker for 20 years. She stopped working, but has been forced to return to the streets of Constituci\u00f3n to make ends meet. \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of a total crisis,\u201d she says. \u201cWe used to work four to five hours a day. Now it\u2019s 12, including on Saturdays and Sundays, just to cover the basic necessities.\u201d Dramatic inflation (which reached nearly 50% last year), combined with a reduction in subsidies by the rightwing government under Mauricio Macri and at the behest of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have sent the cost of basic foodstuffs, electricity and water spiralling. A third of the population are living in poverty. Women are disproportionately affected: almost 50% of women are either unemployed or working informally without labour protection or a security net, and cuts to public sector jobs have been most pernicious in feminised occupations. Despite the need to dramatically increase their income in the face of the rampant inflation, Georgina Orellano, general secretary of Ammar, says that \u201cworkers\u2019 wages haven\u2019t kept up, so we\u2019ve had to freeze our prices\u201d. To try to improve conditions for sex workers, Ammar opened the doors of the Casa Roja on 2 June, International Sex Worker Day. The centre will offer health and mental health services and a place to drink coffee as winter draws in. Importantly, says Valeria, an Ammar activist who works in Constituci\u00f3n, \u201cThere will also be legal assistance, so that the women know their rights.\u201d In the face of increasingly punitive policing in the area, such support will be invaluable. Ammar has been one of the most successful sex workers\u2019 organisations in the world. Across Argentina it has integrated itself into the mainstream labour movement, decriminalised sex work in some provinces, and provided peer-to-peer support for more than 20 years. But Macri\u2019s economic policies \u2013 including accepting the largest loan package ever issued by the IMF ($57.1bn) \u2013 have renewed Argentina\u2019s status as the most indebted country in Latin America. Conditions attached to the mammoth IMF loan threaten to roll back the gains that Ammar and other grassroots organisations have made since the last crisis of 2001. Argentinians, however, have never taken things sitting down. On 1 May the fifth general strike against \u201cMacrismo\u201d brought the capital city to a standstill. And women are in open revolt. Rebelling against interpersonal violence in their homes and on the streets, and the economic violence of structural adjustment, the NiUnaMenos (not one woman more) movement burst on to the scene in 2015. The campaign for legal, free and safe abortion has brought millions of women on to the streets, time and time again. Since integrating themselves into the labour movement, women in Ammar have also become increasingly visible in this effervescent feminist movement, taking the stage at women\u2019s assemblies, participating in the national women\u2019s meetings that attract tens of thousands of women from across the country, and building the Women\u2019s Strike which happened on 8 March. The parallels with the UK are striking. We too have been undergoing a massive programme of cuts for over a decade, with the burden falling disproportionately on the shoulders of women. Significant numbers of women have turned to sex work due to benefits sanctions and public sector wage freezes, and the precarious nature of sex work has increasingly come to characterise many of our contemporary experiences of work. Yet despite existing at the coalface of austerity, feminists in the UK have been slow to embrace sex workers as sisters in the struggle against gender and economic injustice. A small number of groups have stood shoulder to shoulder with sex workers, but the story has largely been one of violence and exclusion. Feminists who want to prohibit sex work have refused entry to sex workers to their conferences, leaving them standing in car parks in the rain; voted down motions in the TUC to make sex work safer; filmed sex workers without their consent and regularly denounced sex workers as \u201cpimps\u201d for trying to improve their working conditions. As the Argentinian experience shows us, sex workers have a privileged position from which to teach us about gendered violence and women\u2019s work. This is why the UK Women\u2019s Strike movement called for a \u201csex/work strike\u201d on 8 March \u2013 International Women\u2019s Day \u2013 placing sex workers centre stage at the heart of the day of action. The Women\u2019s Strike recognises that to create a strong and vibrant women\u2019s movement, economic justice must be prioritised, and sex workers must be at the heart of our struggles. As sex workers begin to unionise in their workplaces and as austerity cuts ever deeper feminists must get onboard with sex workers\u2019 rights. When sex workers speak, we must listen. \u2022 Kate Hardy is associate professor of work and employment relations at the University of Leeds \u2022 Ammar members used money from their own sex work to pay for expenses to set up the Casa Roja.

According to findings published on Monday by the Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC), an international corporate watchdog, only four of the world\u2019s 35 largest tuna retail brands said they conducted due diligence with the specific aim of uncovering modern slavery in their supply chains. Of the brands surveyed for the report who responded, only 20% said they had mapped out their supply chains in full, and just 8% stated that they require their subcontractors to enforce their modern slavery policies throughout their supply chains. The report\u2019s findings are likely to raise questions over claims by tuna brands that they are committed to tackling human rights abuses in their supply chains. The Pacific Ocean is home to the world\u2019s largest tuna fisheries, where catches amounted to $22bn (\u00a317.3bn) in 2014.

      "bodyText": "In 2013, a cure was found for hepatitis C. It could save millions of lives, but its price tag of between $40,000 and $84,000 for 84 pills puts it far out of most patients\u2019 reach. In India, however, a generic version of the drug is available for less than $1,000. Denied the affordable medication he needed, Greg Jefferys defied the US pharmaceutical company that holds the patent to set up a worldwide supply network for the generic version. Buyers Club charts his story. It tells a tale of global solidarity to make life-saving drugs more affordable, from Jefferys\u2019 home in Tasmania to India, where his suppliers dodge government regulations to ship it to nearly every country in the world, and Sweden, where one man seeks a cure for a disease that reminds him of a past he wants to forget. Buyers Club is commissioned as part of the Guardian Bertha documentary partnership, which aims to tell international stories with global impact. The director, Mandakini Gahlot, is a journalist and filmmaker based in Delhi. She works with Babel Press, a production agency that creates high quality television documentaries for clients across the world. Her work has appeared in the Washington Post, the Globe and Mail, GlobalPost, USA Today, Al Jazeera, Arte TV, Canal+ and France 24. The producer, Thomas Ellis, is a producer and co-founder of Babel Press. Coming up: Trapped in the City of a Thousand Mountains In the Chinese city of Chongqing, rappers making trap music try to figure out what can and cannot be done since the introduction of new censorship laws that forbid any form of improvisation.

Quite frankly, we were petrified of those dogs.\u201d</p> <p>However, during these sessions a seed was planted \u2013 and, ever since, the self-confessed \u201ccricket anorak\u201d has kept both eyes fixed on the sport.</p> <p>The 49-year-old was named <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxkJqBkC5tg\" rel=\"nofollow\">2018 Street Coach of the Year</a> at the Chance to Shine awards ceremony at Lord\u2019s cricket ground.

The side he led won the County Championships and went to the north-west finals at Old Trafford in 1984.</p> <p>He says his coach\u2019s impact was profound. \u201cHe was a church-goer and he instilled in us a sense of fair play and the importance of respecting the umpire\u2019s decision.</p> <p>\u201cThese values went beyond cricket \u2013 they were instrumental to my development as a human being. Cricket taught me to have compassion, tolerance and a sense of fair play and respect. I try to replicate that in my Chance to Shine sessions.\u201d</p> <p>He first became interested in coaching around the age of 18. Within a year he was coaching the under-18 side, while continuing to play. He renamed the youth section Clitheroe Cobras and injected energy into the venture, even creating branded clothing for the kids.</p> <p>He took the players on tours and launched a girls\u2019 team in the Lancashire league. Sky Sports made a documentary about the team and awards followed. The Lancashire cricket board also noticed the buzz and introduced Hussain to Chance to Shine, the national cricket charity that works in state schools and communities across England and Wales.</p> <p>The charity invited Hussain to launch a programme in Blackburn, which proved to be an eye-opening experience for him. \u201cUp until then I\u2019d worked with white, middle-class, privileged children for 20 years,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cBut with Chance to Shine I began to work with kids who came from poorer backgrounds, who had less parental support, and very few opportunities.

      "bodyText": "When Farouk Hussain first played cricket at the age of six he could only keep one eye on the game \u2013 he used the other one to watch out for trouble. Hussain and his friends would walk to a nearby factory, chalk a wicket on to its big wall, and play street cricket with a tennis ball. They had such fun, but the neighbours weren\u2019t so keen. \u201cWe\u2019d play for a few minutes, but then someone would come out to complain, so we\u2019d have to leg it and wait for them to go back into their house,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had to have one eye on the game and one eye on the doors of the local houses, so we could get away when they came out with their dogs. Quite frankly, we were petrified of those dogs.\u201d However, during these sessions a seed was planted \u2013 and, ever since, the self-confessed \u201ccricket anorak\u201d has kept both eyes fixed on the sport. The 49-year-old was named 2018 Street Coach of the Year at the Chance to Shine awards ceremony at Lord\u2019s cricket ground. It capped an inspiring journey for the man whose passion for the sport began with those impromptu games of street cricket, and who wants to ensure more children get involved in the game. The backing from partners such as NatWest is \u201cmassively important\u201d to Chance to Shine, he says, because the children who come to his programme would be \u201clost\u201d without it. \u201cIt\u2019s given them so many experiences, and it keeps them occupied and healthy.\u201d Hussain played in his primary school\u2019s team and, during a local tournament, a coach spotted his talent and asked him to join Clitheroe Cricket Club. There, Hussain, a bowler, and his wicketkeeper friend formed a formidable axis. \u201cWe were like the Shane Warne and Ian Healy of the team,\u201d smiles Hussain, remembering how the scorecards seemed to forever feature the legend: \u201cCaught Amin, bowled Hussain.\u201d He was the captain of the junior team, the under-11s, under-13s, the under-15s and onwards. The side he led won the County Championships and went to the north-west finals at Old Trafford in 1984. He says his coach\u2019s impact was profound. \u201cHe was a church-goer and he instilled in us a sense of fair play and the importance of respecting the umpire\u2019s decision. \u201cThese values went beyond cricket \u2013 they were instrumental to my development as a human being. Cricket taught me to have compassion, tolerance and a sense of fair play and respect. I try to replicate that in my Chance to Shine sessions.\u201d He first became interested in coaching around the age of 18. Within a year he was coaching the under-18 side, while continuing to play. He renamed the youth section Clitheroe Cobras and injected energy into the venture, even creating branded clothing for the kids. He took the players on tours and launched a girls\u2019 team in the Lancashire league. Sky Sports made a documentary about the team and awards followed. The Lancashire cricket board also noticed the buzz and introduced Hussain to Chance to Shine, the national cricket charity that works in state schools and communities across England and Wales. The charity invited Hussain to launch a programme in Blackburn, which proved to be an eye-opening experience for him. \u201cUp until then I\u2019d worked with white, middle-class, privileged children for 20 years,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with Chance to Shine I began to work with kids who came from poorer backgrounds, who had less parental support, and very few opportunities. Their needs were far greater. It seemed the ideal thing for me to get my teeth into.\u201d He now runs four projects in the Blackburn area. The main project is at Audley junior school, where he takes a \u201cfast and furious\u201d approach to keep the children involved and avoid them becoming bored by the \u201cstatic\u201d element of the game. There\u2019s little chance of anyone being bored by Hussain, however \u2013 he is an electrifying man. At the Audley sessions, he dishes out high fives to the kids and celebrates successes as if the team has won the World Cup. \u201cI try to meet them at their level and keep them enthusiastic,\u201d he says. \u201cI treat every child as if they are my own, and my dream is that one day they will pass their experiences with me on to their own children.\u201d Hussain says he wants to avoid the \u201celitism you sometimes find in club environments\u201d and instead aims for the guiding principle of Chance to Shine: inclusivity. \u201cChance to Shine has been an absolute godsend for these children,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI get a great buzz out of it too. When a kid catches the ball or hits the ball, and I see the look of satisfaction on their faces, it\u2019s just priceless.\u201d Looking ahead, he says he is dreaming up new projects and is \u201cbubbling\u201d with ideas. \u201cI\u2019m not one to sit still,\u201d he says.

      "body": "<p>Transcribing an interview recording is usually a chore, but this one I enjoyed. Not only because the subject of the interview \u2013 <a href=\"https://carolinecrampton.com/\" title=\"\">the writer and journalist Caroline Crampton</a> \u2013 says some fascinating things about the Thames estuary, the subject of <a href=\"https://carolinecrampton.com/book/\" title=\"\">her excellent </a><a href=\"https://carolinecrampton.com/book/\" title=\"\">book</a>, but also because of the other stuff going on: the honking from a V-squadron of low-flying geese; the morose, shrill piping of an oystercatcher; the summery burbling of a skylark.</p> <p>We haven\u2019t even reached the venue she has chosen for our interview, Cliffe Fort, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/dec/21/walking-north-kent-marshes-hoo-peninsula-charles-dickens\" title=\"\">on the Hoo </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/dec/21/walking-north-kent-marshes-hoo-peninsula-charles-dickens\" title=\"\">peninsula in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/dec/21/walking-north-kent-marshes-hoo-peninsula-charles-dickens\" title=\"\">north Kent</a>, but we are walking and talking and my recorder is on. There is the crunchy mechanical rumble of a conveyor belt bringing gravel inland to the aggregate plant. It cuts us off; we went the wrong way. \u201cClassic Thames mistake, to think we could just head straight for the thing,\u201d says Crampton, 31, consulting her Ordnance Survey map.</p> <p>Eventually, we reach the estuary and sit down on the embankment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jun/17/top-10-forgotten-british-beauty-spots-london-yorkshire-highlands\" title=\"\">the Saxon Shore Way</a>, the path that follows the coastline as it was in Roman times, before the North Kent Marshes came into existence. Behind us is Cliffe Fort \u2013 boarded up, graffitied, surrounded by a green sea of nettles \u2013 which was built in the 1860s to protect the entrance of the Thames from potential attack by the French. In front is the river itself, murky and brown even on a gorgeous spring day, taking one final turn before heading out to the North Sea. \u201cIt\u2019s presenting a very nice face to you today,\u201d says Crampton, not without pride.</p> <p>A dredger chugs inelegantly downstream, probably to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/sep/15/london-gateway-megaport-you-didnt-know-existed-docks\" title=\"\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/sep/15/london-gateway-megaport-you-didnt-know-existed-docks\" title=\"\">container port of London Gateway</a>, the waters of which need to be kept deep to allow in huge ships at all states of the tide, she says. Across the peninsula, we can see its cranes, a platoon of enormous mechanical storks marching across the marshes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"94884b2e195184e980faf930b6d07ca2580a4449\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94884b2e195184e980faf930b6d07ca2580a4449/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The \u2018enormous mechanical storks\u2019 of London Gateway\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The enormous mechanical storks of London Gateway.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This may not immediately strike visitors as a place of inspiration, stories, ideas or beauty \u2013 but it is, say Crampton. She even finds beauty in the mud at low tide. \u201cI love it when it looks all pillowy and dimpled when the streams cut a really deep course through it, making those little cushions,\u201d she says. \u201cAlthough it is very treacherous.\u201d </p> <p>What is so special about this muddy brown estuary? \u201cBecause of London being such a huge and historic place on its own, and then lots of people coming through here for different reasons, from all over the world, I think a lot of mythology is imbibed in this area,\u201d she says. \u201cI suppose to me it seems important because I grew up here and I\u2019ve thought about it a lot.\u201d</p> <p>If we could turn the tide of time and sit here on other days, between when the Romans were in town and today, we would see other vessels passing. The longship of Thorkell the Tall in 1009, perhaps, on his way to take over south-east England; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/jul/28/jmw-turner-britains-greatest-artist\" title=\"\">HMS Temeraire from JMW Turner\u2019s famous painting</a>, no longer fighting in Nelson\u2019s fleet, but being tugged ignominiously to the maritime knacker\u2019s yard at Rotherhithe under a funereal sky in 1838; a clipper called Torrens, with the seaman \u201cJ Conrad Korzemowin\u201d on board, on his last voyage in 1893 before giving up seafaring and taking up writing; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/23/immigration-windrush-west-indians-jamaica-britain\" title=\"\">the Empire Windrush</a>, docking in Tilbury in 1948, bringing with it a new generation of Britons. Or, in 1984, a 33ft sailing yacht called Scherzo, with a young couple on board who had sailed 8,000 miles from Cape Town.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a very hazardous place. There are more wrecks per square mile than anywhere else in the UK</p> <footer> <cite>Caroline Crampton</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The couple were Crampton\u2019s parents. They had left the political horror and economic uncertainty of South Africa for an adventure and to begin a new life. And they came up the Thames. Although Crampton didn\u2019t know it yet (because she hadn\u2019t been born), the river was a part of her.</p> <p>After spending months living on Scherzo in St Katharine Docks by Tower Bridge, her parents settled on the Medway. Crampton \u2013 like the Temeraire \u2013 was born in Chatham, Kent, over Higham hill behind us. Her childhood weekends and holidays were spent sailing and exploring muddy creeks, but not without resentment: her teenage friends were going to Disneyland and Spain. At some point, though, the estuary became the place she loved best in the world \u2013 a place that she would be drawn to again and again.</p> <p>Unlike Peter Ackroyd\u2019s Thames book, which devotes only six of its 500 pages to what happens east of Greenwich, the estuary is where Crampton\u2019s book, The Way to the Sea, gets going. A literary dredger, she chugs downstream slowly (but with much more elegance than the literal dredger), scooping up stories of maritime disasters, floods and cholera, slavery, prison hulks, political upheaval, the rise of the far right, sewerage. When she is not on the estuary, she is travelling by foot along <a href=\"https://www.thames-path.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the Thames Path</a>, which we are sitting beside. She finds joy \u2013 mudlarkers and archeologists, happy sailing trips, the vast skies and light that Turner sought to capture \u2013 as well as sorrow and mud. Beautiful mud, remember. She twists her own story, and the stories of the other storytellers, into the tale of the river, splicing it into something not only scholarly, but purposeful and personal, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"66165008a438c579e357acbf54bea5429d321f13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66165008a438c579e357acbf54bea5429d321f13/0_0_2832_4256/665.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Crampton and Sam Wollaston go mudlarking\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crampton and Sam Wollaston indulge in a spot of mudlarking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Joseph Conrad \u2013 yes, he was the sailor with the Polish name on the Torrens \u2013 is a hero of Crampton\u2019s and a big influence on her. He also found the estuary exciting, she says. \u201cI think for the same reason I do: because it is in some ways quite blank. You can fill it yourself with your own ideas of what you want it to be.\u201d He called it the \u201cmysterious vastness\u201d and settled on the other side, at Stanford-le-Hope in Essex.</p> <p>Dickens was another local; he had a place in Higham, on the peninsula behind us. Cooling church, thought to be the setting for Pip\u2019s encounter with Magwitch at the beginning of Great Expectations, is a little beyond. Crampton remembers reading it, partly at home, partly on weekend sailing trips. \u201cI saw the TV adaptation first, which is not the way round you\u2019re supposed to do it, I\u2019m sure. It was filmed in the Medway at a place called <a href=\"https://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/tag/stangate-creek/\" title=\"\">Stangate Creek</a>, where we used to go all the time. I thought it was amazing they\u2019d put this muddy place I thought was great but no one else did on television, and my father went: \u2018You know, it\u2019s a book as well.\u2019 It was so exciting to read about the places I knew, but 100 years before, in the fictional bleakness of Dickens\u2019s imagination.\u201d</p> <p>There were 10 prison hulks along the river, holding 4,446 people in 1826. \u201cA wicked Noah\u2019s Ark,\u201d Dickens called Magwitch\u2019s, \u201ccribbed and barred and moored by massive rusty chains.\u201d There is nothing left of them today, but if you close your eyes it is easy to hear the clanking of leg irons or a shot ringing out across the salt marshes, a warning to the locals that an escape has been made and a criminal is on the loose.</p> <p>There is the ghost of a vessel here on the foreshore, a Danish schooner called the Hans Egede. It was built in 1922, damaged by fire off Dover in 1955 and dumped here. The tide is now at its lowest and the wreck lies like a beached whale, ribs picked by time and tide. We step out over Crampton\u2019s muddy cushions \u2013 gingerly; she is right, it is treacherous \u2013 to play Jonah and explore the vessel\u2019s slimy planks.</p> <p>Crampton describes the estuary as \u201cwreck central. Partly because of the volume of shipping that comes into the Thames; also the sands, tides, tidal range and bad weather. It\u2019s a very hazardous place. There are more wrecks per square mile than anywhere else in the UK. I do like wrecks \u2013 they\u2019re amazing and fascinating \u2013 but just a bit scary.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2273149dcd52a0dd67ddb7044e814674947b0565\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2273149dcd52a0dd67ddb7044e814674947b0565/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Part of Cliffe Fort, built originally in the 1860s to withstand a potential French attack\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of Cliffe Fort, built originally in the 1860s to withstand a potential French attack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Probably the best known \u2013 and most feared \u2013 is the SS Richard Montgomery, a US Liberty ship that dragged its anchor and was wrecked on a sandbank off Sheerness, round the corner, in 1944. On board \u2013 still on board \u2013 is 1,400 tonnes of explosives. Locally, they call it the Doomsday Ship.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/14/london-history-mud-thames-foreshore-mudlarking\" title=\"\">Time for a little light mudlarking</a> before the tide comes back in. Scavaging the shore like the oystercatchers, looking for something of value, has become an unlikely \u201cthing\u201d on Instagram. It is probably better upriver in the capital, where the lives of Londoners past can be picked over, Crampton says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite boring most of the time, but then every time you\u2019re just about to go home you\u2019ll see something and stay for another two hours.\u201d</p> <p>The sound of boot in Thames mud is a lovely, squelchy one. Rude, even. (Listening back is getting even more fun.) Our haul, after considerably less than two hours, includes the tube part of a Victorian clay pipe, plus a few bits of broken ceramics, some \u201csea glass\u201d (bits of broken bottle worn smooth), a lump of coal, a fan belt, a trainer, a Hindu pamphlet and a chocolate wrapper. I don\u2019t think the British Museum, or even Instagram, is going to get very excited about it.</p> <p>But if the estuary hasn\u2019t given up much of material value, it has made up for it in other ways. Because, as Crampton writes in her epilogue: \u201cMore than just the physical flotsam transported by the river, this water is the repository for every silent sorrow and hidden joy ever whispered down by the Thames at twilight and carried away by the stream.\u201d In that, it doesn\u2019t disappoint.</p> <p><em>The Way to the Sea by Caroline Crampton is published by Granta</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 June 2019. The author\u2019s mudlarking produced a Hindu, rather than Buddhist, pamphlet.</p>",

Not only because the subject of the interview \u2013 the writer and journalist Caroline Crampton \u2013 says some fascinating things about the Thames estuary, the subject of her excellent book, but also because of the other stuff going on: the honking from a V-squadron of low-flying geese; the morose, shrill piping of an oystercatcher; the summery burbling of a skylark. We haven\u2019t even reached the venue she has chosen for our interview, Cliffe Fort, on the Hoo peninsula in north Kent, but we are walking and talking and my recorder is on. There is the crunchy mechanical rumble of a conveyor belt bringing gravel inland to the aggregate plant. It cuts us off; we went the wrong way. \u201cClassic Thames mistake, to think we could just head straight for the thing,\u201d says Crampton, 31, consulting her Ordnance Survey map. Eventually, we reach the estuary and sit down on the embankment of the Saxon Shore Way, the path that follows the coastline as it was in Roman times, before the North Kent Marshes came into existence. Behind us is Cliffe Fort \u2013 boarded up, graffitied, surrounded by a green sea of nettles \u2013 which was built in the 1860s to protect the entrance of the Thames from potential attack by the French. In front is the river itself, murky and brown even on a gorgeous spring day, taking one final turn before heading out to the North Sea. \u201cIt\u2019s presenting a very nice face to you today,\u201d says Crampton, not without pride. A dredger chugs inelegantly downstream, probably to the container port of London Gateway, the waters of which need to be kept deep to allow in huge ships at all states of the tide, she says. Across the peninsula, we can see its cranes, a platoon of enormous mechanical storks marching across the marshes. This may not immediately strike visitors as a place of inspiration, stories, ideas or beauty \u2013 but it is, say Crampton. She even finds beauty in the mud at low tide. \u201cI love it when it looks all pillowy and dimpled when the streams cut a really deep course through it, making those little cushions,\u201d she says. \u201cAlthough it is very treacherous.\u201d What is so special about this muddy brown estuary? \u201cBecause of London being such a huge and historic place on its own, and then lots of people coming through here for different reasons, from all over the world, I think a lot of mythology is imbibed in this area,\u201d she says. \u201cI suppose to me it seems important because I grew up here and I\u2019ve thought about it a lot.\u201d If we could turn the tide of time and sit here on other days, between when the Romans were in town and today, we would see other vessels passing. The longship of Thorkell the Tall in 1009, perhaps, on his way to take over south-east England; HMS Temeraire from JMW Turner\u2019s famous painting, no longer fighting in Nelson\u2019s fleet, but being tugged ignominiously to the maritime knacker\u2019s yard at Rotherhithe under a funereal sky in 1838; a clipper called Torrens, with the seaman \u201cJ Conrad Korzemowin\u201d on board, on his last voyage in 1893 before giving up seafaring and taking up writing; the Empire Windrush, docking in Tilbury in 1948, bringing with it a new generation of Britons. Or, in 1984, a 33ft sailing yacht called Scherzo, with a young couple on board who had sailed 8,000 miles from Cape Town. The couple were Crampton\u2019s parents. They had left the political horror and economic uncertainty of South Africa for an adventure and to begin a new life. And they came up the Thames. Although Crampton didn\u2019t know it yet (because she hadn\u2019t been born), the river was a part of her. After spending months living on Scherzo in St Katharine Docks by Tower Bridge, her parents settled on the Medway. Crampton \u2013 like the Temeraire \u2013 was born in Chatham, Kent, over Higham hill behind us. Her childhood weekends and holidays were spent sailing and exploring muddy creeks, but not without resentment: her teenage friends were going to Disneyland and Spain. At some point, though, the estuary became the place she loved best in the world \u2013 a place that she would be drawn to again and again. Unlike Peter Ackroyd\u2019s Thames book, which devotes only six of its 500 pages to what happens east of Greenwich, the estuary is where Crampton\u2019s book, The Way to the Sea, gets going. A literary dredger, she chugs downstream slowly (but with much more elegance than the literal dredger), scooping up stories of maritime disasters, floods and cholera, slavery, prison hulks, political upheaval, the rise of the far right, sewerage. When she is not on the estuary, she is travelling by foot along the Thames Path, which we are sitting beside. She finds joy \u2013 mudlarkers and archeologists, happy sailing trips, the vast skies and light that Turner sought to capture \u2013 as well as sorrow and mud. Beautiful mud, remember. She twists her own story, and the stories of the other storytellers, into the tale of the river, splicing it into something not only scholarly, but purposeful and personal, too. Joseph Conrad \u2013 yes, he was the sailor with the Polish name on the Torrens \u2013 is a hero of Crampton\u2019s and a big influence on her. He also found the estuary exciting, she says. \u201cI think for the same reason I do: because it is in some ways quite blank. You can fill it yourself with your own ideas of what you want it to be.\u201d He called it the \u201cmysterious vastness\u201d and settled on the other side, at Stanford-le-Hope in Essex. Dickens was another local; he had a place in Higham, on the peninsula behind us. Cooling church, thought to be the setting for Pip\u2019s encounter with Magwitch at the beginning of Great Expectations, is a little beyond. Crampton remembers reading it, partly at home, partly on weekend sailing trips. \u201cI saw the TV adaptation first, which is not the way round you\u2019re supposed to do it, I\u2019m sure. It was filmed in the Medway at a place called Stangate Creek, where we used to go all the time. I thought it was amazing they\u2019d put this muddy place I thought was great but no one else did on television, and my father went: \u2018You know, it\u2019s a book as well.\u2019 It was so exciting to read about the places I knew, but 100 years before, in the fictional bleakness of Dickens\u2019s imagination.\u201d There were 10 prison hulks along the river, holding 4,446 people in 1826. \u201cA wicked Noah\u2019s Ark,\u201d Dickens called Magwitch\u2019s, \u201ccribbed and barred and moored by massive rusty chains.\u201d There is nothing left of them today, but if you close your eyes it is easy to hear the clanking of leg irons or a shot ringing out across the salt marshes, a warning to the locals that an escape has been made and a criminal is on the loose. There is the ghost of a vessel here on the foreshore, a Danish schooner called the Hans Egede. It was built in 1922, damaged by fire off Dover in 1955 and dumped here. The tide is now at its lowest and the wreck lies like a beached whale, ribs picked by time and tide. We step out over Crampton\u2019s muddy cushions \u2013 gingerly; she is right, it is treacherous \u2013 to play Jonah and explore the vessel\u2019s slimy planks. Crampton describes the estuary as \u201cwreck central. Partly because of the volume of shipping that comes into the Thames; also the sands, tides, tidal range and bad weather. It\u2019s a very hazardous place. There are more wrecks per square mile than anywhere else in the UK. I do like wrecks \u2013 they\u2019re amazing and fascinating \u2013 but just a bit scary.\u201d Probably the best known \u2013 and most feared \u2013 is the SS Richard Montgomery, a US Liberty ship that dragged its anchor and was wrecked on a sandbank off Sheerness, round the corner, in 1944. On board \u2013 still on board \u2013 is 1,400 tonnes of explosives. Locally, they call it the Doomsday Ship. Time for a little light mudlarking before the tide comes back in. Scavaging the shore like the oystercatchers, looking for something of value, has become an unlikely \u201cthing\u201d on Instagram. It is probably better upriver in the capital, where the lives of Londoners past can be picked over, Crampton says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite boring most of the time, but then every time you\u2019re just about to go home you\u2019ll see something and stay for another two hours.\u201d The sound of boot in Thames mud is a lovely, squelchy one. Rude, even. (Listening back is getting even more fun.) Our haul, after considerably less than two hours, includes the tube part of a Victorian clay pipe, plus a few bits of broken ceramics, some \u201csea glass\u201d (bits of broken bottle worn smooth), a lump of coal, a fan belt, a trainer, a Hindu pamphlet and a chocolate wrapper. I don\u2019t think the British Museum, or even Instagram, is going to get very excited about it. But if the estuary hasn\u2019t given up much of material value, it has made up for it in other ways. Because, as Crampton writes in her epilogue: \u201cMore than just the physical flotsam transported by the river, this water is the repository for every silent sorrow and hidden joy ever whispered down by the Thames at twilight and carried away by the stream.\u201d In that, it doesn\u2019t disappoint. The Way to the Sea by Caroline Crampton is published by Granta \u2022 This article was amended on 4 June 2019. The author\u2019s mudlarking produced a Hindu, rather than Buddhist, pamphlet.",

      "body": "<p>My mother, Joyce Scroxton, who has died aged 98, was an energetic voluntary worker who became a leading figure in the YWCA organisation worldwide.</p> <p>After joining the YWCA Central Club in Great Russell Street, London, in 1949, she rose up through the ranks to become president of the London region, president of the YWCA of Great Britain, chair of the European YWCA in Brussels and Strasbourg and eventually vice-president of the world YWCA, working in Geneva. </p> <p>Born in Brockley, south London, to Winifred and Harry Smith, a lithographer, Joyce went to Sydenham high school. She joined the Home Office in Bournemouth at the start of the second world war as a secretary. When the war ended she trained as a youth and community worker at YWCA College.</p> <p>She married Joseph Scroxton, a quantity surveyor, in 1947, and the couple moved to Shepherd\u2019s Bush, west London. After the birth of her children, Jonathan and me, my mother gave up her club leader job, but did occasional paid work for the Home Office, in a senior \u201cprivate secretarial\u201d role to high-ranking civil servants.

      "bodyText": "My mother, Joyce Scroxton, who has died aged 98, was an energetic voluntary worker who became a leading figure in the YWCA organisation worldwide. After joining the YWCA Central Club in Great Russell Street, London, in 1949, she rose up through the ranks to become president of the London region, president of the YWCA of Great Britain, chair of the European YWCA in Brussels and Strasbourg and eventually vice-president of the world YWCA, working in Geneva. Born in Brockley, south London, to Winifred and Harry Smith, a lithographer, Joyce went to Sydenham high school. She joined the Home Office in Bournemouth at the start of the second world war as a secretary. When the war ended she trained as a youth and community worker at YWCA College. She married Joseph Scroxton, a quantity surveyor, in 1947, and the couple moved to Shepherd\u2019s Bush, west London. After the birth of her children, Jonathan and me, my mother gave up her club leader job, but did occasional paid work for the Home Office, in a senior \u201cprivate secretarial\u201d role to high-ranking civil servants. She continued to volunteer at the YWCA in the evenings, and from the 1960s with the Girl Guides, an organisation that she had been part of in her youth. She became a county commissioner for the Guides, for Middlesex East, in 1964, and later a community relations adviser in Guide headquarters and project officer for the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. In 1974 she was appointed London president of the YWCA, then, in the mid-80s, of Great Britain. It was in that capacity that she lobbied Margaret Thatcher in 1987 over the inclusion of the unpaid work of women in the calculations of GDP. As vice-president of the international YWCA, Joyce travelled extensively, supporting its work all over the world and visiting refugee camps.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson Johnson\u2019s campaign video looks like a version of the Daz doorstep challenge. The candidate chats amiably with Conservative voters who handily share his views on Brexit, crime, education and tax cuts. Highlights include a rather half-hearted air punch as Johnson tells one woman that Britain just needs to believe in itself more, and Johnson\u2019s new sensible leadership challenge haircut. The video has a dig at the Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, over crime in the capital. (By happy coincidence, Donald Trump criticised Khan as soon as he landed in the UK on Monday.) Perhaps wisely though, with a court case looming over the leave campaign\u2019s \u00a3350m NHS promise, Johnson avoids making any costed pledges in his video. Michael Gove There\u2019s a markedly different approach from Gove, whose video starts with a supercut of previous speeches. Gove then says it isn\u2019t enough just to \u201cbelieve\u201d in Brexit, you need to be able to deliver it. He cites his record in government on environmental and educational issues, although children learning punctuation may have some questions about why Gove\u2019s name at the end of the video has a full stop. Dominic Raab Raab turned heads last week with a head-turning opening to his campaign video. Looking like an owl spinning its head round to focus on its prey, Raab preaches fairness, for which he claims to have been fighting all his life. (The feminists he has described as \u201cobnoxious bigots\u201d might beg to differ.) Raab is ahead of the game on Facebook, having already spent more than \u00a36,000 on adverts there. Matt Hancock Rather more energetically, the health secretary has been posting videos of himself playing cricket in the workplace. With the World Cup starting in England, Matt Hancock appeared in a video that looked like it could have been posted by David Brent from The Office, offering his services if England were to need any last-minute squad replacements. Needless to say, he took the most dramatic catch in the clip \u2013 diving headlong across the office in his best Ben Stokes impression. Hancock does have form \u2013 last year he posted clips of himself playing street cricket during an official visit to India. Rory Stewart \u201cFlorence of Belgravia\u201d has become the unexpected social media star of the campaign, but one of his early videos caused a stir when he was asked if he was holding out his arm as if taking a selfie while his phone appeared to be on a tripod. The following exchange about it was, at least, a refreshingly honest reply from a politician being caught out in a public act of deception. Stewart has subsequently adopted a more shaky aesthetic as he wanders around the country chatting to people, using the #rorywalks hashtag. A stint at Speakers\u2019 Corner in London is scheduled for 6pm on Monday. There\u2019s a suspicion that Stewart isn\u2019t really bidding to be leader at all but just auditioning for the \u201clovable cuddly Tory\u201d role that Ken Clarke will vacate at some point. Clarke, of course, has endorsed Stewart. Sajid Javid The home secretary has opted for a much more formal indoor setting for his #TeamSaj campaign video. One thing #TeamSaj might consider is employing the services of a sound engineer: despite having multiple camera angles, Javid sounds like he\u2019s being recorded underwater in a wind tunnel. He has, though, recorded the best social media retort of the campaign so far. The launch videos so far have been male-dominated. Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey have preferred to post clips of media appearances on Twitter and Facebook rather than bespoke videos. Kit Malthouse Malthouse has run a low-key social media campaign for the top job, although the housing minister has at least demonstrated a grasp of the fact that the internet loves cats. James Cleverly Cleverly has opted for a nostalgic look back at where he grew up in Lewisham as the background to the \u201cconversation\u201d he is promising with the British people. Bonus points to the director for including an old family photo that makes clear Cleverly served in the army without the candidate having to mention it. Jeremy Hunt Hunt has posted a series of videos, and one that stands out is a short clip filmed while out campaigning for this week\u2019s byelection in Peterborough. He boasts about once having turned a marginal seat into one with a majority of 20,000. It might seem like an odd pitch to unite and lead the nation, but Hunt clearly has his eye on who the real electorate is for the UK\u2019s next prime minister: Conservative party activists. Just keep him away from bells while on camera. And the one making way One crumb of comfort for all the contenders is that they will be hard-pushed to produce a campaign video as stilted and awkward as Theresa May\u2019s fireside Brexit chat from April, which already feels like a long, long time ago.",

This has since been followed with World Cup glory at under-17 level in 2014 and at under-20 level in 2018, making Japan the only country to be crowned as world champions at all three levels.</p> <p>A number of younger players from the 2011 generation have matured to provide the current side with leaders in every area of the pitch, including defenders Saki Kumagai and Aya Sameshima, midfielders Mizuho Sakaguchi and Rumi Utsugi, plus forward Mana Iwabuchi. They are joined by a new crop with plenty of full international experience already, such as Moeka Minami in defence, Yui Hasegawa and Hina Sugita in midfield, and Rikako Kobayashi up front. Around half of this summer\u2019s squad have previously played in World Cup finals at either senior, under-20 or under-17 level.</p> <p>Japan line up in either an orthodox 4-4-2 or a 4-2-3-1 formation, with a style of play underpinned by hard work and good technique. The world champion teams across the different age groups all demonstrated an ability to punish opposing weaknesses with patient buildup and coordinated pressing. But in a modern world where tactical trends are increasingly homogenised, Japan no longer possess the kind of qualities to stand themselves apart.</p> <p>In attack the manager, Asako Takakura, preaches a flexible, varying style of play in which players are encouraged to take decisions according to the situation \u2013 one individual action should determine the next. When it works, it can be terrifically entertaining, but when it doesn\u2019t, it can appear little more than haphazard and random. Certainly, the team does not tend to create many chances. Conceding first is a near guarantee of defeat.</p> <p>The top priority at this World Cup, then, should be to keep clean sheets and try to ensure they can take advantage of whatever few chances come their way.</p> <h2><strong>Coach</strong></h2> <p>Asako Takakura was a midfielder throughout her playing days in the 1980s and 90s, winning 79 caps for the Japanese national team. In 1989, she scored the first ever goal in the newly established Japan Women\u2019s Football League (now Nadeshiko League). After hanging up her boots she coached at soccer schools, before taking charge of the Japan Under-17 team in 2013 and leading them to a first ever Fifa Under-17 World Cup triumph a year later. She was appointed as manager of the senior side in May 2016, with a record by mid-May of this year of 22 wins, seven draws, and 14 losses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5f0d4de5805e6ace173c1771764679a52ac6926e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f0d4de5805e6ace173c1771764679a52ac6926e/91_0_1910_2870/666.jpg\" alt=\"Emi Nakajima\u2019s deliveries from free-kicks and corners are a potent weapon for Japan\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emi Nakajima\u2019s deliveries from free-kicks and corners are a potent weapon for Japan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frederick Breedon/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Star player</strong></h2> <p>Emi Nakajima went to the same school (Shiga Yasu High School) as Takashi Inui, who played for Japan at the men\u2019s World Cup in Russia last year. But in the absence of a girls\u2019 football team there, she had to travel over an hour every day to play for a club in Osaka instead. After graduating from high school in 2009 she signed for INAC Kobe Leonessa where she quickly became a favourite of her teammate, and 2011 Fifa Women\u2019s World Player of the Year, Homare Sawa. Capable of accurate set pieces and long-range shots with either foot, Nakajima will be featuring at her first World Cup.</p> <h2><strong>Did you know?</strong></h2> <p>Midfielder Hikaru Naomoto has a phobia of stink bugs, a family of insects found in Asia and known for their distinctive odour. The trouble is that stink bugs seem to be rather fond of her. The relationship dates back to a football match at elementary school when one flew into her mouth; she played on despite numbness in her tongue. Naomoto claims that the insects always settle on her washing when she hangs it outside, while their recurrent appearance in dreams keeps her up at night.</p> <h2><strong>Brief history of women\u2019s football in Japan</strong></h2> <p>A reference to football in a 1906 sports day programme at Marugame High School for 12-to-16-year-old girls in Kagawa Prefecture is the oldest known record of women\u2019s football in Japan. A number of women\u2019s clubs were established throughout the country in the 1960s, with the first national Women\u2019s Football Championship (now known as the Empress\u2019s Cup) held in 1980. A selection of players from leading clubs in each part of the country were assembled to form the first Japan women\u2019s team a year later, and competed at the 1981 AFC Women\u2019s Championship where they finished fifth out of eight.</p> <p>Japan took part at the first Women\u2019s World Cup in 1991 and have since been ever present. Despite recording just three wins in the first five editions, a first-ever victory over the host nation Germany sent them on the road to glory in 2011. In the final against the United States they won on penalties after a 2-2 draw normal and extra time. This was followed by runs to the finals at both the 2012 London Olympics and the 2015 World Cup.</p> <p>The domestic league was launched in 1989. The manager Asako Takakura\u2019s old club, Nippon TV Beleza, have been champions 16 times in 30 years, including each of the last four seasons.</p> <h2><strong>Which player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup?</strong></h2> <p>The 25-year-old forward Kumi Yokoyama, who plays for AC Nagano Parceiro Ladies, is a real threat to defences, capable of dribbling through tight spaces and shooting when opponents least expect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b23bef67c251c3eb7e40b6add6604ca230d63fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b23bef67c251c3eb7e40b6add6604ca230d63fa/0_0_2810_1873/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kumi Yokoyama could give Japan an extra cutting edge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kumi Yokoyama could give Japan an extra cutting edge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Masashi Hara/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>What is the realistic aim for Japan and why?</strong></h2> <p>Round of 16. Japan had, by mid-May, a record of 22 wins, seven draws, and 14 defeats under Takakura, but this drops to just three wins, five draws, and 11 defeats against opponents ranked in the Fifa top 10. Not once in that time have they ever successfully come from behind to win a game. Perhaps a semi-final appearance might be possible if they shift to a more pragmatic, defensively-oriented approach.</p> <h2>Annual budget for the women\u2019s national team (compared to men\u2019s)</h2> <p>The only figure officially published by the Japan Football Association (JFA) is 4.4bn yen (\u00a331.1m) for \u201cexpenses related to national teams\u201d \u2013 which include men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams for football, futsal, and beach soccer at all age levels.</p> <p>By means of comparison, the JFA offers a prize of 150m yen to the winning team of the men\u2019s Emperor\u2019s Cup (equivalent to the FA Cup in England), and 3m yen to the winners of the women\u2019s Empress\u2019s Cup.</p> <h2>Registered female players</h2> <p>Approximately 28,000.

      "bodyText": "This article is part of the Guardian\u2019s 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup Experts\u2019 Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 24 countries who have qualified for France. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 7 June. Overview The Japanese team that won the 2011 World Cup became a symbol of the nation\u2019s recovery from the devastating earthquake and tsunami earlier that year, as well as an inspiration for women\u2019s football around the globe. This has since been followed with World Cup glory at under-17 level in 2014 and at under-20 level in 2018, making Japan the only country to be crowned as world champions at all three levels. A number of younger players from the 2011 generation have matured to provide the current side with leaders in every area of the pitch, including defenders Saki Kumagai and Aya Sameshima, midfielders Mizuho Sakaguchi and Rumi Utsugi, plus forward Mana Iwabuchi. They are joined by a new crop with plenty of full international experience already, such as Moeka Minami in defence, Yui Hasegawa and Hina Sugita in midfield, and Rikako Kobayashi up front. Around half of this summer\u2019s squad have previously played in World Cup finals at either senior, under-20 or under-17 level. Japan line up in either an orthodox 4-4-2 or a 4-2-3-1 formation, with a style of play underpinned by hard work and good technique. The world champion teams across the different age groups all demonstrated an ability to punish opposing weaknesses with patient buildup and coordinated pressing. But in a modern world where tactical trends are increasingly homogenised, Japan no longer possess the kind of qualities to stand themselves apart. In attack the manager, Asako Takakura, preaches a flexible, varying style of play in which players are encouraged to take decisions according to the situation \u2013 one individual action should determine the next. When it works, it can be terrifically entertaining, but when it doesn\u2019t, it can appear little more than haphazard and random. Certainly, the team does not tend to create many chances. Conceding first is a near guarantee of defeat. The top priority at this World Cup, then, should be to keep clean sheets and try to ensure they can take advantage of whatever few chances come their way. Coach Asako Takakura was a midfielder throughout her playing days in the 1980s and 90s, winning 79 caps for the Japanese national team. In 1989, she scored the first ever goal in the newly established Japan Women\u2019s Football League (now Nadeshiko League). After hanging up her boots she coached at soccer schools, before taking charge of the Japan Under-17 team in 2013 and leading them to a first ever Fifa Under-17 World Cup triumph a year later. She was appointed as manager of the senior side in May 2016, with a record by mid-May of this year of 22 wins, seven draws, and 14 losses. Star player Emi Nakajima went to the same school (Shiga Yasu High School) as Takashi Inui, who played for Japan at the men\u2019s World Cup in Russia last year. But in the absence of a girls\u2019 football team there, she had to travel over an hour every day to play for a club in Osaka instead. After graduating from high school in 2009 she signed for INAC Kobe Leonessa where she quickly became a favourite of her teammate, and 2011 Fifa Women\u2019s World Player of the Year, Homare Sawa. Capable of accurate set pieces and long-range shots with either foot, Nakajima will be featuring at her first World Cup. Did you know? Midfielder Hikaru Naomoto has a phobia of stink bugs, a family of insects found in Asia and known for their distinctive odour. The trouble is that stink bugs seem to be rather fond of her. The relationship dates back to a football match at elementary school when one flew into her mouth; she played on despite numbness in her tongue. Naomoto claims that the insects always settle on her washing when she hangs it outside, while their recurrent appearance in dreams keeps her up at night. Brief history of women\u2019s football in Japan A reference to football in a 1906 sports day programme at Marugame High School for 12-to-16-year-old girls in Kagawa Prefecture is the oldest known record of women\u2019s football in Japan. A number of women\u2019s clubs were established throughout the country in the 1960s, with the first national Women\u2019s Football Championship (now known as the Empress\u2019s Cup) held in 1980. A selection of players from leading clubs in each part of the country were assembled to form the first Japan women\u2019s team a year later, and competed at the 1981 AFC Women\u2019s Championship where they finished fifth out of eight. Japan took part at the first Women\u2019s World Cup in 1991 and have since been ever present. Despite recording just three wins in the first five editions, a first-ever victory over the host nation Germany sent them on the road to glory in 2011. In the final against the United States they won on penalties after a 2-2 draw normal and extra time. This was followed by runs to the finals at both the 2012 London Olympics and the 2015 World Cup. The domestic league was launched in 1989. The manager Asako Takakura\u2019s old club, Nippon TV Beleza, have been champions 16 times in 30 years, including each of the last four seasons. Which player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup? The 25-year-old forward Kumi Yokoyama, who plays for AC Nagano Parceiro Ladies, is a real threat to defences, capable of dribbling through tight spaces and shooting when opponents least expect. What is the realistic aim for Japan and why? Round of 16. Japan had, by mid-May, a record of 22 wins, seven draws, and 14 defeats under Takakura, but this drops to just three wins, five draws, and 11 defeats against opponents ranked in the Fifa top 10. Not once in that time have they ever successfully come from behind to win a game. Perhaps a semi-final appearance might be possible if they shift to a more pragmatic, defensively-oriented approach. Annual budget for the women\u2019s national team (compared to men\u2019s) The only figure officially published by the Japan Football Association (JFA) is 4.4bn yen (\u00a331.1m) for \u201cexpenses related to national teams\u201d \u2013 which include men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams for football, futsal, and beach soccer at all age levels. By means of comparison, the JFA offers a prize of 150m yen to the winning team of the men\u2019s Emperor\u2019s Cup (equivalent to the FA Cup in England), and 3m yen to the winners of the women\u2019s Empress\u2019s Cup. Registered female players Approximately 28,000. Note this figure does not include female players who play in mixed-sex teams; once included, there are an estimated 40,000 female players in total.

      "bodyText": "The tears that fell from Jeongeun Lee6 upon claiming victory at the US Women\u2019s Open had a resonance way beyond joy. The South Korean broke down as victory was secured at the Country Club of Charleston \u2013 as, endearingly, did her translator during post-tournament interview duties \u2013 with family heartache the underlying theme. Now 23, Lee6 was only four when her lorry-driving father, Jung Ho Lee, was left paralysed after a serious accident. Beyond the obvious challenges for the family at that time, Lee6\u2019s amateur golf career subsequently required an abundance of journeys and hotel stays. Consigned to a wheelchair, Jung Ho Lee was still a regular at tournaments. \u201cBy looking at my family situation back then, I thought about wanting to play golf because I wanted to support my family no matter what,\u201d Lee6 said. \u201cI told my family that I wanted to play on the LPGA Tour for a long time. I want to thank my family, who are in Korea watching me on TV and supporting me all the time. I couldn\u2019t imagine it without you guys, with all your support.\u201d The feeling, one presumes, is mutual. Lee6 likes to be known simply as \u201cSix\u201d with the number an addition owing to the makeup of the Korean Tour. \u201cThere\u2019s six different players who have the same name, Jeongeun Lee,\u201d the champion said. \u201cIt goes by one, two, three, four, five, six. I\u2019m the sixth Jeongeun Lee player, and that\u2019s why they put it down as Jeongeun Lee6. But this is my lucky number too, so I would love to put down Lee6 as my last name.\u201d Fittingly, Lee6 won at an aggregate of six under par in what is her rookie year on the LPGA Tour. Earlier, she had grown disillusioned with professional golf in her homeland to the point where she wanted to stop despite seven victories. Her major credentials had been obvious; last year she finished in the top 10 in two of them. A newly introduced qualifying series, which Lee6 won, allowed her to take her professional talents to the US on a full-time basis. Lee6\u2019s rounds of 70, 69, 69 and 70 sealed glory in Charleston by two from Angel Yin, Ryu So-yeon and Lexi Thompson. As more illustrious names wilted in the North Carolina heat, Lee6 had the cushion of being able to bogey two of her last three holes. There appears no chance of Lee6 letting a $1m prize \u2013 boosted only last week \u2013 go to her head. \u201cSo my goal was, if I win the tournament, I can eat ramen,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was my goal. If I finish the top five, I can buy shoes. But I can buy shoes and eat ramen. So it\u2019s a double.\u201d A penny for the thoughts of Hank Haney, who caused outrage before the US Women\u2019s Open: when asked who he thought would win the tournament, Haney had said he would \u201cpredict a Korean\u201d and that he could not name six players on the LGPA Tour unless he could \u201cgo with Lee\u201d without a first name. The winner of the 74th edition of this major shrugged off the sentiment of Tiger Woods\u2019s former coach. \u201cI didn\u2019t really understand him that much,\u201d Lee6 said. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t really think about it.\u201d Haney, who was suspended by his radio show at the request of the PGA Tour, had apologised for his comments but has since dug himself a deeper hole with a series of tweets that suggested Lee6\u2019s victory had vindicated his prediction. \u201cKorean women are absolutely dominating the LPGA Tour,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you asked me again my answer would be the same but worded more carefully.\u201d Lydia Ko finished in a share of 39th having failed to break 70 all week but the former world No 1 did produce a hole-in-one, at the 11th on Sunday. Incredibly, this marked only Ko\u2019s second career ace as a professional. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty cool record is that my first one was at the Olympics in Rio, and then my second one is at the US Women\u2019s Open,\u201d Ko said. \u201cMaybe I should go for the career grand slam holes\u2011in\u2011one or something. My goal is career grand slam. But career grand slam hole-in-one, I don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s done that.\u201d",

Asked at the White House on Sunday evening if he was willing to apologise to the royal family, or clarify his comments, Trump replied: \u201cNo, I made no bad comment. Thank you.\u201d He had called on Britain to leave the EU without a deal if Brussels refused to meet its demands, and urged the government to send Farage into the negotiations. The controversy was further exacerbated on Sunday when the US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, suggested the NHS would be on the table in post-Brexit trade talks with Washington. Addressing the prospect of a transatlantic trade deal, Trump said: \u201c[We\u2019re] going to the UK. I think it\u2019ll be very important. It certainly will be very interesting. There\u2019s a lot going on in the UK. And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to work out very well for them. \u201cAs you know, they want to do trade with the United States, and I think there\u2019s an opportunity for a very big trade deal at some point in the near future. And we\u2019ll see how that works out.\u201d The president departed from Joint Base Andrews near Washington DC onboard Air Force One at about 8.45pm local time (1.45am BST). The Trumps are due to head to Buckingham Palace for a reception with the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. Prince Harry will also attend a private lunch at the palace, although his wife, Meghan, who is on maternity leave, will be at home with their four-week-old son, Archie. Trump\u2019s arrival in the capital is due to be followed by a protest through central London on Tuesday, with the \u201cTrump baby\u201d blimp made for his visit last year due to put in an appearance. On Sunday, Khan described the US president as \u201cjust one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat\u201d and compared the language he has used to that of the \u201cfascists of the 20th century\u201d. Asked if he would be willing to meet the London mayor, Trump replied: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think much of him. I think that he\u2019s the twin of [the New York City mayor Bill] de Blasio, except shorter.\u201d With the Press Association",

The child remains in hospital where his condition is said to be improving after he fell about 5 metres (16ft) from the Twister rollercoaster on Thursday. Ian Cunningham said on Monday that everyone at the theme park near Ripon, North Yorkshire, was completely focused on the welfare of the boy and his family. \u201cEveryone at Lightwater Valley theme park is very pleased to hear that the condition of the young boy who fell from our Twister ride last Thursday is improving,\u201d he said in his first public statement since the incident. \u201cAs a father myself, I can imagine only too well how it must have felt for everyone involved when the incident happened, and in the hours since.

We are committed to offering our full support to the family.\u201d The Health and Safety Executive has launched an investigation into the incident, which happened as the park was busy with families and children during half-term. Witnesses reported seeing the boy hanging backwards outside one of the Twister\u2019s waltzer-shaped carriages before he plummeted to the ground. There were screams from onlookers as the ride continued to operate for up to 15 seconds after the boy fell, according to a witness. A woman believed to be the boy\u2019s mother was stuck on top of the rollercoaster while others rushed to the child\u2019s aid, the witness added. The boy\u2019s condition was initially reported as non-life threatening, but was changed to critical but stable when doctors found he had injuries not apparent at the scene. A North Yorkshire police spokeswoman said on Sunday that the boy was breathing independently and his condition continued to improve. Cunningham said: \u201cEstablishing the cause of the incident is now in the hands of the authorities \u2013 we are co-operating fully with the Health and Safety Executive investigation that is now under way. \u201cUntil the investigation is complete, it will be too early and inappropriate for us to speculate on any aspect of the incident, or answer any specific questions about it.\u201d",

Sure, you might be able to get some ambiguity out of Major or Brown \u2013 at a pinch, Canning or Thatcher \u2013 but these have nothing on a name that is also a modal auxiliary. What about her nicknames? In 2017, Quentin Letts tried out Glumbucket, a variant of a term once applied to Lloyd George. It didn\u2019t stick. Nor did Teflon Theresa, from the period when various Home Office horrors were failing to do damage to May while she was home secretary; the Economist\u2019s Theresa Maybe (a bit obvious, lads) and Theresa the Appeaser (though surely not because of an excess of politesse in politics).

      "body": "<p>Just like temperamental weather, parmigiana di melanzane is all about layers: aubergine, tomato sauce and cheese (mozzarella, scamorza, caciocavallo and often parmesan, too). The \u201cparm\u201d does not, as I thought for many years, refer to the inclusion of parmesan cheese.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/sicilian-food.html\" title=\"\">Sicilian Food: Recipes from Italy\u2019s Abundant Isle, by Mary Taylor Simeti</a>, it refers to <em>palmigia</em><em>na</em>, which means shutters in Sicilian. One day, as someone somewhere in Sicily arranged slices of fried aubergine, corners overlapping corners, they were reminded of wooden shutters and their overlapping slats. However, as Sicilians struggle to pronounce the letter \u201cl\u201d, their creation became parmigiana di melanzane instead. This could of course be one of the many gastronomic tales that are passed around like Chinese whispers, but, true or not, the idea of shutters is a useful one in terms of construction, reminding us how the fried slices should be arranged.</p> <p>The first question with this dish is whether to fry or not to fry. Fry, fry, fry is almost always my answer, especially when it comes to aubergine slices for parmigiana. This is primarily because I like the thick, velvet-like texture and deep flavour that is created by letting slices dance around a pan of hot olive oil until light golden in colour and ever so slightly crisp.</p> <p>Second, when aubergine is immersed completely in hot oil (olive or vegetable), the cooking time is reduced and with it the amount of fat absorbed. Door open wide, shower cap on, I fry in a deep frying pan, heating two inches of oil until a cube of bread dances around the pan with a coat of bubbles. I fry four large aubergines sliced into 3mm rounds in batches, and, once golden, lift them on to a tray lined with plenty of kitchen paper to drain. I have discovered that this is a task that takes exactly the same amount of time as two back-to-back episodes of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnmr\" title=\"\">Desert Island Discs</a>.</p> <p>For a leaner version in both spirit and flavour, the slices can be brushed with olive oil and roasted in the oven or seared on a grill pan, until soft and branded with dark lines.</p> <p>Whether you choose to fry, bake or grill, while the aubergine slices rest, cut 400g mozzarella into thin, scraggy slices (or simply shred it), grate 150g parmesan and tip 300ml smooth tomato sauce into a bowl. This can be your own sauce or a good-quality passata from a jar, or a tin of peeled plum tomatoes passed through a food mill and seasoned with salt and ripped basil.</p> <p>Now it\u2019s all about making layers in an oven-proof dish \u2013 a 40cm x 27cm Pyrex one is ideal. Start with a layer of aubergine, the corners overlapping slightly like shutters, followed by a smear of tomato sauce, some ripped basil leaves, mozzarella and parmesan. Repeat this sequence of layers until you have used up all the ingredients, ending with a layer of aubergine. The top will need a thick carpet of grated parmesan and some breadcrumbs, too, if you like, plus a zigzag of olive oil.</p> <p>The resting is as important as the cooking. Once the parmigiana has been baked at 180C (160C fan)/gas 4 for 30 minutes, leave to sit for at least a couple of hours and up to 12.

      "bodyText": "Just like temperamental weather, parmigiana di melanzane is all about layers: aubergine, tomato sauce and cheese (mozzarella, scamorza, caciocavallo and often parmesan, too). The \u201cparm\u201d does not, as I thought for many years, refer to the inclusion of parmesan cheese. According to Sicilian Food: Recipes from Italy\u2019s Abundant Isle, by Mary Taylor Simeti, it refers to palmigiana, which means shutters in Sicilian. One day, as someone somewhere in Sicily arranged slices of fried aubergine, corners overlapping corners, they were reminded of wooden shutters and their overlapping slats. However, as Sicilians struggle to pronounce the letter \u201cl\u201d, their creation became parmigiana di melanzane instead. This could of course be one of the many gastronomic tales that are passed around like Chinese whispers, but, true or not, the idea of shutters is a useful one in terms of construction, reminding us how the fried slices should be arranged. The first question with this dish is whether to fry or not to fry. Fry, fry, fry is almost always my answer, especially when it comes to aubergine slices for parmigiana. This is primarily because I like the thick, velvet-like texture and deep flavour that is created by letting slices dance around a pan of hot olive oil until light golden in colour and ever so slightly crisp. Second, when aubergine is immersed completely in hot oil (olive or vegetable), the cooking time is reduced and with it the amount of fat absorbed. Door open wide, shower cap on, I fry in a deep frying pan, heating two inches of oil until a cube of bread dances around the pan with a coat of bubbles. I fry four large aubergines sliced into 3mm rounds in batches, and, once golden, lift them on to a tray lined with plenty of kitchen paper to drain. I have discovered that this is a task that takes exactly the same amount of time as two back-to-back episodes of Desert Island Discs. For a leaner version in both spirit and flavour, the slices can be brushed with olive oil and roasted in the oven or seared on a grill pan, until soft and branded with dark lines. Whether you choose to fry, bake or grill, while the aubergine slices rest, cut 400g mozzarella into thin, scraggy slices (or simply shred it), grate 150g parmesan and tip 300ml smooth tomato sauce into a bowl. This can be your own sauce or a good-quality passata from a jar, or a tin of peeled plum tomatoes passed through a food mill and seasoned with salt and ripped basil. Now it\u2019s all about making layers in an oven-proof dish \u2013 a 40cm x 27cm Pyrex one is ideal. Start with a layer of aubergine, the corners overlapping slightly like shutters, followed by a smear of tomato sauce, some ripped basil leaves, mozzarella and parmesan. Repeat this sequence of layers until you have used up all the ingredients, ending with a layer of aubergine. The top will need a thick carpet of grated parmesan and some breadcrumbs, too, if you like, plus a zigzag of olive oil. The resting is as important as the cooking. Once the parmigiana has been baked at 180C (160C fan)/gas 4 for 30 minutes, leave to sit for at least a couple of hours and up to 12. It is the same principle here as with lasagne; when served straight from the oven, it will be a soft and sloppy affair, the considerable heat blinding the flavour. Resting will not only develop the flavour, it will also allow the melted mozzarella and parmesan to settle and firm up into a coherent whole. I often make a shutter-like parmigiana in the morning for the evening, or in the evening for the next day. When it\u2019s time to eat, I give the parmigiana another 10 minutes in the oven and a few more under the grill, until the top bubbles madly. Green salad with red-wine vinegar is a good partner for a square of this, on the same plate if you\u2019re English (me) or on a separate one if you\u2019re Italian.

Trump calls London mayor a \u2018stone cold loser\u2019 Donald Trump described Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, as \u201cnasty\u201d and the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, as a \u201cstone cold loser\u201d \u2013 and that was before he landed in London. The president arrived in the UK on Monday for a state visit, with tens of thousands expected to turn out in protest and widespread alarm over his administration\u2019s trade demands. The US ambassador to London, Woody Johnson, said on Sunday that in any post-Brexit trade deal between the two nations, access to the UK\u2019s National Health Service would be \u201con the table\u201d.

Kushner joined the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, at the annual Bilberberg Group summit \u2013 catnip for conspiracy theorists \u2013 which took place in Switzerland at the weekend. Institute that advised UN and EU is actually lobby group An institute that sold itself as a scientific health charity, installing its experts on EU and UN regulatory committees, is in fact an industry lobby group with corporate backers including Coca-Cola and Monsanto. The International Life Sciences Institute claims to pursue \u201cobjectivity, clarity and reproducibility\u201d to \u201cbenefit the public good\u201d, but researchers who analysed thousands of documents under freedom of information laws uncovered evidence that it had worked to counter public health policies on behalf of business.

Italy\u2019s first transgender mayor, who was elected in the small northern town of Tromello last week, has said the \u201carrogant and oppressive\u201d politics of the burgeoning far right will eventually be defeated by a \u201ckindness revolution\u201d.

As if delivering instructions in an undercover military operation, her tight jaw relinquishing to a rallying cry, Carrie Brownstein commands this love song for the unlovable, keen to impress upon a partner the urgency and disembodying exhilaration of becoming open to love, the domestic and existential overhaul of it. \u201cYou got me used to loving you!\u201d she spits, half-indignant, half-enrapt at the surprise of it. It is the first song from the Pacific Northwest trio\u2019s forthcoming ninth album, produced by St Vincent, whose fantastic way with aggression and absurdism makes itself heard in the lurching vocal cries of Corin Tucker that colour Hurry on Home\u2019s pop-industrial churn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eb991f45fe35b24b6994aba6d4bdf3e095a615fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb991f45fe35b24b6994aba6d4bdf3e095a615fd/0_213_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sleater-Kinney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleater-Kinney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Record Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDWeob50YY8\">Megan Thee Stallion \u2013 Realer</a></h2> <p>Houston\u2019s hottest sets out her philosophy on the first track from debut album Fever: men are good for nothing but money and head, though cash is best made oneself, the fewer details given the better, and critics can go whistle (in so many words). Her punishing flow is proof of an impending supremacy, a thrillingly vicious counterpoint to her hometown\u2019s screwed legacy and rap\u2019s post-SoundCloud slurring.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/6q4i9QAtKQLV8vxP5S8kHj?si=cNUZP-K2ShydqAGwdnDhtw\">Bill Callahan \u2013 The Ballad of the Hulk</a></h2> <p>\u201cEveryone deserves a past they don\u2019t care to mention!\u201d Bill Callahan declared on America, from his 2011 album Apocalypse. But on The Ballad of the Hulk \u2013 one of six songs released to trail new album Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest \u2013 he is \u201ctalking about the old days\u201d. He muses, in that beguiling, quizzical baritone, on whether permitting himself more angry outbursts in his younger years might have saved him \u201cholding on to ancient aches\u201d that a reiki master intuits in his body. \u201cI try to be a good person,\u201d he pledges, then wonders if that\u2019s worth pursuing at all when \u201cthe risk of the road\u201d might derail those efforts. But the peace of Callahan\u2019s new material \u2013 the loosest acoustic guitar playing, as bright and cleansing as dawn, inflected with humour and subtle drama \u2013 makes the case for trying.

      "bodyText": "Sleater-Kinney \u2013 Hurry on Home Being vulnerable is a prerequisite to being loved, an emotional state equivalent to a state of emergency for anyone naturally resistant to that kind of intimacy. As if delivering instructions in an undercover military operation, her tight jaw relinquishing to a rallying cry, Carrie Brownstein commands this love song for the unlovable, keen to impress upon a partner the urgency and disembodying exhilaration of becoming open to love, the domestic and existential overhaul of it. \u201cYou got me used to loving you!\u201d she spits, half-indignant, half-enrapt at the surprise of it. It is the first song from the Pacific Northwest trio\u2019s forthcoming ninth album, produced by St Vincent, whose fantastic way with aggression and absurdism makes itself heard in the lurching vocal cries of Corin Tucker that colour Hurry on Home\u2019s pop-industrial churn. Megan Thee Stallion \u2013 Realer Houston\u2019s hottest sets out her philosophy on the first track from debut album Fever: men are good for nothing but money and head, though cash is best made oneself, the fewer details given the better, and critics can go whistle (in so many words). Her punishing flow is proof of an impending supremacy, a thrillingly vicious counterpoint to her hometown\u2019s screwed legacy and rap\u2019s post-SoundCloud slurring. Bill Callahan \u2013 The Ballad of the Hulk \u201cEveryone deserves a past they don\u2019t care to mention!\u201d Bill Callahan declared on America, from his 2011 album Apocalypse. But on The Ballad of the Hulk \u2013 one of six songs released to trail new album Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest \u2013 he is \u201ctalking about the old days\u201d. He muses, in that beguiling, quizzical baritone, on whether permitting himself more angry outbursts in his younger years might have saved him \u201cholding on to ancient aches\u201d that a reiki master intuits in his body. \u201cI try to be a good person,\u201d he pledges, then wonders if that\u2019s worth pursuing at all when \u201cthe risk of the road\u201d might derail those efforts. But the peace of Callahan\u2019s new material \u2013 the loosest acoustic guitar playing, as bright and cleansing as dawn, inflected with humour and subtle drama \u2013 makes the case for trying. It is a fool\u2019s errand to look to musicians for guidance, but Callahan feels attuned to a sense of calm and certainty worth heeding.

If the contestants in the new series are expecting a relaxed summer of sun by the pool, they are in for a shock.</p> <p>From the moment my phone was taken off me as part of the pre-show preparations, I realised it was not going to be a walk in the park. There would be no speaking to friends or family or knowing what was happening in the outside world. Then came the dreaded entrance to the Love Island villa, in which the men walk in, one by one, to a line of female contestants who are waiting, ready to step forward for you, or stay in line and reject you. My turn came and I stood there shaking as my worst fears were realised: no one stepped forward. I felt sick and ashamed knowing that very soon, millions of people would see my humiliation \u2013 including all my family, friends and colleagues.</p> <p>The days that followed were some of the hardest of my life. My Love Island journey lasted just short of eight weeks, in which time I experienced countless highs and lows.

What with the big match in Madrid, the Cricket World Cup, a Brit in a heavyweight title fight and England women\u2019s last warmup before the World Cup, Flat racing\u2019s most famous race had a lot to contend with both before and after the event.</p> \n<p>Inevitably, there were calls last week for Epsom, and racing as a whole, to have a serious think about moving back to a Wednesday Derby, a quarter of a century after the switch to Saturday. With equal inevitability, nothing will come of it \u2013 not this side of the end of Investec\u2019s current sponsorship deal, at any rate, and that runs until 2026.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/02/aidan-obrien-sottsass-prix-du-jockey-club-chantilly-french-derby-horse-racing-tips\">Aidan O\u2019Brien draws French Derby blank as Sottsass wins at Chantilly</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Nor should it.

The switch to Saturday gave it a huge boost and opened up the Derby to new potential audiences including families and workers who were unwilling, or unable, to take a day off in midweek.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie77hJ7v9mQ\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ie77hJ7v9mQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  TV coverage of the final Wednesday running of the Derby in 1994.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And the evidence of Saturday\u2019s race is that the Derby held its own quite well. It was a 36,000 sell-out, as it always is, in terms of the paid attendance, while the hottest day of the year also drew a bumper crowd to the Hill. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV6Z8mK7N74&amp;t=50s\">Will it ever again be the teeming mass of humanity that it was 50 years ago?</a> No. But many tens of thousands of spectators had an exciting and memorable afternoon in the sun and will, in all likelihood, be back again next year.</p> \n<p>ITV\u2019s peak viewing figure \u2013 ie. for the race itself \u2013 also held up well at 1.7m, just 2% down on last year, and a drop of nearly 15% on the average figure was almost certainly down to the weather.

      "bodyText": "As soon as Lucas Moura scored his winning goal in Amsterdam last month, it was obvious that this year\u2019s Derby was going to have even more of a struggle than usual to grab the attention of the British sporting public. What with the big match in Madrid, the Cricket World Cup, a Brit in a heavyweight title fight and England women\u2019s last warmup before the World Cup, Flat racing\u2019s most famous race had a lot to contend with both before and after the event. Inevitably, there were calls last week for Epsom, and racing as a whole, to have a serious think about moving back to a Wednesday Derby, a quarter of a century after the switch to Saturday. With equal inevitability, nothing will come of it \u2013 not this side of the end of Investec\u2019s current sponsorship deal, at any rate, and that runs until 2026. Nor should it. Twenty-five years on, plenty of the racegoers at Epsom on Saturday, both in the stands and on the famous Hill, were not old enough to remember Erhaab\u2019s victory in the last Derby on a Wednesday. As someone who is, my strong recollection is that in the early 1990s, Derby day was visibly dying from one year to the next. The switch to Saturday gave it a huge boost and opened up the Derby to new potential audiences including families and workers who were unwilling, or unable, to take a day off in midweek. And the evidence of Saturday\u2019s race is that the Derby held its own quite well. It was a 36,000 sell-out, as it always is, in terms of the paid attendance, while the hottest day of the year also drew a bumper crowd to the Hill. Will it ever again be the teeming mass of humanity that it was 50 years ago? No. But many tens of thousands of spectators had an exciting and memorable afternoon in the sun and will, in all likelihood, be back again next year. ITV\u2019s peak viewing figure \u2013 ie. for the race itself \u2013 also held up well at 1.7m, just 2% down on last year, and a drop of nearly 15% on the average figure was almost certainly down to the weather. Most Britons no longer feel the need to be chained to the telly on a fine Saturday afternoon when they can follow the sporting action on their smartphone and get out in the sunshine too. For many punters the only real disappointment on the afternoon was the sight of Telecaster, the 5-1 second-favourite on the back of his win in the Dante Stakes 16 days earlier, backpedalling rapidly halfway down the straight before crossing the line in last place. Telecaster had, of course, been added to the field at last Monday\u2019s supplementary stage for \u00a385,000 along with Sir Dragonet, the Chester Vase winner, who clawed about half of it back by finishing fifth. Hughie Morrison, Telecaster\u2019s trainer, was open about his concerns that his colt might not be over his exertions in the Dante while Telecaster\u2019s connections were pondering whether to stump up the cash and the trainer\u2019s fears, it seems, were justified. This should be something that concerns both Epsom and York, as a 16-day gap between the Dante and the Derby is hardly unusual. Some years, depending on how early or late the first Saturday in June happens to be, it is 23 days, as it was in 2015 when Golden Horn was supplemented after winning the Dante and was an impressive winning favourite at Epsom. The memory of Telecaster\u2019s dismal showing off seven days\u2019 less rest is likely to be one of the first images that comes to mind if, or when, connections of a Dante winner with a similar profile weigh up whether to pay for a supplementary entry.

      "bodyText": "Taste Georgian cuisine Prague\u2019s foodie scene is diversifying, with delicious Georgian cooking, which has a rising but still bafflingly low global profile, gaining popularity. Thankfully, the small but energetic local Georgian community is doing its bit to redress this injustice. At bustling Pol\u00e9vk\u00e1rna Manana soup restaurant, the unstoppable owner, Manana Toidze, cooks a range of soups (a large bowl costs \u20ac3), including robust meat and walnut-based kharcho and international favourites, such as minestrone. Her compatriot, Lela Kukava, established nearby Fair Food Bistro, hidden in a quiet corner of the city centre. She employs refugees, who prepare their native dishes, and her homely restaurant also offers gluten-free and vegan options. Both eateries make good lunch choices and serve khachapuri, a highly addictive Georgian cheese-filled flatbread. \u2022 Pol\u00e9vk\u00e1rna Manana: B\u011blehradsk\u00e1 77, on Facebook. Fair Food Bistro: U Nemocnice 4, fairfoodclub.cz, both open Mon-Fri Airships and glassworks The jumbo statements on the otherwise plain exterior of the DOX Centre for Contemporary Art are the only clue to the surprises inside. The critically acclaimed converted factory opened in 2008 and typifies the transformation of the post-industrial inner suburbs. DOX has quickly become a big hitter in the Prague art world, showcasing big local and international names. At the cafe terrace, get a close-up of the wooden zeppelin metres above. Attached to the building in 2016, the airship serves as a space for art and exhibitions. Internationally recognised Czech-born architect Eva Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1, known for her use of glass and ethereal structures, is the subject of an exhibition running until August.

English titles available include magazines and coffee-table architecture books, and there are also posters for sale. In the same street, Bistro 8 restaurant typifies a clutch of new eateries serving imaginatively prepared global cuisine. Many are found in inner suburbs such as Karl\u00edn and Vinohrady, where the other Bistro 8 is located. On working days, the restaurant offers an international soup and main course special, with dishes such as vegetable curry or pasta for around \u00a37.50. At weekends, Bistro 8 does brunches. \u2022 PageFive, Veverkova 5, pagefive.com. Bistro 8, Veverkova 8, bistro8.cz Escape to the country For time out, head to Divok\u00e1 \u0160\u00e1rka valley, one of the parts of town untouched by post-1989 transformation. Catch tram 20 or 26 from Dejvick\u00e1 to the terminus for a change of scenery just metres from the airport road. Then, follow the walkers. Leave the bustle behind, enter the valley and follow the stream bubbling through a twisting canyon. The route continues past a popular open-air swimming pool, and the valley widens, a gentler landscape replacing the craggy drama. Finish at Jener\u00e1lka or Podbaba, both of which have handy bus connections to the metro. Czech design Design is thriving in the Czech Republic, boosted by international exposure. It can be purchased at self-explanatory Czech Design. The actual and online shops stock an eclectic and affordable selection of items, from greeting cards to ceramics, by leading and up-and-coming local designers. Look out for Libu\u0161e Niklov\u00e1\u2019s inflatable animal toys \u2013 retro classics from the 1970s \u2013 and minimalist Braasi backpacks. \u2022 Vojt\u011b\u0161sk\u00e1 3, czechdesign.cz , Mon-Fri Browse at a market Manifesto Market is a \u201cvillage\u201d made up of shipping containers, the brainchild of landscape architect Martin Barry. With international street food and night markets with DJs, the New Yorker\u2019s project is helping to rejuvenate Florenc, once a neglected hub, east of the centre. From late November, the Florenc venue becomes an alternative Christmas market, a contemporary twist on seasonal celebrations. \u2022 Na Florenci, manifesto.city Get a caffeine boost Savvy young connoisseurs are invigorating the local bean scene. At Kav\u00e1rna M\u00edsto and across the city, they\u2019re challenging the central Viennese-style coffee houses. This cafe, which has outside seating in summer, has quickly become an institution. It also gathers plaudits for its filling breakfasts, including homemade pastries, fuelling some redemptive exercise in the ancient Stromovka Park nearby. The vast 100-hectare playground can easily accommodate huge numbers of regulars, from in-line skaters to cross-country skiers, yet never feels crowded. Close to the park is the recently restored Na Slamn\u00edku, a much-loved pub with a beer garden. \u2022 Bubene\u010dsk\u00e1 12, mistoprovas.cz Picnic with a panorama Round off a visit with a picnic boasting the best view in town.

For the first season, 2024-25, 28 clubs were proposed to be included based on their ranking in their national leagues over the four previous seasons. Only four clubs, most likely champions of mid-ranking leagues, would make it into the Champions League through qualifying rounds.</p> <p>The ECA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/25/promotion-relegation-champions-league-plans-agnelli-european-clubs\" title=\"\">promise of promotion and relegation</a> was incorporated into a divisional structure with the Europa League, which would have a top division of 32 clubs and second division of 64.

      "bodyText": "The plans drawn up by top clubs to reshape the Champions League after 2024 would create a \u201csuper league\u201d motivated by greed that Uefa should firmly reject, the president of Europe\u2019s football leagues\u2019 association said. Lars-Christer Olsson, who heads the European Leagues, the collective body that includes the Premier League, told the Guardian that Uefa should instead be looking to improve \u201ccompetitive balance\u201d so that success is not so concentrated among rich clubs. Olsson called for 20% of Champions League revenues to be redistributed outside the participating clubs and for Europe\u2019s leagues to share money more equally. Speaking at the start of a potentially fraught week in football politics, Olsson described proposals presented by Uefa and the European Club Association last month as a \u201cclosed league\u201d, designed to give 24 top clubs permanent participation in an expanded, lucrative Champions League. The ECA has consistently denied it has any developed plans for the future of European football, despite making public new \u201cprinciples\u201d for a \u201cpyramidal structure\u201d and promotion and relegation. The chairman of the ECA and Juventus, Andrea Agnelli, a driving force behind the project, said a year ago that he wanted the Champions League to provide eight more matches in the group stage, by having four groups of eight clubs rather than eight groups of four, and that domestic leagues could be diminished. Publicly Uefa has not confirmed how far plans have been developed beyond \u201can informal brainstorming session\u201d with the ECA board in March on the shape of its competitions when the game\u2019s agreed calendar concludes in five years. The Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, has said since that a consultation is ongoing and that he wants \u201cto find a way forward that meets the needs of the game across the whole of Europe, not just in the big markets\u201d. Olsson, however, said European Leagues were shown detailed plans by Uefa last month, which were supported by the ECA, for 24 clubs to retain participation in the Champions League each season, and for the group stage to be recast as Agnelli proposed. For the first season, 2024-25, 28 clubs were proposed to be included based on their ranking in their national leagues over the four previous seasons. Only four clubs, most likely champions of mid-ranking leagues, would make it into the Champions League through qualifying rounds. The ECA\u2019s promise of promotion and relegation was incorporated into a divisional structure with the Europa League, which would have a top division of 32 clubs and second division of 64. Four clubs would be promoted from the second division and four from the top division into the Champions League. Eight clubs would be relegated at the end of the season from the Champions League into the Europa, although domestic champions could redeem themselves through the qualifying process. \u201cThis is not even a new proposal \u2013 it is very similar to the proposals made by the old G14 [top] clubs 20 years ago, for a breakaway super league,\u201d said Olsson, who was involved in senior Uefa administration from 1992 and was the organisation\u2019s chief executive from 2004 to 2007. \u201cBut this is more dangerous because it is proposed under the auspices of Uefa, the governing body of European football. \u201cThere has been huge opposition from our member leagues and clubs across Europe, from supporters and increasingly now from national associations, telling Uefa that this closed shop is a proposal for the richest clubs to get even wealthier. This is an attempt to form a super league, absolutely.\u201d Analysis by European Leagues for its clubs documented the Champions League\u2019s phenomenal growth in TV exposure and income, from a total of \u20ac22m (\u00a319.5m) shared with the participating clubs in 1992-93, the first year of its modern reorganisations, to a projected \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.8bn) this season. More of those revenues have become increasingly concentrated in the coffers of successful and rich clubs, a tendency continuing in the 2018-21 cycle. Overall Champions League revenues have increased over these three seasons by \u20ac686m compared with 2015-18, and a \u201ccoefficient\u201d has been introduced, awarding 30% of the income according to clubs\u2019 historical victories in the competition, clearly benefiting major clubs. While the Premier League, Europe\u2019s richest by far, has developed a huge financial gap between its top six clubs and the other 14, several other European leagues have become increasingly dominated by a single club, which is perpetuated by that club receiving more money for its success. In Serie A Juventus have been league winners now for eight consecutive seasons. But an inability to close the financial gap with the Premier League is one of Agnelli\u2019s motivations for the post-2024 plans. Ceferin has commissioned internal work on improving competitive balance but ideas including restrictions on squad sizes and a \u201cluxury tax\u201d fall well short of seriously redistributing TV money. \u201cOur counterproposal,\u201d Olsson said, \u201cis for Uefa to develop a much fairer distribution of the money from European competitions, to leagues other than the wealthiest, that 20% should be redistributed. We need to keep the dream alive for clubs, to help their youth development, and to improve competitive balance. \u201cThis ECA proposal will distort competitive balance in Uefa competitions and domestic competitions \u2013 making the gap between the rich clubs and the rest permanent, or even bigger. We\u2019re calling for preserving the European model, not introducing the closed North American system.\u201d The ECA is holding a special general assembly of its clubs in Malta on Thursday and Friday; its position is that no new competition formats have yet been agreed and its plan is to \u201cworkshop the principles\u201d.",

Charisma is the ability to attract, charm and influence the people around you. Some people think you either have it or you don\u2019t - but this isn\u2019t necessarily accurate. Being charismatic involves dynamic communication, positive body language and a foundation of self-awareness, and this means that many of the behaviours that make someone charismatic can be identified and learned. We can all grasp how to be more charismatic by developing our interpersonal skills through understanding and practice. In this hands-on and highly interactive session with Ryan Millar, you will develop your personal magnetism and learn how to work those fledgling charisma skills. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you have to be the life of the party (unless that\u2019s your thing), but you will be able to better relate to others, and - perhaps most importantly - you will gain self-confidence. Course content Breaking down charisma - a discussion of what it is and behaviours that can be learned Authenticity and personal mastery; getting to know ourselves Interpersonal communication - listening, asking questions, telling stories Radiating out and broadcasting your charisma Modelling culture - leadership Quick-hack guide: 25 charisma shortcuts Feedback and Q&amp;A Tutor profile Ryan Millar is a comedian, actor, presenter and communications trainer.

They have arrived in Amsterdam to decompress a little, only to find that Dutch transport workers are going on strike. Tomorrow\u2019s train to Berlin, where they will be playing the first date of their tour \u2013 which takes in London, Glasgow, Manchester and Dublin \u2013 might be cancelled. In the hotel lobby, they discuss alternatives: should they hire a car and drive to Germany? Virgil Texas thinks that sounds like a fun idea.

Trump and Brexit have produced events that are beyond parody: the petit-bourgeois <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/03/revenge-of-alan-partridge-brexit-britain-bbc\">pomposities of Alan Partridge</a> now find expression in the most influential politician in Britain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage\">Nigel Farage</a>; Michael Howard\u2019s 2017 talking up of a potential war with Spain over Gibraltar could have featured on Chris Morris\u2019s news-spoof <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/17/the-day-today-chris-morris-alan-partridge-changed-satire-forever\">The Day Today</a><em>.</em> </p> <p>In this landscape, the hosts find the traditional forms of satire \u2013 sketch shows and news parodies \u2013 toothless. \u201cThe writers\u2019 rooms on those shows are made up of people who largely went to prestigious colleges,\u201d Christman explains. \u201cThey have an investment in [existing] institutions.

The sketch features Robert De Niro as a heroic Robert Mueller \u2013 the former FBI director who became a liberal pin-up as many expected his report to secure Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cThis is two months <em>after</em> the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-mueller\">Mueller report</a> came out and said we\u2019re not going to recommend any charges against Trump, and nothing happened.\u201d</p> <p>The central distinction, Christman explains, between the liberal approach to Trump and Brexit, and Chapo\u2019s, is that the former is obsessed with them as singular events \u2013 aberrations that are going to \u201cgo away soon\u201d either through impeachment or a second referendum \u2013 while the Chapo team see them as \u201csymptomatic of a broader collapse of legitimacy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just a comedian,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/06/jon-stewart-the-daily-show-final-episode\">Jon Stewart, the arch-satirist of the George W Bush years</a>, would tell interviewers when asked about his influence on the real world. Does Chapo Trap House have the same response? They have received many testimonials from listeners who credit the show with \u201creordering the way they think\u201d about politics. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the amount of times we\u2019ve gotten a heartfelt email from someone who says your show helped me make sense of things,\u201d Texas says. \u201cThey say, \u2018Now I\u2019m talking to my co-workers about starting a union.\u201d But when I ask if they consider their podcast to be a form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/activism\">activism</a>, there is a chorus of noes. \u201cThere are people who\u2019ve had their minds changed by us,\u201d says Christman. \u201cBut how many more, even if they won\u2019t admit it to themselves, are listening to us as a substitute [for genuine political activism]?\u201d</p> <p>The podcast \u2013 which is also co-hosted by Felix Biederman and Amber Frost, who are joining these three in Berlin \u2013 does nonetheless receive some scorn. Though the cultural expression of a multiracial and diverse movement, it is mainly white and male. The hosts have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/10/24/16503462/dsa-women-cumtown-chapo\">been accused of </a>sexism by others on the left: during one scandal, they came under fire for making a joke about Bill Cosby, in response to which they apologised and made a donation to a rape and sexual assault centre. And Chapo\u2019s attempt to reconstruct a heroic story of American socialism runs the risk of overlooking the racist, patriarchal elements of US labour history. It\u2019s a concern they swiftly dispatch. \u201cUnionised white people are the least racist white people in the working class,\u201d says Christman, \u201cand it\u2019s especially meaningless now because the working class is made up of minorities anyway.\u201d The labour movement has, adds Texas, \u201cbeen one of the primary drivers of integration in the United States\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fc07fa3220fbaf55ddfaaf8a5213e7f75cebceb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fc07fa3220fbaf55ddfaaf8a5213e7f75cebceb/0_0_2097_1417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019m just a comedian\u2019 \u2026 Jon Stewart interviews President Barack Obama ion The Daily Show in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m just a comedian\u2019 \u2026 Jon Stewart interviews President Barack Obama on The Daily Show in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Geographic Channels/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What about the worry that an adherence to irony can be corrosive? \u201cIrony, for me, is a sword and a shield for defending yourself from the world and attacking the people that you think are risible,\u201d says Menaker. \u201cBut like comedy itself, there\u2019s nothing inherently good or moral about irony. And there are many obnoxious and awful people who use it. It\u2019s a matter of the human being who\u2019s doing it.\u201d</p> <p>If Chapo has a long-term strategy, it\u2019s to clear the overgrowth of liberal complacency so that something new can grow. But Texas warns against taking the podcast too seriously. The show\u2019s charm derives from its slacker-like insouciance. Take the name \u2013 it\u2019s something Menaker \u201chappened to say\u201d at the end of the first episode and it just stuck. \u201cIf we\u2019d sat down and thought of a name,\u201d says Christman, \u201cit would probably have been something awful, like Politics Guyz.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m heartened by the popularity of the show,\u201d Menaker says. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. Recording two podcasts a week is taxing enough. I don\u2019t know how to build socialism in America. We\u2019re not a political movement. And if that\u2019s shirking responsibility, then I have to say: that comes to me naturally.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Chapo Trap House are at \u00d2ran M\u00f3r, Glasgow, on 3 June; at Islington Assembly Hall, London, on 5 June. <a href=\"http://chapotraphouse.com/\">Then touring</a>.</p>",

The show has inspired several copycats and even a moniker for their audience: the Dirtbag Left, a coterie of underemployed and overly online millennials who were radicalised by the Iraq war and the 2008 financial crisis, have no time for the pieties of traditional political discourse, and place cautious hope in the movement to put the socialist senator Bernie Sanders in the White House.

Trump and Brexit have produced events that are beyond parody: the petit-bourgeois pomposities of Alan Partridge now find expression in the most influential politician in Britain, Nigel Farage; Michael Howard\u2019s 2017 talking up of a potential war with Spain over Gibraltar could have featured on Chris Morris\u2019s news-spoof The Day Today. In this landscape, the hosts find the traditional forms of satire \u2013 sketch shows and news parodies \u2013 toothless. \u201cThe writers\u2019 rooms on those shows are made up of people who largely went to prestigious colleges,\u201d Christman explains. \u201cThey have an investment in [existing] institutions. And that bleeds into their analysis of the situation. You have to be alienated from it to really make fun of it.\u201d He cites a recent skit on Saturday Night Live, featuring Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump singing a version of Queen\u2019s Don\u2019t Stop Me Now. The sketch features Robert De Niro as a heroic Robert Mueller \u2013 the former FBI director who became a liberal pin-up as many expected his report to secure Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cThis is two months after the Mueller report came out and said we\u2019re not going to recommend any charges against Trump, and nothing happened.\u201d The central distinction, Christman explains, between the liberal approach to Trump and Brexit, and Chapo\u2019s, is that the former is obsessed with them as singular events \u2013 aberrations that are going to \u201cgo away soon\u201d either through impeachment or a second referendum \u2013 while the Chapo team see them as \u201csymptomatic of a broader collapse of legitimacy\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m just a comedian,\u201d Jon Stewart, the arch-satirist of the George W Bush years, would tell interviewers when asked about his influence on the real world. Does Chapo Trap House have the same response? They have received many testimonials from listeners who credit the show with \u201creordering the way they think\u201d about politics. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the amount of times we\u2019ve gotten a heartfelt email from someone who says your show helped me make sense of things,\u201d Texas says. \u201cThey say, \u2018Now I\u2019m talking to my co-workers about starting a union.\u201d But when I ask if they consider their podcast to be a form of activism, there is a chorus of noes. \u201cThere are people who\u2019ve had their minds changed by us,\u201d says Christman. \u201cBut how many more, even if they won\u2019t admit it to themselves, are listening to us as a substitute [for genuine political activism]?\u201d The podcast \u2013 which is also co-hosted by Felix Biederman and Amber Frost, who are joining these three in Berlin \u2013 does nonetheless receive some scorn. Though the cultural expression of a multiracial and diverse movement, it is mainly white and male. The hosts have been accused of sexism by others on the left: during one scandal, they came under fire for making a joke about Bill Cosby, in response to which they apologised and made a donation to a rape and sexual assault centre. And Chapo\u2019s attempt to reconstruct a heroic story of American socialism runs the risk of overlooking the racist, patriarchal elements of US labour history. It\u2019s a concern they swiftly dispatch. \u201cUnionised white people are the least racist white people in the working class,\u201d says Christman, \u201cand it\u2019s especially meaningless now because the working class is made up of minorities anyway.\u201d The labour movement has, adds Texas, \u201cbeen one of the primary drivers of integration in the United States\u201d. What about the worry that an adherence to irony can be corrosive? \u201cIrony, for me, is a sword and a shield for defending yourself from the world and attacking the people that you think are risible,\u201d says Menaker. \u201cBut like comedy itself, there\u2019s nothing inherently good or moral about irony. And there are many obnoxious and awful people who use it. It\u2019s a matter of the human being who\u2019s doing it.\u201d If Chapo has a long-term strategy, it\u2019s to clear the overgrowth of liberal complacency so that something new can grow. But Texas warns against taking the podcast too seriously. The show\u2019s charm derives from its slacker-like insouciance. Take the name \u2013 it\u2019s something Menaker \u201chappened to say\u201d at the end of the first episode and it just stuck. \u201cIf we\u2019d sat down and thought of a name,\u201d says Christman, \u201cit would probably have been something awful, like Politics Guyz.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m heartened by the popularity of the show,\u201d Menaker says. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. Recording two podcasts a week is taxing enough. I don\u2019t know how to build socialism in America. We\u2019re not a political movement. And if that\u2019s shirking responsibility, then I have to say: that comes to me naturally.\u201d \u2022 Chapo Trap House are at \u00d2ran M\u00f3r, Glasgow, on 3 June; at Islington Assembly Hall, London, on 5 June.

It is a day of complicated emotions for Chen, of guilt and grief.</p> <p>\u201cThey died to promote democracy in China and it seems what we have done in the past 20 or 30 years is insignificant. We failed to let their souls rest in peace, we failed to redress their deaths,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Fasting is one of the only forms of remembrance left to people like Chen and her husband, also an activist, amid even tighter controls and censorship by Chinese authorities.</p> <p>For years, both have been under virtual house arrest and heavy surveillance, with cameras in elevators and outside their building set up especially for them. On the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown, the couple were arrested and jailed for trying to host a public memorial.</p> <p>Following the end of the 1989 pro-democracy movement, when protests took place in more than 300 cities across the country, thousands of students, workers, and residents were detained by police.

What cannot be restricted is fasting, which is possible even if you are deprived of your freedom,\u201d said a statement, posted online this week by the human rights group China Change.</p> <p>\u201cWhen 1.3 billion people come together to observe this moment, our nation will have gained new life,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>\u201cBefore people fasted on their own. Now, we hope more people will join and turn this into a social movement and a tradition.

      "bodyText": "For the past 29 years, Chen Wei has marked the anniversary of the bloody 4 June Tiananmen Square crackdown by fasting for 24 hours, consuming only water and thinking of the students who perished. Chen, a former student organiser, started the tradition when she was in prison, soon after the protests ended, while serving 20 months in an 8 sq metre cell. It was a small, silent act of resistance. The guards did not pay attention to whether she ate or not. Chen is one of many former protesters and activists who will be fasting on Tuesday, the 30th anniversary of the crushing of a nationwide pro-democracy movement, when tanks and soldiers cleared protesters by force, killing hundreds or perhaps thousands. \u201cIt\u2019s really a sacred day,\u201d said Chen, who led protests in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou as a university student. It is a day of complicated emotions for Chen, of guilt and grief. \u201cThey died to promote democracy in China and it seems what we have done in the past 20 or 30 years is insignificant. We failed to let their souls rest in peace, we failed to redress their deaths,\u201d she said. Fasting is one of the only forms of remembrance left to people like Chen and her husband, also an activist, amid even tighter controls and censorship by Chinese authorities. For years, both have been under virtual house arrest and heavy surveillance, with cameras in elevators and outside their building set up especially for them. On the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown, the couple were arrested and jailed for trying to host a public memorial. Following the end of the 1989 pro-democracy movement, when protests took place in more than 300 cities across the country, thousands of students, workers, and residents were detained by police. Like Chen, those who spent time in prison would often fast on 4 June. After they were released, many continued the tradition on their own. Now, a group of Chinese activists have called for a nationwide fast to remember Tiananmen. \u201cHolding vigil, wearing black in mourning, these acts can be suppressed and restricted. What cannot be restricted is fasting, which is possible even if you are deprived of your freedom,\u201d said a statement, posted online this week by the human rights group China Change. \u201cWhen 1.3 billion people come together to observe this moment, our nation will have gained new life,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBefore people fasted on their own. Now, we hope more people will join and turn this into a social movement and a tradition. Even though we are scattered\u2026 we are united and together,\u201d said one of the organisers, based in China, who asked not to be named for security reasons. Ahead of the anniversary, authorities appear to be blocking some virtual private networks (VPNs), used to get around China\u2019s Great Firewall, which restricts access to foreign sites. The popular video-streaming site Bilibili has disabled some of its comment functions and Baidu has barred the sharing of external links in its cloud service. Chinese officials and state media do not mark the occasion. An English-language editorial in the state-run Global Times said the government has already dealt with 4 June and \u201cdropping the incident thereafter has been aimed at helping the country leave the shadow behind\u201d. In the absence of any allowed commemoration, some say fasting is also about remembering a key part of the protests in Beijing, when students in Tiananmen Square began a hunger strike in May of 1989. Images of students fainting and being wheeled to hospitals gained widespread sympathy within China and abroad. \u201cFasting is a way to suffer. To reflect, so it\u2019s appropriate for such an occasion,\u201d said Zhou Fengsuo, a former student leader in Beijing, who is now living in the US. Other activists, who every year spend the day followed by public security, will spend the day fasting and watching their government minders enjoy long, lavish lunches. Chen will spend the day at home in Zhengzhou with her husband. Police and security guards outside her apartment will make sure they do not try to leave the city or organise any gatherings. She has been told not to accept any interviews. While she does not believe another broad student movement would be possible today, Chen thinks conditions are actually better for political change now than in 1989, when the economy was weak and communication networks were poor. Thirty years on from the protests, more families feel comfortable talking about what happened to their children and despite far-reaching censorship, more people are aware of what happened, Chen says. A community of activists and civil society groups, though restricted, have had time to grow. Chen said: \u201cI feel guilty, but I also hope this will be resolved. I hope one day this day will be China\u2019s human rights day. Everyone feels sadness but also a sense of motivation and courage. This day is very special and sacred.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It is finally here. The most anticipated Women\u2019s World Cup in history is just days away and there is every chance it will be the best one too.</p> <p>Four years ago, more than 750 million people around the world watched the 2015 edition in Canada on television. Audiences for this tournament, starting on Friday when France take on South Korea at the Parc des Princes in Paris, are expected to dwarf that total. Over 750,000 tickets have been sold and attendances are expected to top a million.</p> <p>The women\u2019s game is a bigger beast these days. Investment is at its highest, sponsorship floods in, and, most importantly, as a result of that financial support, the quality on the pitch is the best it has ever been.</p> <p>And there is more to come. Players across the globe are only just starting to reap the rewards of professionalism. The kids that will come through in five, 10, 15 years time will be technically better, physically fitter and more complete players than those who came before them.</p> <p>All this change and growth has made it difficult to pinpoint which of the 24 teams will lift the trophy on 7 July in Lyon. In previous tournaments the United States, Japan and Germany have ruled supreme \u2013 with six of seven titles between them \u2013 but now the pack are closing in.</p> <p>The US remain favourites despite having been in transition since Carli Lloyd\u2019s 13-minute hat-trick put them on course for a 5-2 victory over Japan in the final four years ago. The 2016 Rio Olympics saw the team fall short in a quarter-final shootout against Sweden. A year of experimentation \u2013 in style, formation and lineup \u2013 ensued.</p> <p>There were grumblings about the tinkering but this is a team of winners. Serial winners. And in 2018 Jill Ellis\u2019s team hit their stride. Alex Morgan scored 13 goals in 14 games and the US went the calendar year undefeated \u2013 a 1-1 draw against Australia in the friendly Tournament of Nations the only time they failed to win.</p> <p>Their start to 2019 has been rockier. A shock 3-1 defeat in France and consecutive 2-2 draws against Japan and England at the SheBelieves Cup were a warning about the increasing threat to their crown. But this is a team experienced at tournament preparation \u2013 a squad packed with experience heads to France with the fear-factor firmly on their side. So much confidence surrounds the team that the lion\u2019s share of tickets sold so far have been to fans in the States.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0062bc4c991d23cdd2efd4ccf2b95b26b50286b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0062bc4c991d23cdd2efd4ccf2b95b26b50286b/0_0_4971_3287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"France, seen here at Clairefontaine, could become the first country to hold the men\u2019s and women\u2019s World Cup titles at the same time.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">France, seen here at Clairefontaine, could become the first country to hold the men\u2019s and women\u2019s World Cup titles at the same time.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the biggest threat to their hopes of title retention are France. The ruthlessness with which they beat the world champions in January hinted at a side ready to cast off the cloak of underachievement that has shrouded campaigns in recent years. The two fast-paced goals of 24-year-old Kadidiatou Diani in either half of the 3-1 win showed the US aren\u2019t infallible. Eight of Corinne Diacre\u2019s squad are from Lyon\u2019s treble-winning team, including a backbone of goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi, Wendie Renard, Amandine Henry and Eug\u00e9nie Le Sommer. They are on home soil and with the chance to do something no country has done before: hold both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s titles at the same time.</p> <p>England are perhaps the best of the rest. The team coached by Phil Neville, the former Manchester United defender who never made it to a World Cup when he was an England player, are a more mature and developed one than the side that won bronze in Canada and reached the semi-finals at the 2017 European Championship in the Netherlands. At the very least, they are all fully professional players as opposed to the more mixed bag four years ago. While the direct approach of Neville\u2019s predecessor, Mark Sampson, has been replaced by a possession-based game more akin to how they play at the domestic level now. They ooze confidence and if Neville can find the right starting XI and midfield balance to make up for the injury-enforced absence of the Arsenal playmaker Jordan Nobbs, then the Lionesses could cause an upset. How they handle the expectations will be important. Anything less than a semi-final berth is likely to be seen as a disappointment. That is new territory for this team.</p> <p>Standing in their way is a familiar foe. The Lionesses meet Scotland in their Group D opener in a rerun of their first group game at Euro 2017. Two years ago England flattened their rivals with a 6-0 win but the Scots travelling to France are a much changed force. With new manager Shelley Kerr having presided over seven wins in eight qualifying games and Arsenal\u2019s Kim Little, Manchester City\u2019s Jen Beattie and Manchester United\u2019s Lizzie Arnot back from the injuries, the Scots pose a bigger threat than many will expect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2213c4797b3aa8876f2fd93fba1ea87de0c85003\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2213c4797b3aa8876f2fd93fba1ea87de0c85003/0_216_5412_3247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phil Neville has made it clear he is going to France with winning the World Cup as a realistic objective.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phil Neville has made it clear he is going to France with winning the World Cup as a realistic objective.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warren Little/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, the 2015 runners-up Japan will be transformed from the experimental side that was beaten 3-0 by England at SheBelieves Cup this spring and Germany, having underwhelmed of late, seem to be on their way back at just the right time under Martina Voss-Tecklenburg.</p> <p>An incredible run to a maiden European Championship title has prompted a women\u2019s football revolution in the Netherlands, though the success of the national team is yet to really filter into the domestic game.

      "bodyText": "It is finally here. The most anticipated Women\u2019s World Cup in history is just days away and there is every chance it will be the best one too. Four years ago, more than 750 million people around the world watched the 2015 edition in Canada on television. Audiences for this tournament, starting on Friday when France take on South Korea at the Parc des Princes in Paris, are expected to dwarf that total. Over 750,000 tickets have been sold and attendances are expected to top a million. The women\u2019s game is a bigger beast these days. Investment is at its highest, sponsorship floods in, and, most importantly, as a result of that financial support, the quality on the pitch is the best it has ever been. And there is more to come. Players across the globe are only just starting to reap the rewards of professionalism. The kids that will come through in five, 10, 15 years time will be technically better, physically fitter and more complete players than those who came before them. All this change and growth has made it difficult to pinpoint which of the 24 teams will lift the trophy on 7 July in Lyon. In previous tournaments the United States, Japan and Germany have ruled supreme \u2013 with six of seven titles between them \u2013 but now the pack are closing in. The US remain favourites despite having been in transition since Carli Lloyd\u2019s 13-minute hat-trick put them on course for a 5-2 victory over Japan in the final four years ago. The 2016 Rio Olympics saw the team fall short in a quarter-final shootout against Sweden. A year of experimentation \u2013 in style, formation and lineup \u2013 ensued. There were grumblings about the tinkering but this is a team of winners. Serial winners. And in 2018 Jill Ellis\u2019s team hit their stride. Alex Morgan scored 13 goals in 14 games and the US went the calendar year undefeated \u2013 a 1-1 draw against Australia in the friendly Tournament of Nations the only time they failed to win. Their start to 2019 has been rockier. A shock 3-1 defeat in France and consecutive 2-2 draws against Japan and England at the SheBelieves Cup were a warning about the increasing threat to their crown. But this is a team experienced at tournament preparation \u2013 a squad packed with experience heads to France with the fear-factor firmly on their side. So much confidence surrounds the team that the lion\u2019s share of tickets sold so far have been to fans in the States. Perhaps the biggest threat to their hopes of title retention are France. The ruthlessness with which they beat the world champions in January hinted at a side ready to cast off the cloak of underachievement that has shrouded campaigns in recent years. The two fast-paced goals of 24-year-old Kadidiatou Diani in either half of the 3-1 win showed the US aren\u2019t infallible. Eight of Corinne Diacre\u2019s squad are from Lyon\u2019s treble-winning team, including a backbone of goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi, Wendie Renard, Amandine Henry and Eug\u00e9nie Le Sommer. They are on home soil and with the chance to do something no country has done before: hold both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s titles at the same time. England are perhaps the best of the rest. The team coached by Phil Neville, the former Manchester United defender who never made it to a World Cup when he was an England player, are a more mature and developed one than the side that won bronze in Canada and reached the semi-finals at the 2017 European Championship in the Netherlands. At the very least, they are all fully professional players as opposed to the more mixed bag four years ago. While the direct approach of Neville\u2019s predecessor, Mark Sampson, has been replaced by a possession-based game more akin to how they play at the domestic level now. They ooze confidence and if Neville can find the right starting XI and midfield balance to make up for the injury-enforced absence of the Arsenal playmaker Jordan Nobbs, then the Lionesses could cause an upset. How they handle the expectations will be important. Anything less than a semi-final berth is likely to be seen as a disappointment. That is new territory for this team. Standing in their way is a familiar foe. The Lionesses meet Scotland in their Group D opener in a rerun of their first group game at Euro 2017. Two years ago England flattened their rivals with a 6-0 win but the Scots travelling to France are a much changed force. With new manager Shelley Kerr having presided over seven wins in eight qualifying games and Arsenal\u2019s Kim Little, Manchester City\u2019s Jen Beattie and Manchester United\u2019s Lizzie Arnot back from the injuries, the Scots pose a bigger threat than many will expect. Meanwhile, the 2015 runners-up Japan will be transformed from the experimental side that was beaten 3-0 by England at SheBelieves Cup this spring and Germany, having underwhelmed of late, seem to be on their way back at just the right time under Martina Voss-Tecklenburg. An incredible run to a maiden European Championship title has prompted a women\u2019s football revolution in the Netherlands, though the success of the national team is yet to really filter into the domestic game. The Dutch boast an all-star cast with 2017 Golden Ball winner Lieke Martens in the middle and Arsenal\u2019s WSL top-scorer Vivianne Miedema leading the line. Then there is Australia, who were in disarray following the sacking of coach Alen Stajcic just four months before the World Cup. They have seemingly regrouped under Ante Milicic who has continued the country\u2019s policy of blooding youth on the big stage with his inclusion of 16-year-old Mary Fowler and 19-year-old Ellie Carpenter in his squad alongside superstar striker Sam Kerr and Portland Thorns player Caitlin Foord. The Matildas are flying under the radar a little but should not be underestimated. A new name on the trophy on 7 July would be a testament to the increased competitiveness of the women\u2019s game on a global level, yet even if it is decked in familiar colours it is likely to be at the conclusion of the most exciting competition in the history of women\u2019s football.",

Having qualified for Euro 2017 by finishing second in their group with seven wins and one defeat, they were hit by an injury crisis that stymied their campaign in the Netherlands. The Arsenal midfielder Kim Little and Manchester United\u2019s Lizzie Arnot (then at Hibernian) suffered ruptured ACLs and Arsenal\u2019s Emma Mitchell and Manchester City\u2019s Jen Beattie also missed out. A brutal 6-0 defeat by England in their opening group game followed, with the forward Jane Ross damaging a shoulder to further deplete the ranks. A 2-1 loss to Portugal then a 1-0 win against Spain almost saw them scrape through to the quarter-finals as they finished level on points with both, but Spain progressed with a superior head-to-head record. Following the disappointing display, the head coach Anna Signeul made way for the former Arsenal manager Shelley Kerr, who immediately commissioned a full report into the team\u2019s performance at the Euros.</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s passage to this World Cup finals was not easy. Only top spot in the five-team groups guaranteed qualification and they secured that on the final day. With Switzerland dropping points against Poland, goals by Little and Ross ensured a 2-1 win against Albania and a first World Cup finals.</p> <p>The players included in Kerr\u2019s squad from the Women\u2019s Super League in England include the title winners Little, Mitchell and Lisa Evans from Arsenal, cup double winners Beattie and Caroline Weir of Manchester City, Champions League semi-finalist with Chelsea Erin Cuthbert and FA Cup runner-up with West Ham Ross. A number come from the top two SWPL teams Glasgow City and Hibernian, and the captain, Rachel Corsie, is top of the NWSL table with Utah Royals in the US. These are players who know how to win.</p> <p>On paper the starting XI is strong enough to beat any team. A positive performance in a 1-0 defeat by the reigning champions, the United States, in their final friendly of 2018 hinted at the potential. Keeping players fit will be vital. They lack the squad depth of the top nations and that was exposed in the Netherlands. But if luck is on their side on that score, they are not the underdogs that many are labelling them.</p> <p>As in 2017, they open against England. But with tournament experience now under their belts and the fire of revenge in their bellies the score is unlikely to be as emphatic as that 6-0 defeat.</p> <h2>Coach</h2> <p>Shelley Kerr was appointed following Scotland\u2019s disappointing Euro 2017 campaign and has led the team to their first World Cup. Having managed Arsenal from February 2013 until the end of the 2014 season, where she picked up consecutive FA Cup trophies, Kerr became the first female manager in British men\u2019s senior football when she was appointed manager of Stirling University in the Lowland League.</p> <h2>Star player</h2> <p>Kim Little. Missed out on Scotland\u2019s first major international tournament, the 2017 European Championship, having suffered an ACL injury but she is fit and ready to show why she is one of the world\u2019s best players now. Having had her leg broken in Arsenal\u2019s 5-0 demolition of Chelsea in October, many feared the worst, but the 28-year-old made a quicker-than-expected recovery and returned to pull the strings and control the tempo of Joe Montemurro\u2019s side as they battled to their first league title in seven years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b51ad2a14ac814a04e7d299fc1fdc86193bb85a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b51ad2a14ac814a04e7d299fc1fdc86193bb85a2/0_163_2487_1491/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Little has recovered quickly from a broken leg in October\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Little has recovered quickly from a broken leg in October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Holmes/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Did you know?</h2> <p>When Manchester City\u2019s Claire Emslie and Birmingham\u2019s Chloe Arthur played together at Bristol City they also spent time working together in the bar of a five-a-side venue. The nicknames \u201cLime\u201d and \u201cSoda\u201d were adopted, and stuck, and the pair have promised to wear the names on their boots in France.</p> <h2>Brief history of women\u2019s football in Scotland</h2> <p>The first records of women\u2019s football start in Scotland. In the Highlands single women would play against married women while men would watch and select a prospective bride. Much later, Easter Road hosted the first known match played under FA rules between England and Scotland in 1881. With women drafted into the factories during the war, munitions teams cropped up and in 1918 an unofficial game with England at Celtic Park attracted a crowd of 8,000 However, the SFA banned women\u2019s football in the 1920s, as the FA did in England.</p> <p>It was not until 1974 that the SFA gave token recognition to the Scottish Women\u2019s FA. During that time, Rose Reilly and Edna Neillis moved to Italy in search of semi-professional football. Reilly played for nine Italian clubs winning eight league titles; she took Italian nationality and went on to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jul/17/rose-reilly-scottish-footballer-world-cup-italy-milan\">win the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jul/17/rose-reilly-scottish-footballer-world-cup-italy-milan\">Mundialito Femminile </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jul/17/rose-reilly-scottish-footballer-world-cup-italy-milan\">in 1984</a>. The SFA took charge of women\u2019s football in 1998. Although the SWPL is not at the level of the WSL in England, huge strides are being made. Celtic announced they would establish a full-time professional side in December, and Rangers announced increased funding.</p> <p>In addition, the Scottish government has provided around \u00a380,000 to allow national team players to train full-time in the run-up the the World Cup.</p> <h2>Which player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup?</h2> <p>Erin Cuthbert. Chelsea\u2019s manager, Emma Hayes, has run out of superlatives for the 20-year-old forward. \u201cYou dream about players like this coming around \u2013 full of heart, desire, determination,\u201d she said after the player scored either side of half-time in a 2-1 defeat of Arsenal in January. The striker has 13 goals in all competitions, including a goal against Lyon<strong> </strong>at the Groupama Stadium in the Champions League semi-final first leg.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fea161be2c80186765f351019236215bee5c1ede\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fea161be2c80186765f351019236215bee5c1ede/0_59_3402_2135/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Erin Cuthbert in action against the US in November\" width=\"1000\" height=\"628\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erin Cuthbert in action against the US in November.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Soccrates Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What is the realistic aim for Scotland in France and why?</h2> <p>The team\u2019s aim is to get out of the group and, while a tough challenge, that is not impossible. The squad going to France is significantly stronger than the one at Euro 2017 and could cause an upset or two. The four best third-placed teams will advance to the round of 16 and with Argentina by far the weakest team in the group there is a real chance for Scotland to get through.</p> <p><strong>Registered female players:</strong> 12,289 (from the Scottish FA\u2019s 2018 annual review)</p> <p><em>Suzanne Wrack writes for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">the Guardian</a>.

Did you know? When Manchester City\u2019s Claire Emslie and Birmingham\u2019s Chloe Arthur played together at Bristol City they also spent time working together in the bar of a five-a-side venue. The nicknames \u201cLime\u201d and \u201cSoda\u201d were adopted, and stuck, and the pair have promised to wear the names on their boots in France. Brief history of women\u2019s football in Scotland The first records of women\u2019s football start in Scotland. In the Highlands single women would play against married women while men would watch and select a prospective bride. Much later, Easter Road hosted the first known match played under FA rules between England and Scotland in 1881. With women drafted into the factories during the war, munitions teams cropped up and in 1918 an unofficial game with England at Celtic Park attracted a crowd of 8,000 However, the SFA banned women\u2019s football in the 1920s, as the FA did in England. It was not until 1974 that the SFA gave token recognition to the Scottish Women\u2019s FA. During that time, Rose Reilly and Edna Neillis moved to Italy in search of semi-professional football. Reilly played for nine Italian clubs winning eight league titles; she took Italian nationality and went on to win the Mundialito Femminile in 1984. The SFA took charge of women\u2019s football in 1998. Although the SWPL is not at the level of the WSL in England, huge strides are being made. Celtic announced they would establish a full-time professional side in December, and Rangers announced increased funding. In addition, the Scottish government has provided around \u00a380,000 to allow national team players to train full-time in the run-up the the World Cup. Which player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup? Erin Cuthbert. Chelsea\u2019s manager, Emma Hayes, has run out of superlatives for the 20-year-old forward. \u201cYou dream about players like this coming around \u2013 full of heart, desire, determination,\u201d she said after the player scored either side of half-time in a 2-1 defeat of Arsenal in January. The striker has 13 goals in all competitions, including a goal against Lyon at the Groupama Stadium in the Champions League semi-final first leg. What is the realistic aim for Scotland in France and why? The team\u2019s aim is to get out of the group and, while a tough challenge, that is not impossible. The squad going to France is significantly stronger than the one at Euro 2017 and could cause an upset or two. The four best third-placed teams will advance to the round of 16 and with Argentina by far the weakest team in the group there is a real chance for Scotland to get through.

      "body": "<p>It is July 2018, and I have just got my dream job as writer-in-residence at a theatre I admire. I am feeling lucky: as a playwright, such jobs are few and far between. But something is not right. </p> <p>My daughter is going to university in two months and I am not ready for her to leave. As a single-parent family, our household is small and tightly knit. Just the two of us. I am excited for my daughter to find the independence for which I hope I have prepared her. But no one has prepared me for this. I don\u2019t know what losing my righthand girl will feel like. I am panicking. I feel as if I am drowning in my conflicted and unexpressed emotions.</p> <p>Somehow, this feeling of drowning becomes the thing that saves me. One day as I\u2019m walking home, I notice the university pool, which is not far from where we live. I must have walked and driven past it a million times. Swimming is not something I do. I mean, I can do it, thanks to slightly traumatic swimming lessons at school. </p> <p>But the way I feel about swimming is that I\u2019ll probably drown if left in any body of water for too long. Childhood stories about <a href=\"https://africa.si.edu/exhibits/mamiwata/intro.html\" title=\"\">Mami Wata</a> from my Nigerian culture make you respect how powerful water is from an early age. The fear is real.</p> <p>And yet something compels me to walk in to the pool. I pick up a leaflet and am impressed by how relatively affordable this is compared with my usual yoga classes. I sign up to a six-week taster membership. My daughter reacts with shock but a kind of relief. She knows.</p> <p>The next morning, at 7.30, I don a swimming costume. For a non-swimmer, I have quite a collection. Memories of holidays spent sunbathing while watching enviously as people jump into the blue sea come flooding back.</p> <p>The changing room alone feels like a strange new world. The bright lights and almost empty space seem to be shining a light on how out of place I am here. I walk to the side of the pool. At this time of the morning, there is barely a handful of swimmers. I head over to the shallow end, reserved for nervous swimmers like me. I walk down the cold, grey, aluminium steps into the pool and all of a sudden, I\u2019m in.</p> <p>I can touch the floor, and that is reassuring. I look around to make sure the five other people and the lifeguards aren\u2019t watching my awkward strokes, sniggering at the non-rhythmic kick of my legs. Noticing the fear of my head going under.</p> <p>\u201cNo one is watching,\u201d I repeat to myself. No one cares. No one cares if you look like a baby elephant swimming for the first time. No one cares if your heart breaks when all of her things are packed up and she leaves. Somehow, in that moment, this is reassuring.</p> <p>I swim slowly from one end to the other. Each short length feels like it is releasing something in me. I cry. It is such a relief, partly because no one can tell my hot tears from the cool, chlorinated water running down my face. Half an hour later, I am out of the water and walking towards the changing rooms. Smiling hard. Proud that I can face this small fear and maybe even learn to love it.</p> <p>By the time I get home, my daughter is up and making breakfast. She says I look happy. I am beaming. The next day, I am up again at the crack of dawn, swimming bag in hand. And every morning that I am not working or travelling, I swim. There is no fear of drowning, now. I am breathing better. I am feeling better.</p> <p>The first morning that I wake up knowing my daughter is now living her new life as a student miles away from me, I walk into her bedroom to find a clean towel. I feel sick. I put on my swimming costume, and head out to the pool. I swim for longer. Harder. Afterwards I wring out my costume, feeling lighter. Almost smiling, I send my daughter a text to say I went swimming again. She is proud of me. I walk back into her bedroom, ready to face another fear.</p> <p>Having \u201can empty nest\u201d is an easy catchphrase for something that is impossible to describe. It is not just an empty room. It is a missing part of the jigsaw of who you think you are. These early-morning swims are now a part of who I am. And swimming fills a part of that daughter-shaped hole. The fact that I can now swim underwater and do breaststroke like a pro is just an added bonus.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is July 2018, and I have just got my dream job as writer-in-residence at a theatre I admire. I am feeling lucky: as a playwright, such jobs are few and far between. But something is not right. My daughter is going to university in two months and I am not ready for her to leave. As a single-parent family, our household is small and tightly knit. Just the two of us. I am excited for my daughter to find the independence for which I hope I have prepared her. But no one has prepared me for this. I don\u2019t know what losing my righthand girl will feel like. I am panicking. I feel as if I am drowning in my conflicted and unexpressed emotions. Somehow, this feeling of drowning becomes the thing that saves me. One day as I\u2019m walking home, I notice the university pool, which is not far from where we live. I must have walked and driven past it a million times. Swimming is not something I do. I mean, I can do it, thanks to slightly traumatic swimming lessons at school. But the way I feel about swimming is that I\u2019ll probably drown if left in any body of water for too long. Childhood stories about Mami Wata from my Nigerian culture make you respect how powerful water is from an early age. The fear is real. And yet something compels me to walk in to the pool. I pick up a leaflet and am impressed by how relatively affordable this is compared with my usual yoga classes. I sign up to a six-week taster membership. My daughter reacts with shock but a kind of relief. She knows. The next morning, at 7.30, I don a swimming costume. For a non-swimmer, I have quite a collection. Memories of holidays spent sunbathing while watching enviously as people jump into the blue sea come flooding back. The changing room alone feels like a strange new world. The bright lights and almost empty space seem to be shining a light on how out of place I am here. I walk to the side of the pool. At this time of the morning, there is barely a handful of swimmers. I head over to the shallow end, reserved for nervous swimmers like me. I walk down the cold, grey, aluminium steps into the pool and all of a sudden, I\u2019m in. I can touch the floor, and that is reassuring. I look around to make sure the five other people and the lifeguards aren\u2019t watching my awkward strokes, sniggering at the non-rhythmic kick of my legs. Noticing the fear of my head going under. \u201cNo one is watching,\u201d I repeat to myself. No one cares. No one cares if you look like a baby elephant swimming for the first time. No one cares if your heart breaks when all of her things are packed up and she leaves. Somehow, in that moment, this is reassuring. I swim slowly from one end to the other. Each short length feels like it is releasing something in me. I cry. It is such a relief, partly because no one can tell my hot tears from the cool, chlorinated water running down my face. Half an hour later, I am out of the water and walking towards the changing rooms. Smiling hard. Proud that I can face this small fear and maybe even learn to love it. By the time I get home, my daughter is up and making breakfast. She says I look happy. I am beaming. The next day, I am up again at the crack of dawn, swimming bag in hand. And every morning that I am not working or travelling, I swim. There is no fear of drowning, now. I am breathing better. I am feeling better. The first morning that I wake up knowing my daughter is now living her new life as a student miles away from me, I walk into her bedroom to find a clean towel. I feel sick. I put on my swimming costume, and head out to the pool. I swim for longer. Harder. Afterwards I wring out my costume, feeling lighter. Almost smiling, I send my daughter a text to say I went swimming again. She is proud of me. I walk back into her bedroom, ready to face another fear. Having \u201can empty nest\u201d is an easy catchphrase for something that is impossible to describe. It is not just an empty room. It is a missing part of the jigsaw of who you think you are. These early-morning swims are now a part of who I am. And swimming fills a part of that daughter-shaped hole. The fact that I can now swim underwater and do breaststroke like a pro is just an added bonus.",

      "body": "<p>The Guardian sat down with Louis van Gaal at Noordwijk\u2019s Grand Hotel Huis ter Duin, three years since his dismissal by Manchester United.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Jackson:</strong> <strong>Did you feel betrayed because Manchester United wanted you to do three years and then one day after you won the FA Cup final they turned around and </strong><strong>said goodbye?</strong></p> <p><strong>Louis van Gaal</strong> At that moment I feel betrayed. I feel betrayed because what I hear from a lot of people is it was already done in December, January. I spoke every week with [the executive vice-chairman Ed] Woodward. After three lousy defeats in December, when we also went out of the Champions League, I have spoken with him and I said: \u2018I can understand that you sack me.\u2019 In a club like Manchester United you cannot lose three times in a row. Then he said: \u2018No, never. I never shall fire you. Believe in yourself. Don\u2019t read the papers.\u2019 I think then you can feel betrayed but now I can better understand because he knew that the next year I would say goodbye. On the market was [Jos\u00e9] Mourinho. He is also a very good manager and Woodward thought that he had secured for Manchester United Mourinho\u2019s top managerial level for years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/17/ryan-giggs-wales-manchester-united-van-gaal-interview\">Ryan Giggs: \u2018It didn\u2019t work for United but Van Gaal was brilliant for me\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>How was your relationship with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho? </strong></p> <p>I can imagine that Mourinho wants the chair of the manager of Manchester United because it\u2019s, in my opinion, the highest chair in England. Before I signed for Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur was here in my living room \u2013 Mr Levy. I could sign also for Tottenham Hotspur and I have said to my wife that Tottenham had the better selection [squad] than Manchester United. But I chose United for the challenge and because I have always managed the number one club in a country!</p> <p><strong>There\u2019s no hard feelings with Mourinho?</strong></p> <p>No hard feelings.</p> <p><strong>What is the problem at Manchester United now?</strong></p> <p>The problem begins with, of course, that Manchester United was never refreshed. I think when you are a manager you have to refresh every year to keep the team-building process going.</p> <p><strong>You brought in players. You tried to refresh.</strong></p> <p>Yes, but I didn\u2019t always get the players that I want. That\u2019s the problem. There is Woodward and his right hand is [head of corporate development] Matt Judge. Judge I met once in a while but not too much. And there was the head of scouting. That was the structure but you are always dependent on Woodward and Judge.</p> <p><strong>Did they not take your advice?</strong></p> <p>I thought always Manchester United can buy every player because they have a lot of power. Seemingly a few players were not reachable for Manchester United. I cannot understand but it was like that.</p> <p><strong>\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, was he your choice?</strong></p> <p>Di Mar\u00eda was my choice at AZ, seven years before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9ffa117ca4d4c700b517245658a51bdd22053c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9ffa117ca4d4c700b517245658a51bdd22053c5/0_157_5118_3071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda in action against QPR.

He had \u2018a problem with the English football culture and the climate\u2019, says Van Gaal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>He didn\u2019t sign then. Did you want him for United? Were you happy that he came?</strong></p> <p>I was satisfied, because he was a creative player, but I had other players on the list. Di Mar\u00eda had a problem with the English football culture and the climate. You cannot buy players and know, for sure, that they can deliver. You cannot know because football is a team sport.</p> <p><strong>Where did he want to play?</strong></p> <p>I always ask a player where he wants to play. For him it was wing, wide and mostly left. In the Argentina team he plays on the left. I started with him there. He was not performing that well, to a level you could expect from an \u00a380m player. I believe, then, I have to see if another position is better for him. I have played him left winger, as the 10, second striker and on the right. Then the critics say he is having to play in too many positions. I gave him all the chances that there were to perform well.</p> <p><strong>Do you have any regrets about your time with Manchester United?</strong></p> <p>No. The way they sacked me was terrible. But I like my time in England, because of the culture, because of the people. A lot of humour and always supporting the manager. I have respect for everybody I worked with.</p> <p><strong>Who was the best player you had there?</strong></p> <p>I think [David] de Gea has done fantastically.</p> <p><strong>OK, outfield player.</strong></p> <p>This is significant that I have to think a lot. [Luke] Shaw was starting very well but he was kicked out [badly injured] by PSV. Shaw was above average. [Ander] Herrera was above average. He started not so well but he became more important for the team because of his inspiring behaviour and coaching qualities. I think that overall Daley Blind was my most consistent player with high qualities for building up the play. [Juan] Mata was also a quality player with a lot of creativity and I was very happy with him because we had a big lack of creative players. That\u2019s why we played that, in your eyes, \u201cboring football\u201d. We did not have too many creative players to increase the tempo of the ball and to use more vertical passes. But it was better than parking the bus, I think.</p> <p>We played there [points to the opposition half]. We were mostly always better than our opponents, but, when your opponent is parking the bus, you need creative players. That\u2019s why I allowed Di Mar\u00eda and [Memphis] Depay to come because they were creative players and I think a team needs at least three or four creative players to break down those opponents.</p> <p><strong>You haven\u2019t mentioned Wayne Rooney. Was he too old by then? </strong></p> <p>I\u2019m sorry but he was over the hill. But in spite of that he was one of my best players.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"86116c33e1f7737c8cdd3d297f600ac6881ba4eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86116c33e1f7737c8cdd3d297f600ac6881ba4eb/36_20_2387_1432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Van Gaal says he made Wayne Rooney captain to try to control his life off the pitch. \u2018I think we don\u2019t succeed totally,\u2019 he reflects.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Van Gaal says he made Wayne Rooney captain to try to control his life off the pitch. \u2018I think we don\u2019t succeed totally,\u2019 he reflects.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Was it difficult to make </strong><strong>Rooney captain?

Is that because the Glazers didn\u2019t want to pay?</strong></p> <p>I don\u2019t know. Woodward is the one who talks with the Glazers. I only talked with the Glazers when they were [attending] a game or training session. Mostly they attend top matches and fortunately we won a lot of these top matches, in any case against Liverpool.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Manchester United need a manager with experience, not a manager who has trained at one or two teams and on a lower level</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What does it take to be a perfect technical director or director of football?</strong></p> <p>First of all you need knowledge of the game, methods of training, preparation experience, youth education, scouting and you have to think in structures.

When you are in your profession as a technical director, you have developed a name, then you have a big network and you can always make use of that network.</p> <p><strong>One person United are interested in to become technical director is Rio Ferdinand.

When you have to start like that, that\u2019s not good.</p> <p>In scouting players, Manchester United don\u2019t have the organisation to deliver the best players in my opinion. Then with the education of players, you cannot say that the education of Manchester United is very good. How many players are coming through?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were not defending and we were looking for tactical solutions adapted to the level of our players.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With Manchester United, you have a fantastic performance department and that is under the guidance of the doctor. But this performance department needs also the guidance of an experienced technical director. You have to use that department not only for the first team but also intensively for the youth education. Then young players are more educated in the philosophy of Man United and the big step to the first team is much easier. These are the important aspects that you have to develop as a technical director.</p> <p>I saw as Manchester United manager that the quality of the players of City, Tottenham, Chelsea, Arsenal was better. So what can I do? We were attacking. We were not defending and we were looking for tactical solutions adapted to the level of our players.

I think six months ago [J\u00fcrgen] Klopp has also seen the light because in former days he was always pressing.</p> <p><strong>How do you provoke space?</strong></p> <p>I have tried because of the speed of [Anthony] Martial and [Marcus] Rashford to provoke space by not pressing immediately but to come a little back, not parking the bus, but to the middle line and then the defenders halfway in our own half. Only with AZ did I do that before, also because of the lower level of my players, and of course I adapt to the quality of my players. You have to see it. Because I didn\u2019t have the best quality of players, they could not perform the system to attack. For example, when Liverpool have to attack constantly, they have a problem, more a problem than, for example, Manchester City.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d16014a4a3ee8b53555e0b1c0d0eb0ff27a06d42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d16014a4a3ee8b53555e0b1c0d0eb0ff27a06d42/0_0_2000_1326/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ajax celebrate winning the 1995 Champions League under Van Gaal.

      "bodyText": "The Guardian sat down with Louis van Gaal at Noordwijk\u2019s Grand Hotel Huis ter Duin, three years since his dismissal by Manchester United. Jamie Jackson: Did you feel betrayed because Manchester United wanted you to do three years and then one day after you won the FA Cup final they turned around and said goodbye? Louis van Gaal At that moment I feel betrayed. I feel betrayed because what I hear from a lot of people is it was already done in December, January. I spoke every week with [the executive vice-chairman Ed] Woodward. After three lousy defeats in December, when we also went out of the Champions League, I have spoken with him and I said: \u2018I can understand that you sack me.\u2019 In a club like Manchester United you cannot lose three times in a row. Then he said: \u2018No, never. I never shall fire you. Believe in yourself. Don\u2019t read the papers.\u2019 I think then you can feel betrayed but now I can better understand because he knew that the next year I would say goodbye. On the market was [Jos\u00e9] Mourinho. He is also a very good manager and Woodward thought that he had secured for Manchester United Mourinho\u2019s top managerial level for years. How was your relationship with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho? I can imagine that Mourinho wants the chair of the manager of Manchester United because it\u2019s, in my opinion, the highest chair in England. Before I signed for Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur was here in my living room \u2013 Mr Levy. I could sign also for Tottenham Hotspur and I have said to my wife that Tottenham had the better selection [squad] than Manchester United. But I chose United for the challenge and because I have always managed the number one club in a country! There\u2019s no hard feelings with Mourinho? No hard feelings. What is the problem at Manchester United now? The problem begins with, of course, that Manchester United was never refreshed. I think when you are a manager you have to refresh every year to keep the team-building process going. You brought in players. You tried to refresh. Yes, but I didn\u2019t always get the players that I want. That\u2019s the problem. There is Woodward and his right hand is [head of corporate development] Matt Judge. Judge I met once in a while but not too much. And there was the head of scouting. That was the structure but you are always dependent on Woodward and Judge. Did they not take your advice? I thought always Manchester United can buy every player because they have a lot of power. Seemingly a few players were not reachable for Manchester United. I cannot understand but it was like that. \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, was he your choice? Di Mar\u00eda was my choice at AZ, seven years before. He didn\u2019t sign then. Did you want him for United? Were you happy that he came? I was satisfied, because he was a creative player, but I had other players on the list. Di Mar\u00eda had a problem with the English football culture and the climate. You cannot buy players and know, for sure, that they can deliver. You cannot know because football is a team sport. Where did he want to play? I always ask a player where he wants to play. For him it was wing, wide and mostly left. In the Argentina team he plays on the left. I started with him there. He was not performing that well, to a level you could expect from an \u00a380m player. I believe, then, I have to see if another position is better for him. I have played him left winger, as the 10, second striker and on the right. Then the critics say he is having to play in too many positions. I gave him all the chances that there were to perform well. Do you have any regrets about your time with Manchester United? No. The way they sacked me was terrible. But I like my time in England, because of the culture, because of the people. A lot of humour and always supporting the manager. I have respect for everybody I worked with. Who was the best player you had there? I think [David] de Gea has done fantastically. OK, outfield player. This is significant that I have to think a lot. [Luke] Shaw was starting very well but he was kicked out [badly injured] by PSV. Shaw was above average. [Ander] Herrera was above average. He started not so well but he became more important for the team because of his inspiring behaviour and coaching qualities. I think that overall Daley Blind was my most consistent player with high qualities for building up the play. [Juan] Mata was also a quality player with a lot of creativity and I was very happy with him because we had a big lack of creative players. That\u2019s why we played that, in your eyes, \u201cboring football\u201d. We did not have too many creative players to increase the tempo of the ball and to use more vertical passes. But it was better than parking the bus, I think. We played there [points to the opposition half]. We were mostly always better than our opponents, but, when your opponent is parking the bus, you need creative players. That\u2019s why I allowed Di Mar\u00eda and [Memphis] Depay to come because they were creative players and I think a team needs at least three or four creative players to break down those opponents. You haven\u2019t mentioned Wayne Rooney. Was he too old by then? I\u2019m sorry but he was over the hill. But in spite of that he was one of my best players. Was it difficult to make Rooney captain? Was he really the only choice? You can say nothing about his professionalism as a player in the training sessions or on a pitch. Outside the environment of the training pitch and the stadium is different. I made him my captain because I want to control that life outside. Interesting. Give him responsibility and then he \u2026 I think we don\u2019t succeed totally. You said you don\u2019t understand why United have a lot of money and won\u2019t always pay for players. Is that because the Glazers didn\u2019t want to pay? I don\u2019t know. Woodward is the one who talks with the Glazers. I only talked with the Glazers when they were [attending] a game or training session. Mostly they attend top matches and fortunately we won a lot of these top matches, in any case against Liverpool. What does it take to be a perfect technical director or director of football? First of all you need knowledge of the game, methods of training, preparation experience, youth education, scouting and you have to think in structures. So you need a lot of experience in the football world. When you are in your profession as a technical director, you have developed a name, then you have a big network and you can always make use of that network. One person United are interested in to become technical director is Rio Ferdinand. What do you think about this? He was a good player, obviously. As a good player, you\u2019re not a good manager or you\u2019re not a good technical director. It\u2019s more or less what is happening now with [Ole Gunnar] Solskj\u00e6r, ex-players, old boys\u2019 network. It\u2019s not always a good choice. It can be but it\u2019s not always a good choice. Were you surprised that Solskj\u00e6r was given the job permanently? I was very surprised he got it in spite of the winning run at the start. Why? Because Manchester United is one of the biggest clubs in the world that needs a manager with experience and not a manager who has trained at one or two teams and on a lower level. Pep Guardiola went straight into Barcelona after managing the Barcelona B team. He was very successful. There are always exceptions and he played as a central midfielder at the highest level, a position where you need tactical orientation, and he was my captain! You\u2019ve got a philosophy of playing football: your Ajax team, Barcelona, AZ and Bayern Munich. Do United have one, would you say? When I was accepting the job, we never spoke about the system Manchester United played with, or about a philosophy. Is that a surprise? Yes. It was [different with] the other clubs. I\u2019ve always spoken about that. When you won the Champions League with Ajax [in 1995], was playing as a team key? All my teams are really teams. I think also United played like a team. When your head is already cut off and you can inspire the players still to play that football or play the style that you want to play \u2026 We always played the same system but with other accents, depending on the opponent. If you had a blank canvas, how long would it take to sort United out? The trouble is that you cannot demand so much time. And the fans do not allow that. Also with Solskj\u00e6r, they shall demand in spite of him being an ex-player. In the football world you have to deliver. However as an ex-player you always have more credit. Is it almost impossible then to succeed at these big clubs, at United? I remember your first press conference, you basically said \u2018it\u2019s too much commercial, this club\u2019. I\u2019m happy that you remember that. I think you have to change the structure in the organisation of Manchester United because now I think the balance between the football department and commercial department is not right and even slopes over to the commercial.

Performed by an impressive cast of five women in this Bradford pub venue, Kash Arshad\u2019s production pointedly sidelines the \u201cuseless men\u201d who let Dunbar down \u2013 from her dad to her boyfriends to Max Stafford-Clark, whose enthusiasm for Dunbar\u2019s writing ultimately faded. In many ways, the show is a celebration of fierce, resilient women: Dunbar\u2019s no-nonsense mother, her candid best friend Eileen, the women who encouraged Dunbar\u2019s writing, and of course Dunbar herself. Both Stripe and Holdsworth are careful to stress that Black Teeth and a Brilliant Smile is fiction, not biography. Nevertheless, it raises the question of whether we should finally let Dunbar\u2019s work speak for itself \u2013 a fraught debate that the play itself implicitly alludes to. What do we really care about, the woman or the art? \u2022 At the Ambassador, Bradford, until 8 June; then touring.",

More often than not, it\u2019s not worth very much.\u201d The Lewis chessmen were most likely made in Trondheim, Norway, of which the Western Isles were part, between 1150 and 1200. Lewis was on a thriving trade route between Norway and Ireland and one theory is that they were hidden for safekeeping by a travelling merchant. They became arguably Scotland\u2019s best known archaeological find when they were found buried in the beach of Uig Bay in 1831. How they were discovered is still disputed, with one account claiming they were uncovered by a grazing cow.

The fact that London has the majority of the chessmen objects, 82 against 11 now in Edinburgh, has often been a sore point, with the Scottish National party arguing for the chessmen to be permanently returned to Scotland. The former British Museum director Neil MacGregor included them in his A History of the World in 100 Objects series for BBC Radio 4, and talked of how the \u201cmuch-loved pieces take us into the heart of the medieval world\u201d. He said they showed not only high status, wealth and power, but also \u201cknowledge, taste and intellect\u201d. The chessmen are made mostly from walrus tusk, a few from whales\u2019 teeth, and consist of seated kings and queens, bishops, knights on horseback, pawns in the shape of obelisks and standing warders. Some of them would originally have been coloured red. The warders, equivalent to rooks on a modern board, are the most intimidating of the chess pieces, some of them biting on the edge of their shields in an ecstasy of rage which identifies them as beserkers, the shock troops of the Scandinavian medieval world. Kader, head of European sculpture and works of art at Sotheby\u2019s, said the discovery was \u201cone of the most exciting and personal rediscoveries to have been made during my career\u201d. He added: \u201cToday all the chessmen are a pale ivory colour, but the new Lewis warder\u2019s dark tone clearly has the potential to offer valuable and fresh insight into how other Lewis chessmen may have looked in the past.\u201d",

Multiple candidates to replace Theresa May as Conservative party leader and prime minister have said they would push for Brexit on 31 October, whether or not a deal has been agreed \u2013 against the warnings of every major business lobby group. The candidates in favour of leaving with or without a deal include the bookmakers\u2019 favourite, Boris Johnson, and Andrea Leadsom, Dominic Raab and Sajid Javid. Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of Make UK, which represents 20,000 British manufacturers, said it would be \u201cthe height of economic lunacy to take the UK out of the EU with no deal in place\u201d. A survey of 344 Make UK members found that a balance of only 6% of manufacturers had increased investment in the second quarter of the year, the lowest level since the final quarter of 2016, in the aftermath of the EU referendum in June. The balance of manufacturers intending to increase hiring in the next three months fell to only 6% from 16% in the previous quarter.

A kind of political manifesto, the artists look at the intersection between politics and gay rights, such as Tuesday Smillie, who crafts banners emblazoned with emotionally charged phrases (one says \u201cWe fuck up sometimes\u201d), as well as protest signs by Elektra KB (one reads: \u201cDeath = Silence\u201d).

      "bodyText": "One summer night in 1969, police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay dive bar in New York\u2019s Greenwich Village (John Waters said the \u201cuppity gays would never go there\u201d). While the police raided Stonewall for not having a liquor license, many saw it as an excuse to target sex workers and criminalize the gay community. Then something happened \u2013 the LGBTQ community fought back in a way that had never been seen before. For six consecutive days, the gay community held a series of protests to fight for their rights, some held signs that read: \u201cStonewall means fight back!\u201d and \u201cSmash gay oppression!\u201d This historic moment (and now, a historic landmark), which sparked the gay rights movement, wouldn\u2019t be remembered without the photographers and artists who documented the protests, its lead-up and aftermath. As gay pride parades kick off in various cities across America, they will have a different meaning with the 50th anniversary of Stonewall. Even with the legalization of gay marriage in 2015 and ever-increasing trans visibility, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done for the LGBTQ community in America. Artists, above all, are tackling these ideas and their works are on view this summer. From New York to Boston and Houston, here are some of the art exhibitions across the US that are celebrating Stonewall 50. Nobody Promised You Tomorrow: Art 50 Years After Stonewall The Brooklyn Museum is showcasing a younger, fresher look at Stonewall by featuring the voices of 28 LGBTQ artists who were born after 1969. A kind of political manifesto, the artists look at the intersection between politics and gay rights, such as Tuesday Smillie, who crafts banners emblazoned with emotionally charged phrases (one says \u201cWe fuck up sometimes\u201d), as well as protest signs by Elektra KB (one reads: \u201cDeath = Silence\u201d). Until 8 December. Art After Stonewall, 1969-1989 How did the Stonewall riots affect the art world? New York University\u2019s Grey Art Gallery and the Leslie-Lohman Museum, both in Manhattan, are showcasing a two-part exhibit, organized by the Columbus Museum of Art in Ohio, that attempts to answer that question. More than 200 artworks trace how artists reacted to the gay rights movement. From Andy Warhol to Keith Haring and photographers such as Robert Mapplethorpe, Art After Stonewall shows how artists saw things differently from the news reports at the time. \u201cLGBTQ history didn\u2019t start in 1969, it has a long, complicated history,\u201d said the curator Jonathan Weinberg. \u201cStonewall represented a turning point.\u201d Stonewall 50 The New York Historical Society is tracing the history of gay culture, activism and nightlife throughout the second half of the 20th century. As part of this sprawling, multi-part exhibition, there are a pair of Doc Martens from a march in 1993, photos from pride marches in the 1980s and Aids awareness pins. They\u2019re also showing highlights from the lesbian herstory archives, one of the largest archives of lesbian history. Until 22 September. Love &amp; Resistance: Stonewall 50 The New York Public Library\u2019s Fifth Avenue location is honoring the trailblazing gay rights activists that paved the path for the LGBTQ community today, beyond Martha P Johnson and Silvia Rivera.

Some people respond better to drugs than others.</p> <p>Thirdly, the prescription of drugs has surged in recent years, particularly antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) \u2013 drugs such as Prozac that have become hugely popular since the 1990s. In several countries, there has been concern that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/21/your-experiences-antidepressants-responses\">they are prescribed too readily</a>, to people with only mild symptoms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2019-05-17T13:40:13/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2019-05-17T13:40:13/embed.html\">Chart</a> </figure>  <p>That said, they also work.

      "bodyText": "What is mental illness? There are dozens of different kinds of mental illness, from common disorders that affect tens of millions of people such as depression and anxiety, to rarer afflictions like paraphilia (sexual compulsion) and trichotillomania (a compulsion to remove hair). The \u201cbible\u201d of mental illness, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (its fifth iteration, DSM-5, was published in 2013), groups them under about 20 subheadings* (see below). Mental illness is not sadness, insanity or rage (though it can involve these in some of its forms); it is not binary or exclusive, but complex and universal. Another way to think of it is as a spectrum, a continuum that we all sit on. At one end is mental health, where we are thriving, fulfilled and at ease. In the middle reaches, people can be described as coping, surviving or struggling. At the far end sit the range of mental illnesses. Most us move back and forth along this line our entire lives. How widespread is it? First, to bust some myths: there is no global epidemic. It is not growing exponentially. It is not a disease of western capitalism. Second, a warning. Data is remarkably patchy. It relies on people self-reporting their feelings, never the best foundation for accurate information. But insofar as data exists, the most reliable time series curated by the Institute for Health Metrics Evaluation (IHME) appears to show that in 2017, just under 300 million people worldwide suffered from anxiety, about 160 million from major depressive disorder, another 100 million from the milder form of depression known as dysthymia. Totting up a global figure is not easy, as many people may suffer from more than one condition. According to data from the IHME\u2019s Global Burden of Disease, about 13% of the global population \u2013 some 971 million people \u2013 suffer from some kind of mental disorder. Dementia is the fastest-growing mental illness. The British charity Mind refers to a statistic that one in four people will experience some form of mental illness in any given year. Is it getting worse? The short answer is not really. The increases in the above graphic are only slightly higher than the rise in global population since 1990. \u201cAll the modelling we\u2019ve done in high-income countries where there is survey data which has tracked over time shows that the prevalence hasn\u2019t changed \u2013 it\u2019s flatlined,\u201d says Harvey Whiteford, professor of population mental health at the University of Queensland. But there have been two big changes in the past 20 years. The first is that recognition and destigmatisation has resulted in a huge surge of people seeking help. The second is that surveys repeatedly show that more young people are reporting mental distress. \u201cThere is much more talk about it and more people being treated,\u201d Whiteford adds. \u201cThe treatment rates have gone up. In Australia, they have gone up from about one third of the diagnose population getting treatment to about a half.\u201d Where is it worst in the world? No country is immune. No country really stands out as a hellscape either \u2013 though mental health data collectors say that countries that have been at war naturally suffer from large numbers of trauma-related mental illness. One measure of mental illness that has become a gold standard over the past 30 years is the disability adjusted life year (DALY) \u2013 a sum of all the years of healthy, productive life lost to illness, be it through early death or through disability. The DALY metric as compiled by the IHME for all countries of the world shows an interesting top 10: What causes mental illness? How long have you got? Myriad volumes have been written on this and yet it remains unresolved. Because it is rarely just one single thing. Psychiatrists speak of a combination of risk factors that might, repeat might, add up to trouble. Start with the genes. \u201cWhat you inherit is a certain vulnerability or predisposition, and if things happen on top of that then people would then be more likely to suffer from a mental problem,\u201d says Ricardo Araya, director of the Centre for Global Mental Health at King\u2019s College. \u201cIt\u2019s polygenic, there are lots of genes involved, we know you may have inherited certain genes but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you will suffer.\u201d For example, last year scientists pinpointed 44 gene variants that raise the risk of depression. Then there are life experiences that compound the risk factor, such as abuse, trauma, stress, domestic violence, adverse childhood experience, bullying, conflict, social isolation or substance abuse (which can be cause and consequence). But it\u2019s not a precise science, says Ann John, professor in public health and psychiatry at Swansea University Medical School. \u201cOne of the things with mental illness is that one risk factor plus a second doesn\u2019t automatically equal a mental illness,\u201d she says. So which are the most common illnesses? Clinical depression (which is not the same a feeling a bit down or a bit depressed \u2013 that is called being human) is sometimes best described as a series of things lost: loss of joy, concentration, love, hope, enthusiasm, equilibrium, appetite and sleep (though it can also come with overcorrections on both of these). Depressive disorders, which may affect as many as 300 million people worldwide, account for about one third of mental illness DALYs. There are myriad online diagnostics for self-assessment, though if you feel what might be clinical depression, you should see a doctor. It is usually treated with a mixture of medication and talking therapy, the former for mood stabilisation, the latter to discover whence it came and how to change ways of thinking to send it on its way. Anxiety is a close cousin of clinical depression \u2013 and again, it is not the same as feeling a bit anxious. It is an uncontrollable, and often inexplicable, surfeit of worry, often experienced as much in the body as in the mind. Acute anxiety can lead to panic attacks and numerous phobias.

In several countries, there has been concern that they are prescribed too readily, to people with only mild symptoms. That said, they also work. A metastudy published last year found that they worked better than placebos. A range of new treatments is promising to move psychopharmacology beyond SSRIs. From ketamine to psilobycin, new psychotropic compounds offer both the promise of remedy \u2013 and the worry of self-medication. So are mental illnesses still taboo? Less than they used to be. It could be said that the subject has moved from being invisible to being taboo to being openly discussed in the space of 30 years. But mental illnesses are still not universally accepted. People with mental illnesses still complain of discrimination; 300,000 people with long term mental health problems lose their jobs every year \u2013 and that\u2019s just in the UK. And while disorders like depression and anxiety are becoming more accepted by the public, schizophrenia, personality disorders and psychosis are still poorly understood.

The support has to be there.\u201d</p> \n<p>At Rukkila, seven staff support 21 tenants.

You can spot problems more readily.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hardly any of the tenants come straight from the street, Haapa says, and those who do can take time to adjust to living indoors. But after a three-month trial, tenants\u2019 contracts are permanent \u2013 they can\u2019t be moved unless they break the rules (Rukkila does not allow drug or alcohol use; some other Housing First units do) or fail to pay the rent.</p> \n<p>Some stay seven years or more; others leave after one or two. In 2018, six tenants moved out to lead fully independent lives, Haapa says. One is now a cleaner, living in her own flat; another studied for a cookery qualification during his five years at Rukkila and now works as a chef.</p> \n<p>Ainesmaa is on a two-year work experience programme designed to lead to a job. He says the opportunity to sort himself out was priceless: \u201cLook, I own nothing. I\u2019m on the autism spectrum. I think people are my friends, and then they rip me me off. I\u2019ve been ripped off \u2026 a lot. But now I have my place. It\u2019s mine. I can <em>build</em>.\u201d</p> \n<p>Housing First costs money, of course: Finland has spent \u20ac250m creating new homes and hiring 300 extra support workers. But a recent study showed the savings in emergency healthcare, social services and the justice system totalled as much as \u20ac15,000 a year for every homeless person in properly supported housing.</p> \n<p>Interest in the policy beyond the country\u2019s borders has been exceptional, from France to Australia, says Vesikansa. The British government is funding pilot schemes in Merseyside, the West Midlands and Greater Manchester, whose Labour mayor, Andy Burnham, is due in Helsinki in July to see the policy in action.</p> \n<p>But if Housing First is working in Helsinki, where half the country\u2019s homeless people live, it is also because it is part of a much broader housing policy. More pilot schemes serve little real purpose, says Kaakinen: \u201cWe know what works. You can have all sorts of projects, but if you don\u2019t have the actual homes \u2026 A sufficient supply of social housing is just crucial.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"605b23c495d6934d2ad3774533144fa3d8c546c8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/605b23c495d6934d2ad3774533144fa3d8c546c8/0_165_4960_2975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An under-construction district of Helsinki in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An under-construction district of Helsinki in 2013.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannu Mononen/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And there, the Finnish capital is fortunate.

You can come out of it and get the world thrown at you, or you get thrown back into reality straight away. I didn\u2019t go in there searching for any sort of fame, like a few people did, but thinking what could have been put me in a bit of a place. It was messing with my head.\u201d He says he didn\u2019t have particularly high expectations. \u201cI\u2019d seen the previous series and what people were getting out of it.\u201d The difficulty, he says, is \u201ccoming to terms with the amount people use you after you\u2019ve been in that environment. People were coming out of the woodwork. They want to give you stuff \u2013 and as soon as you\u2019re done, they\u2019re nowhere to be seen.\u201d</p> <p>At his lowest ebb, he would drive to work every day and think about how he might kill himself. A post Miller put on Instagram caught the attention of a producer from the show, who put him in touch with the show\u2019s psychologist. They had a long session via Skype. It helped, he says. \u201cWe got a plan of action in place during that session: plan out the next few months, get what I wanted to get done, job-wise and relationship-wise.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"588f0f9fc0908050cbb2023d3eca3ae88318e542\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/588f0f9fc0908050cbb2023d3eca3ae88318e542/0_0_2872_1723/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Gradon on Love Island\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophie Gradon was diagnosed with depression three years before she appeared on Love Island in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He understands why other reality stars can experience ill health long after their shows are broadcast. \u201cA lot of people will say: \u2018They\u2019ve chosen to go on TV,\u2019 but you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re letting yourself in for.

Ex on the Beach has similarities to Love Island, but seems more extreme \u2013 people are put on the show with former partners in the hope there will be conflict and sex.</p> <p>Filming the show was stressful, McSorley says. \u201cThey definitely sell you a dream and put a lot of pressure on you, like: \u2018This is your one chance and if you don\u2019t do what we\u2019re suggesting then there\u2019s no point in you being on this show, you\u2019re probably going to get sent home.\u2019\u201d McSorley appeared on the show with her twin sister. \u201cIf my sister wasn\u2019t acting up as much as she should have, or having sex or whatever, they were saying to me: \u2018Your sister\u2019s not doing well, but you could do so well if you did certain things.\u2019 They don\u2019t outright tell you: \u2018You have to do this,\u2019 but it\u2019s a manipulative atmosphere.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b3d1468bbdd7757923586d69deb2d66fe106de7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3d1468bbdd7757923586d69deb2d66fe106de7a/0_0_5677_3792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Jeremy Kyle Show\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Dymond was found dead shortly after appearing on The Jeremy Kyle Show <em>(pictured)</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A spokesperson for MTV said: \u201cContributors\u2019 welfare across our programming is of paramount importance to us.

She left the show after a therapist, who assessed the cast members on behalf of Channel 4 (which owns E4) before each new series, said she was unfit to continue. Earlier this year, Jonny Mitchell, who appeared on Love Island in 2017, launched a petition demanding a more robust duty of care for reality TV contestants. He claimed many \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/19/mike-thalassitis-love-island-death-reality-tv\" title=\"\">were hit with depression following a baptism of fire that they never anticipated</a>, were not properly warned about, and then were left to their own devices to deal with when the sun set on the season\u201d.</p> <p>Alex George, an A&amp;E doctor who appeared on Love Island last year, has spoken about the regular counselling sessions he has had since being on the show. Before this year\u2019s Love Island, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/22/itv-to-offer-love-island-contestants-more-help-in-wake-of-deaths\" title=\"\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/22/itv-to-offer-love-island-contestants-more-help-in-wake-of-deaths\" title=\"\">show </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/22/itv-to-offer-love-island-contestants-more-help-in-wake-of-deaths\" title=\"\">hired Paul Litchfield</a>, an adviser to the government on mental health issues, to review its aftercare procedures. New measures have been taken for this series, including more intensive preparation, with a focus on managing expectations and dealing with social media attention; the provision of a minimum of eight therapy sessions for each contestant after the show; and proactive contact for up to 14 months after the conclusion of the series.</p> <p>Miller says these are good developments. He had very little preparation \u2013 he only knew he would be in the show two days before he flew out. Afterwards, he says: \u201cThey can\u2019t keep an eye on everyone 24/7, but they can put a system in place where they check up on you regularly. I think they could have done that a bit better.\u201d How long should the aftercare last? \u201cI\u2019d probably say 18 months, to cross the period when the new series starts, because that can hit people as well.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Aftercare \u2013 even in excellent production companies \u2013 is pretty minimal</p> <footer> <cite>Jo Hemmings</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>McSorley had a mental health evaluation before she was cast on Ex on the Beach, but she was wary of being too honest, she says. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t open up as much as you should, because there\u2019s a worry that if you say the wrong thing then you\u2019re not going to get on the show.\u201d</p> <p>When her series started broadcasting, she started to get abuse on social media. She said she expected it \u2013 and had been warned about it \u2013 \u201cbut not in the volume I got. People were saying all this horrible stuff, then it was like: \u2018OK, I need a nose job, they\u2019re right.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>On a programme such as The Jeremy Kyle Show, it is easy to see how people\u2019s lives are upended when they are presented with devastating information. On other reality shows, one of the biggest issues is contestants\u2019 high expectations of their career prospects, says Hemmings. \u201cSome of them want that level of fame, but don\u2019t have the skill or talent to back it up and don\u2019t have a plan B,\u201d she says. When it doesn\u2019t materialise, \u201csometimes they feel like a failure. There is anxiety about money and they often have to continue to feed their social media platforms with posts about how marvellous life is, when they may not be feeling like that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3caf8c350f914e308ec4418eb840ccae2794af14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3caf8c350f914e308ec4418eb840ccae2794af14/0_0_3000_4477/670.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Miller, who was a cast member of Love Island in 2018\" width=\"670\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re letting yourself in for\u2019 ...

They basically sell you a dream and say you\u2019re going to be famous and it\u2019s going to be great, but they don\u2019t really emphasise enough how that\u2019s a slim chance.\u201d </p> <p>McSorley says she \u201cgot really depressed.

The show\u2019s contestants often turn a summer on TV into a career: they build huge followings on social media, they appear on other reality shows, and brands throw money at them. Not everyone becomes famous, of course, but those who do sometimes find the pressure too great. Last June, a contestant from the 2016 series, Sophie Gradon, who had been diagnosed with depression three years before she appeared on the show, killed herself. In March, Mike Thalassitis, who appeared on Love Island in 2017, also killed himself. The dating show has become part of the wider debate around the effects of reality TV on mental health. Last month, Steve Dymond was found dead a week after he appeared on ITV\u2019s The Jeremy Kyle Show. Dymond had \u201cfailed\u201d a lie-detector test, a regular feature of the show, to try to prove to his partner that he hadn\u2019t cheated on her.

He claimed many \u201cwere hit with depression following a baptism of fire that they never anticipated, were not properly warned about, and then were left to their own devices to deal with when the sun set on the season\u201d. Alex George, an A&amp;E doctor who appeared on Love Island last year, has spoken about the regular counselling sessions he has had since being on the show. Before this year\u2019s Love Island, the show hired Paul Litchfield, an adviser to the government on mental health issues, to review its aftercare procedures. New measures have been taken for this series, including more intensive preparation, with a focus on managing expectations and dealing with social media attention; the provision of a minimum of eight therapy sessions for each contestant after the show; and proactive contact for up to 14 months after the conclusion of the series. Miller says these are good developments. He had very little preparation \u2013 he only knew he would be in the show two days before he flew out. Afterwards, he says: \u201cThey can\u2019t keep an eye on everyone 24/7, but they can put a system in place where they check up on you regularly. I think they could have done that a bit better.\u201d How long should the aftercare last? \u201cI\u2019d probably say 18 months, to cross the period when the new series starts, because that can hit people as well.\u201d McSorley had a mental health evaluation before she was cast on Ex on the Beach, but she was wary of being too honest, she says. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t open up as much as you should, because there\u2019s a worry that if you say the wrong thing then you\u2019re not going to get on the show.\u201d When her series started broadcasting, she started to get abuse on social media. She said she expected it \u2013 and had been warned about it \u2013 \u201cbut not in the volume I got. People were saying all this horrible stuff, then it was like: \u2018OK, I need a nose job, they\u2019re right.\u2019\u201d On a programme such as The Jeremy Kyle Show, it is easy to see how people\u2019s lives are upended when they are presented with devastating information. On other reality shows, one of the biggest issues is contestants\u2019 high expectations of their career prospects, says Hemmings. \u201cSome of them want that level of fame, but don\u2019t have the skill or talent to back it up and don\u2019t have a plan B,\u201d she says. When it doesn\u2019t materialise, \u201csometimes they feel like a failure. There is anxiety about money and they often have to continue to feed their social media platforms with posts about how marvellous life is, when they may not be feeling like that.\u201d Many reality stars are picked up by agents to exploit their personal brands, but some are less responsible than others. Gladeana McMahon, a psychotherapist who has been involved in reality TV since the early series of Big Brother, says: \u201cA good manager needs to keep an eye on the emotional and mental health of the people they\u2019re managing.\u201d Reality stars often take advantage of their huge following on Instagram, doing paid posts, promotions and collaborations with brands. \u201cYou had to be doing something to keep the momentum going after the show,\u201d says McSorley. \u201cYou panic, thinking that all of what you did on the show was for nothing. They basically sell you a dream and say you\u2019re going to be famous and it\u2019s going to be great, but they don\u2019t really emphasise enough how that\u2019s a slim chance.\u201d McSorley says she \u201cgot really depressed. At the time, all you care about is doing well on the show, but you don\u2019t realise that, when you come out, more serious jobs are not going to hire you; a lot of people have an opinion on you now.\u201d She says there have been \u201csome good parts\u201d of appearing on reality TV, but mostly she has regrets. \u201cI feel like the younger generation think these reality people live the life and there\u2019s nothing bad that happens. They don\u2019t get how awful it can be.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

      "bodyText": "A majority of British workers would back pay transparency measures to tackle income inequality, as calls mount for Scandinavian-style income disclosures in Britain. A survey undertaken by YouGov on behalf of the jobs website Indeed showed 56% of workers support making personal information such as monthly income and tax returns publicly available. The poll joins growing calls from Labour, trade unions, thinktanks and campaign groups to introduce pay disclosures to tackle heightened levels of inequality in Britain. Countries including Finland, Sweden and Norway already force the publication of pay and tax details for every worker in some form. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, who has previously called for legislation to enforce public disclosures of incomes above \u00a31m, said Labour would take such steps if elected. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that excessive pay inequality is one of the drivers of the anger and resentment which many people feel towards the establishment,\u201d he said in a comment on the survey\u2019s findings. \u201cLabour will tackle the scourge of those earning enormous sums and using schemes of dubious morality to hide them offshore in tax havens.\u201d The findings from the survey of more than 2,000 full-time employees indicate British workers want to know how much their colleagues are paid and would be ready to give up their own privacy in exchange. Pawel Adrjan, the UK economist at Indeed, said a traditional reticence to discuss financial matters among friends and family was being challenged as awareness of inequality grows. \u201cPerhaps that is in part due to the huge interest that gender pay gap reporting has gathered, but perhaps more so thanks to the new generation of younger workers with different views on money and the workplace,\u201d he said. According to official figures, one-quarter of companies and public sector bodies in the UK have a pay gap of more than 20% in favour of men. The survey asked whether workers would support a system of publicly available pay information online that anyone could see to ensure transparency and fairness. Most approved of the idea, 33% opposed it and 11% were undecided. Indeed believes its research is the first time such a study has found support for pay transparency measures in Britain, which alongside the US has typically been less supportive of the idea. McDonnell, who together with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has published his tax returns, first floated the idea in 2017. He told the Guardian at the time that he hoped more transparency of individuals\u2019 tax affairs would cut down on tax avoidance and encourage a more open civic culture. In Norway, every citizen\u2019s earnings are made available for the public to inspect in a system that has been in place since the early 1800s. In Sweden, companies with 25 or more employees must have an equality action plan, and every worker\u2019s pay details can be accessed from tax authorities. The Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank has previously called for transparency measures to form part of public life in Britain, as a way of tackling the gender , ethnicity and disability pay gaps. The growing calls for greater pay disclosure add to rising concerns about inequality in Britain, with the launch of a five-year review by the Nobel prize-winning economist Sir Angus Deaton and the Institute for Fiscal Studies. According to the IFS, the share of household income for the richest 1% has almost tripled in the past four decades, rising from 3% in the 1970s to about 8%.

I saw something about it online and I wanted an opportunity to say that I, as a young person, am angry about what is going on. I\u2019m afraid, and I feel that there is great injustice. I felt like for the first time in a long time, we had actually taken a stand. After that I contacted Youth Strike 4 Climate and said I wanted to be involved, full-time.</p> <p>We are told that we\u2019re jumping on this bandwagon of adolescent insolence, but that is just not true. We\u2019re marching on the streets because we are furious \u2013 we are full of rage and terror \u2013 and those together have taught me that young people have the real power in our society. Our empowerment as individuals is key to change, and it has been the way that protests have brought change about over centuries.</p> <p>We need a fundamental change to our system \u2013 we need to fulfil the principles of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey\" title=\"\">Green New Deal</a>, and we need to listen to everyone. Activism for me is a part of my life and will remain that way, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to go on and become an MP. I want to be an opera singer. Activism shouldn\u2019t change who you are, it should come from who you are, and your beliefs, and how you want the world to see other people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a3b112e120abe4a3e0cb5ff01bda8ef99ae43d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a3b112e120abe4a3e0cb5ff01bda8ef99ae43d0/175_141_2889_1733/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mugdha Mokashi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We got quite a bit of criticism \u2013 lots of people saying we were going to hell \u2019 \u2026 Mugdha Mokashi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Mugdha Mokashi, 22, is president elect of Medical Students for Choice and grew up in Alabama</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m in my first year at Harvard Medical School. I was born in India but I consider Alabama my home, and I intend to return to provide abortion services when my studies are finished.</p> <p>I became interested in reproductive justice when I was 19. I started volunteering at a rape crisis centre. From there I started working in an organisation called URGE (Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity). They primarily work in states where the government and legislation is typically conservative or Republican. I brought a chapter to my campus. We held something called the Abortion Positive Tour in 2017, spending a week on campus, talking and distributing information about abortion, then we would hold a rally at the end. We got quite a bit of feedback and criticism \u2013 lots of yelling, lots of people saying we were going to hell \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t as dramatic as it could have been. There was no threat of physical violence.</p> <p>When Donald Trump was elected we felt a sense of urgency and we marched. I\u2019ve learned that activism is most effective when the voices of the people who are being oppressed or targeted are elevated and centred. Nothing really does that better than protest. It\u2019s a very accessible form of engagement you really can\u2019t beat how persuasive visceral emotion and passion are.</p> <p>An important tenet of activism is doing work both \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside the building\u201d. Outside are the traditional forms of protest, rallying and grassroots action, but you have to establish change inside, too. My interest is in reforming the medical institution and the policy-making sphere to match what people are marching about. The power of being disruptive and visible is a salient part of protest that I have been using in my day\u2011to-day work \u2013 the idea that to bring about change, people need to feel uncomfortable, and that to shift the window of discourse, you need something really powerful. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e26517f3a5d77c59a414a65897088098dccdea75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e26517f3a5d77c59a414a65897088098dccdea75/0_417_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I was born into activism\u2019 \u2026 Dallas Goldtooth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was born into activism\u2019 \u2026 Dallas Goldtooth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryan Tarnowski/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Dallas Goldtooth, 35, </strong><strong>is based in Chicago. He is the Keep It in </strong><strong>the Ground campaigner for the Indigenous Environmental Network</strong></p> <p>As cliched as it sounds, I was born into activism. My dad has been an organiser since as far back as I can remember. My own experience of organising started about six years ago in the fight against the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/keystone-xl-pipeline\" title=\"\">Keystone XL pipeline</a>, a tar sands pipeline that was supposed to cross the traditional territories of my people \u2013 the Great Sioux Nation. We brought to the doors of the White House a march of 10,000 people, led by Native American and non-Native farmers and ranchers, and we set up a tipi camp on the National Mall for six days. I\u2019m pretty proud to say we won that campaign. We were able to convince the Obama administration not to approve that pipeline. That\u2019s the goal of any good organiser \u2013 to work themselves out of a job.</p> <p>There are many different forms of protest, but they should all be tactics for a greater strategy. There is a lot of political turmoil right now and people are justifiably angry about the attacks on their self-determination, their land, their bodies. We want to march, and that\u2019s powerful because we\u2019re acting on the moment, and people have a right to express their anger and frustrations. But we have to challenge ourselves to look at the bigger picture of what we\u2019re building towards.</p> <p>The change that we wish to see, that we\u2019re trying to create in this world, has to be about addressing and challenging power. If our conversations, if our work, if our lives don\u2019t challenge the systems of power, then we\u2019re not really working towards the just society that we want. We have to reimagine our relationships to the greater world, to the land and to the ecosystem in which we live. That\u2019s a very strong indigenous framework: if you innately believe that the Earth is your mother and the animals and plants around you are brothers and sisters, then you have a responsibility to care for them in a different manner than if you just see them as natural resources to be managed.</p> <p><strong>Yang Po</strong><strong>rter, 24, is a campaigner for women\u2019s rights in Saudi Arabia</strong></p> <p>It was against the law for women to drive in Saudi Arabia, but in the early 2010s there was a Facebook campaign calling on Saudi women to go out and drive at a certain time, and a few women responded and went out and drove cars together. Many of them were put in jail and made to sign documents saying they would not drive again. When the new crown prince, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mohammed-bin-salman\" title=\"\">Mohammed bin Salman</a>, came to power, he decided it was time to give women the right to drive [in May 2018], but the authorities cracked down on the women who had protested before and jailed them again.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People now are willing to give up\u00a0their\u00a0lives for a\u00a0prosperous future for the collective: you have to make sacrifices</p> <footer> <cite>Yang Porter</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m speaking on behalf of these women. I haven\u2019t suffered the consequences personally but I\u2019ve seen them suffer the consequences, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s moving me now to make these efforts to expose what\u2019s happening. Women\u2019s freedom has a long way to go in Saudi Arabia; women<strong> </strong>can now drive, but still need permission from their male guardians to travel and to marry. I want to make people aware that there is still a human rights crisis going on there.</p> <p>What protest is happening now in Saudi Arabia is down to the scattered efforts of individuals. People are too afraid to act collectively. I can\u2019t really think of a Saudi collective group that has achieved anything in the last 100 years. We\u2019re not really familiar with collective effort, but it\u2019s possible, if this situation gets worse, that it might happen. I really hope it does.</p> <p>Demanding rights comes at a price. Everyone who has spoken out has suffered consequences. People reap the benefits from the accumulated efforts of others. That\u2019s how the history machine works, with individual sacrifice as its engine.

I was just an ordinary schoolgirl focusing on my studies and working hard to enter university, but one day I discovered the Facebook page of Scholarism [Hong Kong\u2019s student pro-democracy movement] and saw a picture of a group of students, including Joshua Wong, out on the streets voicing their opposition to the \u201cpatriotic\u201d national education curriculum at that time.

Social movements, including protest, are a direct way to get involved and to change people\u2019s minds.

So it is not only a way for people to voice their opinions, it\u2019s also a channel for changing people\u2019s minds.</p> <p>Many thought that Hong Kong people were just concerned with how to earn more money and live in bigger apartments, but people are also very concerned about our human rights, our freedom, our political system. And some of them, like Joshua, have even sacrificed their personal freedom. They want to use their sacrifice to fight for something better for the city.</p> <p>It is very important not to give up. After the umbrella movement, a lot of people have maybe given up their dream that Hong Kong should have a democratic political system, because nothing changed. But when we look at the history of social change in other areas \u2013 such as gender or race equality \u2013 we see how people have needed to fight for 20 or 30 or even 100 years. I\u2019m 22 years old; perhaps I\u2019ll have to fight for Hong Kong\u2019s democracy until I\u2019m 70.

      "bodyText": "Noga Levy-Rapoport, 17, led the London climate strike march on 15 February and has since become a core organiser at UK Student Climate Network I first got involved in the February school strike in London. I saw something about it online and I wanted an opportunity to say that I, as a young person, am angry about what is going on. I\u2019m afraid, and I feel that there is great injustice. I felt like for the first time in a long time, we had actually taken a stand. After that I contacted Youth Strike 4 Climate and said I wanted to be involved, full-time. We are told that we\u2019re jumping on this bandwagon of adolescent insolence, but that is just not true. We\u2019re marching on the streets because we are furious \u2013 we are full of rage and terror \u2013 and those together have taught me that young people have the real power in our society. Our empowerment as individuals is key to change, and it has been the way that protests have brought change about over centuries. We need a fundamental change to our system \u2013 we need to fulfil the principles of the Green New Deal, and we need to listen to everyone. Activism for me is a part of my life and will remain that way, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to go on and become an MP. I want to be an opera singer. Activism shouldn\u2019t change who you are, it should come from who you are, and your beliefs, and how you want the world to see other people. Mugdha Mokashi, 22, is president elect of Medical Students for Choice and grew up in Alabama I\u2019m in my first year at Harvard Medical School. I was born in India but I consider Alabama my home, and I intend to return to provide abortion services when my studies are finished. I became interested in reproductive justice when I was 19. I started volunteering at a rape crisis centre. From there I started working in an organisation called URGE (Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity). They primarily work in states where the government and legislation is typically conservative or Republican. I brought a chapter to my campus. We held something called the Abortion Positive Tour in 2017, spending a week on campus, talking and distributing information about abortion, then we would hold a rally at the end. We got quite a bit of feedback and criticism \u2013 lots of yelling, lots of people saying we were going to hell \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t as dramatic as it could have been. There was no threat of physical violence. When Donald Trump was elected we felt a sense of urgency and we marched. I\u2019ve learned that activism is most effective when the voices of the people who are being oppressed or targeted are elevated and centred. Nothing really does that better than protest. It\u2019s a very accessible form of engagement you really can\u2019t beat how persuasive visceral emotion and passion are. An important tenet of activism is doing work both \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside the building\u201d. Outside are the traditional forms of protest, rallying and grassroots action, but you have to establish change inside, too. My interest is in reforming the medical institution and the policy-making sphere to match what people are marching about. The power of being disruptive and visible is a salient part of protest that I have been using in my day\u2011to-day work \u2013 the idea that to bring about change, people need to feel uncomfortable, and that to shift the window of discourse, you need something really powerful. Dallas Goldtooth, 35, is based in Chicago. He is the Keep It in the Ground campaigner for the Indigenous Environmental Network As cliched as it sounds, I was born into activism. My dad has been an organiser since as far back as I can remember. My own experience of organising started about six years ago in the fight against the Keystone XL pipeline, a tar sands pipeline that was supposed to cross the traditional territories of my people \u2013 the Great Sioux Nation. We brought to the doors of the White House a march of 10,000 people, led by Native American and non-Native farmers and ranchers, and we set up a tipi camp on the National Mall for six days. I\u2019m pretty proud to say we won that campaign. We were able to convince the Obama administration not to approve that pipeline. That\u2019s the goal of any good organiser \u2013 to work themselves out of a job. There are many different forms of protest, but they should all be tactics for a greater strategy. There is a lot of political turmoil right now and people are justifiably angry about the attacks on their self-determination, their land, their bodies. We want to march, and that\u2019s powerful because we\u2019re acting on the moment, and people have a right to express their anger and frustrations. But we have to challenge ourselves to look at the bigger picture of what we\u2019re building towards. The change that we wish to see, that we\u2019re trying to create in this world, has to be about addressing and challenging power. If our conversations, if our work, if our lives don\u2019t challenge the systems of power, then we\u2019re not really working towards the just society that we want. We have to reimagine our relationships to the greater world, to the land and to the ecosystem in which we live. That\u2019s a very strong indigenous framework: if you innately believe that the Earth is your mother and the animals and plants around you are brothers and sisters, then you have a responsibility to care for them in a different manner than if you just see them as natural resources to be managed. Yang Porter, 24, is a campaigner for women\u2019s rights in Saudi Arabia It was against the law for women to drive in Saudi Arabia, but in the early 2010s there was a Facebook campaign calling on Saudi women to go out and drive at a certain time, and a few women responded and went out and drove cars together. Many of them were put in jail and made to sign documents saying they would not drive again. When the new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, came to power, he decided it was time to give women the right to drive [in May 2018], but the authorities cracked down on the women who had protested before and jailed them again. I\u2019m speaking on behalf of these women. I haven\u2019t suffered the consequences personally but I\u2019ve seen them suffer the consequences, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s moving me now to make these efforts to expose what\u2019s happening. Women\u2019s freedom has a long way to go in Saudi Arabia; women can now drive, but still need permission from their male guardians to travel and to marry. I want to make people aware that there is still a human rights crisis going on there. What protest is happening now in Saudi Arabia is down to the scattered efforts of individuals. People are too afraid to act collectively. I can\u2019t really think of a Saudi collective group that has achieved anything in the last 100 years. We\u2019re not really familiar with collective effort, but it\u2019s possible, if this situation gets worse, that it might happen. I really hope it does. Demanding rights comes at a price. Everyone who has spoken out has suffered consequences. People reap the benefits from the accumulated efforts of others. That\u2019s how the history machine works, with individual sacrifice as its engine. Ancient civilisations used to believe that human sacrifices were necessary for their society to survive and prosper; this principle still applies. The only thing that has changed is that people now are willing to pay the price \u2013 to give up themselves, their lives and their time for a prosperous future for the collective. It\u2019s how you make the world a better place: sacrifice.

Many thought that Hong Kong people were just concerned with how to earn more money and live in bigger apartments, but people are also very concerned about our human rights, our freedom, our political system.

The dominant narrative in the media is about \u201cno platforming\u201d but it\u2019s not that at all; it\u2019s about doing our bit to try and stop the rise of the far right. We have to open the road behind us. That involves learning from the history of those who have struggled for freedom in the past. If you look at these movements in a narrow and defeatist way, you might come to the conclusion that they failed, because the basic power relations that they sought to change \u2013 be they colonialism, imperialism, patriarchy, capitalism \u2013 remain in place. But in these different visions of freedom, every new generation and every new activist can find the lessons and the inspiration to keep struggling \u2022 Interviews by Steve Rose.",

Regional spokesperson Robert Shivambu declined to comment on the allegations to the Guardian citing pending investigations.

Amnesty Zimbabwe is one among many civil society organisations in Zimbabwe to be implicated in the abuse of donor funds. Last year USAid suspended funding for NGOs that included Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZimRights), Election Resource Centre (ERC) and Counselling Services Unit (CSU) for alleged gross financial mismanagement. It comes months after a damning report into the wider Amnesty International organisation warned of a \u201ctoxic\u201d working environment and widespread bullying. The review was ordered by its head, Kumi Naidoo, after the suicides of two staff members last year, Ga\u00ebtan Mootoo, who worked in the Paris office, and Rosalind McGregor, a paid intern at the Geneva office. It pointed to a workplace culture of bullying, nepotism and an \u201cus v them\u201d dynamic which threatened the organisation\u2019s credibility as a human rights champion. Staff in the group are currently braced for redundancies after the management admitted to a hole in its budget of up to \u00a317m to the end of 2020.

Krymov visits Tolstoy\u2019s grave. He finds \u201cdamp, sticky earth; damp, unkind air; the rustle of autumn leaves underfoot\u201d. A Junker bomber breaks the silence.</p> <p>Tolstoy wrote about the events of 1812 from a distance. Grossman began writing in a more treacherous age, at a time when the war was fresh and Stalin was embarking on an antisemitic campaign. As a Jew, Grossman was a target. He published a version of <em>Stalingrad</em> in 1952, under the title <em>For </em><em>a Just Cause.</em> Soon after, the book was denounced. Stalin\u2019s death the following year may have saved Grossman from execution. Unlike Tolstoy, Grossman spent much of his career grappling with censors. Editors insisted on cuts and reworkings: chapters set in a coal-mine were plugged in. Robert Chandler \u2013 the original English translator of <em>Life and Fate</em> \u2013 gives us, along with his wife Elizabeth, a masterful new version of <em>Stalingrad.</em> It is mostly based on Grossman\u2019s early typescript and the post-Stalin 1956 edition of the novel. The Chandlers restores bold, humorous passages scrubbed by fastidious officials. They include mentions of lice, bad behaviour and infidelity.</p> <p>Grossman never saw <em>Life and Fate </em>appear in print; in 1960, the KGB \u201carrested\u201d his manuscript. The novel was eventually published after his death, to international acclaim. In Putin\u2019s Russia, Grossman is largely ignored. <em>Stalingrad\u2019s</em> long non-appearance in English is a mystery. It may have suffered from a lack of interest in Soviet culture. The novel was wrongly estimated on the grounds that anything published under Stalin couldn\u2019t have literary merit.</p> <p>In fact <em>Stalingrad</em> is <em>Life and Fate\u2019s</em> equal. It is, arguably, the richer book \u2013 shot through with human stories and a sense of life\u2019s beauty and fragility.</p> <p><em>Luke Harding\u2019s </em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/collusion-613409.html\" title=\"\"><em>Collusion: How Russia Helped Trump Win the White House</em></a><em> is published by Guardian Faber</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 Stalingrad </em>by Vasily Grossman, translated by Robert and Elizabeth Chandler, is published by Harvill Secker (\u00a325).

Tolstoy wrote about the events of 1812 from a distance. Grossman began writing in a more treacherous age, at a time when the war was fresh and Stalin was embarking on an antisemitic campaign. As a Jew, Grossman was a target. He published a version of Stalingrad in 1952, under the title For a Just Cause. Soon after, the book was denounced. Stalin\u2019s death the following year may have saved Grossman from execution. Unlike Tolstoy, Grossman spent much of his career grappling with censors. Editors insisted on cuts and reworkings: chapters set in a coal-mine were plugged in. Robert Chandler \u2013 the original English translator of Life and Fate \u2013 gives us, along with his wife Elizabeth, a masterful new version of Stalingrad. It is mostly based on Grossman\u2019s early typescript and the post-Stalin 1956 edition of the novel. The Chandlers restores bold, humorous passages scrubbed by fastidious officials. They include mentions of lice, bad behaviour and infidelity. Grossman never saw Life and Fate appear in print; in 1960, the KGB \u201carrested\u201d his manuscript. The novel was eventually published after his death, to international acclaim. In Putin\u2019s Russia, Grossman is largely ignored. Stalingrad\u2019s long non-appearance in English is a mystery. It may have suffered from a lack of interest in Soviet culture. The novel was wrongly estimated on the grounds that anything published under Stalin couldn\u2019t have literary merit. In fact Stalingrad is Life and Fate\u2019s equal. It is, arguably, the richer book \u2013 shot through with human stories and a sense of life\u2019s beauty and fragility.

On top of that, a near record number of tornadoes has whipped through the region, smashing homes and claiming nearly 40 lives so far. All of this comes after the <a href=\"https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/us-maps/12/201904?products%5B%5D=nationalpcpnrank#us-maps-select\">wettest 12 months</a> in the US since records began.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It feels like we\u2019ve been getting rained on for two months just practically nonstop. And again today it\u2019s nonstop</p> <footer> <cite>Dina Barker</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Storms and near record rainfall have caused the region\u2019s three major rivers to flood, inundating communities from Nebraska to Michigan and Illinois to Oklahoma, driving tens of thousands in to shelters, shutting businesses and closing interstate highways.</p> <p>Waters that used to surge and recede have stayed around, swamping millions of acres of farmland and devastating the planting season. The amount of land farmers are being prevented from sowing by the water is estimated to be as much as double the previous record of 3m acres of corn, set in 2013. The worst-hit states include Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska and Indiana.</p> <p>In Nebraska, where farmers are already grappling with the effects of Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China, which has killed off a good part of the soybean trade, flooding is estimated to have destroyed $1bn-worth of crops and livestock.</p> <p>In Iowa, bordered on either side by America\u2019s two greatest rivers, the Mississippi and the Missouri, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/15/it-has-to-be-dealt-with-what-is-the-future-for-midwest-towns-affected-by-climate-change\">entire towns have been engulfed</a> and some may never revive. At the weekend, levees failed on three rivers, flooding homes and forcing the evacuation of thousands in Iowa, Missouri and Arkansas. In other places, authorities raced to shore up protections against surging waters. Burlington was the latest city in Iowa to be swamped after its floodwalls failed and river water poured into downtown following three days of intense rain. The Mississippi has been in flood for 80 days with little sign of returning to normal anytime soon.</p> <p>Across state after state, people say the same thing unprompted: they have never seen anything like it. Many can point to previous great floods but there is common agreement that it is rare to see so much water for so long across one state after another.</p> <p>To compound the misery, about 270 tornadoes were recorded in May, including a record 13 straight days of twisters in the second half of the month.</p> <p>Every one of Oklahoma\u2019s 77 counties is under a state of emergency as the state is battered by some of the worst flooding in its history, tornadoes and powerful winds.</p> <p>Rain falling in southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma sets off a chain reaction. The water runs into the Arkansas River which flows into Kaw Lake, a reservoir and hydroelectric dam just inside Oklahoma\u2019s northern border. When Kaw Lake fills, the engineers open the dam gates. Ten days ago, it was 35ft above normal and releasing more than 100,000 cubic feet of water per second.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"16c1cdf6914f47d05285f3cd80f6636524501a8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16c1cdf6914f47d05285f3cd80f6636524501a8a/0_0_4340_2894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers lay down sandbags to keep water from flooding the entrance to a bridge across to Arkansas river in Russellville.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers lay down sandbags to keep water from flooding the entrance to a bridge across to Arkansas River in Russellville.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Metthe/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The water surged about 80 miles down the Arkansas River and into another manmade lake, the Keystone. But after weeks of rain, Keystone was struggling with flows from a second unregulated river even before the overflow from Kaw arrived.</p> <p>By early last week, the Keystone engineers were releasing 275,000 cubic feet of water a second, more than double the rate of water over Niagara Falls and the second largest outflow in the dam\u2019s history. The waterfall through the gates threw up a huge cloud of spray and let loose a bubbling torrent down the river, overpowering levees protecting part of Sand Springs a few miles away.</p> <h2>\u2018It took over quick\u2019</h2> <p>Sam Duvall and Lisa Gaines were living in a mobile home in the Meadow Valley neighbourhood. Theirs was one of five trailers, beyond which was what Duval calls a \u201creal nice house\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey were an older couple and apparently they had lived there for 40 or 50 years. We see them moving a U-Haul in two days before any of the rest of us knew what was going on,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Duvall, 43, and Gaines, 49, soon found out.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was growing like two feet every hour. Fast. Now you can\u2019t even see the house. It\u2019s completely engulfed</p> <footer> <cite>Sam Duvall</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe were about 75ft from the water when the river\u2019s at its normal state. When it started coming, it took over quick. It was growing like two feet every hour. Fast. Now you can\u2019t even see the house. It\u2019s completely engulfed,\u201d Duvall said.</p> <p>The couple got about three hours\u2019 notice to leave, from police who banged on the door. They filled a couple of suitcases and some small bags and fled. By then, the water was touching the back of their home.</p> <p>\u201cI grabbed my important papers,\u201d said Gaines. \u201cThat was really it.\u201d</p> <p>The couple moved into a motel just up the road, close to their jobs. Duvall is a cook and Gaines a waitress. The following day the police were at the door again, saying the water was still rising and to be prepared to leave. By then the river had engulfed most of Meadow Valley.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s 153 houses there and only a dozen that don\u2019t have water in them,\u201d said police captain Todd Enzbrenner.</p> <p>The rest of the town is protected by levees that held their own but were tested as never before. In 1986 a huge flood forced engineers at Keystone Lake to release 305,000 cubic feet of water per second but that only lasted for 12 hours. This time, although the flow was marginally less, the river was pounding the levees for 72 hours. National guardsmen patrolled the 20-mile length, looking for signs they might give way.</p> <p>\u201cNothing compares to this one,\u201d said Enzbrenner. \u201cThis is the most river water that\u2019s ever been on the levees for this extended period of time. But there they are. They\u2019re doing the job. They\u2019re holding up.\u201d</p> <p>The dam engineers dialled back the amount of water flowing out of the dam at the weekend but with more storms predicted the threat remains, not just to Sand Springs but to neighbouring Tulsa, where a large part of the waterfront has flooded including parts of the sprawling River Spirit Casino.</p> <p>Further downriver, nearly 2,500 people were forced from their homes as the Arkansas rose to the highest levels since 1943 at Muskogee and then broke its banks. Just across the state border in Arkansas, hundreds of homes were flooded in the state\u2019s second largest city, Fort Smith, even before the river crested there at a record 41ft on Saturday.</p> <h2>\u2018The house is probably ruined\u2019</h2> <p>For some, the crisis has been far more drawn out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/12/as-climate-change-bites-in-americas-midwest-farmers-are-desperate-to-ring-the-alarm\">As climate change bites in America\u2019s midwest, farmers are desperate to ring the alarm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Richard Oswald farms in northern Missouri. In December, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/12/as-climate-change-bites-in-americas-midwest-farmers-are-desperate-to-ring-the-alarm\">spoke to the Guardian</a> about the increasing difficulty of farming amid dramatically changing weather patterns, with longer and more intense rains leaving fields perpetually soaked and disrupting the planting season.</p> <p>Then came the \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d, in March. Huge floodwaters carried large chunks of ice into the Spencer dam in northern Nebraska. The pressure of the water and the battering from the ice broke the 90-year-old structure, collapsing the dam and unleashing its contents in a huge surge. The subsequent flash flood merged into the Missouri River, already brimming with water from melting snow running over frozen ground in Iowa and South Dakota. The wall of water swept away levees to sink towns and farms, including Oswald\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a record crest on the Missouri River here just across the river from where I live at Brownsville, Nebraska,\u201d he said. \u201cIt topped the levees.

He called his son and they dragged planters and cultivators, irrigation systems and grain trailers, generators and fuel storage tanks along roads increasingly swamped by water and mud.</p> <p>\u201cI tied propane tanks to trees or whatever was close so they wouldn\u2019t float away,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The roads were so bad all winter and into the spring that there was just no way to get that corn out</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Oswald</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All of it had to be got out because Oswald\u2019s farm insurance did not cover damage to machinery from flooding.

      "bodyText": "Even with half of the houses on her street underwater, Dina Barker looked at the numbers and calculated that it was worth holding out. The rate at which water was pouring out of the rain-swollen Keystone dam less than 10 miles up the Arkansas River had been enough to submerge most of Barker\u2019s neighbourhood in Sand Springs, Oklahoma, last week. But her house sits on a small rise just feet from the pop-up lake that rose in hours as the surging river broke the town\u2019s flood walls. Over the following days, Barker paid close attention to the dam\u2019s engineers. If they announced they were opening the gates another couple of notches, it would be time to run. That would depend not only on whether the rain kept coming but, more importantly, where it fell. \u201cI packed my suitcase and my papers and my medicine in my car this morning so that if I have to leave I can load my animals in and I can go,\u201d said the 57-year-old civil servant. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve been getting rained on for two months just practically nonstop. And again today it\u2019s nonstop.\u201d The fate of Barker and the rest of Sand Springs, along with the neighbouring city of Tulsa and communities down the the Arkansas River, hung less on the torrential downpour than what was happening hundreds of miles to the north. Weeks of flooding is drowning large parts of the midwest, wrecking communities and turning farms into inland seas. On top of that, a near record number of tornadoes has whipped through the region, smashing homes and claiming nearly 40 lives so far. All of this comes after the wettest 12 months in the US since records began. Storms and near record rainfall have caused the region\u2019s three major rivers to flood, inundating communities from Nebraska to Michigan and Illinois to Oklahoma, driving tens of thousands in to shelters, shutting businesses and closing interstate highways. Waters that used to surge and recede have stayed around, swamping millions of acres of farmland and devastating the planting season. The amount of land farmers are being prevented from sowing by the water is estimated to be as much as double the previous record of 3m acres of corn, set in 2013. The worst-hit states include Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska and Indiana. In Nebraska, where farmers are already grappling with the effects of Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China, which has killed off a good part of the soybean trade, flooding is estimated to have destroyed $1bn-worth of crops and livestock. In Iowa, bordered on either side by America\u2019s two greatest rivers, the Mississippi and the Missouri, entire towns have been engulfed and some may never revive. At the weekend, levees failed on three rivers, flooding homes and forcing the evacuation of thousands in Iowa, Missouri and Arkansas. In other places, authorities raced to shore up protections against surging waters. Burlington was the latest city in Iowa to be swamped after its floodwalls failed and river water poured into downtown following three days of intense rain. The Mississippi has been in flood for 80 days with little sign of returning to normal anytime soon. Across state after state, people say the same thing unprompted: they have never seen anything like it. Many can point to previous great floods but there is common agreement that it is rare to see so much water for so long across one state after another. To compound the misery, about 270 tornadoes were recorded in May, including a record 13 straight days of twisters in the second half of the month. Every one of Oklahoma\u2019s 77 counties is under a state of emergency as the state is battered by some of the worst flooding in its history, tornadoes and powerful winds. Rain falling in southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma sets off a chain reaction. The water runs into the Arkansas River which flows into Kaw Lake, a reservoir and hydroelectric dam just inside Oklahoma\u2019s northern border. When Kaw Lake fills, the engineers open the dam gates. Ten days ago, it was 35ft above normal and releasing more than 100,000 cubic feet of water per second. The water surged about 80 miles down the Arkansas River and into another manmade lake, the Keystone. But after weeks of rain, Keystone was struggling with flows from a second unregulated river even before the overflow from Kaw arrived. By early last week, the Keystone engineers were releasing 275,000 cubic feet of water a second, more than double the rate of water over Niagara Falls and the second largest outflow in the dam\u2019s history. The waterfall through the gates threw up a huge cloud of spray and let loose a bubbling torrent down the river, overpowering levees protecting part of Sand Springs a few miles away. \u2018It took over quick\u2019 Sam Duvall and Lisa Gaines were living in a mobile home in the Meadow Valley neighbourhood. Theirs was one of five trailers, beyond which was what Duval calls a \u201creal nice house\u201d. \u201cThey were an older couple and apparently they had lived there for 40 or 50 years. We see them moving a U-Haul in two days before any of the rest of us knew what was going on,\u201d he said. Duvall, 43, and Gaines, 49, soon found out. \u201cWe were about 75ft from the water when the river\u2019s at its normal state. When it started coming, it took over quick. It was growing like two feet every hour. Fast. Now you can\u2019t even see the house. It\u2019s completely engulfed,\u201d Duvall said. The couple got about three hours\u2019 notice to leave, from police who banged on the door. They filled a couple of suitcases and some small bags and fled. By then, the water was touching the back of their home. \u201cI grabbed my important papers,\u201d said Gaines. \u201cThat was really it.\u201d The couple moved into a motel just up the road, close to their jobs. Duvall is a cook and Gaines a waitress. The following day the police were at the door again, saying the water was still rising and to be prepared to leave. By then the river had engulfed most of Meadow Valley. \u201cThere\u2019s 153 houses there and only a dozen that don\u2019t have water in them,\u201d said police captain Todd Enzbrenner. The rest of the town is protected by levees that held their own but were tested as never before. In 1986 a huge flood forced engineers at Keystone Lake to release 305,000 cubic feet of water per second but that only lasted for 12 hours. This time, although the flow was marginally less, the river was pounding the levees for 72 hours. National guardsmen patrolled the 20-mile length, looking for signs they might give way. \u201cNothing compares to this one,\u201d said Enzbrenner. \u201cThis is the most river water that\u2019s ever been on the levees for this extended period of time. But there they are. They\u2019re doing the job. They\u2019re holding up.\u201d The dam engineers dialled back the amount of water flowing out of the dam at the weekend but with more storms predicted the threat remains, not just to Sand Springs but to neighbouring Tulsa, where a large part of the waterfront has flooded including parts of the sprawling River Spirit Casino. Further downriver, nearly 2,500 people were forced from their homes as the Arkansas rose to the highest levels since 1943 at Muskogee and then broke its banks. Just across the state border in Arkansas, hundreds of homes were flooded in the state\u2019s second largest city, Fort Smith, even before the river crested there at a record 41ft on Saturday. \u2018The house is probably ruined\u2019 For some, the crisis has been far more drawn out. Richard Oswald farms in northern Missouri. In December, he spoke to the Guardian about the increasing difficulty of farming amid dramatically changing weather patterns, with longer and more intense rains leaving fields perpetually soaked and disrupting the planting season. Then came the \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d, in March. Huge floodwaters carried large chunks of ice into the Spencer dam in northern Nebraska. The pressure of the water and the battering from the ice broke the 90-year-old structure, collapsing the dam and unleashing its contents in a huge surge. The subsequent flash flood merged into the Missouri River, already brimming with water from melting snow running over frozen ground in Iowa and South Dakota. The wall of water swept away levees to sink towns and farms, including Oswald\u2019s. \u201cWe had a record crest on the Missouri River here just across the river from where I live at Brownsville, Nebraska,\u201d he said. \u201cIt topped the levees. After about two or three days of topping we began to have levee failures and we had more levee failures than I\u2019ve ever seen here.\u201d The water washed across his farm, engulfing every bit of land except for 500 acres on a terraced hillside. It also swamped his house. \u201cMy home where I was born, where I\u2019ve lived all my life, that\u2019s been through three previous floods, that has never been harmed by the river, never had water on the ground floor, my home for the first time ever had water on the ground floor,\u201d he said. \u201cI went back three times. All the roads were flooded but I could get through it with a big tractor. I think the house is probably ruined the way the mould is. The water was in the basement as well as on the ground floor. I didn\u2019t have time to move any of my appliances or furniture or really very few of my clothes.\u201d Oswald\u2019s priority was more than $1m worth of machinery, some of it highly technical like the massive semi-autonomous combine harvester. He called his son and they dragged planters and cultivators, irrigation systems and grain trailers, generators and fuel storage tanks along roads increasingly swamped by water and mud. \u201cI tied propane tanks to trees or whatever was close so they wouldn\u2019t float away,\u201d he said. All of it had to be got out because Oswald\u2019s farm insurance did not cover damage to machinery from flooding. It meant he had to abandon $80,000 worth of corn harvested in January and stored in four large bins. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have had it there at all except that the roads were so bad all winter and into the spring that there was just no way to get that corn out,\u201d he said. Grain silos collapsed by flood waters dot the landscape along the path of the Missouri River, a visible symbol of the toll on farming. Roger Johnson, president of the National Farmers Union, said the flooding brings yet more pressure. \u201cNet farm income and the US is down 50% in the last six years,\u201d he said. \u201c You have trade being disrupted which makes net farm income an even larger issue. And then on top of that you get this really extraordinary beginning to a crop year that has resulted in literally thousands of farmers being in a really untenable position of not being able to plant crops. The planting window has closed in lots of places and is rapidly closing and others and there is really no end in sight.\u201d \u2018It is so wet\u2019 Corn production is expected to be way below the agriculture department\u2019s prediction earlier this year of a bumper crop. As it is, less than half of the typical acreage has been planted so far, with Indiana at one-fifth of normal levels. \u201cSoybeans is even worse,\u201d said Johnson. Kansas has harvested just 22% of soybean acreage so far this year compared with 63% at this time in 2018. Last year, the National Climate Assessment warned of heavier rains, along with droughts and hotter summers, causing \u201csubstantial damages\u201d to midwestern agriculture. Johnson said the dramatic falls in production are unlikely to have an impact on food supplies because most US corn and soya goes to feed livestock or make ethanol, and there are alternatives for both. \u201cI\u2019m not worried that we\u2019re going to end up with the food shortages on top of this. But it does create a lot of chaos in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is so wet. There\u2019s so much land that\u2019s under so much water that you\u2019d literally have to have the rain stop, the sun come out, the wind blow, humidity be low and even then you\u2019d have I think millions of acres of land that would have to go unplanted because they\u2019re just too waterlogged. So it\u2019s a piling on of circumstances all of which are beyond the control of individual farmers and ranchers. That\u2019s why there is so much stress out at farm country right now.\u201d Oswald is not sure what will happen after the waters finally recede. \u201cI\u2019ve seen erosion going on out in the fields,\u201d he said. \u201cI have seen water flowing across the fields washing soil away.

      "body": "<p>There is a sentiment I think is widely felt among progressive Australians: why can\u2019t Labor and the Greens work together instead of this constant bloody squabbling? Conflict is dispiriting, but it\u2019s inspiring to imagine the two parties somehow joining forces. A new and vigorous political movement that could smash the disunited and increasingly aimless conservatives.</p> <p>Of course, there are a few problems with this scenario.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/26/hindsight-is-a-wonderful-thing-how-getups-election-campaign-fell-flat\">'Hindsight is a wonderful thing': how GetUp's election campaign fell flat</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2019/jun/02/labor-and-the-greens-have-to-join-forces-for-the-climates-sake\">Greg Jericho has written about it</a> and his main point regarding the Greens boils down to, \u201cSure, you have some Senate seats. Lovely. But that\u2019s not really how we measure success when the planet is warming, is it?\u201d No, it\u2019s not, and given the state of environmental policy it\u2019s difficult to argue that the Greens\u2019 core mission is on track. Could this have been foreseen 30 years ago, and should the green left have joined forces with the \u201cred\u201d left back then and remade history?</p> <p>No.</p> <p>The first problem with this idea is that it\u2019s simplistic to paint the environmental movement as a mere offshoot of left politics. The Greens and Labor aren\u2019t divided by minor tactical differences over whether emissions targets should be X or Y, or what year is best to move to electric vehicles. Labor is and always will be a party that champions jobs and economic growth as a way of improving the lives of Australian workers\u2014and fair enough. The Greens also want everyone to be taken care of, but believe an economy based on exponentially increasing resource extraction has to be fundamentally re-thought. The Greens maintain that the ecology that supports us should be given primacy. This is an ideology of an entirely different sort to that which gave birth to the Labor movement.</p> <p>At this point we have acknowledge that much of what is considered by outsiders to be bickering is a genuine and serious contest of ideas. This is actually healthy, not just a squabble over jobs and territory. We also hear more about the differences than the common ground. When the two parties do work together\u2014common in parliaments, ubiquitous in local government\u2014it generates little comment. It also provides weak campaigning fodder.</p> <p>The second reason why a green merger with the Labor left would be a non-starter is that it would have only exacerbated the conflict within Labor. You could not jam the Franklin river campaigners into the same party as the forestry union and expect to see a more united and functional party. I can\u2019t see how such a divided party would have won more elections. And as for the greenies who joined the ALP to fight the good fight, more than likely they\u2019d have been chewed up and spat out. That\u2019s not a criticism of Labor; which organisation would not push back on an outside group coming in to stack it out and change its mission?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/04/whither-the-greens-how-a-reckoning-looms-for-a-party-fighting-to-hang-on\">Whither the Greens? How a reckoning looms for a party fighting to hang on</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most importantly, I firmly believe that the Greens exist because they must exist. If Bob Brown and the rest of the founders of the Australian Greens had joined the ALP in 1992 instead of forming their own party, it would only briefly have delayed the inevitable rise of political environmentalism. For some of us there is a burning need for someone to stand up and say what needs to be said about this little planet of ours and the havoc we are wreaking upon it. There are many of us who are motivated primarily by the fear of environmental collapse and the hope of a better way of doing things. It is an idea whose time has come, and it must be expressed, as a political identity as well as in all walks of life. It is too big to exist merely as a sub-faction of the Labor party.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not like the change-from-within idea has not been tried. There are plenty of former ALP members in the Greens, including myself, who tried; and many in the ALP are trying still. </p> <p>So where does this leave the Australian left? It is too easy to believe that the Greens and ALP are destined to bitterly slug it out from opposition and the crossbenches while the country slides into climate catastrophe. One scenario in which the two sides of progressive politics could form a detente might see Labor move to the right in an effort to recapture those parts of middle Australia and the coal belt that kept them out of government. Meanwhile, they yield enough political territory to the Greens so that when they are in government there is a strong parliamentary bloc that can push, with force if need be, for real action on climate and environmental issues. In other words, Labor could acknowledge the Greens\u2019 right to exist and give up on the goal of winning majority government.</p> <p>The phrase \u201cyield political territory\u201d tells you all you need to know about the chances of such an arrangement materialising.</p> <p>As for a formal national coalition, there are some who see this as inevitable. The Greens have already held ministries in Labor governments in Tasmania and the ACT. But there are few in either party who think this did either partner any favours, a view reinforced by the defeat of Greens-supported Gillard/Rudd government in 2013. Therefore, the ALP will resist such an arrangement as long as possible, and the Greens may well baulk at drinking from that poisoned chalice.</p> <p>It is true that some sort of alliance is in the interests of the country and the planet. Figuring out how to accomplish that is as difficult as figuring out how to unite a diverse and divided Australia. There\u2019s a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Colin Jacobs is a former staffer to senator Richard Di Natale, serving as Greens director of policy and strategy in the Australian parliament</em></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "There is a sentiment I think is widely felt among progressive Australians: why can\u2019t Labor and the Greens work together instead of this constant bloody squabbling? Conflict is dispiriting, but it\u2019s inspiring to imagine the two parties somehow joining forces. A new and vigorous political movement that could smash the disunited and increasingly aimless conservatives. Of course, there are a few problems with this scenario. Greg Jericho has written about it and his main point regarding the Greens boils down to, \u201cSure, you have some Senate seats. Lovely. But that\u2019s not really how we measure success when the planet is warming, is it?\u201d No, it\u2019s not, and given the state of environmental policy it\u2019s difficult to argue that the Greens\u2019 core mission is on track. Could this have been foreseen 30 years ago, and should the green left have joined forces with the \u201cred\u201d left back then and remade history? No. The first problem with this idea is that it\u2019s simplistic to paint the environmental movement as a mere offshoot of left politics. The Greens and Labor aren\u2019t divided by minor tactical differences over whether emissions targets should be X or Y, or what year is best to move to electric vehicles. Labor is and always will be a party that champions jobs and economic growth as a way of improving the lives of Australian workers\u2014and fair enough. The Greens also want everyone to be taken care of, but believe an economy based on exponentially increasing resource extraction has to be fundamentally re-thought. The Greens maintain that the ecology that supports us should be given primacy. This is an ideology of an entirely different sort to that which gave birth to the Labor movement. At this point we have acknowledge that much of what is considered by outsiders to be bickering is a genuine and serious contest of ideas. This is actually healthy, not just a squabble over jobs and territory. We also hear more about the differences than the common ground. When the two parties do work together\u2014common in parliaments, ubiquitous in local government\u2014it generates little comment. It also provides weak campaigning fodder. The second reason why a green merger with the Labor left would be a non-starter is that it would have only exacerbated the conflict within Labor. You could not jam the Franklin river campaigners into the same party as the forestry union and expect to see a more united and functional party. I can\u2019t see how such a divided party would have won more elections. And as for the greenies who joined the ALP to fight the good fight, more than likely they\u2019d have been chewed up and spat out. That\u2019s not a criticism of Labor; which organisation would not push back on an outside group coming in to stack it out and change its mission? Most importantly, I firmly believe that the Greens exist because they must exist. If Bob Brown and the rest of the founders of the Australian Greens had joined the ALP in 1992 instead of forming their own party, it would only briefly have delayed the inevitable rise of political environmentalism. For some of us there is a burning need for someone to stand up and say what needs to be said about this little planet of ours and the havoc we are wreaking upon it. There are many of us who are motivated primarily by the fear of environmental collapse and the hope of a better way of doing things. It is an idea whose time has come, and it must be expressed, as a political identity as well as in all walks of life. It is too big to exist merely as a sub-faction of the Labor party. And it\u2019s not like the change-from-within idea has not been tried. There are plenty of former ALP members in the Greens, including myself, who tried; and many in the ALP are trying still. So where does this leave the Australian left? It is too easy to believe that the Greens and ALP are destined to bitterly slug it out from opposition and the crossbenches while the country slides into climate catastrophe. One scenario in which the two sides of progressive politics could form a detente might see Labor move to the right in an effort to recapture those parts of middle Australia and the coal belt that kept them out of government. Meanwhile, they yield enough political territory to the Greens so that when they are in government there is a strong parliamentary bloc that can push, with force if need be, for real action on climate and environmental issues. In other words, Labor could acknowledge the Greens\u2019 right to exist and give up on the goal of winning majority government. The phrase \u201cyield political territory\u201d tells you all you need to know about the chances of such an arrangement materialising. As for a formal national coalition, there are some who see this as inevitable. The Greens have already held ministries in Labor governments in Tasmania and the ACT. But there are few in either party who think this did either partner any favours, a view reinforced by the defeat of Greens-supported Gillard/Rudd government in 2013. Therefore, the ALP will resist such an arrangement as long as possible, and the Greens may well baulk at drinking from that poisoned chalice. It is true that some sort of alliance is in the interests of the country and the planet. Figuring out how to accomplish that is as difficult as figuring out how to unite a diverse and divided Australia. There\u2019s a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in.

These are the places that only locals know about. \u4e16\u754c\u3067\u3082\u6700\u3082\u4eba\u53e3\u5bc6\u5ea6\u306e\u9ad8\u3044\u8857\u3068\u3057\u3066\u77e5\u3089\u3066\u3044\u308b\u6771\u4eac\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306f\u4eba\u6df7\u307f\u3092\u907f\u3051\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3069\u3053\u306b\u884c\u304d\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f \u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u306e\u4eba\u304c\u307e\u305a\u3001\u6771\u4eac\u3068\u3044\u3046\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u3067\u601d\u3044\u3064\u304f\u306e\u304c\u3001\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30a2\u30ef\u30fc\u306e\u6e80\u54e1\u96fb\u8eca\u3084\u6e0b\u8c37\u306e\u4ea4\u5dee\u70b9\u3092\u6a2a\u5207\u308b\u4eba\u6df7\u307f\u3067\u3059\u3002\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u4eba\u53e3\u306f\u6e1b\u5c11\u3057\u3064\u3064\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u300113\uff10\uff10\u4e07\u306e\u4eba\u304c\u4f4f\u3080\u5927\u90fd\u4f1a\u3067\u3059\u3002\u305d\u308c\u306a\u306e\u306b\u3001\u6771\u4eac\u306f\u3068\u3066\u3082\u89aa\u3057\u307f\u306e\u3042\u308b\u307f\u3058\u304b\u306a\u4eba\u9593\u7684\u306a\u5834\u6240\u3067\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u81ea\u8eab\u3082\u8857\u3092\u4e00\u9031\u9593\u3044\u308d\u3044\u308d\u63a2\u7d22\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3066\u3001\u6771\u4eac\u306e\u4f4f\u6c11\u304c\u4eba\u6df7\u307f\u3092\u907f\u3051\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3069\u3053\u306b\u884c\u304f\u306e\u304b\u3068\u3066\u3082\u8208\u5473\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u6771\u4eac\u306e\u4eba\u3060\u3051\u304c\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306a\u5834\u6240\u3092\u3082\u3063\u3068\u77e5\u308a\u305f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002 How to share your story We\u2019re keen to show this side of the city, so we\u2019re creating a video featuring Tokyo residents sharing their favourite place to enjoy peace and quiet.

While villages to the south have become tourist honeypots, this section of coast remains staunchly undeveloped for visitors, yet no less spectacular. In Skinningrove, we get an instant coffee at the corner shop and admire the public toilets \u2013 built in memory of the shipwrecked crew of a Norwegian barque stranded here in 1901. The sandy beach is stunning, and empty. The last section of path takes us up to 203 metres, over the highest sea cliffs on the east coast of England, before we drop down to our finish in Staithes, arguably the prettiest village, with the Cod and Lobster, the best pub. Across the cobbled lane is the place where James Cook worked, standing in the grocer\u2019s window, staring out to sea. My affection for the remainder of the path ahead, all the way to Filey, is unwavering, but my favourite hike has just got longer. \u2022 The trip was provided by the North York Moors national park. The King\u2019s Head in Newton under Roseberry has Walk-Inn breaks from \u00a385pp, including dinner, packed lunch (bait), boot cleaning and a waterproof OS walking pack containing 20 classic walks; and doubles from \u00a399 room-only. Doubles/twins at the Spa Hotel in Saltburn start from \u00a379 B&amp;B Looking for a holiday with a difference? Browse Guardian Holidays to see a range of fantastic trips",

      "bodyText": "The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison has downplayed \u2013 but not denied \u2013 speculation the United States considered placing trade tariffs on Australian aluminium imports last week. The New York Times reported that the Trump administration had discussed placing tariffs on Australian aluminium, which, under a deal struck by former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, remains exempt from tariffs Donald Trump placed on metal imports to the US in 2018. The NYT reported the White House decided against making any changes to the Australian arrangement after defence and diplomatic advisers cautioned against any actions which could potentially alienate a key ally in the Asia-Pacific region. Speaking in the Solomon Islands, Morrison did not deny the report, but said Australia remained in communication with the States. \u201cWe have an arrangement with the United States and we are working within that arrangement and working closely with the US officials and the White House on all those issues,\u201d he said. Trump himself also downplayed the report, but did not deny it, as he boarded a helicopter at the White House earlier on Monday. \u201cThe Australian situation is interesting, but the relationship is very strong. No, we\u2019re doing a very, a very special relationship with Australia,\u201d he said. Turnbull negotiated the exemptions, which protect Australia from the 25% steel tariff and 10% aluminium tariff introduced by Trump in late 2017. Other countries, including South Korea and Argentina, were awarded temporary reprieves in exchange for supply limits after Trump signed the tariffs into existence. Since then, Australian aluminium exporters have seen their imports to the US jump by about 45% between 2017 and 2018, and a reported 350% in the first quarter of 2019, compared with the same quarter last year. It was those figures which reportedly saw US trade advisers suggest the tariffs, citing concerns Australian aluminium was flooding the market and undercutting local suppliers. But despite the increases, Australian suppliers still only make up 6% of total aluminium imports to the United States. With Trump itching for trade fights, having already sparked confrontations with traditional allies including Canada, Europe and most recently, Mexico, officials in Canberra remain wary Australia\u2019s exemptions could be scrapped. The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said Australia continued to work within the arrangement set out by the US, but also made it clear Australia was not overstepping its bounds or taking advantage of the exemptions. \u201cThere has been no dumping of Australian aluminium into the US or any other market,\u201d Birmingham said in a statement. \u201cAustralia\u2019s aluminium producers trade at market prices in a competitive environment, receiving no government subsidies or similar support. \u201cThe US and Australia are great allies as well as economic partners and we continue to work cooperatively to build on our close and mutually beneficial trade and investment ties.\u201d Australia remains a key defence partner for the United States in the Asia-Pacific region, a relationship which continues to grow in importance in the wake of China\u2019s growing influence in the region. Australia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Joe Hockey, recently announced he would not be seeking to renew his term, with senator Arthur Sinodinos announced as his replacement.",

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Protesters promise show of force</h2> <p>Good morning, this is Alison Rourke bringing you this Monday briefing on what\u2019s set to be a blockbuster week in politics.</p> <p>All eyes will be on London today as Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/02/donald-trump-to-land-in-uk-amid-rising-anger-over-trade-demands\">flies in for his much-anticipated visit</a>. The trip could provide some awkward moments when he meets Theresa May in her last few days as prime minister (she is set to formally resign on Friday). The White House sees the trip as an opportunity for a \u201creset moment\u201d on trade, but Trump lands in the thick of the Tory leadership battle, in which he has made no bones about his preferred candidate, Boris Johnson. On <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/03/trump-praises-nigel-farage-and-refuses-to-apologise-for-nasty-jibe-as-he-leaves-us\">potentially meeting Johnson</a>, Trump told reporters before he left Washington: \u201cWell I may meet with him, he\u2019s been a friend of mine, he\u2019s been very nice.\u201d He also added he had a \u201cvery good relationship with Nigel Farage\u201d.</p> <p>May meanwhile has called the visit \u201ca significant week for the special relationship and an opportunity to further strengthen our already close partnership\u201d. She stressed the need to build closer trading ties, but with only five days left in the job, it\u2019s hard to see how much influence she will have.</p> <p>Another Johnson has also been helping set the scene ahead of the visit \u2013 Trump\u2019s US ambassador in the UK, Woody Johnson, has suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/02/us-wants-access-to-nhs-in-post-brexit-deal-ambassador-to-uk-says\">the NHS should be \u201con the table\u201d</a> in future trade negotiations with the US. Trump\u2019s man in London also indicated the UK would need to allow US agricultural products, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/06/britain-urged-to-reject-backward-us-food-safety-standards\">chlorinated chicken</a>, on to the UK market as part of any post-Brexit trade deal.</p> <p>So there will be plenty of subjects to avoid during the president\u2019s banquet at Buckingham Palace tonight with the Queen, before formal talks in Downing Street tomorrow, when the giant Trump baby balloon is expected to fly over large protests.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Tory hopefuls</strong> \u2013 As the 13 runners and<strong> </strong>riders in the Conservative party leadership race jockey for position, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/03/matt-hancock-pledges-to-lift-immigration-limits-on-nhs-medics\">the centrist Matt Hancock will today call for the UK to allow complete freedom of movement for medics from around the world</a>. The health secretary will promise to lift all immigration restrictions for qualified doctors and nurses of any nationality who have secured a job in the NHS. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has put forward his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/03/boris-johnson-pledges-to-raise-secondary-school-spending\">first major domestic policy proposa</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/25/moderate-tories-launch-stop-boris-johnson-campaign\">l</a>, saying he would \u201csignificantly\u201d lift spending on secondary school students to at least \u00a35,000 per pupil if he became the next prime minister.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Jared Kushner </strong>\u2013 The US Middle East envoy has expressed uncertainty over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/03/jared-kushner-expresses-doubt-palestinians-self-govern-trump-racism\">the ability of Palestinians to self-govern</a>, in a rare television interview broadcast last night. Kushner, Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and an architect of the White House\u2019s yet-to-be-released Middle East peace plan, said it would be a \u201chigh bar\u201d when asked if the Palestinians could expect freedom from Israeli military and government interference. Kushner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/03/lets-just-not-say-it-jared-kushner-says-two-state-label-hinders-middle-east-talks\">again avoided saying explicitly </a>whether the plan would include a two-state solution, the bedrock of US policy for decades. But he said: \u201cI do think they should have self-determination. I\u2019m going to leave the details until we come out with the actual plan.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Not so equal </strong>\u2013 Not a single country is expected to achieve gender equality by 2030, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jun/03/not-one-single-country-set-to-achieve-gender-equality-by-2030\">first index to measure progress against a set of internationally agreed targets.</a> According to the inaugural SDG Gender Index, launched today, even the Nordic states, which score highly in the index, would need to take huge strides to fulfil gender commitments in the 17 sustainable development goals, which 193 countries signed up to in 2015. The index measured progress in 129 countries, marking them from zero to 100. Countries with an overall score of 90 or more are making excellent progress, but only 21 countries got 80 or above. Denmark came in first with 89.3.

Almost one in four people (24%) aged 18-24 say reality TV makes them worry about their body image, according to the YouGov survey of 4,505 UK adults. More than one in seven (15%) said they had self-harmed or deliberately hurt themselves because of concerns about their body image, and 23% had experienced suicidal thoughts because of concerns in relation to their body image. The foundation\u2019s Dr Antonis Kousoulis acknowledged that the show had issued mental health aftercare guidelines for contestants, \u201cbut they must also take into consideration the potential damage being done to viewers\u201d, adding that contestants\u2019 appearance are \u201cnot diverse, [are] largely unrealistic and [are] presented as aspirational\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Drink up </strong>\u2013 Coffee addicts will be pleased to hear that scientists say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/02/up-to-25-cups-of-coffee-a-day-safe-for-heart-health-study-finds\">drinking up to 25 cups a day is not bad for your heart</a>. Some previous studies have suggested that coffee stiffens arteries, putting pressure on the heart and increasing the likelihood of a heart attack or stroke, with drinkers warned to cut down. But a new study (part-funded by the British Heart Foundation) of more than 8,000 people across the UK found that drinking five cups a day, and even up to 25, is no worse for the arteries than drinking less than a cup a day.</p> <h2>Today in Focus podcast: Inside Isis</h2> <p>Martin Chulov, the Guardian\u2019s Middle East correspondent, discusses his meeting with Umm Sayyaf, the most senior female Islamic State captive. In her first interview, Sayyaf reveals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/jun/03/inside-islamic-state-umm-sayyaf-podcast\">her role in helping the CIA hunt for the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.</a> And Johny Pitt on how an ice bath with pop duo Jedward promoted a journey around Europe exploring Afropean identity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76637065d293b8d7d09e2637a839ec6806347c8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76637065d293b8d7d09e2637a839ec6806347c8f/113_0_3273_1964/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi recently appeared on an Isis propaganda video for the first time in five years.

Now they\u2019re back with a No 1 single and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/03/we-needed-to-speak-our-truth-and-forgive-jonas-brothers-on-music-marriage-and-making-up\"> talking about marriage, family rifts and why it took so long to patch things up.</a> More than half a decade since their split (that was blamed on a \u201cdeep rift within the band\u201d) the brothers are married, settled and arguably in better musical shape than ever before, writes the Guardian\u2019s Peter Robinson. But their journey through teenage stardom and a rift in the band at the time when their father was managing them, left its marks. \u201cI was mad as hell,\u201d says Joe Jonas of his younger brother Nick\u2019s move to instigate the split.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c444fc985a12d3dd2669ac8321d398018acf3a3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c444fc985a12d3dd2669ac8321d398018acf3a3a/0_790_8009_4808/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Jonas Brothers are back after a 6-year hiatus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Jonas Brothers are back after a six-year hiatus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nick says his dad handled things well, balancing being both manager and parent. \u201cBecause I had initiated the conversation for the group to break up, he was comforting to me while I spoke my truth. Then when Joe and Kevin\u2019s reaction was complicated, he was a father to them, and managerial to me.\u201d Although the brothers were hardly estranged, there was a multi-platinum elephant in the room at family events. In 2017 came the idea of a Jonas Brothers documentary, Chasing Happiness, which is out this week on Amazon. The main aim was closure: \u201cWe definitely didn\u2019t think we were going to get back together,\u201d Joe says. But a full reunion followed and the album Happiness Begins is released this week.</p> <h2>Sport</h2> <p>Liverpool want to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/02/liverpool-reward-jurgen-klopp-improved-contract\">extend J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s contract</a> following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague\">Champions League</a> triumph his players believe heralds the beginning of a glittering era under their charismatic manager.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Protesters promise show of force Good morning, this is Alison Rourke bringing you this Monday briefing on what\u2019s set to be a blockbuster week in politics. All eyes will be on London today as Donald Trump flies in for his much-anticipated visit. The trip could provide some awkward moments when he meets Theresa May in her last few days as prime minister (she is set to formally resign on Friday). The White House sees the trip as an opportunity for a \u201creset moment\u201d on trade, but Trump lands in the thick of the Tory leadership battle, in which he has made no bones about his preferred candidate, Boris Johnson. On potentially meeting Johnson, Trump told reporters before he left Washington: \u201cWell I may meet with him, he\u2019s been a friend of mine, he\u2019s been very nice.\u201d He also added he had a \u201cvery good relationship with Nigel Farage\u201d. May meanwhile has called the visit \u201ca significant week for the special relationship and an opportunity to further strengthen our already close partnership\u201d. She stressed the need to build closer trading ties, but with only five days left in the job, it\u2019s hard to see how much influence she will have. Another Johnson has also been helping set the scene ahead of the visit \u2013 Trump\u2019s US ambassador in the UK, Woody Johnson, has suggested the NHS should be \u201con the table\u201d in future trade negotiations with the US. Trump\u2019s man in London also indicated the UK would need to allow US agricultural products, including chlorinated chicken, on to the UK market as part of any post-Brexit trade deal. So there will be plenty of subjects to avoid during the president\u2019s banquet at Buckingham Palace tonight with the Queen, before formal talks in Downing Street tomorrow, when the giant Trump baby balloon is expected to fly over large protests. * * * Tory hopefuls \u2013 As the 13 runners and riders in the Conservative party leadership race jockey for position, the centrist Matt Hancock will today call for the UK to allow complete freedom of movement for medics from around the world. The health secretary will promise to lift all immigration restrictions for qualified doctors and nurses of any nationality who have secured a job in the NHS. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has put forward his first major domestic policy proposal, saying he would \u201csignificantly\u201d lift spending on secondary school students to at least \u00a35,000 per pupil if he became the next prime minister. * * * Jared Kushner \u2013 The US Middle East envoy has expressed uncertainty over the ability of Palestinians to self-govern, in a rare television interview broadcast last night. Kushner, Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and an architect of the White House\u2019s yet-to-be-released Middle East peace plan, said it would be a \u201chigh bar\u201d when asked if the Palestinians could expect freedom from Israeli military and government interference. Kushner again avoided saying explicitly whether the plan would include a two-state solution, the bedrock of US policy for decades. But he said: \u201cI do think they should have self-determination. I\u2019m going to leave the details until we come out with the actual plan.\u201d * * * Not so equal \u2013 Not a single country is expected to achieve gender equality by 2030, according to the first index to measure progress against a set of internationally agreed targets. According to the inaugural SDG Gender Index, launched today, even the Nordic states, which score highly in the index, would need to take huge strides to fulfil gender commitments in the 17 sustainable development goals, which 193 countries signed up to in 2015. The index measured progress in 129 countries, marking them from zero to 100. Countries with an overall score of 90 or more are making excellent progress, but only 21 countries got 80 or above. Denmark came in first with 89.3. The UK came 17th with 82.2. * * * Reality TV\u2019s body anxiety \u2013 Young people\u2019s worries about how they look are being fuelled by aspirational TV shows, according to a new survey by the Mental Health Foundation, which released the report ahead of the new series of Love Island. Almost one in four people (24%) aged 18-24 say reality TV makes them worry about their body image, according to the YouGov survey of 4,505 UK adults. More than one in seven (15%) said they had self-harmed or deliberately hurt themselves because of concerns about their body image, and 23% had experienced suicidal thoughts because of concerns in relation to their body image. The foundation\u2019s Dr Antonis Kousoulis acknowledged that the show had issued mental health aftercare guidelines for contestants, \u201cbut they must also take into consideration the potential damage being done to viewers\u201d, adding that contestants\u2019 appearance are \u201cnot diverse, [are] largely unrealistic and [are] presented as aspirational\u201d. * * * Drink up \u2013 Coffee addicts will be pleased to hear that scientists say drinking up to 25 cups a day is not bad for your heart. Some previous studies have suggested that coffee stiffens arteries, putting pressure on the heart and increasing the likelihood of a heart attack or stroke, with drinkers warned to cut down. But a new study (part-funded by the British Heart Foundation) of more than 8,000 people across the UK found that drinking five cups a day, and even up to 25, is no worse for the arteries than drinking less than a cup a day. Today in Focus podcast: Inside Isis Martin Chulov, the Guardian\u2019s Middle East correspondent, discusses his meeting with Umm Sayyaf, the most senior female Islamic State captive. In her first interview, Sayyaf reveals her role in helping the CIA hunt for the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. And Johny Pitt on how an ice bath with pop duo Jedward promoted a journey around Europe exploring Afropean identity. Lunchtime read: \u2018We needed to speak our truth \u2013 and forgive\u2019 Six years ago, on the back of 17m album sales, the Jonas Brothers split, devastating their fans, many of whom had watched their rise from Disney. Now they\u2019re back with a No 1 single and talking about marriage, family rifts and why it took so long to patch things up. More than half a decade since their split (that was blamed on a \u201cdeep rift within the band\u201d) the brothers are married, settled and arguably in better musical shape than ever before, writes the Guardian\u2019s Peter Robinson. But their journey through teenage stardom and a rift in the band at the time when their father was managing them, left its marks. \u201cI was mad as hell,\u201d says Joe Jonas of his younger brother Nick\u2019s move to instigate the split. Nick says his dad handled things well, balancing being both manager and parent. \u201cBecause I had initiated the conversation for the group to break up, he was comforting to me while I spoke my truth. Then when Joe and Kevin\u2019s reaction was complicated, he was a father to them, and managerial to me.\u201d Although the brothers were hardly estranged, there was a multi-platinum elephant in the room at family events. In 2017 came the idea of a Jonas Brothers documentary, Chasing Happiness, which is out this week on Amazon. The main aim was closure: \u201cWe definitely didn\u2019t think we were going to get back together,\u201d Joe says. But a full reunion followed and the album Happiness Begins is released this week. Sport Liverpool want to extend J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s contract following the Champions League triumph his players believe heralds the beginning of a glittering era under their charismatic manager. Anthony Joshua confirmed his intent to enforce an immediate return fight with Andy Ruiz Jr, admitting he was so confident in the run-up to his astounding defeat that he had not bothered asking whether a rematch clause was in the contract. Johanna Konta became the first British woman to reach the last eight of the French Open since Jo Durie in 1983, while Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal seem to be operating in their own dimension at Roland Garros, moving into the quarter-finals with uncanny synchronicity. And Richard Carapaz became Ecuador\u2019s first grand tour champion by winning the Giro d\u2019Italia while Chad Haga of the US was fastest in the final stage\u2019s individual time trial. Business Amazon is opening up a new front on its retail dominance, opening a chain of pop-up shops selling everything from food and drink to electronics, beauty products and homewares. The year-long pilot, launched in conjunction with the small business support organisation Enterprise Nation, will give 100 small online businesses a high street presence, with the first Clicks and Mortar shop opening today in St Mary\u2019s Gate in central Manchester. It will also offer lockers for customers to collect Amazon orders. The company plans to open 10 shops in total. It hasn\u2019t revealed the locations of the other stores but said there would be openings in Wales, Scotland, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the south-east. On the markets, US stock futures, Asian shares and oil prices slipped to multi-month lows on Monday on worries that intensifying Chin-US tensions and Washington\u2019s new tariff threats against Mexico could tip the global economy into a recession. The E-mini futures for S&amp;P500 dropped 0.5% in early Asian trade to 2,738, near their March low of 2,722, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei skidded 1.1% to a four-month low. The pound is buying \u20ac1.131 and $1.265. The papers Trump\u2019s visit and Huawei dominate the front pages today. The Guardian has: \u201cTrump arrives amid rising anger at US trade demands\u201d and the i reports: \u201cMay urged to confront Trump on climate\u201d. The Daily Mail reports that Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid may u-turn over the government\u2019s decision to allow 5G access to the Chinese giant: \u201cTories\u2019 Huawei deal warning\u201d, as does the Telegraph: \u201cTories bow on Huawei as Trump lands in UK\u201d and the Sun combines the two subjects: \u201cTrump: It\u2019s my way or Huawei\u201d. More China news on the front page of the FT: \u201cChina blames US \u2018coercion\u2019 as FedEx probe raises trade tensions\u201d, the Times continues to cover the Tory leadership contest: \u201cDelaying Brexit will hand Corbyn No10, Gove told\u201d, the Express has comments from an NHS boss: \u201cWe must act now to beat dementia\u201d and the Mirror covers Ann Widdecombe\u2019s comments about finding a \u201ccure\u201d for homosexuality, which it calls: \u201cStrictly offensive\u201d.

The pensions minister, Guy Opperman, is due to tell a conference that pension and investment managers must \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and take their environmental and social responsibilities seriously to help combat the climate emergency. During the last few years a number of pension schemes have taken action to protect their members from the risks associated with climate breakdown by reducing their exposure to companies with reserves of coal, oil and gas. Some have pulled all of their funds out of these companies, while others have chosen to apply a positive \u201ctilt\u201d that increases support for businesses identified as vital to combating the climate crisis, such as those working on renewable energy, while at the same time reducing investment in firms that are heavy carbon emitters, have fossil fuel reserves or are not making the sorts of changes needed to meet emission reduction targets. In April, the Guardian revealed that parliament\u2019s pension fund trustees were to reconsider the rules of their investments to take account of the risks posed by the climate emergency. Meanwhile, rules taking effect in October will require UK pension fund trustees to set out how they take account of \u201cfinancially material considerations, including \u2026 climate change\u201d.

The NSA allegedly lost control of the tool, called EternalBlue, in 2017, enabling hackers to paralyze vulnerable towns and cities across the country.</p> <p>Security experts hope Baltimore\u2019s ongoing crisis motivates municipalities to take these threats seriously.

The next task was more complicated: figure out if people\u2019s lives were in danger.</p> <p>\u201cThat day one was brutal,\u201d said Deborah Blyth, Colorado\u2019s chief information security officer, recounting the ransomware that afflicted the state transportation department and quickly sparked fears of harmful disruptions to traffic operations: \u201cRight away, it was impossible to even understand the scope.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f79cc7c8a76ff55187603d4d2688120be20eb53d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f79cc7c8a76ff55187603d4d2688120be20eb53d/0_156_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, was targeted in a cyber attack in 2016 and paid out $17,000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Hollywood Presbyterian medical center in Los Angeles, California, was targeted in a cyber-attack in 2016 and paid out $17,000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Some victims decide paying out is cheapest option\u2019</h2> <p>In the coming years, cybercriminals will just repeat their attempts across governments until they find one that is vulnerable, said Tyler Moore, a University of Tulsa cybersecurity professor. \u201cAttackers have found a playbook that is working.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a playbook that remains profitable.</p> <p>That\u2019s because some victims choose to pay, despite ethical concerns about capitulating to ransom demands and despite the fact that there\u2019s no guarantee of restored access. In some cases, paying bitcoins may be a cheaper and quicker resolution. One <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/ransomware/ransomware-attack-data-recovery-firms-paying-hackers/\">report</a> suggested that cyber-attackers have collected millions in ransom in recent years.</p> <p>Even if major cities view Baltimore as a wake-up call and adopt reforms, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t shock me to see smaller cities roll the dice,\u201d said Hannah Quay-de la Vallee, senior technologist with the Center for Democracy and Technology. She said she was also concerned about educational institutions that have major budget challenges and systems with crucial personal data, such as students\u2019 medical information and allergies and individual special needs plans.</p> <p>The frustrating reality for information security leaders is that the technical solutions are known and easy to implement, if there is funding: cities have to <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-0529-baltimore-ransomware-nsa-20190528-story.html\">update their systems with available security patches</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/28/baltimore-ransomware-attack-could-be-coming-your-city-or-hospital/?utm_term=.325b5e96e257\">maintain effective data backups</a>. Without patches, hackers can break in and demand money, and if officials don\u2019t have the data stored elsewhere, they have to choose between paying ransom or rebuilding systems.</p> <p>\u201cThose who are unwilling to pay the price to upgrade systems and people \u2026 are going to pay the price one way or the other,\u201d said Alan R Shark, executive director of Public Technology Institute, which provides consulting services to governments.</p> <p>Baltimore made the right decision refusing to pay, but the crisis could drag on for months as a result, said Avi Rubin, a Johns Hopkins computer science professor. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a lot of the data \u2026 They are going to face a real challenge building up all the systems organically from scratch.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/may/29/new-york-facial-recognition-cameras-apartment-complex\">New York tenants fight as landlords embrace facial recognition cameras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the Colorado attack, the malware hit the transportation department\u2019s business services, but ultimately did not spread to road and traffic operations. Thousands of workers were, however, <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2018/02/26/samsam-ransomware-virus-cdot/\">forced offline</a>, which meant the state had to communicate with employees by leaving printed handouts on their desks and scheduling conference calls, said Blyth.</p> <p>The state eventually brought in the national guard to help.</p> <p>Colorado has since adopted a range of new practices to prevent future attacks, said Blyth, adding that officials have thought through worst-case scenarios: disruptions to healthcare, prisons, emergency communications, traffic safety, fire departments.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if it was a broader impact \u2013 affecting multiple of those services at once?\u201d she added.</p> <p>Despite the challenges, Blyth remained confident that refusing the attackers\u2019 demands was the right call. \u201cWe would not even think about paying the ransom.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe won\u2019t talk more, all we know is MONEY! Hurry up!\u201d This was the ransom note that confronted Baltimore officials on 7 May when hackers crippled government computers with a virus, taking the systems hostage. The ongoing cyber-attack has halted real estate transactions and shut down websites for processing water bills and other services. The horrors of ransomware \u2013 where cybercriminals break in, lock up computer data, then demand payments to restore access \u2013 have increasingly hobbled cities and municipalities across the globe in recent years. The crisis in Baltimore, where officials have refused to pay the $76,000 bitcoin ransom, follows similar incidents in Atlanta, Newark, San Diego and Los Angeles. These cyber intrusions are expected to continue disrupting ill-prepared local governments and public services, with devastating financial impacts and potentially life-threatening consequences, experts warned. Any agency that depends on digitized records could be at risk, including emergency services, water utilities and other infrastructure, healthcare services, voting systems and public education. \u201cWe have an exponentially increasing problem,\u201d said Katie Moussouris, founder and CEO of Luta Security, which helps businesses and governments work with hackers to identify vulnerabilities. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an exponentially increasing workforce. If we don\u2019t see cities and towns \u2026 start pouring a bunch of resources into hiring more people, we are going to see it happening over and over again.\u201d Stolen National Security Agency tool The mess in Baltimore has attracted particularly intense international scrutiny following a New York Times report suggesting the cybercriminals used a malware component that originated with the National Security Agency (NSA). The NSA allegedly lost control of the tool, called EternalBlue, in 2017, enabling hackers to paralyze vulnerable towns and cities across the country. Security experts hope Baltimore\u2019s ongoing crisis motivates municipalities to take these threats seriously. Baltimore leaders have estimated that the attack could cost at least $18.2m, from lost and delayed revenue and costs to restore infected systems. The mayor, Bernard \u201cJack\u201d Young, has said the city would not pay the ransom, though at one point, he hinted he was was considering paying it to \u201cmove the city forward\u201d. City agencies are especially ripe targets because they often maintain databases of vital and sensitive information while having constrained information security budgets and inadequate technological safeguards. \u201cMunicipal governments and hospitals \u2026 just don\u2019t have the top cybersecurity out there, and the criminals know this,\u201d said Jeff Kosseff, assistant professor of cybersecurity law at the US Naval Academy. \u201cYou can see loss of life happening if the hospitals are not able to function \u2026 What terrifies me is if it happens on a large scale.\u201d Disruptions to the functioning of ambulances, rescue squads, fire stations, waste collection and other services could all have serious human consequences, he said. When a massive cyber-attack hit the state of Colorado last year, the first step was to shut down 2,000 infected government workstations. The next task was more complicated: figure out if people\u2019s lives were in danger. \u201cThat day one was brutal,\u201d said Deborah Blyth, Colorado\u2019s chief information security officer, recounting the ransomware that afflicted the state transportation department and quickly sparked fears of harmful disruptions to traffic operations: \u201cRight away, it was impossible to even understand the scope.\u201d \u2018Some victims decide paying out is cheapest option\u2019 In the coming years, cybercriminals will just repeat their attempts across governments until they find one that is vulnerable, said Tyler Moore, a University of Tulsa cybersecurity professor. \u201cAttackers have found a playbook that is working.\u201d It\u2019s a playbook that remains profitable. That\u2019s because some victims choose to pay, despite ethical concerns about capitulating to ransom demands and despite the fact that there\u2019s no guarantee of restored access. In some cases, paying bitcoins may be a cheaper and quicker resolution. One report suggested that cyber-attackers have collected millions in ransom in recent years. Even if major cities view Baltimore as a wake-up call and adopt reforms, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t shock me to see smaller cities roll the dice,\u201d said Hannah Quay-de la Vallee, senior technologist with the Center for Democracy and Technology. She said she was also concerned about educational institutions that have major budget challenges and systems with crucial personal data, such as students\u2019 medical information and allergies and individual special needs plans. The frustrating reality for information security leaders is that the technical solutions are known and easy to implement, if there is funding: cities have to update their systems with available security patches and maintain effective data backups. Without patches, hackers can break in and demand money, and if officials don\u2019t have the data stored elsewhere, they have to choose between paying ransom or rebuilding systems. \u201cThose who are unwilling to pay the price to upgrade systems and people \u2026 are going to pay the price one way or the other,\u201d said Alan R Shark, executive director of Public Technology Institute, which provides consulting services to governments. Baltimore made the right decision refusing to pay, but the crisis could drag on for months as a result, said Avi Rubin, a Johns Hopkins computer science professor. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a lot of the data \u2026 They are going to face a real challenge building up all the systems organically from scratch.\u201d In the Colorado attack, the malware hit the transportation department\u2019s business services, but ultimately did not spread to road and traffic operations. Thousands of workers were, however, forced offline, which meant the state had to communicate with employees by leaving printed handouts on their desks and scheduling conference calls, said Blyth. The state eventually brought in the national guard to help. Colorado has since adopted a range of new practices to prevent future attacks, said Blyth, adding that officials have thought through worst-case scenarios: disruptions to healthcare, prisons, emergency communications, traffic safety, fire departments. \u201cWhat if it was a broader impact \u2013 affecting multiple of those services at once?\u201d she added. Despite the challenges, Blyth remained confident that refusing the attackers\u2019 demands was the right call. \u201cWe would not even think about paying the ransom. We didn\u2019t want to contribute to what we knew was criminal behavior.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

I didn\u2019t have to make anything up.\u201d Finally, tiring of London politics, he visited friends in Cumbria \u2013 a childhood holiday haunt \u2013 and stayed, eventually swapping his caravan for a housing association cottage. \u201cPolitics is very different here,\u201d he says. \u201cI enjoy helping people, empowering communities.\u201d These days, he divides his time between his councillor duties, the church and voluntary work in an Oxfam shop. This week\u2019s 63 Up reveals that he got married \u2013 to a woman he met in panto \u2013 but after four years the relationship ended, owing to his recurring low moods. \u201cI\u2019ve still not got over that.\u201d His parents have died, too, but there had been a reconciliation. \u201cI got on better with my mum when she had dementia,\u201d he says with a sigh. \u201cAll my life, she\u2019d been trying to mould me into something I wasn\u2019t. But by the end she seemed to accept the way I was.\u201d Hughes seems to view his own life as one of shattered dreams. \u201cIf I\u2019d been successful, I\u2019d have been in Westminster, stopping this hideous government or I\u2019d be in theatre, directing what I wanted.\u201d That said, he recently helped to get rid of a \u201crubbish council\u201d, is campaigning passionately to restore the Keswick-Penrith railway line \u2013 and he still dares to dream. \u201cIf you can change the neighbourhood you live in,\u201d he says, \u201cyou can change the world.\u201d His eyes are sparkling, just like the eyes of that would-be astronaut back in 1964. \u2022 63 Up is on ITV at 9pm on 4, 5 and 6 June.",

The reason? We learned in court last week that a senior police officer was concerned that their investigation might have put lives in danger. If there were any evidence for this, and there is none, it might sound reasonable enough. But it also turns out the lives the police were concerned about were <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/warped-mindset-behind-arrests-of-loughinisland-journalists-court-hears-1.3907612\" title=\"\">those of people</a> \u201chaving the misfortune of being involved in terrorist atrocities\u201d.</p> <p>The misfortune? Even by Northern Irish standards this was, as a barrister representing the journalists put it, \u201ca staggering proposition\u201d.

Six men were killed. They had been watching a World Cup match between Ireland and Italy, their backs to the door. Five more were injured. One of them, the barman, Aidan O\u2019Toole, says he relives those events constantly, to the point that he sometimes wonders if he was lucky to survive.</p> <p>With the blood of the dead still wet on the ground in Loughinisland, the then secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Patrick Mayhew visited the scene and repeated the police vow that the authorities would \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d in pursuing the killers.</p> <p>But it was not long before the bereaved families began to feel that there was something not quite right about the investigation \u2013 that, in fact, it did not appear to take place at all. No one was ever tried. A review by the police ombudsman in 2016 found there had been \u201ccatastrophic failings\u201d and that the police had colluded with the killers, believed to be members of the illegal loyalist paramilitary group the UVF. The time was obviously right for a serious documentary.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB9XqkZD1yc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OB9XqkZD1yc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Trailer for Alex Gibney\u2019s documentary No Stone Unturned.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>McCaffrey, who had been investigating and reporting on the atrocity for years, and Birney, who had set up a film company specifically to explore such difficult stories, were the obvious journalists to take it on. Birney brought in the Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney and the 2017 film they made, whose title, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/12/no-stone-unturned-review-documentary-alex-gibney-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">No Stone Unturned</a>, brilliantly upends Mayhew\u2019s promise, pursued the evidence the police ignored and went so far as to name the alleged murderers. The journalists informed the police of their intention to do so months before the film premiered. Surely, it was up to the police to assess if there was any potential threat to lives, and to advise the film-makers accordingly. It appears they did not.</p> <p>The chief constable of the PSNI, George Hamilton, had accepted the findings about collusion in the 2016 ombudsman\u2019s report. The documentary consolidated its findings. The time was more than ripe for the police to finally investigate the killings.</p> <p>After the film premiered, police did, in fact, visit the home of the person accused in it of being the gunman. But unbelievably, they did so not to question him about the murders, but to ask him how the film had affected him, and what he thought about the police ombudsman. He told them he was living in fear and his vermin-control business was in ruins. He was asked who he blamed and he said it was the film-makers and the ombudsman.</p> <p>And so it was that police arrived on the doorsteps of the two journalists one morning. They were arrested and taken into custody. Police seized computers and files containing the equivalent of millions of pages of journalistic material, only a tiny proportion of which related to No Stone Unturned. The lord chief justice commented in court last week that it was unclear what crime the police thought they were investigating. The police\u2019s barrister spoke darkly of the Official Secrets Act and the need to protect informants. They were investigating the theft of a document from the police ombudsman\u2019s office, he said \u2013 even though the ombudsman has denied reporting any such theft. The film did make use of a leaked document from an anonymous source. But the journalists had been entirely candid about this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a27b8e81d0392fb3fd714dbf79aa16d3557535b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a27b8e81d0392fb3fd714dbf79aa16d3557535b7/0_8_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The funerals of two of the Loughinisland victims, Barney Green and his nephew Dan McCreanor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The funerals of two of the Loughinisland victims, Barney Green and his nephew Dan McCreanor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Giles/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The police acted as though they were unaware that journalists and the whistleblowers who provided the public with information that is in the public interest were protected both by UK law and by the European Convention on Human Rights. </p> <p>In the event, the lord chief justice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/31/northern-ireland-judge-rebukes-police-for-seizing-papers-from-journalists\" title=\"\">declared the arrests \u201cinappropriate\u201d</a>.

      "bodyText": "Those who investigate the dark aftermath of conflict walk on dangerous ground. The murder by dissident republicans of Lyra McKee in April was a chilling reminder that there are paramilitaries who are still intent on dragging us back into the hostilities of the past. Another case that has been playing out in Northern Ireland\u2019s legal system is a shocking warning that this may also be true of the police. This case yielded a great victory for press freedom in Belfast\u2019s high court last Friday, but the two brave investigative journalists who brought it about are still caught in a nightmare worthy of Kafka. They remain on police bail, facing unspecified criminal charges. This despite the fact that the highest judge in the Northern Irish state, the lord chief justice, has declared that on the basis of the evidence put before him, they have done nothing wrong. The pair, Barry McCaffrey and Trevor Birney, were arrested last summer for their work on a documentary about a 1994 massacre. The reason? We learned in court last week that a senior police officer was concerned that their investigation might have put lives in danger. If there were any evidence for this, and there is none, it might sound reasonable enough. But it also turns out the lives the police were concerned about were those of people \u201chaving the misfortune of being involved in terrorist atrocities\u201d. The misfortune? Even by Northern Irish standards this was, as a barrister representing the journalists put it, \u201ca staggering proposition\u201d. Durham constabulary, brought in by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) to investigate, had, said Barry Macdonald QC, conducted \u201cthe kind of operation associated with a police state rather than a liberal democracy\u201d. In a few weeks it will be 25 years since the Loughinisland massacre, when a loyalist gang burst into a quiet rural pub in County Down and opened fire. Six men were killed. They had been watching a World Cup match between Ireland and Italy, their backs to the door. Five more were injured. One of them, the barman, Aidan O\u2019Toole, says he relives those events constantly, to the point that he sometimes wonders if he was lucky to survive. With the blood of the dead still wet on the ground in Loughinisland, the then secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Patrick Mayhew visited the scene and repeated the police vow that the authorities would \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d in pursuing the killers. But it was not long before the bereaved families began to feel that there was something not quite right about the investigation \u2013 that, in fact, it did not appear to take place at all. No one was ever tried. A review by the police ombudsman in 2016 found there had been \u201ccatastrophic failings\u201d and that the police had colluded with the killers, believed to be members of the illegal loyalist paramilitary group the UVF. The time was obviously right for a serious documentary. McCaffrey, who had been investigating and reporting on the atrocity for years, and Birney, who had set up a film company specifically to explore such difficult stories, were the obvious journalists to take it on. Birney brought in the Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney and the 2017 film they made, whose title, No Stone Unturned, brilliantly upends Mayhew\u2019s promise, pursued the evidence the police ignored and went so far as to name the alleged murderers. The journalists informed the police of their intention to do so months before the film premiered. Surely, it was up to the police to assess if there was any potential threat to lives, and to advise the film-makers accordingly. It appears they did not. The chief constable of the PSNI, George Hamilton, had accepted the findings about collusion in the 2016 ombudsman\u2019s report. The documentary consolidated its findings. The time was more than ripe for the police to finally investigate the killings. After the film premiered, police did, in fact, visit the home of the person accused in it of being the gunman. But unbelievably, they did so not to question him about the murders, but to ask him how the film had affected him, and what he thought about the police ombudsman. He told them he was living in fear and his vermin-control business was in ruins. He was asked who he blamed and he said it was the film-makers and the ombudsman. And so it was that police arrived on the doorsteps of the two journalists one morning. They were arrested and taken into custody. Police seized computers and files containing the equivalent of millions of pages of journalistic material, only a tiny proportion of which related to No Stone Unturned. The lord chief justice commented in court last week that it was unclear what crime the police thought they were investigating. The police\u2019s barrister spoke darkly of the Official Secrets Act and the need to protect informants. They were investigating the theft of a document from the police ombudsman\u2019s office, he said \u2013 even though the ombudsman has denied reporting any such theft. The film did make use of a leaked document from an anonymous source. But the journalists had been entirely candid about this. The police acted as though they were unaware that journalists and the whistleblowers who provided the public with information that is in the public interest were protected both by UK law and by the European Convention on Human Rights. In the event, the lord chief justice declared the arrests \u201cinappropriate\u201d. Birney and McCaffrey had behaved properly, Declan Morgan found. The work of journalists was essential in holding the state to account, \u201cparticularly in a society like ours where confidence in the institutions is so important\u201d, he added. The police had not behaved properly he found, ordering them to return the material they had seized. This ruling was a landmark victory for investigative journalism. However, the apparent determination of the police to pursue the criminal prosecution of the journalists is scandalous. It is also a further insult to the Loughinisland victims\u2019 families. Patrick McCreanor, who lost his uncle and great-uncle in the massacre, said the families want the police to change course now, and pursue the killers.

The scene in which teens from both sides of the sectarian divide unleashed a barrage of stereotypes about each other (\u201cProtestants hate ABBA!\u201d) is among the year\u2019s funniest.</p> <p><strong>What we said: </strong>Derry Girls\u2019 magic remains intact. The evocation of the 90s is as lightly done as ever (Elizabeth Hurley is fleetingly referenced \u2013 \u201cShe\u2019s a total ride, but she paperclips her frocks together\u201d) and the Troubled setting never overwhelms but simply throws into relief the ordinariness of the girls\u2019 lives in the middle of extraordinary depths of conflict. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/05/derry-girls-series-two-review-still-magic-still-a-total-ride\">Read the full review</a></p> <h2>Don\u2019t Forget the Driver</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af7a09862e676bca114c4c3679c11765befa1270\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af7a09862e676bca114c4c3679c11765befa1270/0_0_4400_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toby Jones in Don\u2019t Forget the Driver\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bleak comedy \u2026 Toby Jones in Don\u2019t Forget the Driver</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Sister Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pulling off a state-of-the-Brexit-nation series looked a tall order, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/14/tob-jones-always-look-on-the-bright-side\">Toby Jones</a>\u2019s understated comedy-drama was taller, finding humour and pathos in its tale of a coach driver who discovers a refugee hiding in his wheel arch and a body washed up on the beach.</p> <p><strong>What we said: </strong>If it is a comedy, it is one with the bleakest tragedy at its heart.

Because the heroine occasionally breaks the fourth wall and exteriorises her inner monologue. But it\u2019s set in Halifax in 1832, so it could be Northern Jane Austen. Then again, it\u2019s about Anne Lister, who has been dubbed the first modern lesbian, so maybe it\u2019s Queer Bront\u00eb ...

But it is American in the sense of having a gag-to-airtime ratio much higher than British sitcoms normally manage these days. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2019/apr/15/ghosts-review-tv-to-give-you-a-right-giggle-at-the-supernatural\">Read the full review</a></p> <h2>I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xS9Y_mjTjc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7xS9Y_mjTjc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This deliriously absurd sketch show from a former <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/saturday-night-live\">Saturday Night Live</a> player was hailed immediately as one of the greatest Netflix shows to date.</p> <p><strong>What we said:</strong> I wolfed down the entire series in one sitting, genuinely incapacitated with laughter. And then I watched it all again. I\u2019m at the stage where I\u2019m cherrypicking sketches now, but I\u2019ve seen my favourites six or seven times. I\u2019m fully obsessed at this point.

Relentlessly spare and unsensationalist, it manages better than any other in its genre not to let its attention wander from the survivors\u2019 testimony. Footage of Jackson is confined almost wholly to that of him with the boys themselves on stage, private calls between them and family snaps.

      "bodyText": "Back to Life Daisy Haggard\u2019s downbeat gem took on a tough topic \u2013 a woman\u2019s return to her home town after a stretch behind bars \u2013 and turned it into a meditation on grief, regret and the passing of time, though with enough gags to keep things zipping along. What we said: A few episodes into Back to Life, I felt like pushing it away in protest. \u201cNo, no!\u201d I cried inwardly. \u201cIt\u2019s too much! It\u2019s too good!\u201d Read the full review Barry In its second season, this black comedy about a hitman who catches the acting bug took its story into darker territory, with Barry\u2019s attempts to extricate himself from his past life only dragging him further into oblivion. Things aren\u2019t going to end well. What we said: Though it\u2019s a comedy rather than a thriller, Barry replicates much of what made Breaking Bad irresistible. Read more Broad City After five virtually flawless sitcom seasons, Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson\u2019s millennial kweens went out in the same way they came in: with gross-out gags, madcap surrealism and one of the greatest on-screen friendships in TV history. What we said: This season has given Abbi and Ilana the best possible send-off. It has been joyful, silly and wild, and while it feels like the perfect and necessary time to wrap up their adventures, it is poignant that they\u2019ve done so by reminding you just how good those can be. Read more Catastrophe Another comedy that went out on a high, Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney\u2019s tale of floundering parents managed to deliver more home truths about the family unit, pay fond tribute to late guest star Carrie Fisher \u2013 and offer up one of the most shocking endings in recent TV history. What we said: From first to last, Catastrophe has been an unremitting triumph. Read the full review Chernobyl Already sitting atop IMDb\u2019s top 250 TV shows list before the final episode has even aired, Sky and HBO\u2019s restaging of the Soviet nuclear disaster captures the ineptitude, corruption and horror at its core. What we said: Chernobyl is a disaster movie, a spy movie, a horror movie, a political thriller, and a human drama, and it spins each plate expertly. The terror is unflinching and explicit, and its images of burned bodies collapsing into putrid decay are impossible to forget. Yet it never feels shocking for the sake of it, only as haunting and horrible as its subject matter demands. Read more Climate Change: The Facts After years spent hinting at the damage done to our planet by the climate crisis , David Attenborough finally laid out the threat in all its magnitude, in a documentary that may just have turned sceptics into believers. What we said: This is a rousing call to arms. It is an alarm clock set at a horrifying volume. Read the full review Dead Pixels E4\u2019s comedy accurately captured the loneliness and mundanity, but also the sense of community, that comes with picking up a controller. All that, and it was as addictive as an all-night Fifa session to boot. What we said: This wickedly entertaining new sitcom may have been inspired by the massive success of online games like World of Warcraft but, thankfully, you are not required to know your Azeroth from your elbow to enjoy it. Read more Derry Girls One of last year\u2019s surprise hits, Lisa McGee\u2019s Northern Irish comedy didn\u2019t let things slip in its second season, with its quartet still finding teenage kicks in the midst of the Troubles. The scene in which teens from both sides of the sectarian divide unleashed a barrage of stereotypes about each other (\u201cProtestants hate ABBA!\u201d) is among the year\u2019s funniest. What we said: Derry Girls\u2019 magic remains intact. The evocation of the 90s is as lightly done as ever (Elizabeth Hurley is fleetingly referenced \u2013 \u201cShe\u2019s a total ride, but she paperclips her frocks together\u201d) and the Troubled setting never overwhelms but simply throws into relief the ordinariness of the girls\u2019 lives in the middle of extraordinary depths of conflict. Read the full review Don\u2019t Forget the Driver Pulling off a state-of-the-Brexit-nation series looked a tall order, but Toby Jones\u2019s understated comedy-drama was taller, finding humour and pathos in its tale of a coach driver who discovers a refugee hiding in his wheel arch and a body washed up on the beach. What we said: If it is a comedy, it is one with the bleakest tragedy at its heart. But whatever label you put on it, it is a fine, fine piece of work. Read the full review Fleabag Back for its second (and, as it turned out, final) outing, Fleabag added a hot priest into the already heady mix of biting wit and family dysfunction \u2013 and it built to a heart-rending ending with a wedding, a mad dash to the airport \u2026 and a fox. Unforgettable. What we said: Series two raised the bar. Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s risks were so impressive all one could do was shake one\u2019s head in appreciation. Read the full review Game of Thrones Did the gargantuan fantasy drama stick the landing in its final season? That\u2019s an argument for the comments section, but both in the scale of its six episodes, and the fevered discussion they prompted, it was unquestionably the TV event of the year. What we said: The ending was true to the series\u2019 overall subject \u2013 war, and the pity of war \u2013 and, after doing a lot of wrong to several protagonists, it did right by those left standing. When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die. Overall, I think, it won. Read the full review Gentleman Jack Sally Wainwright travelled back in time for her latest piece of thrillingly human Yorkshire drama, with this real life tale of Anne Lister. Suranne Jones has received rave reviews for her portrayal of the 19th-century industrialist and diarist, who developed a code to hide her lesbianism. What we said: It\u2019s Regency Fleabag! Because the heroine occasionally breaks the fourth wall and exteriorises her inner monologue. But it\u2019s set in Halifax in 1832, so it could be Northern Jane Austen. Then again, it\u2019s about Anne Lister, who has been dubbed the first modern lesbian, so maybe it\u2019s Queer Bront\u00eb ... You can afford to have a little fun with Gentleman Jack; Sally Wainwright clearly has. Read the full review Ghosts The Horrible Histories team offered up more unashamedly silly comedy with this spirited sitcom about a group of ghouls going to war with the new owners of a crumbling mansion. What we said: In making us giggle at the supernatural, Ghosts is very British. But it is American in the sense of having a gag-to-airtime ratio much higher than British sitcoms normally manage these days. Read the full review I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson This deliriously absurd sketch show from a former Saturday Night Live player was hailed immediately as one of the greatest Netflix shows to date. What we said: I wolfed down the entire series in one sitting, genuinely incapacitated with laughter. And then I watched it all again. I\u2019m at the stage where I\u2019m cherrypicking sketches now, but I\u2019ve seen my favourites six or seven times. I\u2019m fully obsessed at this point. At its peak, I think I Think You Should Leave might be one of the funniest things I have ever seen. Read more Leaving Neverland A devastating four-hour expos\u00e9 of alleged child sexual abuse by Michael Jackson. Wade Robson and James Safechuck chillingly and plausibly outlined their accounts of childhood grooming by the man that they, and the whole world, worshipped. What we said: An astonishing piece of work. Relentlessly spare and unsensationalist, it manages better than any other in its genre not to let its attention wander from the survivors\u2019 testimony. Footage of Jackson is confined almost wholly to that of him with the boys themselves on stage, private calls between them and family snaps. He is never allowed to overwhelm the story. Read the full review Line of Duty Jed Mercurio\u2019s police corruption masterpiece returned for a fifth outing after a two-year wait, bringing with it a stunningly complex performance from Stephen Graham, more urgent exits required \u2026 and heartstopping, jaw-dropping action to the last. What we said: As ever, nothing is wasted; not a scene, not a line, not a beat. It fits together flawlessly \u2013 you can imagine Mercurio sitting like a watchmaker at his table with the parts spread before him and fitting the loupe to his eye before assembling the whole thing and listening for its perfectly regulated tick. Read the full review Mum Stefan Golaszewski\u2019s sitcom tour de force ended on a heartwarming high. Over three lovely series, Lesley Manville and Peter Mullan as Cathy and Michael gave us the gift of a quietly epic romance that will echo down the ages \u2013 and kept the tears in our eyes. What we said: Mum might have looked like it was just a sitcom, but it had something beautiful to say about love and loss. It\u2019s said it. Read the full review Pose Assembling the largest collection of trans actors in televisual history, Ryan Murphy\u2019s big-hearted drama about the voguing scene in 1980s New York had style, grace, swagger and sass for days. What\u2019s not to love? What we said: Razzle-dazzle showmanship isn\u2019t Pose\u2019s only source of infectious joy. Watching the slow, still-unfolding process of these characters becoming more and more their true selves is as exhilarating as the opening bars of Cheryl Lynn\u2019s Got to be Real. Self-actualisation isn\u2019t easy, but it sure is beautiful. Read the full review Pure Following a young woman with a form of OCD called Pure O, which manifests as constant invasive thoughts about sex, this comedy-drama was among the year\u2019s frankest and most fearless TV. What we said: The drama and the gags are never sacrificed to worthy exposition, virtue-signalling or finger-wagging, but, at the same time, the series has so evidently been made in good faith that you can surrender to it entirely, never fearing that it will put a foot wrong. Read the full review Russian Doll A hipster Groundhog Day, but also so much more, Natasha Lyonne\u2019s comedy about a thirtysomething trapped in a time loop of death and rebirth proved a truly mind-bending proposition. What we said: Russian Doll is an acquired taste. But do persist: there is such a fine, idiosyncratic, impressive show nested within. Read the full review Sex Education Gillian Anderson starred as Jean, a sex therapist whose son Otis (Asa Butterfield) \u2013 though too anxious to masturbate himself \u2013 sets up a sex advice service at school. A punchy, horny comedy, with the added bonus of the fantastic Ncuti Gatwa as Otis\u2019s best friend Eric. Worth watching for his heroic prom outfit alone. What we said: Endlessly and seemingly effortlessly funny, in a naturalistic way that doesn\u2019t have you listening for the hooves of the next gag thundering down a well-worn track but, like Catastrophe, catches you almost unawares and makes you bark with laughter. Read the full review The Last Survivors Arthur Cary\u2019s thoughtful, wonderful and always dignified 90-minute documentary heard the stories of some of the last living people who survived concentration camps as children. A very important work indeed. What we said: For an hour and a half, I was crying, especially when Cary followed three generations of Holocaust survivors to Auschwitz, knowing all the time that tears are not enough. Nor guilt. Read the full review The Other Two How would you react if you could barely get cast as Man Who Smells Fart in an advert while your kid brother became a Bieber-esque teen hearthrob overnight? That\u2019s the premise of this brilliant satire, which skewers our pop-culture-obsessed society spectacularly. What we said: It has heart, charm, steel, belly laughs and a gimlet eye. Get on it. Read the full review The Victim John Hannah and Kelly Macdonald starred in an intelligent drama about a vigilante attack on a potential child killer that managed to ask ever more challenging questions as its episodes rolled on. What we said: It is a drama that resonates with its time by asking what constitutes a victim and how much leeway we allow in bestowing that status. Do they have to be perfect? How sure do we have to be? And what happens when the perpetrator becomes a victim too, of a different kind? Read the full review The Virtues Shane Meadows reunited with This is England star Stephen Graham for an unflinching drama about a troubled dad attempting to reunite with his long-lost sister and process childhood sexual abuse. What we said: Unspoken pain infuses every scene, every gesture and expression from Stephen Graham and in doing so lays the foundations to do justice to the suffering of victims everywhere. Read the full review The Yorkshire Ripper Files Liza Williams\u2019s three-part documentary revisited one of the biggest \u2013 and longest \u2013 murder manhunts in British history, taking us back to a time so different it seemed almost foreign. What we said: At its best, Williams\u2019 series \u2013 with its mixture of archive footage and new interviews \u2013 is a social document. The hindsight it offers is not primarily about the mishandling of the investigation, but of the grim tone of the times. Read the full review This Time With Alan Partridge The excruciating monkey tennis-pitcher went back to the BBC for a One Show-style magazine programme. Inevitably \u2013 and hilariously for viewers \u2013 it wasn\u2019t the smoothest of returns. What we said: We get the heroes we deserve, and as you finish writhing in agony and lie limp from laughter, hatred, panic, despair or in awe at the end of another half-hour in his appalling company, you can only reflect that if Brexit means Alan then the whole business just got more complicated still. Read the full review Veep A last hurrah for Julia Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s mendacious yet incompetent vice-president, in a political satire that was perfectly attuned for these most buffoonish of times. What we said: Louis-Dreyfus has won a record six Emmy awards for her role as Selina Meyer, and, frankly, it\u2019s no wonder. She is magnificent, brittle and furiously amoral. In this seventh and final season of Veep, it appears to be getting out while it still has a hope in hell of making its fictional world look more comedic than the real one. Read the full review When They See Us Ava DuVernay\u2019s staggering miniseries about the Central Park Five showed how a group of young boys came to be falsely convicted for raping a young white woman in 1989. It is unbearably harrowing to watch the boys, as young as 13, get violently coerced by police into giving confessions. What we said: The performances are uniformly astonishing \u2013 especially from the central five, Asante Blackk, Caleel Harris, Ethan Herisse, Marquis Rodriguez and Jharrel Jerome, most of whom are just a few years older than the teens they are playing. They capture the innocence, in all senses, of children, and the permanence of its loss. It feels like a great privilege to see them. Read the full review Years and Years Russell T Davies\u2019s hugely ambitious drama followed a family through the next 15 years of British life, taking in the migrant crisis, terrifying technological innovations and Trump\u2019s increasingly fraught face-off with China. What we said: For a series that compresses 15 years into six hours, it seems to pass in the blink of an eye thanks to Russell T Davies\u2019s trademark humour, compassion and the kinetic energy with which he infuses every project. We do not deserve Davies, but thank God he\u2019s here. Read the full review 100 Vaginas Following her projects about breasts and penises, artist Laura Dodsworth photographed a range of women\u2019s vulvas, then showed the sitters their vaginal portraits and interviewed them for their responses. The result? Intimate, empowering television, unlike anything that has ever aired before. What we said: A gently but relentlessly radical documentary. It\u2019s not until you see a full set of female genitals filling your screen that you realise how little you see anything of or about them in wider culture. Read the full review",

      "body": "<p>\u201cGood to see you,\u201d smiles Kevin Jonas, the first of three Jonas brothers to arrive in the back room of an upmarket hotel in Fitzrovia, London. Kevin and I have indeed met before, many years ago, for an interview he has no reason to remember.

Today, he says simply that Disney was \u201cvery helpful when we needed it the most\u201d.</p> <p>Internally, things were also complex. There is a throwaway comment in one episode of Living the Dream in which the brothers discuss their father, who by that point had taken on the role of the band\u2019s co-manager: \u201cThe problem is, we\u2019re never sure when he\u2019s just being dad.\u201d Equally, the band realised the line between brother and bandmate was frequently, inevitably, ill-defined. \u201cSometimes you just want a dad, sometimes you just want a brother,\u201d Joe says today. \u201cThere was confusion when it came to family versus band, and what comes first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen the band broke up, he balanced both really well,\u201d Nick says of their father. \u201cBecause I had initiated the conversation for the group to break up, he was comforting to me while I spoke my truth.

And our relationship was unhealthy. We weren\u2019t communicating as we should have been.\u201d Still, Joe remembers thinking that things would work themselves out. \u201cI kind of just assumed we\u2019d get through this bad phase and something great would happen again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66197699bfb7d89a5529e9c95b905817b07dc045\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66197699bfb7d89a5529e9c95b905817b07dc045/0_97_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonas Brothers at the premiere of Camp Rock, 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonas Brothers at the premiere of Camp Rock, 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave M.

After that, Nick and Joe released solo albums, which were poorly received. I ask if the failure of those initial solo outings, followed by the ill-fated retreat to the safety of the band, could have fostered resentment that led to the eventual split. Joe nods. \u201cI wanted to at least get that personal win of being able to do something on my own, which I carried for many years, just thinking: \u2018I can\u2019t do anything without these guys.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our relationship was unhealthy. We weren\u2019t communicating as we should have been</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After the band\u2019s split in 2013, Kevin spent time with his wife, Danielle, raising their two daughters, starting a construction company and investing in a handful of ventures including a food app called Yood and a service for social influencers called The Blu Market. Nick released two albums, resulting in some decent airplay and chart hits such as the 2014 single Jealous. Joe formed a band, DNCE, whose 2015 billion-stream behemoth Cake By the Ocean was No 1 from Ecuador to Israel. Despite movie roles for both (Nick in Goat and Jumanji, Joe as a voice actor in Hotel Transylvania 3), and a slot judging on Australia\u2019s The Voice for Joe, their projects hit a wall \u2013 one of the tracks from DNCE\u2019s latest EP has broken 7m Spotify streams, while Cake By the Ocean stands at 806m.</p> <p>Although the brothers were hardly estranged during this period, there was a multi-platinum elephant in the room at family events. In 2017 came the idea of a Jonas Brothers documentary, Chasing Happiness, which is out this week on Amazon. The main aim was closure. \u201cWe definitely didn\u2019t think we were going to get back together,\u201d Joe says. During one pivotal moment the band took part in a drinking game (the documentary was not being made by Disney), in which residual issues were pulled out of a hat, and each member rated the other on the honesty of their responses. \u201cWe all needed to speak our truth, and be able to forgive,\u201d Nick says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy. Say the truth, then it\u2019s behind you. Just say it out loud.\u201d</p> <p>The brothers insist the plan was simply to draw a line under the band, but a full reunion happened anyway. They contacted the songwriter and producer Ryan Tedder, who has worked with everyone from Adele to U2. They knew they needed to update to reflect pop\u2019s new sound, and what Nick describes as \u201cthe ever-changing landscape of the way music is released and how people consume it. We were conscious that there would always be a new wave of entertainers you can feel you\u2019re in competition with but rather than be frustrated with how quickly things change, we\u2019ve chosen to lean into it.\u201d Tedder\u2019s early enthusiasm for the project gave the band the confidence to approach other pop overlords such as Greg Kurstin and Max Martin. \u201cBefore,\u201d Joe says, \u201cwhen it was slowing down, we were nervous to reach out to big producers and writers, thinking they would say no to working with us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a8fa04f3f6424f284322e4dbdaa24bb3138b305a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8fa04f3f6424f284322e4dbdaa24bb3138b305a/0_302_3750_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Jonas with his wife Priyanka Chopra and Joe Jonas with Sophie Turner, May 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Jonas with Priyanka Chopra and Joe Jonas with Sophie Turner, May 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Kamau/GC Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The result is an album, Happiness Begins, that is arguably better than anything the band made in their earlier years. Free from the late-00s shackles of over-enthusiastic hair straightening, the Jonas Brothers rather suit being older. They seem happy that their audiences in 2019 will generally have drinks in their hands and much like the fans who have grown up with them, these brothers seem more like individuals, too, from Nick in his designer bomber jacket to Kevin in an unassuming lumberjack shirt.</p> <p>The march of age \u2013 Nick is 27, Joe, 29, and Kevin, 31 \u2013 also means the brothers are no longer synonymous with the purity rings they once wore as a display of abstinence, which quickly became the target of a rather odd media obsession. Nick has since said that the purity rings ended up shaping his view of sex. \u201cThey did,\u201d he restates today. How? \u201cThe values behind the idea of understanding what sex is, and what it means, are incredibly important. When I have children, I\u2019ll make sure they understand the importance of sex, and consent, and all the things that are important. What\u2019s discouraging about that chapter of our life is that at 13 or 14 my sex life was being discussed. It was very tough to digest it in real time, trying to understand what it was going to mean to me, and what I wanted my choices to be, while having the media speaking about a 13-year-old\u2019s sex life. I don\u2019t know if it would fly in this day and age. Very strange.\u201d</p> <p>In any case, the band are all now married. Kevin got hitched to Danielle a decade ago while Nick\u2019s wife is the actor Priyanka Chopra, and Joe married Sophie Turner, Game of Thrones\u2019 Sansa Stark, in a Las Vegas ceremony last month. All three significant others feature in the video for Sucker. \u201cSophie was pretty adamant that she play the love interest in every music video we do from now on,\u201d Joe notes. \u201cI told her I didn\u2019t think that was possible, but we\u2019d give her the first one.\u201d I ask him if there\u2019s been a strange atmosphere, with one major chapter ending for Turner just as a new one begins for Joe. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely spoken about that. It\u2019s difficult to say goodbye to one \u2026 But it\u2019s amazing timing that we could be starting our life together right now.\u201d</p> <p>The couple\u2019s refreshing approach to dealing with paparazzi in New York, where they live \u2013 staring them out, giving them the finger \u2013 often sees them go viral. \u201cEarly on, we were trying to be secretive about our relationship,\u201d Joe explains. The problem? \u201cWe like to sit outside. Pulling faces at the paparazzi is sometimes the best way to handle the situation \u2013 and then I see myself on the top of Reddit.\u201d He suddenly becomes rather animated. \u201cI love Reddit! I got so excited when I saw that. I went: \u2018We made it!\u2019 She wasn\u2019t as excited.\u201d (He adds that he mainly visits Reddit for Gifs, memes and pictures of \u201cany cute animal\u201d.)</p> <p>I ask Nick how he and Priyanka, who has experienced a similar level of a different type of fame, manage their public lives. \u201cShe\u2019s coming up on 20 years in the business, and weirdly, so am I,\u201d he begins. \u201cBut she wasn\u2019t really familiar with us, or me, when we first started dating.\u201d One of their first steps, within their first few weeks together, was a show-and-tell session. \u201cWe actually sat down and educated each other, playing videos we were both embarrassed and proud of. It was a helpful way to get to know each other.\u201d (Nick adds, ominously, that Chopra \u201cdid a little digging of her own and found out some things about my past\u201d.)</p> <p>The band\u2019s not exactly hermit-like private lives have undoubtedly boosted their comeback, but, along with Sucker being a nailed-on hit, they have also benefited from a curious type of nostalgia. Their return does transport the mind to a time when their music seemed to soundtrack things slowly getting better, rather than rapidly descending into what Nick describes today as \u201can incredibly negative time across the whole globe\u201d, and what the rest of us might term an international dumpster fire.</p> <p>\u201cThat should be our album title,\u201d Joe decides. \u201cBefore The Dumpster Fire. Six years ago was a lot different everywhere, but we like the idea that we can take people out of it and smile and bring some joy to 2019.\u201d</p> <p>This feels like as appropriate a time as any to bring up the internet theory that Kevin\u2019s appearance on the US version of Celebrity Apprentice was directly responsible for Trump\u2019s presidency. The Jonas Brothers aren\u2019t known for their political views but the theory goes like this: Kevin\u2019s presence gave the ailing show an early ratings boost, but after Kevin attempted to outfox Trump in the boardroom and got himself fired, the rest of the season\u2019s ratings were poor, and now here we are. \u201cYou can do the math on it, and it lines up,\u201d Kevin accepts. \u201cIt\u2019s plausible, I guess, that the need for attention could have led from bad ratings to the presidency. I hope that\u2019s not the case.\u201d Would he like to apologise to the world? \u201cNo. I do not take credit for it.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Nick if, as he has previously stated, he would still like to run for president himself one day. \u201cPolitics is a very tricky thing,\u201d he diplomatically responds. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different time to when I first mentioned my desire to be president.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s practising,\u201d Kevin laughs.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take what we can get,\u201d Joe mutters.</p> <p>With that, it\u2019s time for the band to clear off and perform for fans in Kingston, London. Before they go I ask what Connect 3, the band they portrayed in Camp Rock, are doing now. \u201cI think,\u201d Nick says, \u201cthey\u2019re just really jealous that the Jonas Brothers are back.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Jonas Brothers\u2019 new album, Happiness Begins, is out on 7 June on Polydor/Republic Records</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cGood to see you,\u201d smiles Kevin Jonas, the first of three Jonas brothers to arrive in the back room of an upmarket hotel in Fitzrovia, London. Kevin and I have indeed met before, many years ago, for an interview he has no reason to remember. Between then and today, the Jonas Brothers have split and now re-formed, and for anyone querying just how in sync the newly reunited band are, Joe is the next to join us. \u201cGood to see you,\u201d he says. A few seconds later, here comes Nick: \u201cGood to see you.\u201d It is three months since they announced their reunion, more than half a decade since a split that was blamed on a \u201cdeep rift within the band\u201d. The pandemonium surrounding their getting back together, which has seen Sucker become the band\u2019s first US No 1 single, feels like a mirror image of how fans reacted to the brutality and abruptness of the split in 2013, when, having sold 17m albums and achieved widespread international fame, the brothers ditched a half-made fifth album and cancelled a world tour they were in the middle of.

Joe nods. \u201cI wanted to at least get that personal win of being able to do something on my own, which I carried for many years, just thinking: \u2018I can\u2019t do anything without these guys.\u2019\u201d After the band\u2019s split in 2013, Kevin spent time with his wife, Danielle, raising their two daughters, starting a construction company and investing in a handful of ventures including a food app called Yood and a service for social influencers called The Blu Market. Nick released two albums, resulting in some decent airplay and chart hits such as the 2014 single Jealous. Joe formed a band, DNCE, whose 2015 billion-stream behemoth Cake By the Ocean was No 1 from Ecuador to Israel. Despite movie roles for both (Nick in Goat and Jumanji, Joe as a voice actor in Hotel Transylvania 3), and a slot judging on Australia\u2019s The Voice for Joe, their projects hit a wall \u2013 one of the tracks from DNCE\u2019s latest EP has broken 7m Spotify streams, while Cake By the Ocean stands at 806m. Although the brothers were hardly estranged during this period, there was a multi-platinum elephant in the room at family events. In 2017 came the idea of a Jonas Brothers documentary, Chasing Happiness, which is out this week on Amazon. The main aim was closure. \u201cWe definitely didn\u2019t think we were going to get back together,\u201d Joe says. During one pivotal moment the band took part in a drinking game (the documentary was not being made by Disney), in which residual issues were pulled out of a hat, and each member rated the other on the honesty of their responses. \u201cWe all needed to speak our truth, and be able to forgive,\u201d Nick says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy. Say the truth, then it\u2019s behind you. Just say it out loud.\u201d The brothers insist the plan was simply to draw a line under the band, but a full reunion happened anyway. They contacted the songwriter and producer Ryan Tedder, who has worked with everyone from Adele to U2. They knew they needed to update to reflect pop\u2019s new sound, and what Nick describes as \u201cthe ever-changing landscape of the way music is released and how people consume it. We were conscious that there would always be a new wave of entertainers you can feel you\u2019re in competition with but rather than be frustrated with how quickly things change, we\u2019ve chosen to lean into it.\u201d Tedder\u2019s early enthusiasm for the project gave the band the confidence to approach other pop overlords such as Greg Kurstin and Max Martin. \u201cBefore,\u201d Joe says, \u201cwhen it was slowing down, we were nervous to reach out to big producers and writers, thinking they would say no to working with us.\u201d The result is an album, Happiness Begins, that is arguably better than anything the band made in their earlier years. Free from the late-00s shackles of over-enthusiastic hair straightening, the Jonas Brothers rather suit being older. They seem happy that their audiences in 2019 will generally have drinks in their hands and much like the fans who have grown up with them, these brothers seem more like individuals, too, from Nick in his designer bomber jacket to Kevin in an unassuming lumberjack shirt. The march of age \u2013 Nick is 27, Joe, 29, and Kevin, 31 \u2013 also means the brothers are no longer synonymous with the purity rings they once wore as a display of abstinence, which quickly became the target of a rather odd media obsession. Nick has since said that the purity rings ended up shaping his view of sex. \u201cThey did,\u201d he restates today. How? \u201cThe values behind the idea of understanding what sex is, and what it means, are incredibly important. When I have children, I\u2019ll make sure they understand the importance of sex, and consent, and all the things that are important. What\u2019s discouraging about that chapter of our life is that at 13 or 14 my sex life was being discussed. It was very tough to digest it in real time, trying to understand what it was going to mean to me, and what I wanted my choices to be, while having the media speaking about a 13-year-old\u2019s sex life. I don\u2019t know if it would fly in this day and age. Very strange.\u201d In any case, the band are all now married. Kevin got hitched to Danielle a decade ago while Nick\u2019s wife is the actor Priyanka Chopra, and Joe married Sophie Turner, Game of Thrones\u2019 Sansa Stark, in a Las Vegas ceremony last month. All three significant others feature in the video for Sucker. \u201cSophie was pretty adamant that she play the love interest in every music video we do from now on,\u201d Joe notes. \u201cI told her I didn\u2019t think that was possible, but we\u2019d give her the first one.\u201d I ask him if there\u2019s been a strange atmosphere, with one major chapter ending for Turner just as a new one begins for Joe. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely spoken about that. It\u2019s difficult to say goodbye to one \u2026 But it\u2019s amazing timing that we could be starting our life together right now.\u201d The couple\u2019s refreshing approach to dealing with paparazzi in New York, where they live \u2013 staring them out, giving them the finger \u2013 often sees them go viral. \u201cEarly on, we were trying to be secretive about our relationship,\u201d Joe explains. The problem? \u201cWe like to sit outside. Pulling faces at the paparazzi is sometimes the best way to handle the situation \u2013 and then I see myself on the top of Reddit.\u201d He suddenly becomes rather animated. \u201cI love Reddit! I got so excited when I saw that. I went: \u2018We made it!\u2019 She wasn\u2019t as excited.\u201d (He adds that he mainly visits Reddit for Gifs, memes and pictures of \u201cany cute animal\u201d.) I ask Nick how he and Priyanka, who has experienced a similar level of a different type of fame, manage their public lives. \u201cShe\u2019s coming up on 20 years in the business, and weirdly, so am I,\u201d he begins. \u201cBut she wasn\u2019t really familiar with us, or me, when we first started dating.\u201d One of their first steps, within their first few weeks together, was a show-and-tell session. \u201cWe actually sat down and educated each other, playing videos we were both embarrassed and proud of. It was a helpful way to get to know each other.\u201d (Nick adds, ominously, that Chopra \u201cdid a little digging of her own and found out some things about my past\u201d.) The band\u2019s not exactly hermit-like private lives have undoubtedly boosted their comeback, but, along with Sucker being a nailed-on hit, they have also benefited from a curious type of nostalgia. Their return does transport the mind to a time when their music seemed to soundtrack things slowly getting better, rather than rapidly descending into what Nick describes today as \u201can incredibly negative time across the whole globe\u201d, and what the rest of us might term an international dumpster fire. \u201cThat should be our album title,\u201d Joe decides. \u201cBefore The Dumpster Fire. Six years ago was a lot different everywhere, but we like the idea that we can take people out of it and smile and bring some joy to 2019.\u201d This feels like as appropriate a time as any to bring up the internet theory that Kevin\u2019s appearance on the US version of Celebrity Apprentice was directly responsible for Trump\u2019s presidency. The Jonas Brothers aren\u2019t known for their political views but the theory goes like this: Kevin\u2019s presence gave the ailing show an early ratings boost, but after Kevin attempted to outfox Trump in the boardroom and got himself fired, the rest of the season\u2019s ratings were poor, and now here we are. \u201cYou can do the math on it, and it lines up,\u201d Kevin accepts. \u201cIt\u2019s plausible, I guess, that the need for attention could have led from bad ratings to the presidency. I hope that\u2019s not the case.\u201d Would he like to apologise to the world? \u201cNo. I do not take credit for it.\u201d I ask Nick if, as he has previously stated, he would still like to run for president himself one day. \u201cPolitics is a very tricky thing,\u201d he diplomatically responds. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different time to when I first mentioned my desire to be president.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s practising,\u201d Kevin laughs. \u201cWe\u2019ll take what we can get,\u201d Joe mutters. With that, it\u2019s time for the band to clear off and perform for fans in Kingston, London. Before they go I ask what Connect 3, the band they portrayed in Camp Rock, are doing now. \u201cI think,\u201d Nick says, \u201cthey\u2019re just really jealous that the Jonas Brothers are back.\u201d \u2022 Jonas Brothers\u2019 new album, Happiness Begins, is out on 7 June on Polydor/Republic Records",

      "bodyText": "The Australian woman missing after avalanches in the Himalayas was an experienced mountaineer and a \u201cremarkable person\u201d who had been planning the climb for several years, her husband says. Ruth McCance, from Sydney, is one of eight climbers who went missing while climbing a mountain in the Himalayas after reports of a heavy avalanche. Along with four people from Britain, two from the US, and one from India, McCance had been preparing to climb the Nanda Devi, India\u2019s second-highest mountain, on a previously unclimbed route after reaching 4,870 metres on 22 May. Her husband, Trent Goldsack, told Guardian Australia mountain climbing was \u201cpart of who she was\u201d. \u201cShe had been planning on doing something like this ever since I have known her, more than 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cFor her it\u2019s not about ticking a box of being the highest or fastest or hardest, for her it was about a personal exploration, extending yourself, but also being out in those wild places, it meant a lot to her. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t some whim, she didn\u2019t just say \u2018I\u2019m going to try mountain climbing\u2019 like some of the other people on Everest. She\u2019d been preparing for a long time. It was a well-planned, well-prepared trip. She was a mountaineer, not a tourist. I think she earned that title.\u201d Indian air force helicopters were searching around the Nanda Devi mountain on Sunday but the operation had to be suspended because of poor weather. It will take days to trek to the last known location of the group and hopes that they will be discovered are slim. \u201cThe first aerial recce has concluded and one tent was spotted, but there were no signs of human movement,\u201d Vijay Kumar Jogdanda, the top civil servant in the Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand state, told the Guardian on Sunday. Goldsack\u2019s last contact with McCance was via a text message he received from her about a week ago that read: \u201cOK at base camp.\u201d He said he was \u201cvery emotional\u201d after being informed McCance was missing on Saturday, but praised the efforts of the Indian government, saying they been \u201cgenerous and proactive\u201d in their search for the missing climbers. In a statement, the family of the expedition leader, Martin Moran, said they were calling for the search area to be widened, and wished it to continue until there was clear evidence of the wellbeing or otherwise of all those in the climbing group. Goldsack said that McCance\u2019s priority had not been climbing an unclaimed peak, but \u201cmore personal\u201d. \u201cThe mission for her wasn\u2019t necessarily to climb an unnamed peak, that was part of the trip but it wasn\u2019t like that was her goal in life. It was to be in those wild places,\u201d he said. McCance, an executive coach from Sydney\u2019s lower north shore, wrote in her blog in 2016 that she stopped climbing at the age of 30 before beginning again at the age of 47. \u201cAs much as I loved it and saw others climbing safely and well, I became overwhelmed by the risks involved, so I stopped,\u201d she wrote at the time. Goldsack told Guardian Australia his wife \u2013 who he married in 2006 after meeting about 20 years ago \u2013 resumed climbing because \u201cshe realised how important a part of her being it was\u201d. \u201cShe decided to honour that, that she was a climber, a mountaineer,\u201d he said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to break herself, she wanted to extend herself, it was all part of her personal journey.\u201d He said his wife was \u201cdeeply spiritual\u201d, and \u201cdeeply wise\u201d with \u201ca vast intellect\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s rare to find all of those things in one person,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was remarkable.\u201d The eight were part of a larger contingent of 12 climbers who began their ascent on 13 May from the village of Munsiyari, in the hill state of Uttarakhand in northern India, near the western Nepalese border. The group said it had trekked into the heart of the Nanda Devi sanctuary \u201cwith the ambition of summiting a virgin peak\u201d. The trip was expected to take about 24 days. According to an update on 22 May, the group had reached their second base camp at 4,870m and were due to make a summit attempt on an unclimbed peak at 6,477m. However, by last Saturday \u2013 25 May \u2013 the expedition\u2019s British deputy leader, Mark Thomas, had returned to the second base camp with three others. He was in radio contact with the group of eight that pushed higher but when Thomas did not hear from the group by last Sunday he went up to look for them. He reportedly found a single unoccupied tent. There was evidence of a large avalanche beyond that.",

      "bodyText": "Storms and gales will hit large parts of Australia\u2019s east coast this week as parts of the country experience a wild start to winter, with the possibility of snowfall in southern Queensland. Temperatures could drop as low as -2C on Tuesday on the granite belt near Stanthorpe, close to the Queensland border with New South Wales, according to the meteorologist Michael Gray. He said there was a 20% chance that snow would fall in that region in the form of a \u201cflurry\u201d, which means that the snowflakes don\u2019t accumulate on the ground. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued severe weather warnings for 100km of the NSW coast and for large parts of Victoria, with extreme weather predicted for the rest of the week. Sydney, Newcastle, Wollongong, Gosford, Taree and Port Macquarie are forecast to experience damaging winds and dangerous surf this week, with the bureau predicting 70km/h to 90km/h winds along coastal areas. The severe weather warning stretches from the Victorian border in the south up to Kempsey on the NSW mid-north coast. Melbourne, Geelong and large parts of Victoria will experience heavy rain due to a low pressure system moving over the Bass Strait. On Monday morning Melbourne\u2019s city centre and western suburbs experienced heavy showers, with the possibility of more in the afternoon. But that could ease throughout the week, with the bureau forecasting sporadic showers in the city on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Flash flooding could occur in the Gippsland region and central regions of the state, with 80mm of rain falling in 24 hours across high country, and 35mm across the rest of the region, the bureau said. Blizzard conditions may also develop in alpine areas on Monday night, where winds are predicted to reach 120km/h. In Sydney the bureau is forecasting a 100% chance of rain on Tuesday and a 90% chance for Wednesday. Up to 50mm of rain could fall on Tuesday, mostly in the morning. Across the two states, strong winds have the potential to wreak havoc, and the NSW State Emergency Service has advised residents to move vehicles under cover or away from trees, to secure loose items and to stay clear of fallen power lines. The wet weather comes as councils across NSW introduce water restrictions amid falling dam levels. In western NSW, Tamworth\u2019s Chaffey Dam is at 24% capacity and the city is under level-four water restrictions. That will be upgraded to level five if the dam drops below 20%. Sydney introduced level-one water restrictions last week \u2013 which bans the use of standard sprinklers and unattended hoses, and only allows the watering of lawns before 10am and after 4pm, as long as the hose is fitted with a trigger nozzle. Last week Dubbo introduced level-two water restrictions, which involves an \u201codds and evens\u201d system. Houses with even numbers are allowed to water their lawns on calendar days that are even numbers, and vice versa for their odd-numbered neighbours. \u2022 Australian Associated Press contributed to this report",

In order to understand the situation of refugees on Manus and Nauru it may be helpful to compare the feelings of many Australians who were left in shock from the election results and our situation here on Manus. Many Australians were deeply upset by the results \u2013 they were left feeling hopeless and are anxious about the future of their country. But even though members of this group are upset, they are free human beings. Now compare this with refugees who saw their lives and destinies as contingent on the election results. One might question whether Labor would have freed the refugees if elected. This is a valid question. But we must not forget that the refugees on Manus and Nauru were certain that with a change in government they had some hope of freedom. It is not important whether they were correct in believing this or not. It is important that this hope \u2013 no matter how distant \u2013 has now been completely dashed. The future is grim. Over the last year I could see how all the refugees were counting down every day of each of the 12 months leading up to the election. But it was all just a mirage in the desert. In any case, what is unfolding on Manus and Nauru is a human tragedy. It is a humanitarian crisis, and it is getting increasingly more dangerous as the days go by. In order to move beyond this critical situation only one option exists: that is for the Australian government to abide by the international laws which it is obligated to; it must acknowledge the human rights of refugees. There is no other way to act on this but to free the innocent human beings who they have tortured systematically for years. Freedom is the only thing that can reassure us of life, only freedom. I can say this with certainty: If the government insists on continuing its policy of indefinite detention many human beings will die here. \u2022 Behrouz Boochani is a writer, journalist, associate professor at UNSW, and refugee in Manus \u2022 Translation: Omid Tofighian, American University in Cairo/University of Sydney \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

Alison Holder, director of Equal Measures 2030, said: \u201cI don\u2019t see any countries taking the ambitious action needed to tackle intractable problems \u2013 even the best scoring countries. \u201cI don\u2019t see how naturally these problems will go away. Even among the best scoring countries there are still massive problems.\u201d As well as concerns over slow progress, Holder said she feared achievements could be undone, given the current rollback of abortion laws in the US and challenges to commitments to women\u2019s rights at the United Nations. The US ranked 28th in the index with a score of 77.6 points. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that even in countries at the top of the index that progress is never guaranteed,\u201d said Holder. \u201cWe need to guard against countries falling backwards.\u201d Memory Kachambwa, executive director of the African Women\u2019s Development and Communication Network (Femnet), said what is happening in the US, and the power the Trump administration has to influence key language in international agreements, set a worrying precedent. \u201cIt\u2019s worrying at an international level because it gives a foothold to other governments to continue to repress women,\u201d she said. \u201cParties who are very much against women\u2019s rights and gender equality are growing stronger and stronger and are able to have lot of influence in policy spaces a global level.\u201d Although disappointed with the pace of change, she added that the index did at least offer a clearer picture on how countries were doing. \u201cWhen we talk to policymakers, they say they want the evidence [of gender inequalities]. We now have the evidence,\u201d she said. Europe and North American countries topped the index, while the bottom was dominated by African states. But the index noted that all countries had \u201cdifferent starting points\u201d and, on some targets, states with low GDP were making better progress than wealthier nations in. Denmark, for example, ranks behind Georgia, Kazakhstan and Lithuania on education, partly because the country has a lower percentage of young women who have completed secondary school. It also has fewer women MPs than Senegal and Rwanda, despite the Nordic state having a GDP per capita 56 times higher than Senegal. The bottom 20 countries scored higher than the top 20 for breaking down their budgets by factors such as gender, age, income or region. Women are more likely to have their needs for family planning met in Brazil, China and Nicaragua, than in Canada, the Netherlands and Norway. The index, launched at the Women Deliver conference in Vancouver, will be updated in 2021 and at regular internals until the 2030 SDG deadline. Data are drawn from UN agencies, the World Bank, NGOs, thinktanks and from the consultancy firm Gallup. Equal Measures 2030 is a partnership of civil society and the private sector, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition, KPMG, Femnet, Plan International and Women Deliver. It was set up in 2016 to provide women\u2019s rights advocates with the data they need to hold governments to account for their SDG commitments.",

      "bodyText": "Labor and the Greens have demanded the government immediately release national greenhouse emissions data, and have warned the new emissions reduction minister could be in contempt of parliament for missing the deadline to publish the figures. Angus Taylor\u2019s first act in his new role was to miss a Senate-set deadline on Friday for the publication of Australia\u2019s emissions data for the December 2018 quarter. The Senate passed an order last year that requires the minister to publish the quarterly greenhouse gas inventory no later than five months after the end of each quarter. For the December quarter that date was 31 May. The government, via a statement from the environment department, said late on Friday: \u201cWe anticipate the quarterly update of Australia\u2019s national greenhouse gas inventory: December 2018 will be released soon.\u201d But Labor\u2019s climate and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, said Taylor \u201cmust immediately release the latest emissions data\u201d. \u201cAngus Taylor has failed his first task as new emissions reduction minister,\u201d Butler said. \u201cThis is a disgrace and shows total disregard to the Australian people and Senate process. \u201cBut really it\u2019s no surprise considering Angus Taylor has continually argued against climate action and is part of a government that has continually lied about what their emissions data actually shows, which is that emissions are rising and we\u2019re not on track to meet our international climate commitments.\u201d The government has been under pressure because its climate policy has been failing to stall Australia\u2019s emissions, which have been increasing every year for the past four years. The Senate passed the order for rolling quarterly deadlines last year to address delays in the publication of national carbon pollution figures. The Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said the minister could be in contempt of parliament. \u201cThe government and minister are showing early signs of contempt for the parliament and should be punished. \u201cEmissions data should be no different to other nationally significant data, which gets released by the ABS like clockwork. The release of greenhouse pollution data should be automatic and free from ministerial interference.\u201d In Senate estimates last year, department officials were asked if complying with Senate orders to publish the reports within five months would be a problem. \u201cNo \u2026 That time is sufficient for us to make use of the available data to prepare the reports,\u201d they said. On Monday afternoon the Greens Leader Richard Di Natale wrote to the government\u2019s deputy senate leader, Simon Birmingham, who is the representative for both Taylor and the environment department in the Senate. Di Natale reminded Birmingham of the department\u2019s testimony that it could meet the upper house deadline. \u201cGiven the testimony from the department, the only conclusion is that it was held back for political reasons by the minister\u2019s office,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI seek your answers explaining the reasons for the delay and reserve my right to put a motion to the Senate should the government continue to demonstrate signs of contempt for the Senate and its role in scrutinising the use of executive power.\u201d Tim Baxter of the Climate and Energy College at Melbourne University, said although Morrison\u2019s new ministry was only sworn in last week, he did not believe that should have led to a delay. \u201cI don\u2019t really think that\u2019s a decent excuse under the circumstances because it\u2019s not like the report has to be written. It has to be read,\u201d he said. \u201cTaylor, while he hasn\u2019t been emissions reduction minister for long, has been energy minister and he has seen these reports.\u201d Baxter said much of the information that was in the report was the same as previous quarters, it was just the headline figures that changed. \u201cThis is a pretty unambiguous Senate order. It\u2019s not something he gets to choose \u2026he\u2019s the minister and it\u2019s his job,\u201d he said.",

They even still had a chance during the game\u2019s final seconds before Iguodala slammed the door shut. Instead of being up 2-0, the Finals are tied and we\u2019re heading into Oakland next. The question now is: how healthy will the Warriors be for Wednesday\u2019s Game 3? Will Kevin Durant be back? Will Thompson and Looney be better? That might end up being the storyline, but the Warriors will have a few days to worry about that, they have to be happy with their victory for the moment.</p> \n  <p>That will do it from us here at the Guardian, thanks for following our live coverage of Game 2 of the NBA Finals, particularly those who contributed. Make sure to follow further reports on the Finals, including this evening\u2019s game report linked below.

Without Kevin Durant, the Warriors found themselves managing to still find an answer for Kawhi Leonard\u2014at least to a certain degree\u2014but couldn\u2019t figure out Pascal Siakam who ended up having the best game of his entire career at the exact right time. It was a big-time win, especially for a team that had never appeared in the Finals facing a team that has made their home there.</p> \n  <p>Yet it was still just one game.

Several times this postseason it\u2019s been proven that the team who gets an early victory or two doesn\u2019t necessarily take control of the rest of this series (just ask the Boston Celtics and the Milwaukee Bucks about that).

      "bodyText": "This could have been a different game had the Raptors not had inexplicable offensive droughts to start the third quarter and to end the fourth quarter. They even still had a chance during the game\u2019s final seconds before Iguodala slammed the door shut. Instead of being up 2-0, the Finals are tied and we\u2019re heading into Oakland next. The question now is: how healthy will the Warriors be for Wednesday\u2019s Game 3? Will Kevin Durant be back? Will Thompson and Looney be better? That might end up being the storyline, but the Warriors will have a few days to worry about that, they have to be happy with their victory for the moment. That will do it from us here at the Guardian, thanks for following our live coverage of Game 2 of the NBA Finals, particularly those who contributed. Make sure to follow further reports on the Finals, including this evening\u2019s game report linked below. Ciao! Email from Paulo Sternberg: Hah! Good lad; but Bogut had a very good year in Australia before Steve K called him. Won def awards, was not \u201cnearly out of ball\u2026\u201d in addition to disagreements re minor issues, my major beef is that you continue to refer to the Dubs as the Golden state warriors, rather than the Oakland warriors. Thanks for the coverage; don\u2019t have BEIN on the basic Orange pack here in the wilds of the Pyrenees Oriental. You\u2019ree welcome. This just highlights the fact that the Warriors, who have been criticized for their lack of depth, won today on the backs of their role players. Curry had an iffy first half, Looney and Thompson were injured and Durant, of course, continues to be a question mark. Instead, players like Cousins, just barely returned from injury himself, and Bogut and Iguodala all had huge moments. The Golden State Warriors have tied the NBA Finals at 1-1! What a heartbreaking loss for Toronto, who had so many opportunities late. Warriors 109-104 Raptors, FINAL Green misses a three-pointer and that will do it. The Warrior have won Game 2 of the NBA Finals! Warriors 109-104 Raptors, 5.9, 4th quarter They change the call. It\u2019s going to be Raptors basketball. Looks like they got it right. Now can the Raptors capitalize? VanVleet tries a three\u2026 its no good, they get the rebound, can\u2019t hit. Another rebound, no good and FINALLY Danny Green hits a three-pointer to cut it down to a single basket. The Warriors keep it for a bit, the Raptors don\u2019t foul and Iguodala drills a basket with 5.9 remaining on the clock! It\u2019s a five-point lead and that might do it. Warriors 106-101 Raptors, 51.4, 4th quarter Huge possession for both teams here. Green drives to the basket and loses the ball, but the refs say it went off of Toronto. It looks like it just barely grazed Gasol\u2019s arm but it\u2019s hard to see. After a few replays it actually looks like it\u2019s just a clear loss by Green. Warriors 106-101 Raptors, 1:08, 4th quarter Steph Curry gets called for a technical after getting called for a standard foul and then throwing the ball in anger. Kawhi Leonard goes to the line for three free throws to cut the lead down to five points. Now, it\u2019s a bit closer than the Warriors would like it. They call a timeout. This is now officially interesting. Warriors 106-98 Raptors, 1:08, 4th quarter The Warriors have gone ice cold and the Raptors can\u2019t capitalize this is amazing. They are going to have so many regrets when this one is over. Warriors 106-98 Raptors, 1:58, 4th quarter Leonard fouls Cousins, the seconds keep ticking away. Warriors 106-98 Raptors, 2:30, 4th quarter Raptors are getting stops but they\u2019re not converting the shots they\u2019re getting and they\u2019re running out of time. Warriors 106-98 Raptors, 3:46, 4th quarter Bad news for the Raptors, Lowry fouls out on an ill-advised reach-in. Toronto needed a better and smarter game from him. Warriors 106-98 Raptors, 4:18, 4th quarter Curry gets called on a foul. The refs look to see if it\u2019s going to be a clear-path foul. Meanwhile, Thompson is diagnosed with hamstring tightness and will not return to this game. It\u2019s just a loose ball foul on Curry, so no free throws\u2026 except he immediately gets called for another foul. Kyle Lowry gets to the line and misses the first free throw, that\u2019s not ideal, but he makes the second. Warriors 106-97 Raptors, 4:46, 4th quarter Bogut, in the midst of a potential podium game, gets called for his second foul. Siakam gets free throws, which is rather questionable, but the Raptors are going to take it. Siakam makes the first, misses the second, but the Raptors get the offensive rebound. They can\u2019t make use of it first time around, or second, but finally VanVleet is able to tip in his own miss. Warriors 106-94 Raptors, 5:22, 4th quarter It\u2019s probably not a good sign that Toronto immediately had to take another timeout. Warriors 106-94 Raptors, 5:39, 4th quarter Livingston finds Green for an alley oop, a go-to play for the Warriors this game. Leonard misses a shot that could cut the lead down to single-digits. Instead, Bogut, perhaps drawing inspiration from haters such as myself, dunks yet again. The Raptors take a timeout and now the clock is starting to be a factor. Warriors 102-94 Raptors, 6:38, 4th quarter Livingston gets to the line, makes both free throws. On the other end, Leonard gets to the basket and scores and draws a foul on Draymond Green. He makes his free throw. Warriors 100-91 Raptors, 7:36, 4th quarter Thompson landed awkwardly and eventually tried to call for a foul to stop things. He\u2019s out for the moment. The Warriors need Thompson desperately, so they have to hope that apparent leg injury isn\u2019t serious. Meanwhile in game news, Livingston makes a layup to get the Warriors to 100. Email from Paulo Sternberg: Following your gamecast from Catalunya Nord at 4 in the morning.Why hating on Oakland? Also, your Bogut comments are silly; he has had very good minutes, yes limited, for Oakland, since Steve K called him up at the start of the playoffs. I want to make it very clear that I have nothing but respect for the Golden State Warriors, who are on one of the greatest runs of any NBA team. I also want to add that I absolutely do mean disrespect to Andrew Bogut. I am not going to pretend otherwise. Warriors 98-91 Raptors, 7:59, 4th quarter Two straight three-pointers for Cook quiets the crowd down. Ibaka hits a three right back. This is starting to get interesting. Except Klay Thompson is hurt. Eventually the Warriors take a timeout, this could be a series-changer here. Warriors 95-88 Raptors, 9:04, 4th quarter Lowry hits a three to cut the Warriors lead down to 5 but Cousins drives to the basket. It would quite the crowd but Danny Green hits a HUGE three to cut the lead down to four. Warriors 90-82 Raptors, 9:49, 4th quarter Siakam tips in an Ibaka miss, so the Raptors avoid a long scoreless streak this time around. Warriors 90-80 Raptors, 11:15, 4th quarter Cousins with a layup to start off the fourth quarter scoring. Of course the Warriors strike first. Warriors 88-80 Raptors, 12:00, 4th quarter The Warriors are twelve minutes away from tying up the Finals. Because whenever there\u2019s a time to use this .Gif... Warriors 88-80 Raptors, end of the 3rd quarter Powell makes a shot for the Raptors. Curry hits yet another three, maybe he\u2019s not hurt at all. Leonard cuts into the Warriors lead with a layup and that will bring us to the end of the third quarter where Golden State very much dominated as predicted. Warriors 85-76 Raptors, 1:22, 3rd quarter Leonard on the line makes both free throws and\u2026 This is just brutal, Bogut makes his second straight dunk. This guy was nearly out of basketball very, very recently. Warriors 83-74 Raptors, 1:46, 3rd quarter Leonard hits a three-pointer. If Leonard can be the Playoff MVP that we\u2019ve seen in the first few postseason series, the Raptors can steal this one. Although putting Curry on the line, where he makes both free throws, isn\u2019t going to help matters. Warriors 81-71 Raptors, 2:17, 3rd quarter Curry misses, the crowd cheers. Curry steals and gets the ball to Quinn Cook who gets it to Green who gives it up to Siakam who has the half-court all to himself and scores. But Cook makes a three-pointer to settle things down. Warriors 78-69 Raptors, 3:13, 3rd quarter Leonard gets to the line, that\u2019s also a good sign for the Raptors, and makes both. Warriors 78-67 Raptors, 3:42, 3rd quarter McKinnie is scoring. It doesn\u2019t matter who has the ball for the Warriors at this point, they\u2019re going to score on the Raptors. Ibaka answers, so at least the Raptors can score points again. Warriors 76-65 Raptors, 4:26, 3rd quarter Leonard scores and gets fouled, just what Toronto needs. He makes the free throw. It\u2019s a nine point game, briefly. Andrew Bogut\u2026 Wait, Andrew Bogut is on the Warriors? He lays down a Steph Curry assist. That\u2019s just embarrassing. Warriors 74-62 Raptors, 4:50, 3rd quarter Okay, it\u2019s just a 10 point game. The Raptors can calm down and make some shots here and be right back in it. There\u2019s a lot of time left. Or Draymond Green can carve up their defense and score while they remain cold on offense. Warriors 72-62 Raptors, 5:27, 3rd quarter Green makes a shot and then, FINALLY, VanVleet hits a three to put the Raptors on the board. It\u2019s an excuse for the fans to get back into the game. Warriors 70-59 Raptors, 6:55, 3rd quarter Game 1 hero tries to make something happen but his shot gets blocked by Cousins. This is a turnaround, isn\u2019t it. Thompson drives to the basket and scores, that\u2019s 16 straight Warriors points. Warriors 68-59 Raptors, 7:35, 3rd quarter VanVleet with a three\u2026 no good. Raptors still haven\u2019t scored. Thompson hits a three. Is Nurse going to call a timeout anytime soon? Yes, immediately. What in god\u2019s name are the Raptors doing? Warriors 65-59 Raptors, 8:21, 3rd quarter Thompson scores, that\u2019s 11 straight points for the Warriors. Gasol attempts a no-hope three and it\u2019s no good. Finally something good happens as Cousins gets called for a fourth foul. The Raptors need something offensively here though. Warriors 63-59 Raptors, 9:18, 3rd quarter Gasol gets called on a moving screen, there\u2019s a turnover. The Raptors still haven\u2019t scored this half. Draymond Green has a free shot under the basket and scores. Toronto then turn the ball over a few times and are damn lucky that Golden State can\u2019t convert. The Warriors are doing what the Warriors can do if you sleep on them just a little and there\u2019s no doubt that the Raptors didn\u2019t start the quarter with the right intensity. Warriors 61-59 Raptors, 10:02, 3rd quarter Iguodala hits a three and the Warriors have already regained the lead. That was quicker than even I was expecting and Nick Nurse calls a timeout, Toronto. Warriors 58-59 Raptors, 10:15, 3rd quarter Iguodala actually starts off the shooting for the Warriors, scoring the first basket and Curry follows up with one of his own and after all that work in the first half, it\u2019s just a one-point game for Toronto. Warriors 54-59 Raptors, 11:13, 3rd quarter Some injury news: Iguodala is out there, Kevon Looney is out with a left chest contusion. That could be a factor defensively for the Warriors. Warriors 54-59 Raptors, 12:00, 3rd quarter And we have basketball again! My second half prediction? Look for the Warriors to have a trademark big third quarter but they don\u2019t look like a team that\u2019s just going to blow by these Raptors. It\u2019s going to be tight until the end of the fourth quarter. Sometimes Twitter is good. Sometimes Twitter is good. The Raptors were in complete control but, as the Warriors tend to do, they scored a bunch in a blink. Curry went from looking completely lost to his old self. He now somehow has 16 points after starting the game on an 0-for. The Raptors have the lead but it\u2019s not as comfortable as they would have hoped. Warriors 54-59 Raptors, end of the first half Green gets called on a foul and complains about it. It puts Siakam on the line with a chance to get them a little more separation after the Warriors closed their lead. He hits one of two free throws and then picks up a reach-in foul on his own to put Curry on the line. Not ideal. Curry makes both free throws to end the first half. Warriors 52-58 Raptors, 28.4, 2nd quarter Thompson is going to have a great night if the Warriors want to win this one and it\u2019s looking like he is. He makes a three pointer. The red hot VanVleet scores yet again! And Curry makes his next two shots. They\u2019ve awoken a sleeping giant. Warriors 45-56 Raptors, 2:04, 2nd quarter Curry makes his second straight three. Let\u2019s see if this gets him going. Meanwhile, the Raptors take advantage of two straight Warriors turnovers to score twice, both Gasol and VanVleet score. Looney picks up another foul and the crowd is getting loud. Warriors 42-52 Raptors, 2:58, 2nd quarter Kevon Looney is called for an iffy foul, putting Leonard on the line for two free throws. He makes both. Warriors 42-50 Raptors, 3:22, 2nd quarter Iguodala was the victim of a Marc Gasol screen. Iguodala is out. Klay Thompson hits a jumper to give the Warriors some good news. Warriors 40-50 Raptors, 3:22, 2nd quarter Curry makes his first basket, a three-pointer that might break the seal. Powell responds with a three-pointer and Iguodala is down. The Warriors take a timeout to deal with this. This doesn\u2019t look great. Warriors 37-47 Raptors, 4:06, 2nd quarter Leonard makes the free throw. Largest lead for the Raptors. Curry misses another shot, he is 0-for-6. Someone else is going to have to step up, Jonas Jerebko decides it\u2019s gotta be him and he makes a basket to cut the lead back to 10. Is that good? That doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s good. Warriors 35-46 Raptors, 5:16, 2nd quarter Siakam finds Leonard who finds the basket and finds himself fouled by Steph Curry. Before he goes to the line, the Warriors are going to take a timeout. They need to find themselves here, if it weren\u2019t for their free throws they would be completely out of it right now. Warriors 35-44 Raptors, 5:36, 2nd quarter Norman Powell with the dunk? Norman Powell with the dunk. Give Gasol the assist. Warriors 35-42 Raptors, 5:52, 2nd quarter Lowry tries to draw a charge but gets called for a foul and Cousins goes to the line yet again. Cousins hits both free throws. Lowry gets two attempts at a three-pointer, makes the second. Cousins answers with a three of his own, he\u2019s definitely a difference maker tonight. Except he just picked up his third foul. Warriors 30-39 Raptors, 7:12, 2nd quarter Warriors can\u2019t even score on a fast break but, guess what, the Raptors get called on a foul that puts Cousins on the line. He makes both free throws. Gasol makes up for committing the foul by making a layup for Toronto. Warriors 28-37 Raptors, 8:06, 2nd quarter Curry is now 0-5 after missing two three-pointers on one possession. On the other end, Leonard gets fouled by McKinnie and gets two free throws to increase the Toronto lead. Warriors 28-35 Raptors, 8:41, 2nd quarter Serge Ibaka picks up his third foul of the game and gets taken out. Finally VanVleet makes a basket to break the stalemate. He draws the foul too and finishes up an old fashioned three-pointer. Warriors 28-32 Raptors, 9:02, 2nd quarter We\u2019re not seeing the crisp offense that made Game 1 so fun to watch. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s great defense or just not great offense. The two teams trade bricks for a bit It\u2019s concerning for the Warriors, they need his shooting to keep them afloat until Durant returns. Warriors 28-32 Raptors, 10:19, 2nd quarter VanVleet will a trademark EXTREME LONGBALL gives the Raptors crowd a huge jolt. Warriors with an early timeout. Warriors 28-29 Raptors, 10:59, 2nd quarter Thompson starts the scoring with a jumper to give the Warriors a lead again but Siakam answers. It would probably behoove the Raptors to start being smarter with their fouls, the Warriors are making them pay at the free throw line and they\u2019re not a team you want to start gifting points to. The Raptors are otherwise outplaying them so far, but it\u2019s just a one-point game after a quarter. Warriors 26-27 Raptors, end of the 1st quarter VanVleet with a score on one side of the court and then a foul on the other, that\u2019s going to put Curry on the line. He makes both this time around. Green draws yet another foul to go to the line. He makes one of two, Ibaka manages to get a tip-in on a Siakam miss after a few attempts, and that\u2019ll do it for scoring in the first quarter. Warriors 23-23 Raptors, 1:20, 1st quarter Siakam scores again. Curry attempts a three pointer, it\u2019s no good. The Warriors turn it over and Danny Green ties things up with a jumper. Warriors 23-19 Raptors, 2:25, 1st quarter Draymond gets fouled again and again makes both free throws. Warriors 21-19 Raptors, 2:25, 1st quarter VanVleet attempts a long one, it\u2019s no good, and Draymond Green draws a foul. Green makes free throws while the broadcast suggests that Curry isn\u2019t 100%, he certainly hasn\u2019t quite looked himself this first quarter. Raptors take a timeout, meanwhile Obama is chilling out with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. Warriors 19-19 Raptors, 2:55, 1st quarter Green gets a layup, gets Golden State closer. Livingston dunks and we have a tied game. Warriors 15-19 Raptors, 3:41, 1st quarter Steph Curry gets fouled attempting a three pointer. Miraculously he actually misses one of them, making only two. Warriors 13-19 Raptors, 4:00, 1st quarter Some substitutions here. Alfonzo McKinnie and Shaun Livingston make their debuts. Lowry makes his free throw and Siakam takes advantage of a Warriors turnover by slamming down a pass from Fred VanVleet. Warriors 13-16 Raptors, 4:27, 1st quarter Another jumper for Klay Thompson. Is he going to miss? Then Lowry gets fouled while drilling a shot, that\u2019s on Thompson. Before Lowry can attempt the free throw, Golden State takes their first timeout. Warriors 11-14 Raptors, 4:52, 1st quarter Leonard gets to the line again, where he makes both. Then, finally, the rest of the Warriors get involved offensively, Curry feeds Draymond Green for a dunk. Warriors 9-12 Raptors, 5:20, 1st quarter Lowry jumps and hits a three pointer to put them back ahead. Leonard throws a bad shot up but then just swats it and, of course, it goes right in. He\u2019s like a pinball machine this guy. Klay Thompson has all nine Warriors points. So there\u2019s that. Warriors 9-7 Raptors, 6:56, 1st quarter Siakam gets called for a foul and the Raptors take a timeout. Warriors 9-7 Raptors, 7:11, 1st quarter Leonard gets called for travelling, the first Toronto turnover. Thompson hits another three-pointer, he\u2019s been Golden State\u2019s main weapon so far. After a turnover, Thompson gets a clean break to the rim, he misses but Lowry gets called for a foul. He\u2019s on the line where he makes one of two free throws for Golden State. Warriors 5-7 Raptors, 8:13, 1st quarter Thompson hits another jumper. Raptors get the ball back, Leonard attempts a long-ball that doesn\u2019t go but a travel gets the ball back to Toronto. So far more of a defensive battle than Game 1, early on. Cousins, however, picks up his second foul. This one puts Gasol on the line where he gets both free throws. Warriors 2-5 Raptors, 9:24, 1st quarter Gasol fouls Cousins, but it\u2019s called on the floor. No free throws, still Golden State ball. Thompson hits the Warriors\u2019 first basket. Leonard counters with a three. Warriors 0-2 Raptors, 10:39, 1st quarter Warriors don\u2019t score on their possession either. Cousins immediately gets called for a foul on the other end, not a shooting foul. Leonard finally hits the first shot of the game a minute in. Warriors 0-0 Raptors, 11:21, 1st quarter Kyle Lowry\u2019s first shot is no good, but they get the ball back. Siakam\u2019s three-point attempt is no good. And we\u2019re off! Powerful moment. We\u2019re getting close to opening tip. Obviously, since this is the Finals it\u2019s never entirely on time, have to do the ABC pregame stuff. Toronto Raptors starters Same as last time around. Why mess with what worked? PG \u2013 Kyle Lowry SG \u2013 Danny Green F \u2013 Kawhi Leonard F \u2013 Pascal Siakam C \u2013 Marc Gasol As always, the Canada/US game. means we get both anthems. Fantasia is here to sing \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner.\u201d \u201cO Canada\u201d is nominally by Alessia Cara but it\u2019s a sing-along affair with the entire crowd, which is kind of amazing. Golden State Warriors starters DeMarcus Cousins is back in the starting lineup for the Warriors, replacing Jordan Bell. Otherwise it\u2019s the same look. PG \u2013 Steph Curry SG \u2013 Klay Thompson F \u2013 Andre Iguodala F \u2013 Draymond Green C \u2013 DeMarcus Cousins Thing that sounds like I\u2019m making a joke but I am totally not: There will be a manufactured Fox News controversy about Obama going to see a basketball game in Canada rather than one in the United States. Very Unamerican. Oh thank God, Drake won\u2019t be the most famous person at tonight\u2019s game. Whatever you think of his presidency, you have to respect him for this: he\u2019s long out of office but he is still providing us all a public service. \u201cNBA Countdown\u201d is up and the whole thing starts with them saying that Paul Pierce has become the most hated man in Canada for jinxing them by picking them as winners. I remember when his nickname was The Truth, man has his broadcasting career made that seem ironic. Predictions Okay, way back in our pre-Finals bold predictions, I said that the Raptors would win the first two games and then go on and lose the next four. I\u2019m going to do the cowardly thing and back down on that prediction. I believe that the Warriors are going to bounce back this game, I feel that they are very much motivated to do so. I also no longer believe that this Raptors team is going to lose four straight. The Warriors win this game, in a dogfight, but the Raptors are going to win on the road. Agree? Disagree? Send us your predictions via email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or Twitter (to @HunterFelt). Injury news First, let\u2019s talk about the Warriors: Kevin Durant is right out. Okay that takes care of that. Meanwhile, the Raptors have activated forward OG Anunoby but he\u2019s unlikely to play any as she\u2019s still recovering from an appendectomy. Well, it\u2019s been three days and yet it still feels like we haven\u2019t gotten enough time to properly adjust to the Toronto Raptors\u2019 118-109 victory over the Golden State Warriors in Game 1 of the NBA Finals. Without Kevin Durant, the Warriors found themselves managing to still find an answer for Kawhi Leonard\u2014at least to a certain degree\u2014but couldn\u2019t figure out Pascal Siakam who ended up having the best game of his entire career at the exact right time. It was a big-time win, especially for a team that had never appeared in the Finals facing a team that has made their home there. Yet it was still just one game. The Warriors can turn the entire series around with a win tonight. After all, that would mean that they would just need to win all of their games at their (well, current) home of Oracle Arena to win the championship, not difficult to imagine with the possibility of Durant returning from his calf injury looming later in the week. Considering how much the Raptors clearly benefitted from the loud and boisterous crowd at Scotiabank Arena, that\u2019s no little difference. So, will Steph Curry and the Warriors respond or will the Raptors manage to put the Warriors into a 0-2 hole? Several times this postseason it\u2019s been proven that the team who gets an early victory or two doesn\u2019t necessarily take control of the rest of this series (just ask the Boston Celtics and the Milwaukee Bucks about that). So, this could end up a major turning point, which means that it will be a must-watch. The game is scheduled to start at 8:00pm EST but we\u2019ll return before then with our coverage. As always, we\u2019ll use your commentary throughout this liveblog, feel free to send end it either via email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or via Twitter (@HunterFelt). Hunter will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s Oliver Connolly on Game 1: Game 1 of the NBA finals was hardly the best litmus test for this series. It was the Raptors\u2019 first finals appearance in franchise history. Scotiabank Arena was going bonkers. Toronto played with some extra juice. The Warriors had 10 days off, fresh off a perfect sweep of the Blazers in the Western Conference finals. It\u2019s their fifth straight trip to the NBA finals. Some of the sheen has inevitably waned; this is just what they do. Golden State\u2019s performance was slathered in rust and complacency. The devastating cutting, high tempo and genius-level passing, all came in fits and starts, but it didn\u2019t sustain. There was always Curry launching a no-look pass into the first row to bail out any onslaught. You can read the full story below:",

Speaking in the Solomon Islands, the prime minister said the government had \u201cknown about that for some time\u201d. \u201cThis was an arrangement, a reciprocal visit because Australian naval vessels have visited China,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were returning after a counter drug-trafficking operation in the Middle East. \u201cThat is a further demonstration of the relationship that we have and this had been in train for some time. It may have been a surprise to others but it certainly wasn\u2019t a surprise to the government.\u201d Asked whether the arrival of the ships was appropriate given the anniversary of the massacre, Morrison said: \u201cNo, I think any reading into timing could be subject to a bit of over-analysis.\u201d In the lead up to the anniversary, a Chinese government minister defended the bloody crackdown on student protesters, with the defence minister, General Wei Fenghe, telling a regional security forum in Singapore on Sunday it was the \u201ccorrect\u201d policy. Morrison said the country\u2019s rare acknowledgement of the event was \u201cnot a new position\u201d, but said Australia would \u201cexpress its views through the foreign minister on that matter\u201d in the coming days. Morrison\u2019s visit to the Solomon Islands is the first by an Australian prime minister since 2008. On Monday he announced a $250m grants program for the country and an easier path for islanders to get work in Australia as part of Australia\u2019s attempts to counter China\u2019s increasing role in the Pacific. China is now the largest trading partner of the Solomon Islands, and is actively courting the country\u2019s leaders to abandon ties with Taiwan and join Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. The country\u2019s prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, has said he is reviewing the relationship with Taiwan. On Monday, Morrison refused to weigh in, saying it was a decision for the Solomon Islands. \u201cOur relationship, our family relationship with the Solomon Islands is to support them in the decisions that they take as an independent sovereign government and so they will work through their process on that issue,\u201d he said. The US has accused China of undermining stability on issues ranging from the South China Sea to Taiwan. On Monday Morrison warned against viewing China and US relations through a \u201cbinary prism\u201d. \u201cI think we have to be careful not to see what are ongoing and upgrading relationships here for Australia and the Pacific through those binary terms of the United States and China,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have their interests in the region, as do others. Our relationship with the Solomon Islands, our relationship with the Pacific transcends all of that. \u201cThere is a great risk and a great danger in an analysis that only can see the world through those \u2013 through such a binary prism. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t. Australia certainly doesn\u2019t. Australia welcomes the economic growth and advancement of China with their economy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An institute whose experts have occupied key positions on EU and UN regulatory panels is, in reality, an industry lobby group that masquerades as a scientific health charity, according to a peer-reviewed study. The Washington-based International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) describes its mission as \u201cpursuing objectivity, clarity and reproducibility\u201d to \u201cbenefit the public good\u201d. But researchers from the University of Cambridge, Bocconi University in Milan, and the US Right to Know campaign assessed over 17,000 pages of documents under US freedom of information laws to present evidence of influence-peddling. The paper\u2019s lead author, Dr Sarah Steele, a Cambridge university senior research associate, said: \u201cOur findings add to the evidence that this nonprofit organisation has been used by its corporate backers for years to counter public health policies. ILSI should be regarded as an industry group \u2013 a private body \u2013 and regulated as such, not as a body acting for the greater good.\u201d In a 2015 email copied to ILSI\u2019s then director, Suzanne Harris, and executives from firms such as Coca-Cola and Monsanto, ILSI\u2019s founder Alex Malaspina, a former Coca-Cola vice-president, complained bitterly about new US dietary guidelines for reducing sugar intake. \u201cThese guidelines are a real disaster!\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey could eventually affect us significantly in many ways; Soft drink taxations, modified school luncheon programs, a strong educational effort to educate children and adults to significanty [sic] limit their sugar intake,, curtail advertising of sugary foods and beverages and eventually a great pressure from CDC [the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention] and other agencies to force industry to start deducing [sic] drastically the sugar we add to processed foods and beverages.\u201d Malaspina \u2013 whom Coca-Cola describes as a \u201clongtime scientific and regulatory affairs leader\u201d \u2013 said he expected many nations to follow the new guidelines, adding: \u201cWe have to consider how to become ready to mount a strong defence.\u201d According to ILSI\u2019s declared mandatory principles, it \u201cmay not directly or indirectly propose public policy solutions or advocate the commercial interests of their member companies or other parties\u201d. Kristin DiNicolantonio, ILSI Global\u2019s communication director, told the Guardian that \u201cunder no circumstance does ILSI protect industry from being affected by disadvantageous policy and laws\u201d. The study, published on Monday in the journal Globalization and Health, found that when ILSI\u2019s regional offices failed to promote industry-friendly messaging, they were subjected to sanctions. In another email from 2015, Malaspina wrote: \u201cAbout the mess ILSI Mexico is in because they sponsored in September a sweeteners conference when the subject of soft drinks taxation was discussed. ILSI is now suspending ILSI Mexico, until they correct their ways. A real mess.\u201d Malaspina added that \u201cI hope we have now reached bottom [sic] and eventually we will recover as [far as] Coke and ILSI are concerned.\u201d ILSI says its Mexican affiliate was suspended for \u201cengaging in activities that can be construed to be policy advocacy\u201d. Around this time, ILSI was caught up in a separate controversy, when the Guardian revealed that ILSI Europe\u2019s vice-president Prof Alan Boobis chaired a UN panel that found glyphosate was probably not carcinogenic to humans. The final panel report included no conflict of interest statements, even though ILSI Europe had received donations of $500,000 (\u00a3344,234) fromMonsanto, which uses glyphosate in its RoundUp weedkiller, and $528,500 from its industry representative, Croplife International. Corporate figures from companies including Monsanto, Kraft and Nestl\u00e9 have sat on ILSI\u2019s board, although DiNicolantonio said they did so \u201cin an individual capacity\u201d. In 2012, the European parliament suspended funding to the European Food Safety Authority (Efsa) for six months over a string of conflicts of interest allegations involving ILSI members on its own board. A separate parliamentary inquiry into the group in 2017 contributed to new EU transparency rules. The food group Mars last year announced that it would break its ties with ILSI, whose work it described as \u201cadvocacy-led\u201d. But former and current ILSI officials continue to play key roles in the EU\u2019s science advisory mechanism, which recently produced a report that recommends a slew of industry positions on pesticides. These would, for example, replace current rules outlawing any products that could harm human health with a US-style concept of \u201cacceptable risk\u201d. A similar Efsa approach, the Threshold for Toxicological Concern published earlier this year, emerged from a working group in which the majority of experts had formal links to ILSI, according to the Pesticides Action Network Europe (PAN-E). The new threshold would allow \u201csafe levels of exposure\u201d for many chemicals which have not been fully tested for toxicity. PAN-E alleges that eight of the 12 EU pesticides risk assessments that it studied had their regulatory use \u201cdesigned and/or promoted\u201d by the industry. Over the course of 2015, a World Health Organization (WHO) move to distance itself from ILSI due to links between one of its members and the tobacco industryprovoked a degree of internal anxiety in ILSI, according to the new study. One email exchange between the University of Washington\u2019s Prof Adam Drewnowski and Malaspina led to suggestions of a direct approach to the WHO director, Margaret Chan. Drewnowski wrote that Chan had \u201csaid that she was ready to be \u2018at the table \u2013 but not in bed \u2013 with industry\u2019 (her own phrase). Since then, her position has hardened considerably. We should remind her of her own phrase and get her to the table.\u201d Malaspina later sent an email to senior ILSI and Coca-Cola officials, saying: \u201cWe must find a way of someone such as a famous scientist arrange to pay her [Chan] a visit. Jim Hill or someone of similar stature or a US government scientist.\u201d If a dialogue could not be started, Chan \u201cwill continue to blast us with significant negative consequences on a global basis\u201d, he continued. \u201cThis threat to our business is serious.\u201d In another email to Barbara Bowman, then the director of the CDC\u2019s Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention, Malaspina complained that the WHO \u201cnow do not want to work with industry [but] who finds all the new drugs.

Airports, seaports, industrial zones and power stations are all envisaged in a plan that has an emphasis on infrastructure, and is in some ways modelled on the Saudi 2030 plan for modernisation, as well as on countries in south-east Asia that have been transformed. Kushner hopes the presence in Bahrain of finance ministers, as opposed to foreign ministers, will lead to a more pragmatic reception there. The political section of the plan may have to be delayed until after the fresh Israeli elections in September, but the decision on its timing will be for Trump to make. Trump, a strong supporter of Benjamin Netanyahu, said he was not happy about the \u201cridiculous\u201d fresh elections, saying Israel was \u201call messed up\u201d. Kushner clearly hopes that the plan \u2013 likely to see an injection of as much as $50bn of mainly Gulf state cash into the region \u2013 will be seen as transformative enough that it will overpower those voices saying the plan does not meet traditional Arab demands for a two-state solution, a capital in East Jerusalem, a return to 1967 borders and Palestinian refugees\u2019 right of return.

Asked whether he understood why the Palestinians might not trust him, Kushner said: \u201cI\u2019m not here to be trusted,\u201d adding that he believed the Palestinian people would judge the plan on whether it improved their daily lives. Palestinian leaders both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have said they will boycott the Bahrain event since they were not consulted. China and Russia have also turned down invites. They see the whole initiative as a bribe to persuade the Palestinians to abandon their decades-old quest for political rights in return for an uncertain promise of a new economic future that has been made by politicians before. Kushner is clearly working hard to prepare the political ground for his plan, stressing his flexibility and willingness to listen to constructive criticism, but at the same time emphasising a fresh approach is required if his plan is to avoid the fate of innumerable previous failed plans. Kushner\u2019s critics claim he is misjudging the degree of popular Arab solidarity on the Palestinian issue by listening excessively to the Gulf monarchies in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates that combine opposition to the Muslim Brotherhood with an antipathy to Iran, and internal democracy. Jordan, already suffering an economic crisis, will be critical to the plan\u2019s reception, and seems increasingly alarmed at what it regards as Kushner\u2019s imbalance. Kushner is convinced that popular opinion is more flexible than that of some Palestinian leaders. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between the technocrats and \u2026 the people.\u201d While \u201cthe technocrats are focused on very technocratic things\u201d, a reference to traditional demands for political rights, \u201cwhen I speak to Palestinian people, what they want is they want the opportunity to live a better life. They want the opportunity to pay their mortgage.\u201d With Saudi Arabian cash a linchpin of his plan, Kushner is sidestepping questions about the US policy towards the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist murdered by a Saudi government hit squad in Turkey. Asked if he joined Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee in calling on the Saudi government to release his body (or identify where they put the body parts) so that his family might bury him, Kushner said: \u201cLook, it\u2019s a horrific thing that happened \u2026 Once we have all the facts, then we\u2019ll make a policy determination, but that would be up to the secretary of state to push on our policy.\u201d Kushner is a close ally of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and sees him as a genuine reformer pushing through women\u2019s rights at a pace that a conservative society can tolerate. The Axios interview also touched on Kushner\u2019s views on whether Trump is racist. Kushner denied the president was racist but would not be drawn on his views on Trump\u2019s \u201cbirtherism\u201d campaign against Barack Obama, in which Trump and others claimed Obama was born outside the US. \u201cI wasn\u2019t involved in that,\u201d he said several times, when asked if it was racist. He was similarly reticent when asked about Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to stop Muslims entering the US.",

      "bodyText": "If you glance at Australia\u2019s team sheet and think of the 2015 World Cup, not much has changed. Aaron Finch and David Warner still open the batting. Steve Smith takes one of the driving seats in the middle order. Glenn Maxwell comes after that to set up the late surge. And with the ball, Mitchell Starc and Patrick Cummins partner up for pace and more pace. All of the major pieces are still in places. But coming into the 2019 World Cup, the current setup was lacking a couple of important starting pieces. One was the way that Starc conducts himself at the start of a bowling innings. Another was Finch\u2019s equivalent for batting. Australia\u2019s first match against Afghanistan on Saturday suggested that both these problems have a chance of being solved.
