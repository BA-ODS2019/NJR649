      "bodyText": "Witnesses of a shooting in Darwin that left four people dead and a woman injured have described scenes of panic after the gunman went on an hour-long rampage. Northern Territory police arrested the suspected shooter, described as a Caucasian man aged 45, wearing high-vis workwear, on Tuesday night. He remained in hospital under police guard on Wednesday. Police said the suspected shooter was \u201cwell known to police\u201d and may have had links to motorcycle gangs. He had been released on parole in January and was wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet. Witnesses have described scenes of panic and carnage throughout the city as the gunman moved from scene to scene. The first reports of a man firing shots came at the Palms Motel just outside the Darwin city centre about 5.50pm. A man was killed at the motel before three other deaths occurred at the nearby Buff Club, Gardens Hill Crescent and an industrial site at Jolly Street in the suburb of Woolner. Jasmine Kielly and her partner, Brendon Ozanne, told the ABC they were staying at the Palms Motel after moving to Darwin only a week ago. \u201cI heard some loud banging \u2013 silly me went out the front to check,\u201d Kielly told the ABC. \u201cAs I\u2019ve gone down towards the stairs, I saw a man in a high-vis shirt walk out with a rifle. \u201cHe\u2019s turned to look at me and I\u2019ve run to the bedroom and locked the door and we hid in the bathroom and we called the police and just heard shot after shot after shot.\u201d Another witness, John Rose, told the ABC he had seen a man walk into the motel with a \u201csawn-off shotgun\u201d. \u201cHe shot up all the rooms and he went to every room looking for somebody and he shot them all up. Then we saw him rush out, jump into his Toyota pick-up, and rush off.\u201d While police have not yet detailed the gunman\u2019s exact movements, the shooting continued at the Gardens, an inner-city suburb in Darwin, where another man was killed and a woman was injured. A witness told the NT News she had been on the phone to the police when she saw the alleged gunman flee the scene. \u201cI was on the phone with the police and I said, \u2018He\u2019s gone right towards the Gardens,\u2019 and I just said that and the cops come and chased him that way,\u201d she said. Another Darwin resident, Matthew James, told Nine\u2019s Today program he had been standing in the car park of a motel when \u201call of a sudden there were these gunshots\u201d. \u201cMoments later someone came running towards me carrying this woman who was covered in blood and just basically put her at my feet and she was screaming that she had been shot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe guy that actually carried her up was pretty frantic at the time, saying he had opened the door and there was a gunman there with a shotgun and he proceeded to fire upon anybody inside the building. \u201cShe was caught up in it, she said, \u2018I\u2019ve been shot, I don\u2019t know why, I don\u2019t have anything to do with anything,\u2019\u201d he said. Witnesses described a fight breaking out at the Buffalo Club car park, where a man was believed to have died after a fight involving a knife and gun. The pub reportedly stayed open after the shooting. Another crime scene was established at an industrial site on Jolly Street in the suburb of Woolner. Johnny Reid was watching television at his worksite at about 6pm when the door of the unit he was sitting in was was knocked down by a man holding a shotgun, the NT News reports. \u201cHe busted in and looked right at me,\u201d he told the NT News. \u201cI looked at him and thought, \u2018Fuck, this is it.\u2019 I thought I was dead for sure. \u201cI asked him what he was doing but he went right past me and shot my mate. His body is still in there.\u201d The man was arrested after calling NT police and trying to enter police headquarters in what the police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, said on Tuesday may have been an attempt to hand himself in. Kershaw would not speculate on the man\u2019s motive on Tuesday but said it had not been a terrorist attack and that the shooter had \u201cacted individually\u201d. \u201cHe is an individual who is well known to police and has a number of interactions adverse with the police force, so he is well known to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI did speak this evening with the corrections commissioner; my information is around January of this year he was released on parole.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Conservatives are speeding up their leadership contest to set up a battle between two big name candidates within the next fortnight, with Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt most likely to make the final cut. Announcing the rule changes, the party said candidates must declare at least eight nominations from fellow Conservative MPs by Monday in a move that will knock out some of the lesser known hopefuls. All candidates will then need the votes of 17 Conservative MPs \u2013 at least 5% of the parliamentary party \u2013 to stay in the first round ballot and at least 33 \u2013 or 10% of Tory MPs\u2013 to stay in the second round of voting. Subsequent rounds will knock out the candidates with the least votes until a shortlist of two is left, in a process likely to take just two weeks with a final round of voting on 20 June. About 160,000 Conservative members will then cast their ballots on which of the two will be the next prime minister, with an announcement in the week beginning July 22. The new rules from the 1922 Committee benefit the more established candidates who have already built up support, with Johnson currently totalling almost 40 public endorsements from MPs. Gove and Hunt have about 30 public supporters each. There were at one stage 13 candidates who had declared they wanted to succeed Theresa May, with more expected to enter the race in the coming days, but two ministers, Kit Malthouse and James Cleverly, withdrew on Tuesday acknowledging they did not have enough support to make the final two. Cleverly said his candidacy had required MPs to take \u201ca leap of faith, [to] skip a generation and vote for a relatively new MP\u201d but that it was clear he did not have the backing of colleagues to progress. Malthouse said: \u201cThe last few days have demonstrated that there is an appetite for this contest to be over quickly and for the nation to have a new leader in place as soon as possible.\u201d Under the new structure, Rory Stewart, Mark Harper, Esther McVey, Andrea Leadsom, and Sam Gyimah are the most vulnerable of the remaining contenders to falling out at the first round. Matt Hancock, Dominic Raab and Sajid Javid have enough endorsements to clear the first hurdle but are some way off having 10% of Tory MPs \u2013 of 33 of their colleagues. However, at least 140 Conservative MPs are still to say who they are backing, with a large rump of Tory moderates and a smaller group of the most hardline Brexiters still holding back Some MPs had raised concerns about the number of hopefuls and time it would take to pick two leading candidates, but others are concerned that narrowing the field too fast could lead to a hasty decision without the views of the frontrunners being sufficiently tested. Under the previous rules, MPs would have cast rounds of votes with the least popular candidate dropping out until the number was reduced to the shortlist of two. With Johnson out in front, the race appears to be on for the second place on the ballot, with Gove and Hunt the most likely candidates. Hancock, who is pitching himself as a centre ground candidate who can take on Jeremy Corbyn, is giving a foreign policy speech on Wednesday, in which he will wade into the debate over whether the UK should be so dependent on the technology of Chinese firm Huawei He will say: \u201cThe question of whether we should have Chinese equipment on our 5G networks is asking the question the wrong way round. The question should be: why don\u2019t we have a home grown solution?\u201d Hunt will launch a campaign website and video on Wednesday, after having gained the unexpected backing of Liam Fox, the trade secretary, on Tuesday. Fox, one of the cabinet\u2019s most dedicated Brexiters, surprised some other leadership camps with his endorsement of Hunt, who has said pursuing no deal would be \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d because it would lead to a general election. Over the weekend, Johnson won the coveted endorsement of Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who had been touted to run herself, as well as that of the sacked former defence secretary Gavin Williamson. Mel Stride, the new leader of the House of Commons, is a backer of Gove, while Javid, the home secretary, won the support of the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, on Tuesday. David Gauke, the justice secretary, who has repeatedly cautioned against a no-deal Brexit, has endorsed Stewart, the international development secretary who was formerly a junior minister in his department. Stewart, who has ruled out pursuing a no-deal Brexit, has attracted media attention for his campaign, which has been based on social media videos of him meeting the public at short-notice events around the country. Several high-profile cabinet names are yet to declare who they will back, including the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, who has been one of the most vocal cabinet voices against leaving the EU without an agreement. Rudd\u2019s 60-strong group of One Nation Conservative MPs will hold the first of three hustings on Tuesday night for Tory candidates.",

There have been occasions when he has run riot at events like this, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jul/11/brexit-pmqs-nato-summit-trump-may-eu-countries-reimburse-us-for-defence-costs-trump-intensifies-criticism-of-nato-politics-live?page=with:block-5b462b41e4b0174534149a0a#block-5b462b41e4b0174534149a0a\">like the Nato summit in Brussels last year</a> or his last press conference with Theresa May,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jul/13/trump-trashes-mays-brexit-plans-and-hails-boris-johnson-as-future-pm-live?page=with:block-5b48c056e4b04dbcfcbe05e6#block-5b48c056e4b04dbcfcbe05e6\"> at Chequers last summer, </a>when he praised Boris Johnson, advised May to adopt a tougher stance over Brexit, and tried (only half-successfully) to wind back comments he made in an interview with the Sun saying the Chequers plan would scupper a UK-US trade deal. And there have been occasions when he has come over as unexpectedly emollient, as he was in the very first Trump/May press conference<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/27/donald-trump-and-theresa-may-hold-joint-white-house-press-conference-politics-live?page=with:block-588b91ede4b0b3e971af3836#block-588b91ede4b0b3e971af3836\"> in the White House in January 2017.</a></p> \n  <p>Today, he was on relatively good behaviour. True, at one point he made a completely ludicrous claim about there being thousands of people on the streets of London to welcome him yesterday, but it is as if lying about the size of crowds has become such a Trump trademark that it no longer seems particularly shocking. On the more substantive stuff, he sounded as if he was out to be helpful. He claimed that the Huawei row between the UK and the US was all but resolved - which may not be true (you can never be sure with Trump), but which may at least lower the temperature a bit in talks with Washington. He confirmed that he would like everything to be on the table in a UK-US trade deal, but it sounded as if he was coaxed into saying this, and it did not seem as if he was setting out to be provocative (even though to some he was - the quotes criticising him on this are already coming in). And, above all, he went out of his way to be complimentary about Theresa May - not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jul/13/trump-trashes-mays-brexit-plans-and-hails-boris-johnson-as-future-pm-live?page=with:block-5b48c056e4b04dbcfcbe05e6#block-5b48c056e4b04dbcfcbe05e6\">in an exaggerated way, like last year;</a> today he sounded more sincere, as if he were acting out of consideration, and perhaps even pity. This may well be the last full-on press conference that May holds as prime minister, and it was all rather valedictory.</p> \n  <p>Given that the UK will have a new prime minister in the next few weeks, what Trump had to say about May\u2019s potential successor was perhaps more important than anything he said about May. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt both got the thumbs up, but rather surprisingly, despite Michael Gove\u2019s hagiographic journalism (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/04/donald-trump-president-visit-uk-press-conference-may-visit-labour-calls-us-president-sexual-predator-and-racist-live-news?page=with:block-5cf658898f082f7da1f2d927#block-5cf658898f082f7da1f2d927\">12.54pm)</a>, Trump said he did not have a view about him. It felt a bit as if he was reserving judgment.</p> \n  <p>And he also sounded a lot more non-committal about Brexit than in the past. At his press conference with May in Washington in January 2017 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/27/donald-trump-and-theresa-may-hold-joint-white-house-press-conference-politics-live?page=with:block-588baa30e4b0860ce556955e#block-588baa30e4b0860ce556955e\">he said that Brexit was going to be a \u201cwonderful thing\u201d for the UK.</a> Today, while not criticising Brexit, he sounded more cautious about celebrating it. Perhaps even he is realising that it is all not as easy as Johnson and Gove promised.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa5ba47dfb507b76bf6bb5b8e90f1532be49646a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa5ba47dfb507b76bf6bb5b8e90f1532be49646a/0_194_5176_3106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Trump and Theresa May at their press conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Trump and Theresa May at their press conference.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-04T20:29:38.536Z\">at 9.29pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cf6761a8f082f7da1f2daa3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-04T13:46:52.746Z\">2.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Labour has put out this statement about Jeremy Corbyn requesting a meeting with Donald Trump.

Here\u2019s an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Ever since a Virginia farmer called George Washington launched his bid for glory, the British have had a tendency to underestimate American presidents. Especially Republicans. When Abraham Lincoln was in the White House, our government sympathised with the Confederacy. When Ronald Reagan was commander-in-chief, the British foreign policy establishment derided him as a trigger-happy cowboy who was in danger of pitching us into a third world war.</p> \n   <p>But no Republican, indeed no president, has come to office facing anything like the level of scorn and condescension from British politicians and commentators as Mr Trump. When we talked last Friday, however, he had nothing but kind words and generous sentiments for a nation he believes will be his strongest ally ...</p> \n   <p>He\u2019s no Kissinger and you\u2019d no more expect him to discuss Clausewitz and Kennan than set fire to his own hair. But intelligence takes many forms. And Mr Trump\u2019s number-rich analysis of defence spending reflects a businessman\u2019s ability to cut through jargon to get to the essentials of a case.</p> \n   <p>The same Trump who uses gladiatorial press conferences and CAPITALISED tweets to hurl huge crude blocks of rhetoric at opponents is also the master of the P&amp;L accounts and the determined negotiator who sees government as a failing corporation ripe for re-engineering ...</p> \n   <p>Mr Trump\u2019s conversation flows like a river in spate, overwhelming interruptions and objections, reflecting the force of nature that is the man. But it would be a mistake to think that he is all instinct and impulse. He wants to bring to governing the same calculating business style that he has brought to communicating. While he has been criticised for tweeting attacks on everyone from Meryl Streep to the civil rights hero John Lewis, he has no intention of abandoning Twitter because he believes it gives him a direct connection to the American people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-04T13:00:29.456Z\">at 2.00pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cf657988f087dd73466d9fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-04T11:37:28.258Z\">12.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More from my colleague<strong> Damien Gayle</strong> on why people are protesting against Trump.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/damiengayle/status/1135856240972783616\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"Today I am a [chlorinated] chicken.\"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GlobalJusticeUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GlobalJusticeUK</a> activist Jelly Cleaver, from Brixton, on why protesters against the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrumpUKVisit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TrumpUKVisit</a> don't want US trade deals after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rAmx3lhRZr\">pic.twitter.com/rAmx3lhRZr</a></p>\u2014 Damien Gayle (@damiengayle) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/damiengayle/status/1135856240972783616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 4, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/damiengayle/status/1135861231183679488\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"Trump is a beacon for neoliberalism and racist policies.

<strong>Theresa May</strong> have been holding roundtable talks with business leaders at St James\u2019s Palace.</p> \n  <p>According to the Press Association, Trump said the US was already the UK\u2019s largest trading partner and that he believed there was scope for further expansion. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think we will have a very, very substantial trade deal. This is something you want to do and my folks want to do.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He even suggested that May should rethink her decision to resign. He told her:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Stick around. Let\u2019s do this deal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>(Presumably that was intended as more of a joke than as a constructive suggestion.)</p> \n  <p>May said that there were \u201chuge opportunities\u201d for Britain and the US to work together in the future. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is a great partnership but I think a partnership we can take even further. Of course that is with a good bilateral trade deal.</p> \n   <p>I think there are huge opportunities for us to do more together in the future and challenges to work on as well.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"652dc536e5ae0ba74beb6491ee220a0b89f478ad\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/652dc536e5ae0ba74beb6491ee220a0b89f478ad/0_54_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May and Donald Trump hold a business breakfast meeting at St James\u2019s Palace, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May and Donald Trump hold a business breakfast meeting at St James\u2019s Palace, London</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Ireland/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-04T13:15:03.275Z\">at 2.15pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cf640d68f087dd73466d895\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/matthewweaver\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-04T10:00:31.962Z\">11.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A Chinese-made talking robot of Donald Trump sitting on a gold toilet has become the focal point of anti Trump protests in Trafalgar Square.<br></p> \n  <p>As<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/15/dumping-donald-trump-robot-being-sent-to-uk\"> the Guardian revealed last month,</a> the 4.9-metre (16ft) object depicts Trump with his trousers down, tweeting on the toilet, while his long red tie dangles into the bowl. It emits recordings of some of Trump\u2019s provocative sound bites including: \u201cno collusion\u201d, \u201ca witch-hunt\u201d, \u201cyou are fake news\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m a very stable genius.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Its creator,<strong> Don Lessem</strong>, a dinosaur expert from Philadelphia, travelled to London to mark the robot\u2019s debut at the protests.</p> \n  <p>Standing beside his creation he claimed comedy was the best way to defeating Trump. \u201cHumour is my weapon,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>The robot also makes a farting sound. Lessem said: \u201cThe fart we couldn\u2019t get from him so we had to use a generic fart.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Lessem said he had no problem getting the robot built in Sichuan and then shipped from China to the UK. He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The factory manager was shocked that we could make fun of our president without repercussions but had no fear of consequences for them in doing so. Trump is not on the Chinese government\u2019s list of favourites, and one of the first papers to pick up the Guardian\u2019s story was the South China News. Since the government keeps particularly close tabs on publications, it\u2019s a tacit indication that the robot is actually appreciated by Chinese authorities.</p> \n   <p>It was a debate as to how to categorise the robot for shipping purposes.

It argues that the firm is effectively controlled by the Chinese government, which could use Huawei technology to spy on Western communications. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/03/pompeo-raises-pressure-over-huawei-before-may-meets-trump\">It has warned that it might stop sharing intelligence with the UK if it allows Huawei a role in its 5G network.</a></p> \n  <p>The British government has not yet taken a final decision about what to do, but officials believe it is possible to allow Huawei a role in 5G without compromising security. <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/blog-post-security-complexity-and-huawei-protecting-uks-telecoms-networks\">This long blog,</a> written in February by <strong>Ian Levy,</strong> technical director at the National Cyber Security Centre, helps to explain why.</p> \n  <p>As my colleagues <strong>Dan Sabbagh </strong>and<strong> Patrick Wintour </strong>report <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/03/pompeo-raises-pressure-over-huawei-before-may-meets-trump\">in their story on this today, </a>there are also other reasons why Whitehall is sceptical of the US threat to turn off the supply of intelligence information if the UK offers contracts to Huawei. They write:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>British civil servants stressed that the UK had a unique architecture in its telecoms network, and the country could not simply take a decision to try to exclude itself from the long-term growth in Chinese economic influence.</p> \n   <p>They added that the chief priorities were protection of the UK-US intelligence relationship as well as a diversification of choice among network technology providers and and an increase in telecoms standards.</p> \n   <p>Other former Whitehall insiders said the next prime minister would have leverage to resist the US warnings. The US is reliant on UK signals intelligence for the targeting of missions in Syria and Iraq. The belief of British officials is that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">Trump administration</a> argument against Huawei is essentially economic, part of a growing battle over trade between the world\u2019s largest economy and China.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This morning<strong> Ben Wallace,</strong> the security minister, was on the Today programme discussing this issue. He said that, contrary to the impression given by a recent story in the Daily Telegraph, the government has not yet taken a final decision on this. (The Telegraph said the National Security Council had decided to allow Huawei a partial role in the 5G project, a leak that eventually led to Gavin Williamson being sacked as defence secretary, after May concluded he was responsible.)</p> \n  <p>But Wallace also said the issue of \u201cfair play\u201d would be an issue in the decision. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Alongside the technical questions is obviously the question of behaviour of a number of states. </p> \n   <p>We\u2019re British \u2013 we believe in fair play \u2013 and I think if we want to allow people access to our markets we have to say there are rules ... Not using the espionage to steal our intellectual property. </p> \n   <p>How do we maintain a level playing field and fair play that allows foreign investment, foreign access to our markets, and vice versa, but people don\u2019t exploit that goodwill to steal and cheat?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This sounded like Wallace was preparing an alternative justification for the UK taking a decision to exclude Huawei along the lines requested by the US. \u201dYou won\u2019t get the contract, not because our network would not be safe, but because of China\u2019s record on stealing intellectual property generally,\u201d (I paraphrase) \u2013 but it was hard to be sure.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c7d5eeeaa99cf0931767e675261eed3e2498e13\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c7d5eeeaa99cf0931767e675261eed3e2498e13/0_78_1704_1022/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Wallace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Wallace.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Stillwell/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-04T13:26:30.639Z\">at 2.26pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cf63a6b8f082f7da1f2d779\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-04T09:39:17.017Z\">10.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The White House pool has released details of Trump\u2019s gifts to the Queen and Prince Philip.

(Some of the time yesterday, even for relatively short journeys, Trump was being whisked across the capital by helicopter \u2013 like a senior politician visiting a war zone \u2013 and even when he was driven by car, the police kept the pavements clear out of fear that his convoy might get the milkshake treatment, or worse.)

Given that May will be out of office within a few weeks, it is hard to see the point, and Trump might have been better advised to spend his time talking to Boris Johnson, the clear favourite to succeed her. (It is still not clear whether or not Trump will meet Johnson during the downtime available in his schedule.) But even if the talks are stilted, the press conference is unlikely to be dull.</p> \n  <p>And, while Trump is meeting May, thousands of people are expected to be nearby in London protesting against him. They will include Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, who also chose to boycott last night\u2019s state dinner. This morning<strong> Emily Thornberry</strong>, the shadow foreign secretary, told the Today programme why Corbyn, who would be having to deal with Trump as prime minister if an early general election led to a Labour government, was taking this stance. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A state visit is an honour and we don\u2019t think this president deserves an honour. The truth is he has tried to close borders with Muslim-majority countries, he is caging small Mexican children, he has grabbed women and boasted about it. He is a sexual predator, he is a racist and it\u2019s right to say that \u2013 we need to think about when is it our country got so scared?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Thornberry also explained why Corbyn refused to go to a state dinner for Trump while he attended one for the president of China, a country with a far, far worse human rights record than the US. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When you have a close friend and they\u2019re going wrong, you are more likely to be adamant with them and clearer with them than someone who has not been as close a friend and someone you are trying to build a relationship up with.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She said Trump needed to be stood up to \u201clike the way you deal with a bully\u201d because \u201cif you bow down in front of them you just get kicked harder\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>9am:</em> Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the Commons and a Tory leadership candidate, holds a phone-in on LBC.</p> \n  <p><em>9.20am: </em>President Trump is due to arrive at Buckingham Palace.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s latest events: Perhaps the most significant development of the day was the joint press conference held by the US president, Donald Trump, and the UK prime minister, Theresa May. You can read a comprehensive summary of that here. Within hours, Trump would row back on one of his key claims. He also contradicted himself over comments he made on tape about Meghan Markle. Tory leadership hopefuls took part in their first hustings. Boris Johnson said the party faced an existential crisis over Brexit and, with his hand at the tiller, the UK would be steered out of the EU on 31 October \u2013 with or without a deal. Sajid Javid warned against trying to defeat the Brexit party by becoming it. Two candidates withdrew from the race, while the Tory party made it more difficult for outside bets to stand. Kit Malthouse and James Cleverly both bowed out, having attracted relatively little support. More than half of Change UK\u2019s MPs left the party. Once, they were 11. Now, only five remain. They have vowed to fight on under the leadership of Anna Soubry. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleague Rowena Mason has the full story: Trump, who met the Brexit party leader Nigel Farage this afternoon, also told the programme he felt it inappropriate to meet the leader of the official opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, who had requested a meeting and who also spoke at a rally protesting the state visit. I don\u2019t know [Corbyn]. He wanted to meet. It was very tough to meet and probably inappropriate to meet to be honest with you. A lot of things are happening right now with respect to our country. Your country, my country \u2013 let\u2019s call them almost the same because I feel that way, it\u2019s really a tremendous relationship. So I didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to me him but I would. I certainly would. I have no problem with it. Donald Trump is rowing back on his claim that the NHS was \u201con the table\u201d in post-Brexit deal negotiations. At a joint press conference with Theresa May this afternoon, he said: When you\u2019re dealing on trade, everything is on the table. So, NHS or anything else. A lot more than that. Those comments were met with immediate condemnation from several Tory leadership hopefuls, as well as senior Labour politicians. This evening, ITV News reports that the US president has now told Good Morning Britain: I don\u2019t see it being on the table. Somebody asked me a question today and I said everything is up for negotiation, because everything is. But that\u2019s something I would not see as part of trade. That\u2019s not trade. Trump\u2019s ambassador to London, Woody Johnson, has previously said the US will want access to the NHS as part of a trade deal. The former cabinet minister, Nicky Morgan, one of the leading figures in the One Nation group that\u2019s holding tonight\u2019s Tory leadership hustings, has said Boris Johnson was \u201csubdued\u201d and showed his serious side. She said he told MPs that, if Brexit was delayed again, there was a risk the \u201crelevance\u201d of the 2016 referendum result \u201cstarts to wane\u201d. Asked about Johnson\u2019s warning about the future of the party, Morgan said: I think we all know that the stakes are very high. Donald Trump has acknowledged that he referred to Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, as \u201cnasty\u201d on the eve of his state visit to the UK \u2013 contradicting his earlier claim he had not done so, which was itself a contradiction of an audio recording of him doing so. The US president made the original comments in an interview with the Sun newspaper; an audio recording of which the paper published. The journalist asked him if he was aware that Meghan had \u201cnot so nice\u201d about him during his election campaign. He replied: \u201cNo, I did not know that she was nasty.\u201d Later, Trump tweeted: Speaking to Good Morning Britain on Tuesday, he said: They said some of the things that she said and It\u2019s actually on tape. And I said: \u2018Well, I didn\u2019t know she was nasty\u2019. I wasn\u2019t referring to \u2018she\u2019s nasty\u2019. I said she was nasty about me. And essentially I didn\u2019t know she was nasty about me. The US president added: \u201cYou know what? She\u2019s doing a good job, I hope she enjoys her life... I think she\u2019s very nice.\u201d Trump said he had spoken to Prince Harry during his visit. \u201cI congratulated him and I think he\u2019s a terrific guy. The royal family is really nice.\u201d He said he had not discussed the issue with Prince Harry. I was going to because it was so falsely put out there. And when you see that transcript and you see, it\u2019s the exact opposite of what they said. Did you look at the transcript? The Tory leadership hopeful, Andrea Leadsom, is understood to have told tonight\u2019s hustings that she has a three-point plan to deliver Brexit \u2013 the \u201cmost urgent priority of the next prime minister\u201d. I offer decisive leadership focused on the strength of our nation on the world stage, and delivering the opportunity for every individual to fulfil their aspirations and become the very best they can be. She told MPs she would kill off the withdrawal agreement and leave the EU on 31 October without a deal. And she set out three steps she said would be necessary in doing so: I will introduce a citizens rights bill to give certainty to UK citizens living in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK to lift the weight of uncertainty from their shoulders. I will also introduce an EU departure provisions bill which will agree areas such as sovereign bases and Gibraltar, our security relationship, data adequacy and air transport. Areas which are already agreed and welcomed by both sides. I will massively ramp up preparations for leaving with a managed exit at the end of October. I will speed up work on alternative arrangements for the Northern Ireland border and look at specific arrangements for just-in-time supply chains and agrifoods. This will give business the certainty it needs. Preparations will be completely transparent with regular updates to parliament. A delegation of ministers will be sent to talk directly with the EU27 heads of government about the wide range of measures the UK is taking to prepare for leaving on 31 October. It will be for the EU27 to decide what steps they want to accept. The UK would convene a summit in early September in Ireland or Northern Ireland to bring together the EU Council and the proposed new EU commissioners who were willing to grasp the issue ahead of the UK\u2019s exit. It is unclear for the moment how Leadsom plans to win over the Commons, where there has been no majority for a no-deal Brexit. She also set out other priorities. She proposes a cross-party commission on social care, \u201csupported by specialists in the field and members of the public. It will be tasked with producing a solution for social care provision that will last generations, regardless of who is in government\u201d. On the subject of the climate crisis, she said: I am proud of the Paris agreement and I will sign up to the Committee on Climate Change target of 0% target emissions by 2050. I will bid for the UK to host the UN Climate Change Conference in 2020. I will support our industrial strategy to promote clean energy, jobs and skills. Our overseas development aid will support decarbonisation overseas. Boris Johnson has told the hustings: The way to win in any seat is to stop banging on about Brexit and put that bawling baby to bed, pacify it and recapture the political agenda with one nation Conservatism. Gavin Williamson, the former defence secretary and a supporter of Johnson, said there was now a \u201cdawning realisation\u201d among Tory MPs that \u201cBoris is the only one who is going to be able to save the party\u201d. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall have arrived at Winfield House, the US ambassador\u2019s residence in Regent\u2019s Park, for dinner with the US president and his wife. Charles and Trump shared a joke as they stood at the entrance of the house for photographs. The UK\u2019s prime minister and foreign secretary are among the guests. The frontrunner, Boris Johnson, has been addressing Tory MPs, telling them a second Brexit referendum would be divisive and he would be \u201cagainst it with every fibre of my body\u201d. He ruled out a coalition with the Brexit party and said Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour was \u201cthe weakest official opposition in a generation\u201d. On Brexit, he claimed the so-called Brady amendment to replace the Irish backstop was the only plan that had the support of the Commons. But he added that the government must be ready for a no-deal Brexit if necessary. Johnson may have a point about backing for the Brady amendment, which MPs narrowly passed back in January. But the EU showed no willingness to even consider playing along. My colleague, Rowena Mason, quotes Johnson as telling the MPs: We are looking at a very difficult situation and we must get ready, eventually but not immediately, to beat Jeremy Corbyn and put Farage back in his box. We are facing an existential crisis and will not be forgiven if we do not deliver Brexit on 31 Oct. I believe I am best placed to lift this party, beat Jeremy Corbyn and excite people about conservatism and conservative values. We need to realise the depth of the problems we face \u2013 unless we get on and do this thing (Brexit), we will be punished for a very long time. There is a very real choice between getting Brexit done and the potential extinction of this great party but I believe I can take on Farage and win back the voters being won over by him. Johnson also ruled out calling a general election. Trump has been meeting various pro-Brexit figures, including the two former cabinet ministers, Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson, and the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage. The US president has also been the object of protests, including in Edinburgh, Glasgow and London. Duncan Smith and Farage both made clear the process of the UK leaving the European Union was on the president\u2019s mind during their discussions. A spokesman for the former Tory leader said the meeting had \u201cbeen in the offing for a while\u201d. It covered a \u201cwhole range of subjects including Brexit\u201d, he added. It is reported that Paterson and Duncan Smith held talks on behalf of the hard Brexit-supporting Tory backbench group, the ERG: On his LBC show, Farage claimed that \u201cmost people will agree yesterday went very, very well [for Trump]\u201d, adding that the president himself \u2013 who claimed not to have seen protests against him \u2013 was pleased with it. Farage added: Clearly, it was a private meeting but what I can say is he was in top form, he was ebullient. He absolutely believes in Brexit, thinks it\u2019s the right thing for the country to do. He\u2019s obviously concerned it\u2019s taking a very long time. In Edinburgh, however, a crowd attended an anti-Trump demonstration, which was addressed by the Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard and others. He told the audience: We say: \u2018no to war, yes to peace, no to Trump, yes to the citizens of America\u2019. Crowds gathered outside St Giles Cathedral, despite showers, to join the demonstration. Many were holding placards: People also gathered outside Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. Many held placards from Stand Up To Racism and the Unison union, with speakers on the Buchanan Street steps criticising comments made by the US president. One person held aloft a homemade sign saying: \u201cTrump - Feed Him To The Corgis.\u201d As the rain came down on the crowds, those gathered were encouraged to chant slogans such as \u201cDonald Trump, off our streets\u201d and \u201cSay it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\u201d. And, in London, Sian Bahia has been speaking to some of the demonstrators. Katie Greene, a 45-year-old teacher, said: Trump is a misogynist, he is racist, he is rude and we don\u2019t like him. I was disgusted when it was announced that he is receiving a state visit \u2013 it\u2019s terrible. Even before he landed, he was being rude about our mayor. He should keep his nose right out of British politics. Doreen Witter, who is 64 and a student, said: I do not like anything that comes out of Trump\u2019s mouth. It doesn\u2019t surprise me that he\u2019s supporting Farage and [Boris] Johnson; all they care about is being a celebrity. Trump, you and your family should go home. The first hustings of the Tory leadership contest is being held this evening. More than 80 of the party\u2019s MPs are packed into a Commons committee room, though no journalists \u2013 they\u2019ve been shut out. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, has told the assembled MPs: If we make the wrong choice in this leadership election we could end up with a leader who thinks the way to lead is to exploit division. He warned that, if the party doesn\u2019t evolve, \u201cvoters will go for change in the form of Corbyn\u201d. And he added: If we make the wrong choice in this leadership election, we could end up with a leader who thinks the way to lead is to exploit division. Javid received a warm response, with banging of tables heard from outside, after telling the MPs: \u201cWe will not beat the Brexit Party by becoming the Brexit Party.\u201d The Conservatives have agreed to a rule change that will raise the threshold for those wishing to stand for the party\u2019s leadership \u2013 as 11 candidates vie for the role. The 1922 Committee, which represents backbench Tory MPs, and the Conservative Party Board met today to agree the changes and have announced a schedule for the contest. In short, candidates will have from 10am to 5pm next Monday to formally enter the race. They\u2019ll need a proposer and a seconder, as well as the support of six other MPs. A process of ballots among MPs will follow over the next fortnight, with the lowest-ranked falling out at each stage. Any candidate failing to secure the support of at least 5% (in effect, 16 votes) at the first stage on 13 June, will be eliminated. At the second, on 18 June, they will require at least 10% (or 32 votes). Further ballots are scheduled for the following two days and the process will be repeated until only two candidates remain. They will then face the party\u2019s membership, who\u2019ll decide the next leader. Once the parliamentary process is completed, CCHQ will assume responsibility for the administration of hustings and the vote of the Conservative party membership. This stage of the process will be completed in the week beginning Monday 22nd July, with the first membership hustings planned for the 22ndJune. Further details will be published in due course. \u2022 This entry was amended on 5 June 2019 because an earlier version misnamed the 1922 Committee as the 1992 Committee. This has been corrected. Earlier, we reported that six of Change UK\u2019s 11 MPs had decided to leave the party (see: 4.14pm). The remaining five \u2013 Anna Soubry, Chris Leslie, Ann Coffey, Mike Gapes and Joan Ryan \u2013 have now released a statement saying they plan to fight on with Soubry as their leader. Challenging the established political parties was never going to be easy. But we remain determined to fix Britain\u2019s broken politics and we are in this for the long haul. You may have heard the news that some of our MPs group have decided to leave Change UK, which is saddening and disappointing just at the moment we need to roll up our sleeves, challenge the Brexit emergency and champion sensible evidence-based policy-making in the face of the main parties drifting to the ideological fringes. We regret their decision, but it is vital we continue to lead and look forward to future elections \u2013 and get started on building our policies and party across the country. We have a responsibility to our amazing European election candidates and 100,000 supporters and the near-600,000 people who voted for us \u2013 as well as a duty to the country \u2013 to continue this task. The British people need more than regrets about the state of our politics, they need solutions. We are delighted that Anna Soubry has taken on the role as our new leader, and our hope is to quickly broaden out our nationwide leadership to include some of our key supporters and activists from across the country. Change UK doesn\u2019t just belong to MPs. It belongs to the country and those looking for a sense of hope and leadership to genuinely change our politics, not simply settle for the existing party status quo. We hope that you agree this is a cause worth fighting for \u2013 and we will need your help and support going forward. While British politics slips into chaos around us, now is the time to stand firm in our beliefs and champion the mainstream centre ground values we articulated when we left our former parties in the first place. Nigel Farage is not the only Brexiter who has been to the US ambassador\u2019s resident to meet President Trump this afternoon. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, and Owen Paterson, the Conservative former environment secretary, have both seen the president. They were photographed leaving. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. Piers Morgan, a friend of Donald Trump\u2019s since he appeared on Trump\u2019s US show Celebrity Apprentice, has interviewed the US president for Good Morning Britain, the ITV show he now co-presents. Kit Malthouse has withdrawn from the Tory leadership contest. In his statement explaining why, he does not quite say he had no realistic chance of winning - the explanation offered by James Cleverly this morning when he announced he was withdrawing his own candidacy. (See 11.32am.) Instead he argued that a relative unknown like himself (someone from \u201ca new generation\u201d) could only win if there were a lengthy contest but that he accepted the party wanted this contest over as soon as possible. In the ConservativeHome tally this morning, Malthouse had just six declared supporters - two more than Cleverly. There are still 11 contenders left in the field. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has tweeted about his meeting this afternoon with President Trump. Here are the main points from the Trump/May press conference. Donald Trump, the US president, confirmed that the US would want to include access to the NHS market in any US-UK trade talks. Woody Johnson, the US ambassador, said this at the weekend, and Trump was asked if he agreed with Johnson that the entire economy should be on the table in trade talks, including the NHS. He replied: I think everything with a trade deal is on the table. When you\u2019re dealing in trade, everything is on the table - so NHS or anything else, a lot more than that, but everything will be on the table, absolutely. But, as my colleague Patrick Wintour points out, Theresa May had to explain to Trump what the NHS was. In response, Theresa May pushed back, saying that there would only be a deal if both sides agreed. The point in making trade deals is of course that both sides negotiate and come to an agreement about what should or should not be in that trade deal for the future. Trump\u2019s answer has generated a row, with both Labour and Tory politicians insisting that the NHS would not be included in a potential US-UK trade deal. (See 3.53pm and 4.04pm.) But Sam Lowe, a trade expert at the Centre for European Reform, reckons that the whole row is a red herring because US trade deals never oblige governments to privatise public services like the NHS in the ways critics claim this deal might. Trump withdrew the US threat to stop sharing intelligence with the UK because of its policy over Huawei and 5G, claiming that the two countries now agreed on this issue. Asked if the US would impose limits on intelligence-sharing if the UK used Huawei infrastructure, he replied: No, because we\u2019re gonna have absolutely an agreement on Huawei and everything else. We have an incredible intelligence relationship and we will be able to work out any differences. We did discuss it - I see absolutely no limitations, we\u2019ve never had limitations. This is a truly great ally and partner and we\u2019ll have no problem with that. The Telegraph\u2019s Ben Riley-Smith claims this is a win for May. But it is not clear what the \u201cagreement\u201d is that Trump was referring to, because Downing Street said this matter was still being reviewed. Trump criticised Jeremy Corbyn as a \u201cnegative force\u201d and said the Labour leader had requested a meeting with him - despite boycotting the state banquet held in Trump\u2019s honour. Asked about Corbyn, Trump said: [Corbyn] wanted to meet today or tomorrow and I decided I would not do that. I think he is, from where I come from, somewhat of a negative force. I think the people should look to do things correctly as opposed to criticise. I really don\u2019t like critics as much as I like and respect people who get things done - so I decided not to meet. Trump backed Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt as candidates for next prime minister, but claimed he did not know what Michael Gove would be like. He said: I know Boris. I like him. I have liked him for a long time. I think he would do a very good job. I know Jeremy, I think he would do a very good job. I don\u2019t know Michael - would he do a good job? Tell me. Trump defended his decision to criticise Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London. He said: I think he has been a not very good mayor from what I understand. He has done a poor job, crime is up, a lot of problems, and I don\u2019t think he should be criticising a representative of the US that can do so much good for the UK ... He should be positive not negative - he is a negative force not a positive force. If you look at what he said, he hurts the people of this great country and I think he should actually focus on his job, it would be a lot better if he did that - he could straighten out some of the problems that he has caused. He said that May deserved \u201ca lot of credit\u201d for her work on Brexit. He said a deal was now \u201cteed up\u201d. He said: I think it will happen and I believe the prime minister has brought it to a very good point where something will take place in the not-too-distant future. I think she\u2019s done a very good job. He said Brexit \u201cprobably should happen\u201d - but he refused to say Britain should definitely leave at the end of October with or without a deal. Asked if the UK should go ahead and leave the UK on 31 October without a deal, he refused to answer, implying that he had not been following the issue in enough detail. On Brexit generally, he said: I would think that it will happen and it probably should happen. This is a great, great country and it wants its own identity ... I believe it would be good for the country, yes. In the past Trump was much more positive about Brexit, telling a press conference with May in January 2017 that it would be \u201ca wonderful thing\u201d for Britain. He claimed (falsely - see 3.49pm) that thousands of people had been cheering him on the streets of London. Asked about the protests, he said: We left the prime minister, the Queen, the royal family, there were thousands of people on the streets cheering. Even coming over today there were thousands of people cheering. Then I heard there were protests, I said \u2018Where are the protests? I don\u2019t see any protests\u2019. I did see a small protest today when I came - very small - so a lot of it is fake news I hate to say. He said Nato countries should spend more on defence if they were not meeting the 2% target. Nato countries are supposed to spend 2% of GDP on defence. Trump said: The United Kingdom is also a key partner in Nato. The prime minister and I agree that our Nato allies must increase their defence spending. They have no choice, they must fulfil their obligations. Nigel Farage has arrived at the US ambassador\u2019s residence for a meeting with Donald Trump, Reuters is reporting. And here is the picture. Earlier my colleagues Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot reported that Change UK, the new party set up by eight Labour MPs and three Tories after they left their respective parties, was about to split. (See 12.26pm.) Heidi Allen, who was Change UK\u2019s interim leader, has now put out a statement confirming this. Six of the party\u2019s 11 MPs are leaving to sit as independents. Jeremy Corbyn claims that the NHS would end up up for sale under the \u201cno-deal disaster capitalism plans\u201d for a trade deal with the US championed by Tory leadership contenders. (See 3.53pm.) But Dominic Raab, one of the most rightwing leadership contenders, and one of those most relaxed about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, says Corbyn is wrong. And Matt Hancock, the current health secretary and another leadership contender, is saying the same thing. Yesterday Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and another leadership contender, said he agreed with Hancock on this issue. And Sam Gyimah, the leadership contender seen as having the least chance of winning, also says the NHS should not be on the table in a US-UK trade deal. This is from Jeremy Corbyn on the Trump/May press conference. This is from the BBC\u2019s James Cook. The Daily Mirror\u2019s political editor, Pippa Crerar, thinks Labour should have admitted that President Trump refused to meet Jeremy Corbyn before Trump said so at this press conference. This is from the Toronto Star\u2019s Daniel Dale, confirming the point I made earlier about President Trump\u2019s lying about crowd sizes being habitual. Donald Trump is famously unpredictable, but that does not mean he always causes mayhem at a news conference (which would make him too easy to predict). There have been occasions when he has run riot at events like this, like the Nato summit in Brussels last year or his last press conference with Theresa May, at Chequers last summer, when he praised Boris Johnson, advised May to adopt a tougher stance over Brexit, and tried (only half-successfully) to wind back comments he made in an interview with the Sun saying the Chequers plan would scupper a UK-US trade deal. And there have been occasions when he has come over as unexpectedly emollient, as he was in the very first Trump/May press conference in the White House in January 2017. Today, he was on relatively good behaviour. True, at one point he made a completely ludicrous claim about there being thousands of people on the streets of London to welcome him yesterday, but it is as if lying about the size of crowds has become such a Trump trademark that it no longer seems particularly shocking. On the more substantive stuff, he sounded as if he was out to be helpful. He claimed that the Huawei row between the UK and the US was all but resolved - which may not be true (you can never be sure with Trump), but which may at least lower the temperature a bit in talks with Washington. He confirmed that he would like everything to be on the table in a UK-US trade deal, but it sounded as if he was coaxed into saying this, and it did not seem as if he was setting out to be provocative (even though to some he was - the quotes criticising him on this are already coming in). And, above all, he went out of his way to be complimentary about Theresa May - not in an exaggerated way, like last year; today he sounded more sincere, as if he were acting out of consideration, and perhaps even pity. This may well be the last full-on press conference that May holds as prime minister, and it was all rather valedictory. Given that the UK will have a new prime minister in the next few weeks, what Trump had to say about May\u2019s potential successor was perhaps more important than anything he said about May. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt both got the thumbs up, but rather surprisingly, despite Michael Gove\u2019s hagiographic journalism (see 12.54pm), Trump said he did not have a view about him. It felt a bit as if he was reserving judgment. And he also sounded a lot more non-committal about Brexit than in the past. At his press conference with May in Washington in January 2017 he said that Brexit was going to be a \u201cwonderful thing\u201d for the UK. Today, while not criticising Brexit, he sounded more cautious about celebrating it. Perhaps even he is realising that it is all not as easy as Johnson and Gove promised. Labour has put out this statement about Jeremy Corbyn requesting a meeting with Donald Trump. A spokesman said: Jeremy Corbyn proposed a meeting with Donald Trump during the president\u2019s visit. Jeremy is ready to engage with the president on a range of issues, including the climate emergency, threats to peace and the refugee crisis. Labour sources are confirming that Jeremy Corbyn did request a meeting with President Trump, as he revealed in the press conference. (See 2.25pm.) Q: [To May] Do you think a deal on Brexit is possible? Would it have made a difference if you had followed Trump\u2019s advice on what to do? May says she still thinks it is in the best interests of the UK to leave the EU with a deal. It will be for whoever succeeds her to take this forward. She says Trump advised her to sue. She decided not to. She negotiated and got a good deal. Trump says he would have sued. \u201cBut it\u2019s okay,\u201d he says. He says he may have settled. He says May has done a good job. Q: [To Trump] What did you say in your conversation with Boris Johnson? And will you meet Michael Gove? Trump says he knows Johnson and likes him. And he knows Jeremy Hunt and likes him too. But he does not know Gove, he says. Trump endorses Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt as possible successors to Theresa May. But he says he does not know Michael Gove. And that\u2019s it. I will post a verdict, summary and reaction shortly. Trump says Mexico should stop millions of people entering the US illegally. Mexico can do this, he says. If Mexico does not, the US will keep increasing tariffs. He says he does not want to believe that Mexico is run by drug cartels. Q: [To Trump] Should everything be on the table in the talks on a UK-US trade deal? Trump says \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d in the talks. But May says there will only be a deal if both sides agree. Q: [To May] Will you take Trump\u2019s advice and stay on? \u201cNice try\u201d, says May. She says she is a woman of her word. Q: Should the UK leave the EU on 31 October with or without a deal? Trump suggests he has not been following this closely. But he thinks the UK should leave. He claims May has brought the UK to a very good point in this regard. Trump says May has brought the UK to a \u201cgood point\u201d in the Brexit negotiation. Q: Will you refuse the UK intelligence because of its involvement with Huawei? Trump says this will not be a problem because the UK and the US will reach an agreement on what to do about Huawei. Trump says the US and the UK will reach an agreement about a joint approach to Huawei. They are now taking questions. Q: [To Trump] What would you say to Jeremy Corbyn? Could you do a trade deal with him? Trump says he does not know Corbyn. Corbyn wanted to meet with him today or tomorrow. He decided not to meet Corbyn, he says. He says he sees Corbyn as a \u201cnegative force\u201d. Trump claims Corbyn requested a meeting with him. Trump turned Corbyn down, he says. He describes him as a \u201cnegative force\u201d. Corbyn has been critical of him, he says. He says he does not like people who are critical. On the subject of the protests, Trump says there were \u201cthousands of people\u201d on the streets cheering him yesterday. And again today. He says he did not see protesters yesterday. He says he saw some today, but it was a very small group. The reports of the protests have been \u201cfake news\u201d. Trump claims \u201cthousands\u201d of people have been on the streets in London cheering him. (This is not true.) Q: [To May] Do you agree with Trump that Sadiq Khan is a stone cold loser? Trump replies to this. He says Khan has been a poor mayor. He is a negative force. He should focus on dealing with the problems he faces, Trump says. Trump says he is looking forward to agreeing a \u201cphenomenal\u201d trade deal with the UK. He says he will be visiting the Churchill War Rooms later. And he ends by paying tribute to Theresa May, saying she is a professional, and that it has been a pleasure working with her. Trump says all members of the Nato alliance \u201cmust fulfill their obligations\u201d. They have no choice. They must fulfill their obligations. Trump says Nato members who are not hitting the 2% target must increase defence spending. President Trump is speaking now. He starts by saying how much he appreciated the state banquet last night and the Queen\u2019s hospitality. Turning to D-day, he praises the way American and British soldiers worked together. He thanks Britain for its contribution to the fight against Islamic State (although he uses the term Isis). May says the events in Portsmouth tomorrow will celebrate the Nato alliance. She says the alliance between the UK and the US is just as strong as it was 75 years ago. She ends by shaking hands with Trump. (Someone is clearly worried by handshakegate. See 1.14pm and 1.31pm.) May summarises what she and Trump spoke about in their talks this morning. Cooperation had deepened on security, she says. And their economies too are more tightly bound together. Some 1 million Americans work for British companies, and 1 million Britons work for American companies, she says. She says she and Trump agreed they wanted an ambitious trade agreement after Brexit, and from their talks today she knows they are still committed to this. Theresa May is speaking now. She says this week we commemorate D-day, 75 years ago. The British and Americans have been historic partners, she says. They have shared values, and those values will endure for the next 75 years and beyond, she says. That is why she is so pleased to welcome President Trump to the UK. She says for the last two years she and Trump have been the guardians of this friendship. She reminds the audience who they have worked together, particularly when the US expelled Russian diplomats after the Salisbury attack and in responding to the use of chemical weapons in Syria. (From my office in the Commons, with the windows open, we can hear the anti-Trump protest getting much louder.) From CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein From NBC\u2019s Bill Neely Donald Trump and Theresa May are now walking from No 10 to the Foreign Office, which is just the other side of Downing Street, followed by their spouses. From the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar From Ben Riley-Smith, the Telegraph\u2019s US editor The Trump-May press conference is starting very soon. This is from the New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman. Just a few hundred United Against Trump protesters were in Parliament Square just before 1.30pm, where some were engaged in a confrontation with pro-Trump supporters who had come out to welcome the president and counter the demonstration against his presence in London. Bob Marley tracks played quietly from a mobile stage in front of Westminster Abbey and political groups had stalls set up around the perimeter of the square, but it appeared as though the Parliament Square rally had been abandoned. As the Guardian made its way to the area, along Embankment, many people were walking the opposite direction, back towards Whitehall. Political debate between pro- and anti-Trump protesters did not manage to surpass name calling, with one man\u2019s chant of \u201cStop Trump\u201d met with \u201cBye bye EU\u201d, and an anti-Trump protester telling one man to \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d. Among those welcoming Trump to London was Lorraine Chappell, a retiree from London who wore a union flag as a scarf and carried a placard saying \u201cWelcome President Trump\u201d. She said: I\u2019m protesting today to welcome Donald Trump to London because America is our greatest ally and Donald Trump is a strong leader. I\u2019m hoping [the UK will] do trade deals with the USA post-Brexit and he\u2019s here today on the invitation of the Queen and these people should show some respect. On the protesters, Chappell said: It\u2019s disgusting, it\u2019s absolutely disgusting. I\u2019m sure they are happy to go and have their holidays in America, but they are not happy to support its president. If the Queen went and [the Americans] made a balloon of the Queen we would be horrified. America helped us to win the war. At the end of the day, without them we would all be speaking German by now. We are in the minority, we know, and that\u2019s why we came out here today. I don\u2019t know what the Americans must think of this country if they saw what\u2019s going on today. You can love him [Trump] or you can hate him, but you should show him respect. Here is another anti-Trump protester in London explaining why she is demonstrating. And here are some pictures of Jeremy Corbyn speaking in Whitehall. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking at the anti-Trump demonstration in Whitehall. He welcomes the diversity of the crowd. Addressing complaints about his decision to boycott the state banquet last night, he says he is not refusing to meet anyone. He would be willing to talk to President Trump, he says. But he condemns Trump for his attack on Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London. He says he is very proud to have a Muslim as mayor of London. Corbyn restates his opposition to racism. He says he would never accept a trade deal that ended up with the NHS being up for sale. He adds the NHS must stay free at the point of deliver. He also criticises Trump\u2019s record on refugees, and says refugees should never be treated as enemies. They are fellow human beings, he says. From there, he moves on to war and reminds the audience that he opposed the Iraq war in 2003. (At this point he is moving away from Trump, to an extent \u2013 Trump also says the Iraq war was a mistake.) Corbyn ends by saying that a few weeks ago the Commons voted for a motion saying the UK was facing a climate emergency. And he says \u201cprotest and activism\u201d eventually lead to change. More from the venue for the May-Trump press conference. More on handshakegate. (See 1.14pm.) To me, the explanation that you do not shake hands with someone you shook hands with at a meeting an hour or so earlier seems perfectly sound. That\u2019s the No 10 explanation. But the White House pool has offered a different take. The pool reporter says: To clarify on handshakes, PM May shook hands with FLOTUS and greeted POTUS but did not shake hands with him as FLOTUS was reaching across to shake Philip May\u2019s hand. For anyone who has never watched West Wing, POTUS stands for president of the United States and FLOTUS for first lady of the United States. There has been some interest on social media in the fact that, when Trump arrived at Downing Street, he did not shake Theresa May\u2019s hand \u2013 even though he did shake hands with her husband. But the encounter took place shortly after May and Trump attended a business breakfast together at St James\u2019s Palace (see 11.10am), where they did shake hands. \u201cOne only shakes another\u2019s hand once in a day,\u201d said a No 10 source, quite reasonably. President Trump will be visiting the Churchill War Rooms in Whitehall later with Theresa May, the White House pool is reporting. Melania Trump and Philip May will attend too. But Boris Johnson will not be going. At one stage, when the state visit was being planned, there was talk of Johnson giving Trump a tour because Johnson has written a biography of Churchill and is seen as something of an expert. But that might have to wait for another day ... According to the Daily Mirror, Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary and favourite in the contest to succeed Theresa May, has had a \u201cfriendly\u201d 20-minute conversation with President Trump. But Johnson turned down an invitation to meet Trump tonight because he is due to attend a private hustings organised by One Nation Tories in the Commons, the Mirror reports. According to Owen Bennett, the journalist who is publishing a biography of Michael Gove next month, Gove was rather more critical of Donald Trump before his election as president than he was when he interviewed him a few weeks later for the Times. (See 12.54pm.) Judging by the interview that President Trump gave to the Sun and the Sunday Times before he came to the UK, his view of people tends to be shaped to a considerable extent by whether or not they have praised him. (\u201cI think Boris [Johnson] would be excellent. I like him. I have always liked him ... He has been very positive about me and our country.\u201d) On that basis, Trump\u2019s meeting with Michael Gove later (see 10.55am and 12.07pm) is likely to go well. I have been rereading Gove\u2019s write-up of his interview with Trump in January 2017 (paywall) and it\u2019s not exactly a hatchet job. Here\u2019s an extract. Ever since a Virginia farmer called George Washington launched his bid for glory, the British have had a tendency to underestimate American presidents. Especially Republicans. When Abraham Lincoln was in the White House, our government sympathised with the Confederacy. When Ronald Reagan was commander-in-chief, the British foreign policy establishment derided him as a trigger-happy cowboy who was in danger of pitching us into a third world war. But no Republican, indeed no president, has come to office facing anything like the level of scorn and condescension from British politicians and commentators as Mr Trump. When we talked last Friday, however, he had nothing but kind words and generous sentiments for a nation he believes will be his strongest ally ... He\u2019s no Kissinger and you\u2019d no more expect him to discuss Clausewitz and Kennan than set fire to his own hair. But intelligence takes many forms. And Mr Trump\u2019s number-rich analysis of defence spending reflects a businessman\u2019s ability to cut through jargon to get to the essentials of a case. The same Trump who uses gladiatorial press conferences and CAPITALISED tweets to hurl huge crude blocks of rhetoric at opponents is also the master of the P&amp;L accounts and the determined negotiator who sees government as a failing corporation ripe for re-engineering ... Mr Trump\u2019s conversation flows like a river in spate, overwhelming interruptions and objections, reflecting the force of nature that is the man. But it would be a mistake to think that he is all instinct and impulse. He wants to bring to governing the same calculating business style that he has brought to communicating. While he has been criticised for tweeting attacks on everyone from Meryl Streep to the civil rights hero John Lewis, he has no intention of abandoning Twitter because he believes it gives him a direct connection to the American people. More from my colleague Damien Gayle on why people are protesting against Trump. We have got more than an hour to wait until the Trump-May press conference starts, but, as is usual for these events, the journalists have been told to arrive extra early. They are in the Foreign Office and, as ITV\u2019s Robert Peston reports, at least they\u2019re in a nice room. From the BBC\u2019s Jon Sopel. At least half of Change UK\u2019s 11 MPs are poised to leave the fledgling political party, after its dismal performance at the European elections, my colleagues Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot report. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has described President Trump as a poster boy for the far-right. Expanding on comments he made yesterday, Khan said: The reality is, when you look around the world there are many leaders whose views I find abhorrent \u2013 in Hungary, in Italy, in France, here in the UK, and the poster boy they look up to is Donald Trump. And it should be a source of concern to us that Donald Trump is the poster boy for the far-right movement around the world and actually some of the things that he has done as president are deeply objectionable, far more objectionable than silly tweets he might send. During the visit to Downing Street, the prime minister and president, along with their spouses, viewed the Sussex Declaration \u2013 a rare copy of the American Declaration of Independence on sheepskin parchment dating back to the 1780s, the Press Association reports. As anti-Trump protesters began their slow march down Whitehall, hundreds of placards remained on the ground around Trafalgar Square, suggesting that organisers had not achieved the numbers expected, or indeed matched those of the last Trump demo. The square had not quite been filled. Nevertheless, as promised by organisers and despite persistent drizzle, there was indeed a carnival atmosphere on the demonstration, with samba bands and whistles accompanying the thousands slowly streaming towards parliament. They will only make it halfway. Police have erected barricades along Whitehall to prevent protests outside Downing Street. Instead the demonstration will halt at the Women of world war two memorial, where a stage will feature speakers, then take a circuitous route to Parliament Square for a mass rally. The anti-Trump protesters have been moving down Whitehall, Sky News reports. At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning a spokeswoman for the prime minister said the UK decision about whether or not to allow Huawei to play a role in constructing the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure (see 10.41am) would be based on a \u201chard-headed technically-informed assessment of the risk\u201d. Talking about Theresa May\u2019s meeting with President Trump, the spokeswoman said: The PM will be setting out the UK position, we\u2019re obviously reviewing the right policy approach at the moment. The PM and others have been clear that any decision we take there will be supported by hard-headed technically-informed assessment of the risk. We\u2019re reviewing the right policy approach and when an announcement is ready we will update parliament. A source close to Michael Gove has confirmed that the environment secretary has been asked to meet Donald Trump, as Sky was reporting earlier. (See 10.55am.) The source said: Mr Gove was asked last night by Mr Trump\u2019s team if he would be able to meet the president today. He said yes. Nothing has been fixed yet. As the Press Association reports, the source indicated the meeting was likely to be on a one-to-one basis, which could prove embarrassing to Theresa May as her talks with the president are likely to involve senior ministers and officials rather than just the two leaders. My colleague Dan Sabbagh has a list of some of the people lined up to speak at the anti-Trump demonstration. Activists promised to meet Donald Trump with a \u201ccarnival of resistance\u201d in London on Tuesday as they began gathering in protest again his state visit. Together Against Trump, an umbrella organisation formed of dozens of civil society groups, is hoping to bring hundreds of thousands of people on to the streets around Westminster. On Tuesday morning, before the 11am gathering time, there were already hundreds in Trafalgar Square, where bundles of placards were leant against street furniture and journalists made pieces to camera. At 11.30am protesters are due to march down Whitehall to the Women of world war two memorial \u2013 as far as they can make it since police have blocked the area outside Downing Street, apparently for security reasons \u2013 where a stage is erected for speakers including Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, and Caroline Lucas of the Green party, among others. They will then march around the Embankment, past New Scotland Yard into Parliament Square, where a second stage will feature music artists and more speakers including, it is expected, Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader. Michael Hewitt, a retired clergyman from Bromley, was wandering past the fountains holding a piece of white A4 paper with the message, \u201cToxic Trump out\u201d. \u201cI think his views are toxic, just toxic \u2013 how do you sum him up?\u201d Hewitt said. Asked what his message to Trump would be, he said: \u201cGet real, face reality of climate change and the interdependence of nations and stop being nationalistic. Patriotism is different from nationalism.\u201d Turning back to the Tory leadership contest for a moment, James Cleverly, the Brexit minister who was one of several unexpected contenders in the Conservative leadership contests (or no-hopers, if you want to be more cynical), has announced that he is withdrawing from the contest. As of this morning, he had just four MPs supporting him. Explaining his decision in a statement on his website, he said: Last week I announced that I intended to run for the leadership of the Conservative party and as prime minister. I felt that we needed to deliver Brexit and then quickly move the conversation on to other important issues that face the country. I had hoped that the Conservative parliamentary party would support me to be the face and voice of that conversation. To do this I asked them to make a leap of faith, skip a generation and vote for a relatively new MP. It is clear that despite much support, particularly from our party\u2019s grassroots, MPs weren\u2019t comfortable with such a move and it has become clear that it is highly unlikely that I would progress to be one of the final two candidates. For this reason I have withdrawn from the process of selecting a new leader and will not be submitting nomination papers. Interviewed on BBC News a moment ago, Cleverly refused to say who he would now be backing for leader. And here is the scene in Trafalgar Square, where the anti-Trump protest is getting underway. President Trump has arrived now at Downing Street. President Trump and Theresa May have been holding roundtable talks with business leaders at St James\u2019s Palace. According to the Press Association, Trump said the US was already the UK\u2019s largest trading partner and that he believed there was scope for further expansion. He said: I think we will have a very, very substantial trade deal. This is something you want to do and my folks want to do. He even suggested that May should rethink her decision to resign. He told her: Stick around. Let\u2019s do this deal. (Presumably that was intended as more of a joke than as a constructive suggestion.) May said that there were \u201chuge opportunities\u201d for Britain and the US to work together in the future. She said: It is a great partnership but I think a partnership we can take even further. Of course that is with a good bilateral trade deal. I think there are huge opportunities for us to do more together in the future and challenges to work on as well. A Chinese-made talking robot of Donald Trump sitting on a gold toilet has become the focal point of anti Trump protests in Trafalgar Square. As the Guardian revealed last month, the 4.9-metre (16ft) object depicts Trump with his trousers down, tweeting on the toilet, while his long red tie dangles into the bowl. It emits recordings of some of Trump\u2019s provocative sound bites including: \u201cno collusion\u201d, \u201ca witch-hunt\u201d, \u201cyou are fake news\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m a very stable genius.\u201d Its creator, Don Lessem, a dinosaur expert from Philadelphia, travelled to London to mark the robot\u2019s debut at the protests. Standing beside his creation he claimed comedy was the best way to defeating Trump. \u201cHumour is my weapon,\u201d he said. The robot also makes a farting sound. Lessem said: \u201cThe fart we couldn\u2019t get from him so we had to use a generic fart.\u201d Lessem said he had no problem getting the robot built in Sichuan and then shipped from China to the UK. He said: The factory manager was shocked that we could make fun of our president without repercussions but had no fear of consequences for them in doing so. Trump is not on the Chinese government\u2019s list of favourites, and one of the first papers to pick up the Guardian\u2019s story was the South China News. Since the government keeps particularly close tabs on publications, it\u2019s a tacit indication that the robot is actually appreciated by Chinese authorities. It was a debate as to how to categorise the robot for shipping purposes. I chose \u2018toy\u2019 over \u2018art\u2019. A message to Trump from a protester. These are from Sky\u2019s Tom Rayner. Gove, the environment secretary and probably Boris Johnson\u2019s leading rival in the contest to be the next Tory leader and prime minister, famously met Trump shortly after his election as president when he interviewed him for the Times. At the time Gove was a backbencher (Theresa May sacked him when she became prime minister in 2016) and writing for the Times, where he used to work full-time as an editor and columnist before becoming an MP. Rupert Murdoch, owner of the Times, is thought to have played a role in securing the interview, which was regarded as a journalistic scoop, even if Gove\u2019s questioning was not noted for being over-critical. Here is an excerpt. In any Tory leadership contest it is always worth knowing who the Murdoch candidate is. This year it\u2019s probably Gove. One of the biggest issues likely to come up in the talks between Donald Trump and Theresa May today is Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications firm, and whether the UK will allow it to play a role in building its 5G infrastructure. The US says Huawei should be excluded because it is a security risk. It argues that the firm is effectively controlled by the Chinese government, which could use Huawei technology to spy on Western communications. It has warned that it might stop sharing intelligence with the UK if it allows Huawei a role in its 5G network. The British government has not yet taken a final decision about what to do, but officials believe it is possible to allow Huawei a role in 5G without compromising security. This long blog, written in February by Ian Levy, technical director at the National Cyber Security Centre, helps to explain why. As my colleagues Dan Sabbagh and Patrick Wintour report in their story on this today, there are also other reasons why Whitehall is sceptical of the US threat to turn off the supply of intelligence information if the UK offers contracts to Huawei. They write: British civil servants stressed that the UK had a unique architecture in its telecoms network, and the country could not simply take a decision to try to exclude itself from the long-term growth in Chinese economic influence. They added that the chief priorities were protection of the UK-US intelligence relationship as well as a diversification of choice among network technology providers and and an increase in telecoms standards. Other former Whitehall insiders said the next prime minister would have leverage to resist the US warnings. The US is reliant on UK signals intelligence for the targeting of missions in Syria and Iraq. The belief of British officials is that the Trump administration argument against Huawei is essentially economic, part of a growing battle over trade between the world\u2019s largest economy and China. This morning Ben Wallace, the security minister, was on the Today programme discussing this issue. He said that, contrary to the impression given by a recent story in the Daily Telegraph, the government has not yet taken a final decision on this. (The Telegraph said the National Security Council had decided to allow Huawei a partial role in the 5G project, a leak that eventually led to Gavin Williamson being sacked as defence secretary, after May concluded he was responsible.) But Wallace also said the issue of \u201cfair play\u201d would be an issue in the decision. He explained: Alongside the technical questions is obviously the question of behaviour of a number of states. We\u2019re British \u2013 we believe in fair play \u2013 and I think if we want to allow people access to our markets we have to say there are rules ... Not using the espionage to steal our intellectual property. How do we maintain a level playing field and fair play that allows foreign investment, foreign access to our markets, and vice versa, but people don\u2019t exploit that goodwill to steal and cheat? This sounded like Wallace was preparing an alternative justification for the UK taking a decision to exclude Huawei along the lines requested by the US. \u201dYou won\u2019t get the contract, not because our network would not be safe, but because of China\u2019s record on stealing intellectual property generally,\u201d (I paraphrase) \u2013 but it was hard to be sure. The White House pool has released details of Trump\u2019s gifts to the Queen and Prince Philip. The Queen got a silver and silk poppy brooch, in a White House jewellery box. Prince Phillip got a personalised Air Force One jacket and a first edition signed autobiography by James Doolittle, I Could Never Be So Lucky Again. Doolittle was an American general of the second world war. The Queen gave Trump a first edition of Churchill\u2019s Second World War (all six volumes, presumably, although the pool report does not say). He also got a three-piece Duofold pen set. And the Queen\u2019s gift to Melania Trump was a specially-commissioned silver box with a handcrafted enamel lid. Liam Fox has backed the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, to be the next Conservative leader, in a further splintering of cabinet endorsements which has seen ministers back candidates in five different directions, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. In response, Hunt posted this on Twitter. ConservativeHome has been keeping a daily tally of leadership endorsements by Tory MPs. According to their latest update (posted just before 8am this morning, but including Fox), Boris Johnson has been publicly backed by 42 Conservative MPs, which puts him ahead of Jeremy Hunt (on 32), Michael Gove (29), Dominic Raab (24), Sajid Javid (17), Matt Hancock (11), Kit Malthouse and Esther McVey (both on 6), Mark Harper and Rory Stewart (both on 5), James Cleverly (4) and Andrea Leadsom (3). Sam Gyimah, who declared at the weekend that he was standing on a platform backing a second referendum, does not seem to have any endorsements. Meanwhile, in Parliament Square, protesters are inflating the Trump blimp (the balloon portraying Trump as a giant baby) that will be flying above London for two hours today. You can watch a live video feed of it being prepared here. President Trump has just arrived at Buckingham Palace by helicopter. From there he will travel by car to St James\u2019s Palace, which is very near, for a meeting with business leaders. We all like showing off our holiday photos and videos. President Trump is no exception, and he has just posted this on Twitter. The video only lasts one minute. That obviously did not leave the White House time to include footage of the \u201ctremendous crowds\u201d. (See 9.12am.) Well, at least one person is happy about Donald Trump\u2019s state visit to the UK. This is what the US president was saying last night after visiting Buckingham Palace for lunch with the Queen. His reference to the \u201ctremendous crowds\u201d will surprise anyone who was in London or watching the news yesterday and the White House has not tweeted any pictures of these huge crowds of Trump fans \u2013 probably for the obvious reason that they they don\u2019t exist. (Some of the time yesterday, even for relatively short journeys, Trump was being whisked across the capital by helicopter \u2013 like a senior politician visiting a war zone \u2013 and even when he was driven by car, the police kept the pavements clear out of fear that his convoy might get the milkshake treatment, or worse.) Still, why let the facts etc etc. You can tell from the pictures being tweeted by the White House why Trump, who is said to aspire to be treated like a monarch, was so grateful to get a warm reception from a real one. Today we get the political side of the state visit, with Trump going to Downing Street for talks with Theresa May and a press conference. Given that May will be out of office within a few weeks, it is hard to see the point, and Trump might have been better advised to spend his time talking to Boris Johnson, the clear favourite to succeed her. (It is still not clear whether or not Trump will meet Johnson during the downtime available in his schedule.) But even if the talks are stilted, the press conference is unlikely to be dull. And, while Trump is meeting May, thousands of people are expected to be nearby in London protesting against him. They will include Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, who also chose to boycott last night\u2019s state dinner. This morning Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, told the Today programme why Corbyn, who would be having to deal with Trump as prime minister if an early general election led to a Labour government, was taking this stance. She said: A state visit is an honour and we don\u2019t think this president deserves an honour. The truth is he has tried to close borders with Muslim-majority countries, he is caging small Mexican children, he has grabbed women and boasted about it. He is a sexual predator, he is a racist and it\u2019s right to say that \u2013 we need to think about when is it our country got so scared? Thornberry also explained why Corbyn refused to go to a state dinner for Trump while he attended one for the president of China, a country with a far, far worse human rights record than the US. She said: When you have a close friend and they\u2019re going wrong, you are more likely to be adamant with them and clearer with them than someone who has not been as close a friend and someone you are trying to build a relationship up with. She said Trump needed to be stood up to \u201clike the way you deal with a bully\u201d because \u201cif you bow down in front of them you just get kicked harder\u201d. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the Commons and a Tory leadership candidate, holds a phone-in on LBC. 9.20am: President Trump is due to arrive at Buckingham Palace. He will then go to St James\u2019s Palace for a meeting with business leaders. 9.30am: Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, speaks at the RUSI thinktank. 11am: Corbyn is among those speaking at the anti-Trump demonstration starting in Trafalgar Square. Anti-Trump protests are also taking place in other cities, such as Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee. Between 10am and 12pm the Trump blimp will be flying over Parliament Square. 11.20am: Trump is due to arrive at Downing Street for talks with Theresa May and other ministers. There will then be a working lunch. 1.45pm: Trump and May hold a press conference. 7pm: Tory leadership candidates Sajid Javid, Boris Johnson, Kit Malthouse and Andrea Leadsom are due to speak at a private hustings in the Commons organised by the One Nation group of Tory MPs. Evening: Trump hosts a dinner for May and other British dignitaries at Winfield House, the US ambassador\u2019s residence. The Prince of Wales will represent the Queen. And at some point today the executive of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee will meet to discuss changing the rules to reduce the number of contenders in the Tory leadership contest. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Trump visit and the press conference. I plan to post a summary at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Some key data from the report: More than 44,000 (75%) of the homeless population are unsheltered, with more than 16,000 people living in cars and more than 11,000 in tents and makeshift shelters.

One recent study named LA the least-affordable housing market in the country. An LA renter earning minimum wage would need to work 79 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom apartment, and the county would need more than 500,000 new affordable units to meet the needs of low-income renters. \u201cThe pressures on Angelenos are severe,\u201d Peter Lynn, Lahsa executive director, said at a public meeting unveiling the numbers, adding that the government \u201ccan help thousands of people exit homelessness, even as thousands more fall into homeless\u201d. Bales said his own employees could not afford to live in LA and that the crisis was \u201cpast the tipping point\u201d, adding: \u201cI hope this is the wake-up call.\u201d The data was released days after the Wall Street Journal reported that developers in LA have built a surplus of lavish mansions in posh LA neighborhoods \u2013 with price tags in the tens and hundreds of millions. \u201cThe unaffordability in this city is sending more and more people on to the streets,\u201d said Tracy Jeanne Rosenthal, co-founder of the LA Tenants Union. \u201cWhat is going on is out of control rent-gouging, real estate speculation, the destruction of rent-controlled housing, and the overdevelopment of luxury [housing],\u201d she added. Rosenthal said she was tired of seeing the homeless criminalized and harassed by police, and that public housing and expanded rent control policies were critical to allowing people to stay in their homes and in LA. Once people are evicted or pushed out due to huge rent hikes, they often have no other options for housing, she added: \u201cIf you\u2019re evicted in Los Angeles, you\u2019re evicted from Los Angeles. If you want to remain housed, you have to leave the city completely.\u201d",

The key determination ahead, essentially, is whether kids get a trial over climate breakdown.</p> <p>Those stakes and the government\u2019s handling of the case have catapulted it to rare courtroom celebrity. The youth plaintiffs are media regulars, with seemingly ubiquitous appeal: teen magazines, local newspapers, radio shows and recent appearances on 60 Minutes and in Vanity Fair. Hearings have been a spectacle, regularly mobbed by suit-and-tie types, kids of all ages, tie-dye and purple-haired grannies. More than 70 support rallies were held worldwide in lieu of a trial last fall.</p> <p>The digital following is no less a curiosity. The youth climate movement has begun to claim Juliana as central to its own narrative, using support rallies to train young leaders and to turn up the digital volume on the case with hashtags like #AllEyesOnJuliana.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s hearing was livestreamed and broadcast into a park near the courthouse. Following the hearing, the plaintiffs walked from the courthouse to the park, where a marching band played and activists shouted chants.

Olsen also stressed courts can and have intervened when government actions violate the constitutional rights of citizens.</p> <p>Bloggers, legal experts, scholars and activists have puzzled over the government\u2019s overall tactics to the case. In legal circles, the case is an anomaly, made an outlier by the repetitive, emergency petitions filed to squash it.

      "bodyText": "Twenty-one youth activists faced off with the US government in an Oregon courthouse on Tuesday, where their attorneys petitioned a panel of judges to let their climate case go to trial. Until it does, their attorneys argued, fossil fuel development should be halted on public lands. The case of Juliana v the US charges the federal government with violating the constitutional rights of youth by perpetuating systems that contribute to climate breakdown. Those young people \u2013 who range in age from 11 to 23 and hail from all corners of the nation \u2013 argue that the constitution gives them and future generations a right to an environment free of climate catastrophe. Their previously scheduled trial was abruptly halted in October 2018 after the government successfully petitioned the supreme court for review. Now, a three-judge panel at the ninth circuit has the final say. The panel did not issue a ruling on Tuesday. \u201cI think what\u2019s at stake is the ability of these young people to vindicate their constitutional rights,\u201d plaintiff attorney Andrea Rodgers, senior staff attorney for Our Children\u2019s Trust, the not-for-profit group representing the youth plaintiffs, told the Guardian ahead of the hearing. The key determination ahead, essentially, is whether kids get a trial over climate breakdown. Those stakes and the government\u2019s handling of the case have catapulted it to rare courtroom celebrity. The youth plaintiffs are media regulars, with seemingly ubiquitous appeal: teen magazines, local newspapers, radio shows and recent appearances on 60 Minutes and in Vanity Fair. Hearings have been a spectacle, regularly mobbed by suit-and-tie types, kids of all ages, tie-dye and purple-haired grannies. More than 70 support rallies were held worldwide in lieu of a trial last fall. The digital following is no less a curiosity. The youth climate movement has begun to claim Juliana as central to its own narrative, using support rallies to train young leaders and to turn up the digital volume on the case with hashtags like #AllEyesOnJuliana. Tuesday\u2019s hearing was livestreamed and broadcast into a park near the courthouse. Following the hearing, the plaintiffs walked from the courthouse to the park, where a marching band played and activists shouted chants. Levi Draheim, one of the plaintiffs, rode on the shoulders of Nathan Baring, another plaintiff. Park-goers rallied around the youth waving signs to \u201cLet the Youth Be Heard\u201d under the watchful eye of giant heads of the 12 presidents with knowledge of climate change. Jeffrey Bossert Clark on Tuesday argued against the trial on the government\u2019s behalf. A former George W Bush administration appointee, he has publicly equated greenhouse gas regulation with socialist attempts to seize the economy and use of United Nations science as synonymous with US rule by foreign scientists. Clark said that the suitconstituted a direct attack on the separations of powers, and that the young activists wrongly want the courts, instead of elected officials, to direct things such as energy policy. Julia Olsen, a lawyer for the activists, argued federal energy policy \u201cputs children in harm\u2019s way\u201d. Olsen also stressed courts can and have intervened when government actions violate the constitutional rights of citizens. Bloggers, legal experts, scholars and activists have puzzled over the government\u2019s overall tactics to the case. In legal circles, the case is an anomaly, made an outlier by the repetitive, emergency petitions filed to squash it. That strategy has been repeated in cases on the far-right fringe of Donald Trump\u2019s agenda: cases affecting Daca recipients, immigrants and the national census, and the transgender military ban. The questions raised in the case, however, are increasingly pressing in America, and worldwide.

But the money tells us a lot more, offering a window into Australia\u2019s fears about China, its attempts to win over neighbouring countries and Australia\u2019s \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d when it comes to aid. Here are five graphs that help unpack what this money reveals. We are not very generous Australia should be careful about how loudly it trumpets this gift \u2013 $250m might sound like a lot, but in reality this is not a huge act of generosity from the Australian government. First, the money will be spread over 10 years, making it less impressive. It is also not new money, but comes out of the existing aid budget and the existing Australian foreign aid budget is at its least generous level ever. The most common measure of aid spending is how much foreign aid is spent compared with gross national income (in layman\u2019s terms, how many cents are spent on foreign aid for every $100 Australia earns). In the next financial year, Australia will spend just 21 cents on foreign aid for every $100 the nation earns, a historic low, and down from a peak of 33 cents in 2013-2014. These cuts have come despite the fact that the UN mandated a target for wealthy countries of reaching foreign aid spending compared to GNI of 0.7 (70 cents). When he was first elected, Morrison praised previous governments for increasing foreign aid and said the country \u201cstill must go further\u201d. \u201cThe need is not diminishing, nor can our support,\u201d he said, calling deaths of the world\u2019s poor \u201ca true moral crisis that eclipses all others\u201d. Despite these fine sentiments, under Morrison\u2019s leadership, and that of his two Coalition predecessors, foreign aid compared to GNI has plummeted. \u201cAustralia has now fallen to the bottom third of OECD countries in regard to our generosity and we\u2019re sharing this club with countries that have been through severe recessions such as Portugal, Greece and Italy,\u201d said Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands program at the Lowy Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty hard pill to swallow given we\u2019ve had 27 years of uninterrupted economic growth, and we\u2019re one of the most prosperous nations in the world, when you look at our GDP per capita. I think it is a dereliction of duty.\u201d We are keeping things increasingly local The Coalition has made it very clear that it wants to refocus Australian foreign policy on the Pacific region, so it should come as no surprise that any big aid announcements by Australia are about money for that region. Morrison\u2019s \u201cPacific step-up\u201d is not just about aid, but aid is a factor and an arena in which China and Australia duke it out for influence. Australia has traditionally been the most significant donor to the Pacific, but in 2017 China committed to spending more than four times as much as Australia. This battle for influence is partly why the Pacific has been largely protected from cuts to the foreign aid budget. Because there have been cuts in all other regions, the Pacific now receives a huge proportion of Australian aid. In 2013-14, 21.1% of the foreign aid budget was spent on the Pacific region, in 2019-2020 the Pacific will receive an unprecedented 35% of the aid budget, with $1.4bn pledged. According to Pryke, this is \u201ca strategic decision\u201d, in part to counter the influence of China in the region. \u201cIt\u2019s never been decided purely on need,\u201d said Pryke. \u201cThat\u2019s why you see a concentration of aid in our immediate region \u2013 Asia, the Pacific \u2013 and far less in Africa. That\u2019s a reflection of the fact we have far greater influence and importance in that part of the world, and that in lots of Pacific countries we are the primary aid donor, so they would feel cuts more acutely.\u201d Stephen Howes, the director of the Development Policy Centre at the Australian National University, says there is a danger of concentrating our aid in the Pacific region. \u201cI personally feel we should make sure we don\u2019t neglect the big global crises \u2026 and just retreat to the Pacific region, which is already the most aid-dependent region in the world,\u201d he said. Howes added that DFAT\u2019s own research showed that aid projects in the Pacific were less effective than in other parts of the world, due to governance issues. \u201cAid is not really the answer to the Pacific, that\u2019s clear, that\u2019s why it was good to see some small announcement on labour mobility [from Morrison in the Solomon Islands], that\u2019s where we should be focusing our efforts.\u201d Bridges and roads, not health and education The fact that the $250m program announced by Morrison is largely about infrastructure reveals a shift in Australia\u2019s thinking about aid. Traditionally, Australian aid has focused on programs around health, education and gender equality. But over the last decade, and particularly in the last few years, the budget has moved away from these programs and toward infrastructure spending, which is how China typically provides aid to the region. In 2011-12, 16% of the Australian foreign aid budget was set aside for infrastructure, trade, agriculture, fisheries and water. In the 2018-19 budget, 28.8% of the budget was dedicated to those areas while the proportion of the budget spent on health, education and governance programs fell. \u201cThat\u2019s really Julie Bishop\u2019s legacy,\u201d said Howes. \u201cJulie Bishop wanted the aid program to focus more on economic development and trade.\u201d Pryke said the shift also has a lot to do with countering China\u2019s influence. \u201cAustralia needs to provide viable alternatives to what China has to offer, and China offers a lot of infrastructure,\u201d he said. Matthew Clarke, professor of international development at Deakin University, said infrastructure money is often welcomed by Pacific leaders who feel pressure to show they have delivered for their communities. \u201cThere\u2019s a great difference between the delivery or a building or a highway to a health program or an education program,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen those services are less material \u2013 it might be the payment of salaries to teachers, or the delivery of community awareness programs \u2013 it\u2019s not as easy to take credit, and to demonstrate what you\u2019ve delivered to your community.\u201d Howes said that while Pacific countries need infrastructure \u2013 \u201cyou need roads to go to school\u201d \u2013 there was a cost to the increased spending on infrastructure, especially in the context of the declining aid budget, at the expense of crucial programs. He also said the government should make sure its \u201cdecisions are based on sound development logic, and not driven by geopolitical considerations.\u201d Howes offered the example of Morrison\u2019s announcement that Australia would fund elite Solomon Islands\u2019 sportspeople to train in Australia, a program that does not come out of the aid budget. \u201cYou\u2019d question whether this is a really good use of money. Solomon Islands is still a poor country, it still has high levels of malaria and basic diseases, so we really need to prioritise on the key issues and try to limit the goodwill gestures that have very little payoff for development,\u201d he said.",

Eventually he is placated by his manager, but the point has been made, and forcefully.</p> \n<p>After earning his place in City\u2019s centurions as an impromptu left\u2011back, the following season proved trickier for Delph. A two\u2011month run in the side was brought to an end by a red card in the defeat by Leicester at Christmas.

And if he couldn\u2019t play, he wanted his teammates to kick on, including those he already considered to be among the best in the world, such as Raheem Sterling.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s an amazing young man,\u201d says Delph of his City and England colleague, who looks set to earn his 50th cap against the Netherlands on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m older than him, I\u2019ve been around a lot longer even though he\u2019s probably played twice as many games.

      "bodyText": "Fabian Delph is looking back on his fourth year at Manchester City and his role within the squad. \u201cIn the second half of the season I never played,\u201d he says. \u201cBut every time it\u2019s a home game, I\u2019m there and I\u2019m ranting and raving. I\u2019m speaking to people one to one, effing and jeffing, getting the team going. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult when you\u2019re not involved, and I go in with the mindset that I\u2019ll probably take a bit of a back seat, just have a quiet word and then I end up like: \u2018Come on then lads!\u2019 It\u2019s just in me, it\u2019s how I\u2019ve always been and it probably won\u2019t change.\u201d Delph is speaking at St George\u2019s Park, as he prepares to travel to Portugal with England for the Nations League finals. He is an intelligent, entertaining man. Anyone who has seen the City documentary series All or Nothing will recognise the midfielder\u2019s description of himself. After City lost the Manchester derby in April 2018, we watch Delph in the dressing room, ripping into his team\u2019s performance and embarking on an industrial-strength tirade about \u201cthe basics of football\u201d. Eventually he is placated by his manager, but the point has been made, and forcefully. After earning his place in City\u2019s centurions as an impromptu left\u2011back, the following season proved trickier for Delph. A two\u2011month run in the side was brought to an end by a red card in the defeat by Leicester at Christmas. As City went on to complete a domestic treble, the 29-year-old made only five more appearances. The quality Delph could make best use of in that time, therefore, was his presence in the dressing room, his inability to stay quiet. And if he couldn\u2019t play, he wanted his teammates to kick on, including those he already considered to be among the best in the world, such as Raheem Sterling. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing young man,\u201d says Delph of his City and England colleague, who looks set to earn his 50th cap against the Netherlands on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m older than him, I\u2019ve been around a lot longer even though he\u2019s probably played twice as many games. [I give him] regular pats on the back, motivating him, giving him good advice, telling him to be confident. \u201cPeople still forget that he\u2019s only 24 years old. When we both signed for City he was 19 [he was actually 20], he looked like a little baby. People questioned what type of player he\u2019d be and whether he would go to that next level. I remember speaking about it a few years back and I was like: \u2018This kid has everything \u2013 once he finds his path and finds what works for him, you\u2019re going to see something incredible.\u2019 \u201cI still believe he\u2019s operating at about 80%. So if he can push himself a bit more, which I know he will because his mindset is very good, I think the sky\u2019s the limit in the next couple of years.\u201d Delph says he has received similar encouragement from Sterling, especially when the pair have gone away with England. \u201cI remember when I played in November for the national team,\u201d Delph says, \u201che was doing that for me. He was the one who was pumping me up and telling me to express myself and to be more direct.

Arcadia Group has handed security over additional property assets to the fund in response to a demand from the Pensions Regulator that the former billionaire inject another \u00a350m to fill the group\u2019s pension black hole. The pledge comes on top of a promise by the Green family and Arcadia, which owns Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis, Burton, Miss Selfridge and Evans, to put \u00a3360m into the pension over three years. The regulator, Arcadia\u2019s pension fund trustees and the pension protection fund, which acts as a lifeboat for collapsed companies savings schemes, said the package was sufficient to have secured their backing.

As a major creditor, the fund will have a significant vote at a meeting on Wednesday that is required to secure the CVA and avert a collapse into administration for Arcadia, which would put 18,000 jobs at risk. A source said Green, whose latest run-in with the regulator comes after he was pressed into pumping \u00a3363m into the pension fund of collapsed department store BHS two years ago, wanted to make a \u201csqueaky clean\u201d deal that could not be questioned in future. The group, which operates 570 shops, must win approval from 75% of its creditors, most of whom are landlords. The restructure will enable it to close at least 23 stores and cut rents by up to 70% on nearly 200 more. In return, Green has promised to hand landlords a 20% stake in the business and invest an extra \u00a350m in cash in stores, part of a \u00a3135m turnaround plan intended to help Arcadia compete with rivals such as Asos, Zara and H&amp;M. The turnaround includes spending \u00a375m on a new hi-tech distribution centre in Daventry and a step up in wholesale sales, including taking Topshop on to fashion retailer Asos\u2019s online platform for the first time. Arcadia has also pledged \u00a360m to upgrade its online operations. More than one landlord told the Guardian on Tuesday that discussions were still ongoing with Arcadia and they had yet to decide if they would back the restructure. While trade creditors are understood to have backed the deal, Arcadia\u2019s complex plan, which involves seven CVAs of property holding companies, hands much more power to landlords.

He has bounced back from the collapse of his dream of a second home and a business in Spain and has settled in a semi-retirement-age village back in Essex. No one under 50 can live there, and most of the inhabitants are East Enders who have decamped to the countryside for better golfing and more leisurely pubbing. Although he is starting to regret voting to leave the EU, he says: \u201cLife couldn\u2019t be better, really!\u201d And their marriage, after his \u201cregretful behaviour\u201d recorded in previous instalments, is \u201csolid\u201d. Or, as Debbie puts it: \u201cGood at the moment.\u201d So many ghosts. Including those of the films not made. I would watch Debbie\u2019s. His fellow East Ender Sue is also content. Her two children are still single, \u201cgot good jobs, bought their own flats\u201d, and she is a university administrator, due to retire in three years and just about able to see that a life without the work she loves might not be too bad. But she worries for others\u2019 futures. \u201cI see homeless people all the time \u2026 My generation had wonderful support from the council, which got me on to the ladder and changed my life. People are struggling now.\u201d Nick remembers his \u201csingle moment of pure, unadulterated joy in my life \u2013 when my son was handed to me.\u201d His students are wonderful and he is still \u201changing on in there as long as possible with them\u201d. The boy who was educated in a one-room schoolhouse in the Dales loves the US \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to get things done here\u201d \u2013 although he boggles at Trump. But trips home to Yorkshire still make \u201cother places you go seem rather trivial in comparison\u201d. It is, of course, God\u2019s own country. Up makes other attempts to replicate the project \u2013 let alone the reality TV shows to which it is sometimes considered a precursor \u2013 seem trivial in comparison. Apted has honed his skills over the years, becoming less presumptive and more content to let narratives unfold naturally. And, of course, the unprecedentedly long relationship between the maker and his subjects has led to more give and take between them. Set against the crudeness, manipulation and superficiality of most of what now makes up this part of the televisual field, Up starts to look like an almost noble endeavour, more akin to the raising of a medieval church amid the housing estates thrown up by the rest to make a quick buck. See you at 70 Up, I hope.",

      "bodyText": "Juventus have made contact with Manchester United to see whether they would consider selling Paul Pogba this summer. The Serie A champions are keen to sign a world-class midfielder before next season starts and they were initially looking at Lazio\u2019s Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and made an offer of \u20ac60m (\u00a353.2m) last month but ended their interest in the Serb when Lazio said they were holding out for \u20ac90m. The Turin side, who are looking for a new manager after Massimiliano Allegri departed after winning his fifth consecutive scudetto, have now turned their attentions to Pogba. They have made United aware of their interest in the French midfielder, who played for them between 2012 and 2016. Pogba has indicated that he would be happy to rejoin Juventus, where he still has a great relationship with Fabio Paratici, the sporting director, as well as several of the players. Juve are now waiting to hear from United whether there is an opportunity to sign Pogba and, if so, at what price. Juve are not in a position to pay the \u00a393.2m Pogba cost when he joined the Premier League side in 2016 and could try to include a player, possibly Paulo Dybala, Alex Sandro or Douglas Costa in a deal. Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s arrival from Real Madrid last summer for \u20ac100m means that the club will have to offload some players if they want to invest heavily in new signings. They are hoping that the current Chelsea manager, Maurizio Sarri, will take over from Allegri. The Italian has told Chelsea he would like to return to Serie A with Juventus and it is now up to Juve to make a formal approach for the 60-year-old.",

Yet Sri Lanka will just be relieved to have got their campaign back on track after New Zealand thumped them by 10 wickets in their opening game last Saturday. In the end they were thankful for career-best ODI figures from Nuwan Pradeep, the right-arm seam bowler taking four wickets for 31, and the trusty slingshot of Lasith Malinga, who took three, for a victory that keeps their World Cup hopes alive. Sri Lanka had thrown away a fine start to their innings, which had seen Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Perera put on 92 for the first wicket, thanks to a spectacular collapse inspired by Mohammad Nabi. The off-spinner\u2019s three wickets in the 22nd \u2013 Lahiru Thirimanne, Kusal Mendis and Angelo Mathews falling in the space of five deliveries \u2013 turned the contest on its head. Hamid Hassan, the headbanded fast bowler, then pounced in the next over when he took Dhananjaya de Silva\u2019s outside edge.

It said much that the second-highest scorer in the innings was extras with 35. Afghanistan\u2019s pursuit of a manageable target got off to a good start when they knocked off 34 of the required runs inside five overs. But the loss of Mohammad Shahzad, steering Malinga to midwicket, and Rahmat Shah, caught off Udana at slip, and then Pradeep\u2019s dismissal of Hazratullah Zazai got Sri Lanka back into the game. The big-hitting Hazratullah had been dropped on 24 by Kusal Mendis. Luckily for Sri Lanka the missed chance only cost them six runs as Thisara Perera took a spectacular catch at long leg. Hashmatullah Shahidi and Nabi also fell as Afghanistan lost five wickets for 23 runs to slip to 57 for five in the 14th over.

      "bodyText": "The government has been accused of \u201cshocking complacency\u201d over the European election voting rights controversy as new data revealed that as few as one in 10 EU citizens were able to cast their vote in some areas of Britain. While Westminster attention was focused on Donald Trump\u2019s state visit on Tuesday, a Cabinet Office minister was facing criticism in the parliament over the election last month. However, the government refused to heed calls for a public inquiry into why so many EU citizens said they had been denied a vote in an election that turned into a proxy ballot on Brexit. Kevin Foster, a junior Cabinet Office minister, said the government had taken \u201call legal steps necessary\u201d to ensure EU citizens were able to exercise their right to vote. He said the government would wait for the Electoral Commission\u2019s post-election report, but his response is unlikely to quell the outcry. Figures obtained by the Guardian from local authorities across the country suggest there was a lack of awareness among EU citizens that they needed to notify their councils that they were going to vote in the UK and not in their home country by 7 May. They had to do this using a form known as a UC1. The Guardian asked more than 50 councils how many UC1 forms had been issued to voters on their register and how many had been returned by the cut-off date. The return rate for the top 10 local authorities with EU citizens \u2013 Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and seven London boroughs \u2013 was 21%. In Birmingham, home to almost 35,000 EU citizens registered to vote, the return of forms was as low as 10.56%. In Brent in north-west London, which has one of the highest number of EU nationals on the register, only 20.74% of voters who were sent the forms by the council returned them on time. Kingston upon Thames appears to have had the highest rate of return in the country at 43% but other local authorities were not as successful in getting the message out. Some constituencies outside London had returns as low as 11% and 12%. Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson on Brexit, said the government\u2019s refusal to take any blame for the lack of awareness showed \u201cshocking complacency\u201d. He told Foster the issue had been raised repeatedly by a number of MPs and demanded an inquiry into \u201cthis shambles and the government\u2019s role in it\u201d. Labour also called for a \u201cfull and urgent\u201d inquiry. Cat Smith, the party\u2019s voter engagement spokesperson, said the numbers of EU citizens who were able to vote in May should be \u201ca source of shame for this government\u201d. She described the government\u2019s response to tell people to vote in their own countries as \u201cinsulting\u201d. Such a response added \u201cto the sense of anger and sense of exclusion\u201d felt by EU citizens, she said. Anneliese Dodds, the Labour MP for Oxford East, said Conservative ministers had ignored the Electoral Commission\u2019s warnings after the last EU elections in 2014 that the process needed to be easier for EU citizens. Some councils in London appeared relatively successful in getting the message out to EU citizens. Islington recorded 30% of forms returned, Wandsworth 36% and Greenwich 35%. Leeds reported that just 21% of forms had been returned while in Boston in Lincolnshire, where large number of EU nationals work on farms all year round, the return rate was 12%. Roger Casale, the founder of the New Europeans campaign group , said the failure to get the message and forms out to EU citizens on time was \u201cparticularly galling\u201d because the figures repeat a similar failure in the European elections in 2014. The New Europeans estimates that about 2 million of the 3.8 million EU citizens living in Britain would in principle have been eligible to vote. It has also called for a public inquiry, with a petition now signed by more than 123,000 people. Casale pointed out that many Britons living abroad who had registered to vote in the UK had also been disenfranchised because their ballot papers had not arrived in time.

      "bodyText": "Well, there we have it. 19-year-old Marketa Vondrousova will play Johanna Konta for a place in the French Open final. Before this year\u2019s tournament, they had won one match between them at Roland Garros. It\u2019s quite the story. I\u2019m signing off now but stay tuned for more reports and reaction. Vondrousova gets bulled in the next rally, and sends a wafted lob into the air in desperation \u2013 only for Martic to net the smash! A fourth match point, and this time the Czech gets the job done, forcing Martic back and into a desperate lob of her own. It drifts wide, and Vondrousova is in the semi-finals! Martic looks in control of the game, but a running backhand down the line from her opponent clips a net cord, and suddenly it\u2019s 30-all. Ferocious defensive work keeps her in the next, and Martic fires wide. Third match point for Vondrousova \u2013 but she can\u2019t get near an inside-out forehand that zips down the line! Vondrousova holds serve, thanks largely to Martic losing her range again. The Croatian will have to serve out the set now, if we\u2019re to have a second straight tie-break. Martic holds serve as her opponent tightens up; a pattern is emerging here. As soon as Martic gets back on terms, her level drops. As soon as Vondrousova gets within sight of winning, the nerves kick in. We could be here a while. Or five more minutes. Who knows. 5-5 in the second. Well, then. Two match points have come and gone for Vondrousova, and Martic can level the set. She\u2019s in control of the game, but again lets her opponent back in, and an ill-advised drop shot brings up deuce... Vondrousova saves the break point with a well-timed drop shot, but Martic has another chance after the match\u2019s longest rally, showing quicker hands at the net. The Czech dominates the next point, Martic controls the next. Another break chance as the game goes past eight minutes... and this time her opponent nets! Martic swings between well-constructed points and dismal unforced errors, allowing Vondrousova to work her way to a second match point \u2013 but she double faults! The nerves are kicking in now, and Martic attacks a short ball to earn a break point... Martic is trying to keep the rallies short \u2013 the longer they goes on, the worse her chances of winning them. That leads to a couple of rash shots that let Vondrousova back in from 40-15 down. A wild mishit then hands the Czech a match point, but some crucial big first serves get her out of trouble. Will the pressure tell on Vondrousova? Not a bit of it, as she marches to two break-back points, then pummels Martic into submission from the baseline. She\u2019s back ahead in the set, and after another nerveless service game moves 5-2 up, and one game away. Martic has rediscovered her mojo, breaking Vondrousova to get this set back on serve. In the men\u2019s doubles, Britain\u2019s Joe Salisbury and partner Rajeev Ram are out, beaten 6-4, 7-6 (6) by France\u2019s Jeremy Chardy and Fabrice Martin. The winner of this will play \u2013 as if you needed telling \u2013 Johanna Konta. The British No 1 is into her third grand slam semi-final, but is focused on going the distance: Vondrousova takes a spill coming into the net, but appears to be OK beyond getting covered in clay. Martic stops the rot in this set with a service hold, but still trails 6-7, 1-3. This match has turned dramatically in Vondrousova\u2019s favour. From 5-3 down, she took the first set to a tie-break, won it 7-1, and has now broken Martic to lead 2-0. No signs of nerves yet from the 19-year-old. The teenager rattles off the next two points, winning the breaker 7-1. She\u2019s one set away from a semi-final with Jo Konta. Thanks, Simon. We\u2019re into a first-set tie break, and Vondrousova has the edge after ending a rally with a delicate drop shot. A horrible mis-hit from Martic puts the Czech 5-1 up at the changeover... With the day\u2019s final singles match delicately poised, I\u2019m going to hand over to Niall McVeigh. Bye! Martic wins the first point with a phenomenal passing shot, probably the best shot of the match so far, and then wins an attritional second, just clobbering the ball back again and again until Vondrousova makes a mistake. From there, Vondrousova wins four points on the spin to hold, the last with both players at the net, trading mediocre volleys until the younger player finally put it away. 5-5. Not so fast! Vondrousova sets up break point with a vicious forehand, and then Martic miscues a forehand wide at the end of a gruelling rally of effort-packed, high-powered tennis (though it\u2019s mostly not very accurate, with the ball landing very much midcourt). Martic has won all four of her previous meetings against Vondrousova, all of them in the last two years (the Czech is only 19, so there weren\u2019t many opportunities before that), and is taking control of this one now: she breaks again, and leads 5-3 in the first set. Martic breaks straight back to level the scores at 3-3. To return briefly to the doubles, Martin and Chardy provided the headline result of the competition so far by knocking out the No1 seeds, Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo, in the third round, and will of course have the overwhelming support of the French fans behind them. Also on court at the moment is Britain\u2019s Joe Salisbury, who with America\u2019s Rajeev Ram is seeded 11th in the men\u2019s doubles. They have however just lost the first set of their quarter-final, being broken to love in its final game by the French pairing of Fabrice Martin and Jeremy Chardy. Break points! Vondrousova has a couple of opportunities to make a breakthrough on Martic\u2019s serve, and she takes the second of them with a forehand down the line. She leads 3-2 in the first set. Here\u2019s some of Roger Federer\u2019s post-match reaction: Two more holds, both players hitting the ball clean and true if not reaching the heights we enjoyed in the other quarter-final earlier today. Still, there\u2019s time yet. Both players hold their opening service games in pretty straightforward style, with Vondrousova concluding hers with a classic drop-shot/lob double-whammy. Who, then, will play Jo Konta in the semi-final? Will it be Petra Martic, the Croatian 31st seed, or Marketa Vondrousova, the unseeded Czech? We\u2019re about to find out: they have just emerged onto Suzanne Lenglen ahead of their quarter-final. Here are some highlights from Jo Konta\u2019s press conference today: A misjudgement from Federer in the first point, leaving a ball which dips to bounce a few inches inside the baseline, gives Wawrinka hope. He levels the game at 15-15 and then serves his first double-fault of the match. A see-saw rally ends with Fed\u2019s forehand dropping just on the line to make it 30-30, and then the No3 seed comes to the net to kill off the next point and set up match point. Wawrinka is furious with how that rally played out and swishes his racket angrily against the clay, and the next point sees him surge to the net to win it. It becomes a repeated race to the net, and it\u2019s one that Federer keeps winning. At deuce Wawrinka curls a fabulous forehand past him to set up break point, which is saved with a dainty drop-volley, with Wawrinka stranded way beyond the baseline. Federer ekes out another match point, and gives it away with another double fault! Those, though, are his last mistakes, and two more points of impeccable, attacking tennis decide the game! Meanwhile events are moving fast on Lenglen. Federer has just broken Wawrinka to take a 5-4 lead in the fourth set, and in a few moments he will serve for a place in the semis! Nadal will play the winner of the Federer-Wawrinka match in the semi-final. It will be his 12th time in the final four of the French Open \u2013 on each of the 11 previous occasions he has gone on to win the thing. Nadal finds himself 15-30 down, but Nishikori is not to be saved by a late wobble: the Spaniard hits successive service winners to take himself to match point, and when Nishikori miscues a forehand wide, it\u2019s all over! It looks like Nadal won\u2019t be back for long. He\u2019s 5-3 up now in the third set and about to serve for the match. The players have warmed up and play is about to resume. They\u2019ve been off for a shade over an hour, which could have helped the fading Nishikori, but perhaps hindered the mid-flow Wawrinka. Time will tell\u2026 Tennis incoming! There will be no play before 6.30pm local time, or 5.30pm BST. This does not mean that there will be play after that time, but it\u2019s at least promising. The rain has arrived, along with heavy winds and something not far away from darkness. Time for Parisians to take shelter indoors. We\u2019ll be back when things brighten, which is unlikely to be in less than an hour. The forecast, according to Eurosport, is for heavy downpours that will last a couple of hours. There is also a referee on Chatrier, trying to convince the players to leave. Nadal isn\u2019t very happy about it, being as he is 4-2 up in what might prove the last set, but he is overruled and they\u2019re off as well! The tournament referee is on court, and discussing the future with Federer and Wawrinka. And after a brief chat, and even though no rain has fallen as yet, play is suspended with the score 3-3 in the fourth set. There are mean, dark clouds gathering above Roland Garros, and the players could be forced off by rainfall at any time. It might be too late to stop Nadal, though: he\u2019s broken in the third set, and leads Nishikori 6-1, 6-1, 3-1. It\u2019s two injury-affected years since Wawrinka last went past the second round of a Grand Slam, but some of the tennis he is producing here is pretty close to Peak Stan. There\u2019s a backhand crosscourt passing shot in this game that is an absolute snorter. But sadly for him \u201cle maestro Roger Federer est de retour\u201d. There aren\u2019t many players who could live with what Wawrinka is producing here, but Federer is managing it. He wins a couple more break points (he\u2019s had 16 now, taking one), but Wawrinka holds. It\u2019s 3-2 in the fourth set, on serve. Federer wins two break points on the Wawrinka serve. The first is saved with a fabulous serve down the middle, the second with a thunderous serve out wide followed by a killer forehand. Another excellent forehand, this one more finessed, gives Wawrinka game point, which he loses. And so fortune continues to fluctuate \u2013 Federer wins another break point, his 15th of the match (one converted) \u2013 before Wawrinka eventually holds. Absolutely compelling, this. Absolutely right: Djere was beaten in round three, and Paire in round four (also in five sets). Nishikori has called on the trainer, who is poking the player\u2019s right arm. Nishikori came back from a double break down in the deciding set against Laslo Djere in the last round, but this looks like a comeback too far. Meanwhile Rafael Nadal\u2019s stroll on Chatrier continues. He has sealed the second set, and leads Nishikori 6-1, 6-1. Federer wins the third set on the tie break! At 3-6 Wawrinka holds a couple of service points to keep the battle going, but he then stands so far back to return a second serve that he makes his own life more complicated than it really ought to have been and ends up netting an underpowered backhand. Federer leads 7-6, 4-6, 7-6! This Federer match is absolutely stonking entertainment. The first point of the tie-break includes an excellent backhand approach from Federer, a brilliant forehand passing shot from Wawrinka, and an absolutely impossible backhand volley winner from Federer. It\u2019ll take another tie-break to separate Federer and Wawrinka and decide the third set on Lenglen. On Chatrier, Nadal is 4-1 up in the second, serving and basically being completely awesome. Wawrinka wins a break point and a chance to retake control of the third set. A drop shot brings Federer to the net, but the great man is perfectly happy to be there and puts away a lovely volley. He takes control of the next point, forcing Wawrinka to hoist up an underpowered defensive lob, but Fed mistimes his smash, which balloons wide! From there Federer turns to serve-volleying on his first serve, saves the break point and holds! As, on Chatrier, does Nadal, who leads 3-1 in the second set now. Nadal has broken right back again, and leads 2-1 in a second set in which neither he nor Nishikori has held serve. A couple of unexpected momentum-shifts later, Nishikori has broken back to level the second set against Nadal at 1-1, and Wawrinka has held serve, finishing the game with a phenomenal backhand down the line, to take the third set to 5-5! Nadal wins the first set against Nishikori 6-1, and then breaks in the first game of the second set for good measure. Federer, meanwhile, has executed a stunning turnaround: a few moments ago he was a break down in the third set, now he\u2019s just earned a second set point, with a beautifully-judged lob (Wawrinka\u2019s decision to leave it was less well judged). Federer earns his ninth break point against Wawrinka and this time, for the first time, he wins it! Or rather, Wawrinka surrenders it, with a limp, overhit forehand from midcourt. It\u2019s 4-4 there, in the third set. Wawrinka breaks to take a 4-3 lead in the third set against Federer, who is struggling at the moment! The same is not true of Nadal, who has taken control of the first set against Nishikori. The Spaniard has just broken a second time, and leads 5-1. Here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell on Jo Konta: Johanna Konta\u2019s Paris dream refuses to end, as she buried an in-form Sloane Stephens on the rebuilt clay of Court Philippe Chatrier, 6-1, 6-4 to become the first British semi-finalist here since Jo Durie in 1983. It was a stunning performance, one of the best in her career, 71 minutes packed with searing serves, six aces among 25 winners, to leave the 2018 finalist clueless from start to finish. \u201cThat was one of the best claycourt matches \u2013 ever,\u201d was Chris Evert\u2019s final judgment \u201cI could not see this coming. But all credit to Jo Konta. I\u2019m speechless. Not even giving her a glimpse ... Jo Konta I take my hat off to you.\u201d Much more here: Nishikori has lost his first service game and is 2-0 down to Nadal. The Spaniard has a 10-2 head-to-head advantage, with both defeats coming on hard courts. Rafael Nadal is on court and has just started his match against Kei Nishikori. The Spaniard served first, and has won the first game to 15. Wawrinka roars to a 40-0 lead but Federer doesn\u2019t stop fighting and battles back to deuce. Stan drops a backhand on the line to earn another set point, which he greets with a roar and a fist-pump, and he takes it to level the match. It\u2019s Wawrinka 6-7, 6-4 Federer! Federer holds to love \u2013 after Wawrinka did likewise; in fact there have been 12 consecutive points won on serve \u2013 but Wawrinka is about to serve to level the quarter-final at a set apiece. There is nobody in this draw who wouldn\u2019t be brought to a state of absolute terror by watching that Konta performance. It might be hard to maintain that ludicrously high level, but if she can she\u2019ll be hard to stop. More chat from Konta: \u201cIt was a great performance, I thought. I was really pleased with the level I played, more than anything. Sloane is a reat player and I knew going into the match that it was going to be difficult. I\u2019m just really pleased. The serve is definitely something I\u2019m looking to utilise. I\u2019m just happy I\u2019m able to do that right now. I\u2019m just so pleased with each match that I\u2019m involved in, I\u2019m really pleased with the work I\u2019m doing with my team and overall just enjoying my tennis.\u201d \u201cTo play on this court, this is my first match on Chatrier, to be out here and play at the level I did against one of the best players in the world, I\u2019m just really proud of myself,\u201d says Konta. So she should be. That was a simply incredible performance, a near-irresistible display of power, aggression and accuracy. On Chatrier, Wawrinka has broken in the second set, which he leads 3-1. Second set: Konta* 6-1, 6-4 Stephens Konta starts the game with an ace, and continues it with a service winner. It\u2019s her 18th consecutive point won on serve in this set, a ludicrous run she proceeds to break with a double fault. She\u2019s not delayed for long, though: another unreturnable serve down the middle and she has two match points. Stephens thinks she\u2019s saved the first when her forehand is called in, but Konta asks the umpire to check the mark, and she confirms it was wide! Konta is through in straight sets! Second set: Konta 6-1, 5-4 Stephens* At 15-0 Konta forces Stephens into the net and has an easy passing opportunity, but with the whiff of a double-break victory in her nostrils she misses her chance, Stephens guesses the right way and puts the volley away. That\u2019s the cushion she needs to win the game to 30, and Konta will now serve for the match. Second set: Konta* 6-1, 5-3 Stephens The first point is a statement of intent from Konta, starting with a fantastic first serve down the T \u2013 which Stephens miraculously manages to return reasonably well \u2013 and won with a pinpoint forehand. It\u2019s another hold to love, completed with a forehand drop shot from well behind the baseline, which gives Stephens absolutely no chance. Second set: Konta 6-1, 4-3 Stephens* Stephens is famously fast around the court, but she has stopped chasing any but the weaker Konta shots, or those that head down the central third of the court. She still holds to 15, though, thanks to some fine serving and one wild backhand return. But having failed to win a single point against Konta\u2019s serve in this set she must now break, and has only two more opportunities to do so. Second set: Konta* 6-1, 4-2 Stephens Konta\u2019s fourth service game of the second set, and Stephens still hasn\u2019t won a point. Just phenomenal. Second set: Konta 6-1, 3-2 Stephens* Konta\u2019s second drop shot of the match is in no way as good as her first, and is dismissed by Stephens for a winner. That\u2019s the first point of a straightforward hold, featuring two service winners and an absolutely vicious forehand. Meanwhile Federer has won the first set against Wawrinka, taking the tie-break 7-4. Second set: Konta* 6-1, 3-1 Stephens The first drop shot of the match has Stephens sprinting netwards, and by the time she reaches the ball she\u2019s practically in it, which is where the ball ends up. Konta ends the game with an ace, and is yet to drop a point on her serve in this second set. Second set: Konta 6-1, 2-1 Stephens* The most fractional of dips by Konta, who hits a couple of shot very marginally long, and then a forehand return very wildly wide, giving Stephens a foothold in the set. Second set: Konta* 6-1, 2-0 Stephens Stephens is starting to look broken in spirit. She chases down a deep, vicious forehand and sends back a defensive shot that lands in, but from there she doesn\u2019t even try to prolong the rally, letting Konta hit the ball into an empty court while she trudges back to her mark for the next point. Konta holds to love, and is playing absurdly well. Meanwhile on Lenglen, Wawrinka and Federer will settle the first set with a tie-break. Second set: Konta 6-1, 1-0 Stephens* At 30-30 Konta bounces her way to victory, hitting a backhand of such wild loopiness that even after running right to the back of the court and leaping as high as she possibly can Stephens can\u2019t get anything on it. The American saves the ensuing break point but swiftly concedes another; this time Konta approaches the net and Stephens hits a passing shot that whips across court but lands an inch wide! Konta leads by a set and a break! First set: Konta* 6-1 Stephens Stephens pretty much surrenders this game, once Konta wins the first point with a second serve that bounces up into the American\u2019s body and can\u2019t be returned. A service winner and an ace later Konta has three set points: Stephens saves the first, drawing her opponent to the net before passing, then Konta miscues a forehand off the frame of her racket and long, but she wins the game, and the set, at the third attempt! Meanwhile it\u2019s still going with serve on Lenglen, Wawrinka currently leading 5-4. Federer, though, is winning his service games with ease, taking 92% of points on his first serve (to Wawrinka\u2019s 83%) and 80% on second serve (33%). Wawrinka has saved four break points so far. First set: Konta 5-1 Stephens* At 0-15 Stephens misses her first serve, and her second serve bounces invitingly to Konta\u2019s backhand. She absolutely lashes it crosscourt for a winner, a shot of frightening aggression and accuracy. The next she wins with a backhand down the line, and that\u2019s three break points. Stephens saves one, Konta saves the next for her with a wild forehand return, but a killer forehand takes the next point and Konta is up a double break! First set: Konta* 4-1 Stephens Konta didn\u2019t win a single rally in this game. When Stephens got the ball back in play, she won the point. However, she didn\u2019t get many balls back in play. A couple of forehand winners put Stephens 0-30 up, but the next time Konta has to play a groundstroke it\u2019s 40-30, and though the American wins that point to take it to deuce, two more service winners take the game. First set: Konta 3-1 Stephens* Konta has shifted up into top gear now, and at this moment she is bettering Stephens. The third point is a fine example, the pair trading crosscourt forehands until Konta eventually nailed one too deep and too hard and Stephens couldn\u2019t get it back. It\u2019s soon 15-40, and though Stephens saves one break point with a phenomenal driven forehand, she surrenders the next with a backhand that drops long! First set: Konta* 2-1 Stephens Konta holds to 15 and even the point she lost was emphatically bossed, although she ended it by hitting her forehand winner, with Stephens marooned on the other side of the court, six inches wide. First set: Konta 1-1 Stephens* Both players have rapidly hit their straps, trading clean, powerful strokes from the baseline. Stephens has a considerably easier time holding her serve than Konta did, though, taking the game to 15 and ending it with a very fine deep, spinning serve that forced Konta too wide. First set: Konta* 1-0 Stephens Konta overhits a forehand and then a first serve, Stephens pouncing to take a 0-30 lead with an excellent, deep forehand. Konta fights back to 30-30 only to concede a break point. She saves that, has a few game points of her own and finally holds a lengthy and very promising game. By the time it ends, Wawrinka is already 2-1 up on Lenglen, with serve. Ready to rock. Stephens won the toss, and chose to receive. The players are out and preparing for action. I\u2019ll be concentrating initially on Konta v Stephens, but will keep a beady eye on action on Suzanne Lenglen. Here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell on Jo Konta and her latest coach, Dimitri Zavialoff. She and Sloane Stephens have played only twice, both this year, and Konta has won both matches. Most recently, she beat Stephens 6-7, 6-4, 6-1 in Rome last month. We have only four matches of senior, singles tennis ahead of us today, but they\u2019re good \u2019uns. First up, it\u2019s Stan Wawrinka v Roger Federer on Suzanne Lenglen, with Federer holding a 22-3 head-to-head advantage over his compatriot. Wawrinka\u2019s last victory over Federer was in the quarter-finals at Roland Garros in 2015, the year he won the title, and all three Wawrinka wins have come on clay, the other two in Monte Carlo in 2014 and 2009. Counting only games on clay, Federer\u2019s head-to-head lead is only 4-3. Meanwhile, on Philippe Chatrier, it\u2019s Johanna Konta v Sloane Stephens for a place in what would be the Briton\u2019s third Grand Slam semi-final. Order of play Philippe Chatrier (from 1pm BST) (7) Sloane Stephens v Johanna Konta (26) (7) Kei Nishikori v Rafael Nadal (2) Suzanne Lenglen (from 1pm BST) (24) Stan Wawrinka v Roger Federer (3) Marketa Vondrousova v Petra Martic (31)",

      "bodyText": "Johanna Konta, playing the best tennis of her career, is two wins away from being the first British champion at the French Open since Sue Barker 43 years ago but she is determined to stick to the low-key attitude that has transformed her season \u2013 and possibly her career. On day 10 of the championships, she destroyed the world No 7 and 2018 Paris finalist Sloane Stephens 6-1, 6-4 in 71 minutes on a hot and dusty Court Philippe Chatrier to reach the semi-finals, where she will face the young Czech Marketa Vondrousova. She later downplayed a performance that the seven-times Roland Garros champion Chris Evert described as \u201cone of the best clay-court matches ever\u201d. Konta said when asked if this was her best ever win: \u201cI had a good quarter-final against Simona [Halep] at Wimbledon. It\u2019s difficult to compare. There are so many things I want to experience this fortnight that are individual to this tournament.

      "bodyText": "A crucial warning about the danger posed by the terrorist who led the London Bridge attack was not passed to a police investigation into him more than 18 months before the atrocity took place, an inquest has heard. The revelation about the apparent failing came during evidence at the Old Bailey in London on Tuesday from a senior Metropolitan police counter-terrorism officer who began investigating Khuram Butt in 2015 over concerns he was planning a UK atrocity. The senior detective, known only as witness M, said a call from Butt\u2019s brother-in-law Usman Darr in September 2015 to the anti-terrorist hotline was not passed to him or his team and could have been an early warning of the danger Butt posed. The error was not contained in the public version of two reports into the 2017 terrorist attacks in the UK written for the government and by parliamentarians. On 3 June 2017, Butt, 27, and two other terrorists killed eight people during a 10-minute attack in which they ran over pedestrians then stabbed people with 12-inch (30cm) knives. The inquests into the deaths heard a high priority investigation called Operation Hawthorn was launched into Butt in 2015 by MI5 and police. Witness M said it was immediately known Butt associated with a banned extremist group, al-Muhajiroun, in which the radical preacher Anjem Choudary was a key figure. Butt was initially assessed as aspiring to carry out an attack, but lacking capability, witness M said, with MI5 leading the inquiry and passing intelligence to Scotland Yard\u2019s counter-terrorism command. Questioned by Jonathan Hough QC, counsel to the inquests, the officer said it was \u201cwrong\u201d that the call from Butt\u2019s family warning of his growing extremism did not come to him. Hough read out a note of the brother-in-law\u2019s call: \u201cThe caller to the anti-terrorism hotline states that he has noticed radical changes in the personality of Khuram Butt. Butt has been distributing anti-western texts, WhatsApp and links to jihadi-type sites. \u201c[Butt] has become increasingly extreme in his views.\u201d Hough asked: \u201cWould you accept that where you have the situation of a family member calling to express concerns about somebody who happens to be under investigation, it\u2019s very unsatisfactory that the investigation team doesn\u2019t hear of that report?\u201d Witness M replied: \u201cIn short, yes. It denied us, really, the option of discussing that information with MI5, and how it fitted into the bigger picture, and denied us the option of what action to take subsequently to receiving that information.\u201d Witness M explained how information received by the anti-terrorist hotline was treated: \u201cSo, just as a general process, you phone the anti-terrorist hotline, it goes into our 24-hour reserve office, it gets recorded, and this is the exact record of what was said. It would then get passed to our intelligence section for assessment, and where needed, dissemination, and then there will be activity or not on the back of that assessment.\u201d Hough continued: \u201cSurely the fact that somebody is prepared to do this tells you something about the degree of concern that the subject is generating in those around them?\u201d \u201cI agree,\u201d replied the officer. Later witness M said human error and a lack of supervision were to blame: \u201cThis was not satisfactory, this should have been shared with the investigation [into Butt] and MI5.\u201d The detective said Darr was never spoken to about his concerns over Butt. The information was instead passed to teams investigating al-Muhajiroun and its successor groups, which are linked to scores of people who became involved in terrorism. Last week, the inquest heard Darr had to be physically separated from Butt in September 2015 after becoming enraged when Butt defended Islamic State for burning to death a captured Jordanian pilot, which was filmed and released as a propaganda video. The Guardian understands the error in handling the warning information about Butt to the hotline was contained in the private full version of reviews carried out by police and MI5 themselves, which was overseen by the barrister David Anderson QC. Butt is believed to be the first terrorist to have killed while under active investigation by police and MI5. Witness M said counter-terrorism investigators were under huge pressure, which ratcheted up even further after the November 2015 Paris attacks and after Westminster was attacked on 22 March 2017. The investigation into Butt was twice suspended by MI5. \u201cI can\u2019t stress strongly enough, just post-Paris, what the operating environment was like after that event within the UK and abroad,\u201d the officer said. \u201cIt was an unprecedented time for us and across MI5 and the police. Post-Paris \u2026 just threw up new attack planning, sustained attack \u2013 planning \u2026 It was a very intensive period.\u201d On 21 March 2017 the investigation into Butt was suspended by MI5 and did not resume until six weeks later on 5 May, less than a month before the London Bridge attack. Witness M said: \u201cThe reason for suspension was in relation to resourcing constraints.\u201d The detective said he did not know Butt was associating with the men who would be his fellow attackers: Rachid Redouane, 30, who bought the knives, and Youssef Zaghba, 22. He also did not know that nearly every day Butt was teaching young children at an Islamic school in east London, as well as attending Sunday swimming sessions. Witness M said police consulted prosecutors in 2015 about potential charges against Butt for disseminating terrorist material, but did not have enough evidence. Earlier on Tuesday, the inquest heard one of the victims died after being stabbed through the heart. James McMullan, 32, from Brent in north-west London, had been watching football in a nearby pub when he became caught up in the attack. A Home Office forensic pathologist, Robert Chapman, told the inquest McMullan was stabbed with such force that a knife pierced his breastbone and punctured his heart. Another of those stabbed suffered six knife wounds. Alexandre Pigeard, 26, a French restaurant worker, also died quickly, Chapman said. One wound to his neck cut the jugular vein. As well as McMullan and Pigeard, those who died were Chrissy Archibald, 30, from Canada, Sebastien Belanger, 36, a French chef, Kirsty Boden, 28, a nurse from Australia, Ignacio Echeverr\u00eda Miralles de Imperial, 39, a Spanish national, Xavier Thomas, 45, a French national, and Sara Zelenak, 21, an Australian national. MI5 is due to face questions next week as the inquest continues.",

A \u00a31,000 investment placed when he started at the firm in 1988 would have risen to \u00a323,000 by the time he left.</p>\n    <p>Woodford accidentally fell into fund management and hadn\u2019t heard of the term until he rocked up in the City in the 1980s sleeping on his brother\u2019s floor while looking for a job. He got his first break in insurance, before drifting into fund management. He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn\u2019t pass the RAF\u2019s aptitude test, and instead read economics and agricultural economics at the University of Exeter.</p>\n    <p>Feeling he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, he set up his own firm Woodford Investment Management in 2014, on an industrial estate near Oxford. Within two weeks of launching, he had raised \u00a31.6bn, a UK record, and it quickly grew to \u00a316bn. In its first full year his flagship fund returned 16% and Woodford, a devotee of veteran US investor Warren Buffett, was dubbed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/oracle-of-oxford-sees-red-as-stock-picking-powers-misfire\">\u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p>Asked if he ever doubted his judgment, Woodford once said: \u201cDaily. You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying \u2018everybody go away, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u2019. You\u2019ve always got to expose yourself to criticism and the analysis that you may be wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Woodford went on to say that the secret of successful fund management was a balance of arrogance and humility. \u201cYou have to have a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction. If you didn\u2019t, you would end up with a portfolio that looks very much like the index. But, equally, you must have the humility to accept that you will get things wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rupertneate\"><b>Rupert Neate</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Those redemptions contributed to a total \u00a3600m decline in the value of the fund last month; it shrank in size to \u00a33.7bn, compared with a peak of \u00a310.2bn in May 2017.</p> \n<p>A request by Kent county council to pull more than \u00a3263m from the fund on Friday is believed to have prompted the ban on redemptions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/04/neil-woodford-fund-manager\">Neil Woodford: star fund manager mixes arrogance and humility</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The local authority said there was a unanimous vote of its pension committee to redeem its investment last week after news of the fund\u2019s dramatic drop in value.

      "bodyText": "The City stock-picker Neil Woodford has experienced another blow after a decision to block investors from pulling cash from his flagship fund caused share prices to fall in his listed fund and a number of other companies where he is a key investor or which sell his funds. Woodford\u2019s Patient Capital Trust Fund, which is listed on London\u2019s FTSE 250 index, tumbled as much as 20% in early trading before closing 7.2% lower at 71p a share. The investment group Hargreaves Lansdown, whose clients last year accounted for more than 30% of Woodford\u2019s now blocked Equity Income Fund, was the second biggest faller in the FTSE-100, down 4.6% at 2,126p. Among companies in which Woodford is a big investor, NewRiver REIT, a property investment business, was down 4.9% and the Stobart Group infrastructure firm was down 4.3%. Investors were spooked by news on Monday that Britain\u2019s best-known fund manager had gated his Equity Income Fund, barring thousands of investors from pulling out their cash, for at least 28 days. Investors are believed to be still liable for fees of up to 1.7% despite the suspension. Woodford was forced to temporarily close the fund after a steady flow of investors pulling out cash turned into a flood. Withdrawals topped \u00a3187m in May alone. Those redemptions contributed to a total \u00a3600m decline in the value of the fund last month; it shrank in size to \u00a33.7bn, compared with a peak of \u00a310.2bn in May 2017. A request by Kent county council to pull more than \u00a3263m from the fund on Friday is believed to have prompted the ban on redemptions. The local authority said there was a unanimous vote of its pension committee to redeem its investment last week after news of the fund\u2019s dramatic drop in value. But the sudden suspension blocked the council from withdrawing the funds, which account for about 4% of its \u00a36.4bn pension fund investments. The council said the suspension announcement was unexpected. \u201cKent county council is disappointed that, as a major investor in the fund, we did not receive this prior notification,\u201d it said. The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association urged the City regulator to step in. It represents local government and workplace pension schemes, some of which are also Woodford clients, including Kent county council. \u201cThe concern now is that pressure builds and matters escalate further or uncontrollably \u2013 which would not be helpful for anyone,\u201d a spokesperson for the association said. \u201cTo avoid this it\u2019s important that clarity for investors is forthcoming as soon as possible and, should it be required, regulators step in to ensure their interests \u2013 and the interests of the thousands of pensions scheme members \u2013 are protected.\u201d The Financial Conduct Authority said it was aware of the suspension and was in contact with the firm, but declined to comment further. Woodford has been stung by his optimism about smaller domestic stocks, which have underperformed since the Brexit vote, prompting investors to pull their cash. He has also backed a number of unquoted investments, which can be difficult to turn into cash when investors decide to redeem. Woodford paid himself and his business partner Craig Newman nearly \u00a337m in the 2017-18 financial year. The investor exodus is an embarrassment for Woodford as he marks the five-year anniversary of the launch of his eponymous fund.

It was codenamed Operation Neptune, and it aimed to push Nazi Germany out of occupied France. Five beaches in Normandy, codenamed Omaha, Utah, Juno, Sword and Gold, were the main targets for landing a large number of troops by sea.</p>\n    <p>At 10pm on 5 June 1944, troops began departing from British shores to head across the Channel. Five assault groups set sail under darkness in an armada of about 7,000 vessels. Just after midnight on 6 June, aerial bombardment of enemy positions on the Normandy coast began. Special operations troops were also parachuted into France.</p>\n    <p>US troops landed on Omaha and Utah beaches at about 6:30am. About an hour later Canadian forces landed at Juno, and British troops landed at Gold and Sword. Soldiers had to get off their boats, wade through the water, and seize control of the beach, all the while under heavy and sustained fire from German defensive positions.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How was the plan kept secret?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Despite involving a large number of troops, keeping D-day secret was vital to the success of the operation. A disinformation campaign had led the Germans to believe that Operation Fortitude was the main plan for the allies to invade the continent, via a two-pronged attack involving Norway and Calais. Even once the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/d-day\">D-day</a>&nbsp;landings had begun, German commanders were convinced they were just a diversionary tactic before the real invasion.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it called D-day?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The D in D-day actually has no particular significance to Operation Neptune. It was common practice in the military to make plans that used the term, where the D stands for the day when operations commenced. Military planners also set H-hour, the time at which a plan was to begin.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happened next?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>By the end of the day, the allies had disembarked more than 135,000 men and 10,000 vehicles on to the beaches, and established bridgeheads of varying depths along the Normandy coastline. This came at the cost of 4,400 allied troops being killed, with thousands more injured or missing. There were also heavy casualties among German troops and French civilians.</p>\n    <p>By 19 August, the allied forces had pushed down far enough to begin the battle to liberate Paris. German troops surrendered the French capital on 25 August 1944, two and a half months after D-day.</p>\n    <p><b>Martin Belam</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cDonald Trump is a divisive figure but from my point of view, the president of the US has been invited to join in the commemorations of Europe being freed from the tyranny of fascism.

In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \u2018stuff\u2019 as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \u2018future high streets\u2019 fund under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2019?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond\">Philip Hammond</a>, has announced a digital services tax will come into force next year.

      "bodyText": "The Czech Republic witnessed its biggest political protest since the fall of communism after an estimated 120,000 people gathered in Prague to demand the resignation of the prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161. Waving Czech and EU flags, demonstrators filled Wenceslas Square, the scene of euphoric rallies 30 years ago that ushered in the velvet revolution and ended communist rule in the former Czechoslovakia. Television footage showed crowds stretching the length of the square, a distance of nearly half a mile, bringing the city centre to a halt and fulfilling organisers\u2019 hopes of an impressive show of opposition strength. Holding banners saying \u201cResign\u201d, protesters \u2013 including some who had travelled from distant locations \u2013 voiced anger over Babi\u0161\u2019s continuation in office despite mounting scandals over the misuse of EU funds. The mixed social makeup suggested anger had reached beyond liberal, relatively cosmopolitan areas around Prague, where opposition to the prime minister has always been strong. \u201cHe\u2019s like a mafia boss and he\u2019s the worst politician in the Czech Republic \u2013 he reminds us of communism,\u201d said Dagmar Kmochova, a shop owner from Kutna Hora, a town 50 miles east of Prague. Feelings at Tuesday\u2019s rally \u2013 the latest in a series of anti-Babi\u0161 events \u2013 were running high after the leaked disclosure of a preliminary European commission auditors\u2019 report accusing the Czech leader of conflicts of interest over his ties to an industrial conglomerate, Agrofert, that receives large EU subsidies. Hours before the demonstration, Babi\u0161, the Czech Republic\u2019s second-richest man, launched a blistering counterattack, using a parliamentary debate to describe the report as an \u201cattack on the Czech Republic\u201d aimed at destabilising the country. That explanation cut little ice at Tuesday\u2019s demonstration, which followed four earlier rallies in the Czech capital in the past six weeks. \u201cBabi\u0161 is an oligarch. He is like [Silvio] Berlusconi but worse,\u201d said Vaclav Bozdech, a retired clerk, who was wearing a mask of the prime minister\u2019s face with the letters StB stamped on the forehead in reference to the prime minister\u2019s alleged role as a secret agent for the communist-era secret police. \u201cHe thinks he owns the Czech Republic and he isn\u2019t even Czech. He is a Slovak gangster and they were glad to get rid of him. He is like the hijacker of a plane and we are his hostages.\u201d A rally in Wenceslas Square two weeks ago attracted at least 50,000 people. Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Min\u00e1\u0159, a spokesman for A Million Moments for Democracy, the group organising the protests, told Tuesday\u2019s gathering it had doubled the previous attendance. He pledged to ratchet the pressure up further by announcing plans for an even bigger rally on 23 June in Prague\u2019s Letn\u00e1 Park \u2013 the venue of a rally in 1989 credited with presaging the final end of the communist regime \u2013 saying Wenceslas Square was no longer large enough to accommodate the growing protests. Babi\u0161, 64, who became prime minister in 2017, has repeatedly said he will never resign. After police recommended in April that he face fraud charges over alleged misuse of EU funds, he responded by sacking the justice minister in his coalition government and installing a close ally, Marie Bene\u0161ov\u00e1. Babi\u0161\u2019s opponents say the EC audit appears to uphold a complaint by Transparency International that the prime minister is breaking conflict of interest rules by retaining effective control of Agrofert despite supposedly putting it into a trust. \u201cMr Babi\u0161 is the beneficial owner of the Agrofert group companies and, since February 2017, of the two trust funds, which he fully controls, and therefore has a direct economic interest in the success of the Agrofert group,\u201d the commission report said. It said his government functions were \u201ccompromised\u201d by his involvement in budget decisions affecting Agrofert, and the Czech Republic could be forced to repay millions of euros in subsidies. David Ondr\u00e1\u010dka, the director of Transparency International in the Czech Republic, predicted Tuesday\u2019s protest would be a \u201cnail in Babi\u0161\u2019s political coffin\u201d. He said: \u201cHe cannot survive this public pressure and these EU reports. He knows that the EU budget and the Czech budget will no longer serve as an ATM where he can pick up whatever he needs. He will never surrender easily but with mounting public anger, smart opposition moves and proper institutional pressure I believe he will no longer be prime minister.\u201d Babi\u0161, who has dismissed the accusations as an \u201corganised plot\u201d, called the commission audit \u201cvery dubious\u201d and pledged the Czech Republic would not repay any subsidies. \u201cEuropean bureaucrats despise Czech laws.

      "bodyText": "Labor\u2019s new leadership team has flagged it will stay firm in its support of controversial medevac legislation, which allows sick refugees on Manus Island and Nauru to be evacuated to Australia. While the government\u2019s push to repeal the law still needs to be debated by the Labor caucus and shadow cabinet, the new leader, Anthony Albanese, and shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, have both expressed support for the medical evacuation regime, which passed into law against the government\u2019s will in February. Since the medevac laws passed parliament in February, 20 people have been transferred to Australia for treatment, with another 40 brought to Australia under existing processes. Labor\u2019s support for the legislation, which the government has vowed to repeal as a priority when parliament resumes next month, hinges on the successful provision of urgent medical care for sick refugees and the fact that the minister retains discretion to refuse entry of an individual on security grounds. \u201cThese changes ensure sick people in offshore processing centres can receive the medical care they need, without compromising our strong border protection arrangements,\u201d Keneally told Guardian Australia. \u201c(And) the minister has full powers to reject a transfer on security and serious criminality grounds.\u201d Keneally has come under fire since her appointment as the party\u2019s new shadow home affairs minister for saying in a 2017 opinion piece that remaining asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru should be brought to Australia. \u201cThere is a solution to \u2026 the Nauru and Manus Island problem that doesn\u2019t depend on the whims of an idiotic and unpredictable US president: bring the refugees to Australia,\u201d she wrote. But Keneally has since hardened her position, saying she supports Labor\u2019s official platform that no one who attempts to come by boat to claim asylum will be settled in Australia. Applications under the medevac laws are being administered by the Medical Evacuation Response Group (Merg), which has reported that it is receiving an average of about 11 applications a day, with doctors triaging a daily average of 8.2 claims. The Coalition, which suffered a historic defeat on the floor of parliament for the laws to come into effect, will need the support of crossbench senators to successfully repeal the legislation. The Centre Alliance senators Rex Patrick and Stirling Griff have indicated they will not budge on their position, meaning the government would have to cobble together support from other independents if Labor remained supportive of the laws. The Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie, who is expected to return to Canberra once the Australian Electoral Commission declares the state\u2019s senate result, may be critical to the government\u2019s chances of getting the 39 votes it needs to repeal the law. The latest count forecasts the Coalition will have 35 seats in the new Senate, with Labor and the Greens to hold 34. One Nation has two senators and the Australian Conservatives has one.",

Adani, in its latest statements about its job figures says the number of ongoing operational jobs at the mine would not be 1,800, but between 800 and 1,500, based on mines of similar size in Queensland.</p> <p>A spokeswoman said there would also be \u201c1,500 direct jobs and 6,750 indirect jobs created during ramp up and construction on the Carmichael project\u201d.</p> <p>Adani has not specified which of these would be associated with construction of the mine and which would be for the rail line from the mine to Abbot Point.</p> <p>The company\u2019s current jobs forecast is smaller than the 10,000 jobs it originally promoted when it was planning a mine producing 60m tonnes of coal per year (it now plans an output of 10m tonnes), a figure that has regularly been cited by Australian federal MPs.</p> <p>That 10,000 figure has also been subject of contention since 2015, when Adani\u2019s own consultant told a court the project would create 1,464 jobs at a time the company was still planning the larger mine.</p> <h2>What others say</h2> <p>\u201cAdani has made different jobs promises to different audiences at different times,\u201d Tom Swann, a senior researcher at the Australia Institute, says.</p> <p>Swann has <a href=\"https://medium.com/@TheAustraliaInstitute/explained-adanis-continuously-changing-jobs-figures-e2a67baac540\">followed</a> Adani\u2019s jobs claims over many years and compared them to other industries in Queensland.</p> <p>He cites Australian Bureau of Statistics data that shows the number of jobs in renewable energy in the state almost doubled from 2016 to 2018 to reach more than 5,000. Much of this increase is being driven by large-scale solar and there is more construction in the pipeline.</p> <p>A 2017 Deloitte <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/au/Documents/Economics/deloitte-au-economics-great-barrier-reef-230617.pdf\">report</a> put the number of jobs supported by the Great Barrier Reef, which is under threat from climate change caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, at 64,000.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/04/qa-labor-made-huge-error-in-being-silent-over-coal-joel-fitzgibbon-says\">Q&amp;A: Labor made 'huge error' in being silent over coal, Joel Fitzgibbon says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Swann questioned why Adani\u2019s current jobs forecasts for ongoing work, which the company is basing on mines of similar size, were not more concrete.</p> <p>\u201cIt is unusual they have now declined to make a specific promise about ongoing employment,\u201d he said.</p> <p>One thing that is clear is that Adani has been posting fresh advertisements for roles since gaining some of the final approvals it needs before preparatory construction can start at the mine. There are currently 14 positions listed on the <a href=\"https://jobsportal.adaniaustralia.com/search-results?keywords=%22Adani%20Australia%22&amp;industryId=0&amp;page=1&amp;daysToSearch=30&amp;sort=relevance&amp;distance=25\">Adani jobs portal</a>.</p> <p>On Monday, the Adani Australia Facebook page posted that it was \u201crecruiting for more than 50 jobs as pre-project works ramp up\u201d and encouraged interested workers to email a cover letter and CV.</p> <p>\u201cWe remain committed to Townsville and Rockhampton as the primary hubs of employment for the Carmichael Project, with regions such as the Whitsunday, Isaac, Central Highlands, Mackay, Charters Towers and Gladstone regions also benefiting from our project,\u201d a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>\u201cThe mine will not be automated. We will use the same conventional coal mining techniques and equipment used in other Queensland coal mines.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been presented as a jobs bonanza for Queensland, but there are fresh questions about Adani\u2019s Carmichael project and the employment it will create in regional Queensland. It comes after the reemergence of an interview with the Nationals MP, Bridget McKenzie, now the agriculture minister, on Sky News. In the interview, from late 2018, McKenzie discusses the Carmichael mine and the number of jobs that will be available. \u201cI think it\u2019s great news they\u2019ll be employing 1,500 through the construction phase and around about 100 in ongoing,\u201d she says. The figure she cites for ongoing work is a vastly smaller number than anything Adani has ever said publicly. It is unclear why McKenzie said what she did or where that figure came from. When asked, McKenzie\u2019s office said her comments were made in November and Adani had since reviewed its numbers. \u201cThe figure placed on the number of jobs that Adani would require for ongoing operations was made in November last year and it is very pleasing to see that Adani have reviewed these figures, indicating that up to 1,800 ongoing positions could be created at their operations, based on other Queensland coal mines of a similar size,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cWe unequivocally support creating jobs in regional Australia and if Adani say there could be up to 1,800 ongoing jobs resulting from their mine operations, that is a great opportunity for central and northern Queenslanders, their families and their communities.\u201d What Adani says The confusion doesn\u2019t end there. Adani, in its latest statements about its job figures says the number of ongoing operational jobs at the mine would not be 1,800, but between 800 and 1,500, based on mines of similar size in Queensland. A spokeswoman said there would also be \u201c1,500 direct jobs and 6,750 indirect jobs created during ramp up and construction on the Carmichael project\u201d. Adani has not specified which of these would be associated with construction of the mine and which would be for the rail line from the mine to Abbot Point. The company\u2019s current jobs forecast is smaller than the 10,000 jobs it originally promoted when it was planning a mine producing 60m tonnes of coal per year (it now plans an output of 10m tonnes), a figure that has regularly been cited by Australian federal MPs. That 10,000 figure has also been subject of contention since 2015, when Adani\u2019s own consultant told a court the project would create 1,464 jobs at a time the company was still planning the larger mine. What others say \u201cAdani has made different jobs promises to different audiences at different times,\u201d Tom Swann, a senior researcher at the Australia Institute, says. Swann has followed Adani\u2019s jobs claims over many years and compared them to other industries in Queensland. He cites Australian Bureau of Statistics data that shows the number of jobs in renewable energy in the state almost doubled from 2016 to 2018 to reach more than 5,000. Much of this increase is being driven by large-scale solar and there is more construction in the pipeline. A 2017 Deloitte report put the number of jobs supported by the Great Barrier Reef, which is under threat from climate change caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, at 64,000. Swann questioned why Adani\u2019s current jobs forecasts for ongoing work, which the company is basing on mines of similar size, were not more concrete. \u201cIt is unusual they have now declined to make a specific promise about ongoing employment,\u201d he said. One thing that is clear is that Adani has been posting fresh advertisements for roles since gaining some of the final approvals it needs before preparatory construction can start at the mine. There are currently 14 positions listed on the Adani jobs portal. On Monday, the Adani Australia Facebook page posted that it was \u201crecruiting for more than 50 jobs as pre-project works ramp up\u201d and encouraged interested workers to email a cover letter and CV. \u201cWe remain committed to Townsville and Rockhampton as the primary hubs of employment for the Carmichael Project, with regions such as the Whitsunday, Isaac, Central Highlands, Mackay, Charters Towers and Gladstone regions also benefiting from our project,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cThe mine will not be automated. We will use the same conventional coal mining techniques and equipment used in other Queensland coal mines.\u201d",

The invitation for every Australian to join the journey is real and this is a team the nation can be be proud of. It\u2019s not just the scorelines, but how these women inspire us to keep pushing, to keep striving for more and to never say die.</p> <p>When asked what their football journey meant to them using just one word, most Matildas said \u201cchallenging\u201d, and rightly so. But one player\u2019s response was perhaps more telling: Sam Kerr said \u201cfun\u201d.</p> <p>With this outlook, Kerr has elevated herself right up there with the likes of Hegerberg as one of the best players in the world and could now lead her team to a quarter-final, a semi-final and, maybe, even further.</p> <p>While we, as fans, can dare to dream of winning the whole thing, the team will only be thinking of their first game against Italy on Sunday.

How they deal with it varies; some thrive off the nerves, others less so. Experience will play its part; the likes of Clare Polkinghorne and fellow veteran Lydia Williams will be treating the opener in Valenciennes as just another game. And it would come as no surprise to see a big smile on Aivi Luik\u2019s face if she takes to the field as a World Cup debutant at the age of 34.</p> <p>American legend April Heinrichs has suggested it will be the fastest-paced World Cup yet seen and it\u2019s difficult to argue with that assessment. The ability to retain possession for longer under extreme pressure with goalscoring intent is becoming the most valued of playing styles. But also a new level of tactical sophistication is expected to evolve this tournament \u2013 not so much the tempo of the game but more how each team connects, adapts and thrives in such a pressure pot atmosphere.</p> <p>So if you haven\u2019t already, try and clear your schedule for the next month, there will be few matches you want to miss. Whether it\u2019s first-timers Jamaica or Scotland, or hosts France and defending champions USA, history will be made one way or another as these women continue to strive for greatness.</p> <ul> <li><p>Joey Peters is a former Australia midfielder who won 110 caps for the Matildas.

It\u2019s not just the scorelines, but how these women inspire us to keep pushing, to keep striving for more and to never say die. When asked what their football journey meant to them using just one word, most Matildas said \u201cchallenging\u201d, and rightly so. But one player\u2019s response was perhaps more telling: Sam Kerr said \u201cfun\u201d. With this outlook, Kerr has elevated herself right up there with the likes of Hegerberg as one of the best players in the world and could now lead her team to a quarter-final, a semi-final and, maybe, even further. While we, as fans, can dare to dream of winning the whole thing, the team will only be thinking of their first game against Italy on Sunday. It\u2019s standard preparation mode for a major tournament to save players from the getting overwhelmed by looking any further into a potential four-week pilgrimage. The players won\u2019t want to expend any unnecessary energy as, needless to say, it is an intense experience for them. How they deal with it varies; some thrive off the nerves, others less so. Experience will play its part; the likes of Clare Polkinghorne and fellow veteran Lydia Williams will be treating the opener in Valenciennes as just another game. And it would come as no surprise to see a big smile on Aivi Luik\u2019s face if she takes to the field as a World Cup debutant at the age of 34. American legend April Heinrichs has suggested it will be the fastest-paced World Cup yet seen and it\u2019s difficult to argue with that assessment. The ability to retain possession for longer under extreme pressure with goalscoring intent is becoming the most valued of playing styles. But also a new level of tactical sophistication is expected to evolve this tournament \u2013 not so much the tempo of the game but more how each team connects, adapts and thrives in such a pressure pot atmosphere. So if you haven\u2019t already, try and clear your schedule for the next month, there will be few matches you want to miss. Whether it\u2019s first-timers Jamaica or Scotland, or hosts France and defending champions USA, history will be made one way or another as these women continue to strive for greatness.

      "bodyText": "It was dismissed as \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201ccompletely false\u201d. But Annika Smethurst\u2019s report suggesting the nation\u2019s surveillance agency, the Australian Signals Directorate, was seeking to broaden its powers to spy on Australian citizens without their knowledge was immediately referred for police investigation. The home affairs boss, Mike Pezzullo, confirmed the referral shortly after the April 2018 story\u2019s publication, during a Senate estimates hearing on 21 May. But he simultaneously took a swipe at the News Corp political editor for running the \u201cworst example of ill-informed reporting regarding home affairs\u201d. His minister, Peter Dutton, who had won the battle to establish a home affairs department, taking in Australia\u2019s spy agencies, the AFP as well as border protection just a few months earlier, dismissed the report as \u201cnonsense\u201d. On Tuesday, 401 days after Smethurst published her report, AFP officers raided her home as she was preparing to go to work, with a warrant to search her home, her phone and her computer. News Corp labelled the raid \u201coutrageous and heavy handed\u201d, and said Smethurst had complied with the warrant, but gave no further information outside of confirming her identity. \u201cNews Corp Australia has expressed the most serious concerns about the willingness of governments to undermine the Australian public\u2019s right to know about important decisions governments are making that can and will impact ordinary Australian citizens,\u201d her employer said in a statement. \u201cWhat\u2019s gone on this morning sends clear and dangerous signals to journalists and newsrooms across Australia.\u201d AFP officers spent the bulk of the day going through Smethurst\u2019s home, as journalists, the National Press Gallery, Digital Rights Watch, the media union and politicians, including Centre Alliance, condemned the raid. The AFP confirmed the raid in a statement just after midday, but gave no indication of the potential crime. It later made clear, in a follow-up tweet, that the warrant was in response to \u201cthe alleged publishing of information classified as an official secret, which is an extremely serious matter with the potential to undermine Australia\u2019s national security\u201d, indicating Smethurst and News Corp were a target, not just the source of the leak. The government, with Labor, passed sweeping new anti-espionage laws in June 2018, but insisted exemptions had been put in place to protect journalists reporting on matters within the public interest. Those laws are not thought to be retrospective. The Law Council, which stressed it could not comment on an individual case, said it was \u201cpossible for a journalist to be charged with an unauthorised disclosure offence\u201d under the criminal code. \u201cWhether a defence might be available would depend on the individual circumstances of the case,\u201d the Law Council president, Arthur Moses, said. \u201cOne would expect that this defence is something that is carefully considered by any law enforcement or prosecuting authorities before the commencement of any proceedings against any journalist in respect of a contravention of section 122.4A of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).\u201d Section 79 of the Crimes Act, while rare, also lists \u201ccommunicating or allowing someone to have access to prescribed information without authorisation with the intention of prejudicing national security\u201d among its offences. The AFP statement made clear any information it may have gathered in its raid of Smethurst\u2019s property would not lead to any arrests \u201ctoday\u201d. But the raid, coming just weeks after the Coalition was re-elected and more than a year after the story was first published, raised concerns over how public interest journalism could be threatened. Smethurt\u2019s report had understandably made waves. It pointed to correspondence between the defence secretary, Greg Moriarty, and Pezzullo, suggesting a proposal to allow the ASD to \u201cproactively disrupt and covertly remove\u201d domestic cyber threats, \u201cby hacking into critical infrastructure\u201d. Under the proposal, which Smethurst reported she had seen, Dutton and the defence minister, then Marise Payne, would have sign-off powers to allow digital surveillance of Australian citizens without the need for a warrant, or the attorney general\u2019s go-ahead. Dramatic escalation of powers The top-secret proposal, on documents which were labelled AUSTEO, which stands for Australian Eyes Only, suggested the new home affairs agency was seeking a dramatic escalation of spying powers, which had already been hinted at during the Snowden leak. Under sections eight and 12 of the Intelligence Services Act 2001, the Australian Signals Directorate, previously known as the Defence Signals Directorate, cannot gather data on Australian citizens, with its mandate directed outside the nation\u2019s borders. It can assist the AFP and Asio with technical advice if the agencies have a warrant to investigate a person of interest related to national security investigations, including terrorism and organised crime. The Snowden leaks revealed in 2013 the surveillance agency had offered to share raw metadata it had collected on Australian citizens with the nation\u2019s allies, leading to concerns the agency was potentially acting outside of its legal, and operational, mandate. In regards to Smethurst\u2019s story, the denials focused around the suggestion, paraphrased in the April 2018 article, that the powers would allow the ASD to access Australians\u2019 digital communications and bank records. Following the report\u2019s publication, Moriarty, Pezzullo and the director of the ASD, Mike Burgess, took the somewhat rare step of issuing a media statement disputing its contents. \u201cThe cyber security function entails protecting Australians from cyber-enabled crime and cyber-attacks, and not collecting intelligence on Australians. These are two distinct functions, technically and operationally,\u201d the statement read. \u201cIn the ever changing world of cyber security as officials we should explore all options to protect Australians and the Australian economy. \u201cWe would never provide advice to Government suggesting that ASD be allowed to have unchecked data collection on Australians \u2013 this can only ever occur within the law, and under very limited and controlled circumstances.\u201d Around the same time, Dutton also continued to dispute the report, but left wriggle room for change. \u201cWe are concerned about threats to our banking system, by both state and non-state actors, both onshore and offshore. Not just our banking system, but our electricity grids. We\u2019re worried about obviously foreign influence into elections,\u201d he said in April 2018. \u201cBut, as for some claim that there\u2019s going to be some spying taking place on Australian citizens, it\u2019s complete nonsense. If there was to be any look at ways in which we could try and address the cyber threat more effectively, it would be accompanied by the usual protections, including warrant powers either with the attorney general or with the relevant justice, whatever the case might be.\u201d \u201cIf we had a capacity to disrupt, for example, the live-streaming of children being sexually exploited, would we explore ways that we could do that within the law? Of course we would.\u201d The next month, in Senate estimates, Pezzullo also said discussions were ongoing. \u201cWithout confirming or denying the existence or content of the specific documents which the correspondent claims to have seen, I can inform this committee that I have not proposed, nor would I ever propose, that ASD\u2019s powers be expanded in the way described in this false reporting,\u201d Pezzullo told the home affairs estimates committee on 21 May 2018. \u201cThe only matter in issue, in terms of potential new powers and functions, as the minister for home affairs has since indicated, is whether ASD\u2019s capabilities could and should be employed in the disruption of cybercrime where the whole, or parts, of the relevant cyber network are hosted on Australian telecommunications infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd secondly, whether ASD\u2019s capabilities could and should be employed in the active defence of certain critical national networks.\u201d Falling foul of home affairs Smethurst was not the only journalist to fall foul of home affairs on Tuesday. The Sydney radio 2GB and Sky News presenter Ben Fordham reported he had been contacted by officials from the agency in relation to a story he broadcast on Monday, reporting up to six illegal boat arrivals were thought to be en route to Australia. Fordham had reported Dutton had admitted a week before \u201cthere could be a wave of illegal vessels headed for Australia after 20 Sri Lankan asylum seekers were sent back\u201d and he had been informed by \u201ca senior source\u201d in the home affairs department that Dutton was in Sri Lanka \u201cbecause \u2018there could be up to six boats in play\u2019.\u201d On Tuesday afternoon, Fordham said he had been contacted by home affairs officials wanting his help in finding the source of the leaked information he had broadcast. \u201cThe chances of me revealing my sources is zero,\u201d he told 2GB listeners. \u201cNot today, not tomorrow, next week or next month. There is not a hope in hell of that happening.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A close schoolfriend of a man accused of lying about a VIP paedophile ring and claiming they murdered a boy in a hit-and-run has told a court he has no recollection of any such incident. Carl Beech told a Scotland Yard detective that a group of high-profile establishment figures murdered three boys, including his childhood friend \u201cScott\u201d, who he claimed was run down in a car in a revenge attack. Steven White, who attended school with Beech from the age of 11, said he had no memory of any boy being knocked down and killed, although he did recall something similar happening to a chemistry teacher. Beech, who pleaded guilty to possessing indecent images of children at a separate trial, is accused of fabricating his claims, which sparked a \u00a32m police inquiry that closed without a single arrest being made. He alleged the abuse gang included the former prime minister Edward Heath, the former home secretary Leon Brittan, Field Marshal Lord Bramall and the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, among others. Beech, a former nurse from Gloucester, denies 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one of fraud over a \u00a322,000 criminal compensation claim he received. On Tuesday, White told jurors at Newcastle crown court that he and Beech attended the Rivermead school, which became Tudor school, in Kingston-upon-Thames, south-west London. They were close friends with another boy, Jonathon Budd, he said. White told the court: \u201cWe were rejects no one else spoke to. I think we bonded. We were all probably socially awkward and introverts, spending time in the library and talking.\u201d Asked by Tony Badenoch QC, prosecuting, if he could recall any boy being knocked over and killed while at the school, White said he could not. He said he remembered hearing, aged about 14, that a teacher had been killed while helping someone change a tyre on a motorway. White said he had not seen Beech for around 35 years until coming to court to give evidence. Their friendship had ended when he stayed on at school to take his A-levels and the defendant left aged 16. Budd, giving evidence via videolink, said he remembered Beech being a well-behaved boy with a good school attendance. \u201cHe didn\u2019t get into bad behaviour, he didn\u2019t have detentions, he was a good kid and a nice friend,\u201d Budd said. \u201cMy parents liked me being friends with him because he was one of the good kids.\u201d Earlier in the trial, jurors heard that Beech tearfully recounted to a Scotland Yard detective how, in the summer of 1979, the paedophile gang killed a boy for being his friend. He claimed Scott, a dimpled, freckled boy, was hit by a car in Kingston and left in a pool of blood. Beech was then dragged away into a vehicle, he claimed. He alleged he had ignored a warning by a former head of MI5, Michael Hanley, not to have friends. \u201cThey warned me a number of times but I was selfish, I didn\u2019t listen,\u201d he told the detective. The trial continues.",

After an opening stand of 83 between Luis Reece and Billy Godleman, Derbyshire lost wickets regularly as first Ben Raine and then, in a flash of inspiration, Gareth Harte took aim. Godleman made 66 before becoming the first of Harte\u2019s victims in a spell of three for 10. An unbroken seventh-wicket stand of 53 between Matt Critchley and Leus du Plooy added late grit to Derby\u2019s batting.</p> <p>At Aigburth, no play was possible after lunch on a good day for wading birds. The morning session was dominated by <strong>Lancashire</strong>\u2019s vigorous lower-order against <strong>Leicestershire</strong>. Tom Bailey hit a powerful 57, going to his fifty with a six that rose over the sight screen and on to the grass tennis courts beyond. When he departed that left Josh Bohannon. But as well as he worked the singles and, as his partners ran low, hit out, he was stranded on 98 when Richard Gleeson fenced and was caught on the stroke of lunch. </p> <p>Bohannon, two short of what would have been a maiden hundred for Lancashire, threw his bat in the air in frustration before pausing for breath and returning to shake his partner\u2019s hand. As the players retired inside for cards, Lancashire could comfort themselves that with their 449 total they had achieved five batting points for the first time in two years \u2013 and as the pitch sweated nicely under layers of plastic sheeting.</p> <p>Play was truncated at Lord\u2019s but not enough for <strong>Middlesex</strong>, whose top order was picked apart by <strong>Sussex</strong>\u2019s Ollie Robinson, moving the balls both ways to five slips under obliging skies. He finished with four for 23, including a spell of three for eight in 14 balls. At 61 for four, Middlesex need 282 more to make Sussex bat again, 51 to avoid their worst defeat since the second world war.</p> <p><strong>Glamorgan</strong>\u2019s last pair had great fun in the morning session at the County Ground, flashing 95 from 69 balls to take the total well past 500. Michael Hogan crashed two sixes in what was only his third first-class fifty. Rain truncated <strong>Northamptonshire</strong>\u2019s reply but Ben Curran made a sweet 48 in an unbeaten opening stand. They still trail by 270 runs.</p> <p>At Headingley, Dom Bess too was left stranded in the 90s, nine runs short of what would have been the second first-class century of his career. Bess and Jonny Tattersall added 90 for <strong>Yorkshire</strong> before Tattersall fell and the tail collapsed. <strong>Essex </strong>faced six overs before the rain, time enough for Alastair Cook to edge Ben Coad to slip for two.</p> <p><strong>Warwickshire</strong> pottered to 311 for seven against <strong>Nottinghamshire </strong>at Edgbaston, with Adam Hose 84 not out; and at Guildford <strong>Surrey </strong>struggled against the Overton twins, who grabbed two wickets each. Surrey, 188 for five, trail <strong>Somerset</strong> by 156.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cf6b1ad8f08d22e907f0489\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-04T18:05:52.920Z\">7.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And thus ends the wettest day</strong> of the season so far. Every match touched by rain, except Chester-le-Street, where Durham still hold the ascendancy. Still lots to play for - though neither <strong>Leicester</strong>, nor <strong>Middlesex</strong>, nor <strong>Northants</strong> will sleep easy tonight. It\u2019s tricksy at Guildford - will the <strong>Overtons</strong> roll over Surrey in the morning? Join me here to find out. Thanks for sticking with it through the dank, damp day.

      "bodyText": "Rain badly affected play at all but one of the Championship matches, spreading its fingers first north, then south and east, sparing only Chester-le-Street. There, nearly a full day was possible and Durham finished happier, with Derbyshire still 112 runs behind. After an opening stand of 83 between Luis Reece and Billy Godleman, Derbyshire lost wickets regularly as first Ben Raine and then, in a flash of inspiration, Gareth Harte took aim. Godleman made 66 before becoming the first of Harte\u2019s victims in a spell of three for 10. An unbroken seventh-wicket stand of 53 between Matt Critchley and Leus du Plooy added late grit to Derby\u2019s batting. At Aigburth, no play was possible after lunch on a good day for wading birds. The morning session was dominated by Lancashire\u2019s vigorous lower-order against Leicestershire. Tom Bailey hit a powerful 57, going to his fifty with a six that rose over the sight screen and on to the grass tennis courts beyond. When he departed that left Josh Bohannon. But as well as he worked the singles and, as his partners ran low, hit out, he was stranded on 98 when Richard Gleeson fenced and was caught on the stroke of lunch. Bohannon, two short of what would have been a maiden hundred for Lancashire, threw his bat in the air in frustration before pausing for breath and returning to shake his partner\u2019s hand. As the players retired inside for cards, Lancashire could comfort themselves that with their 449 total they had achieved five batting points for the first time in two years \u2013 and as the pitch sweated nicely under layers of plastic sheeting. Play was truncated at Lord\u2019s but not enough for Middlesex, whose top order was picked apart by Sussex\u2019s Ollie Robinson, moving the balls both ways to five slips under obliging skies. He finished with four for 23, including a spell of three for eight in 14 balls. At 61 for four, Middlesex need 282 more to make Sussex bat again, 51 to avoid their worst defeat since the second world war. Glamorgan\u2019s last pair had great fun in the morning session at the County Ground, flashing 95 from 69 balls to take the total well past 500. Michael Hogan crashed two sixes in what was only his third first-class fifty. Rain truncated Northamptonshire\u2019s reply but Ben Curran made a sweet 48 in an unbeaten opening stand. They still trail by 270 runs. At Headingley, Dom Bess too was left stranded in the 90s, nine runs short of what would have been the second first-class century of his career. Bess and Jonny Tattersall added 90 for Yorkshire before Tattersall fell and the tail collapsed. Essex faced six overs before the rain, time enough for Alastair Cook to edge Ben Coad to slip for two. Warwickshire pottered to 311 for seven against Nottinghamshire at Edgbaston, with Adam Hose 84 not out; and at Guildford Surrey struggled against the Overton twins, who grabbed two wickets each. Surrey, 188 for five, trail Somerset by 156. And thus ends the wettest day of the season so far. Every match touched by rain, except Chester-le-Street, where Durham still hold the ascendancy. Still lots to play for - though neither Leicester, nor Middlesex, nor Northants will sleep easy tonight. It\u2019s tricksy at Guildford - will the Overtons roll over Surrey in the morning? Join me here to find out. Thanks for sticking with it through the dank, damp day. I\u2019m off to somewhere warm. Sleep well! Division One Somerset 344 v Surrey 188-5 Surrey trail by 156 with 5 wickets remaining Warwickshire 311-7 v Nottinghamshire Yorkshire 390 v Essex 18-1 Essex trail by 372 with 9 wickets standing Division Two Durham 293 v Derbyshire 181-6 Lancashire 449 v Leicestershire Middlesex 138 &amp; 61-4 v Sussex 481-9 dec (after day three) Middlesex need another 282 to avoid innings defeat Northamptonshire 209 &amp; 68-0 v Glamorgan 547 (after day three) Northants need another 270 to avoid innings defeat Play also abandoned at Edgbaston and Lord\u2019s. Play will restart at 5.30 at Guildford, weather permitting. Play called off for the day at Headingley. A pied wagtail heads towards the tent, tiny claws sinking into the Aigburth sponge. Don\u2019t be too upset but the round-up calls. Rain seems set in everywhere except Chester-le-Street, where Durham have the sniff of a first-innings lead. DIVISION ONE HEADINGLEY: Rain. Yorkshire 390 (Lyth 95, Kohler-Cadmore 83, Bess 91 not out) v Essex 18-1. EDGBASTON: Bad light stopped play. Warwickshire 311-7 (Sibley 87, Hose 84 not out) GUILDFORD: Rain, inspection at 445. Somerset 344 v Surrey 123-4 (Foakes 57) DIVISION TWO AIGBURTH: no more play today. Lancashire 449 (Livingstone 114, Bohannon 98 not out) v Leicestershire CHESTER-LE-STREET: Tea. Durham 293 (Lees 63, Burnham 67; Rampaul 5-77)v Derbyshire 147-6 (Harte 3-10) THE COUNTY GROUND: Rain. Day 3: Northamptonshire 209 (Rossington 77) and 68-0 (Curran 48) v Glamorgan 547 (Billy Root 229) LORD\u2019S: Rain. Day 3: Middlesex 138 &amp; 61-4 (Robinson 4-23) v Sussex 481-9 dec Just as the tent begins to leak, play has been called off at Aigburth. Play will resume in the World Cup match at Cardiff in ten minutes. The match will be 41 overs per side, with a 10-minute break between innings. Barry Harte points out that I forgot, \u201c table topping Hampshire!\u201d Good spot! In fact I meant Hampshire and their formidable attack, instead of Essex. (Sorry Porter and Siddle).My heart is still with Somerset though. Now, as the rain sets in everywhere except the north east, is their moment of glory - Durham have the ascendancy. The mighty Rushworth, the meddlesome Harte (3-10), the reliable Raine, have Derby 133 for six, still 160 behind. Derby 128 for four. Why isn\u2019t it raining in Durham? What larks! So, as we\u2019re here for a while - who is going to win the Championship? Somerset with their jolly band of men, Tres, Leach, Bartlett? Essex and their formidable attack? A weakened Surrey? The Yorkies? Mullaney gets a couple and Warwickshire reach 311 for seven before the rain falls again. Only Durham v Derby ploughs on. Derby 109-2, trail Durham by 184. Godleman 60 not out. Did anyone see Sky\u2019s late night analysis-chat thing with Bob Willis last night? Tymal Mills was on and I thought he was bloody great. Intelligent, modest, knowledgeable. His back problems and subsequent diagnosis had somehow completely passed me by when I had my fingers in other pies. For others like me, this is from cricinfo: \u201chis career reached a watershed in 2015 when he was diagnosed with a congenital back condition: his spinal cord and vertebrae are unusually close together and bowling fast too often can agitate his spinal cord. It threatens to consign him to a future as a white-ball bowler, and he has to tailor his training carefully even to cope with that but with Twenty20 growing in importance neither Mills nor Sussex - nor even England - have abandoned hope that he can make an impact.\u201d Who wants to relive Brian Lara\u2019s 501? Go on then, as you\u2019ve all been so good. A second for Raine as Madsen falls for a duck. Derby 83 for 2. As Warwickshire bat on, and on, and on. 292 for five off 125 overs. So, we have two games currently being played - at Lord\u2019s and Chester-le-Street. Ooooh! Derby lose a wicket - Reece for 34, off, aptly, Raine. Derby 83/1. Smashing picture from Lord\u2019s - five slips for Ollie Robinson. Rain crosses the Pennines, stares at Headingley, and decides to stay awhile. Play suspended, Essex 18 for one. Bad light has stopped play at Guildford too, Surrey 123/4. And it is raining at Cardiff, where Sri Lanka are 182 for 8 off 33 overs. Derby batting soundly after lunch at Chester-le-Street, 72/0. Middlesex, ahem. 51-4. Ollie Robinson 4-18. Ben Foakes falls at Guildford, just after passing fifty. Surrey 119/4. Joverton 2-16, and I\u2019ve just clocked that he has been recalled from his loan spell at Northants which was supposed to last till June 13. Injuries forced Somerset\u2019s hand. Alastair Cook gone! Coaded in the third over of Essex\u2019s reply. Essex 3/1. Sorry we\u2019ve had a few technical issues. All fine now - I hope. The rain is pretty set in here at Liverpool, no play also at Birmingham and Northants. But elsewhere, we play on... The rain turns steady. Groundstaff pull the sheets on to the middle, one, two, three, four, five, unfolding like never-ending plastic duvets. Round the ground brown tip up plastic seats sit damp and empty while drizzle plops into unfinished pints of beer with a sigh. Men in late middle age zip up and settle in for a stoical hour sitting in the rain. Why? We\u2019ve no chance now: DIVISION ONE Somerset 344 v Surrey 101-3 (Foakes 49) Warwickshire 291-5 (Sibley 87, Hose 77 not out) v Nottinghamshire Yorkshire 390 (Lyth 95, Kohler-Cadmore 83, Bess 91 not out) v Essex Division Two Durham 293 (Lees 63, Burnham 67; Rampaul 5-77)v Derbyshire 54-0 Lancashire 449 (Livingstone 114, Bohannon 98 not out) v Leicestershire Day 3: Middlesex 138 &amp; 24-1 v Sussex 481-9 dec Day 3: Northamptonshire 209 (Rossington 77) and 68-0 (Curran 48) v Glamorgan 547 (Billy Root 229) Lunchtime scores to follow. And sweet god, Gleeson flails at Klein and is caught behind. Bohannon whirls his bat in the air, and walks off , before thinking better of it and walking back to his partner and shaking hands. Not out 98 - and that, my friends, is the way it goes. Lancashire 449 all out; Klein 3-89. When you\u2019re, say, in the south of France, fall asleep with your sunglasses on, wake up and wonder why everything is so gloomy? That\u2019s what it is like at Aigburth right now - except with no big reveal when you lift the specs to be dazzled by the sky. Bohannan has it in for Parkinson. Four. Six over his head. 98 not out - a waft of declaration passes in front of the tent. Sri Lanka and Afghanistan slow-cooking up a storm at Cardiff. Sri Lanka 175 for six off 29 overs, K Perera 75 not out. Nabi\u2019s 4-28 from eight has turned it from flat to curious to intriguing. They\u2019ve taken an early lunch at Lord\u2019s - Middlesex 24 for one, trail by 319. Northants 35 without loss in the wake of Glamorgan\u2019s ridiculousness. Fingers crossed for wee Ben Curran. Derby\u2019s openers make a smart start - 47/0. Bess loses Tattersall, but plugs away. Now 75 not out, can he be the yorkshireman (of sorts) who makes the magic three figures? Yorks 371 for seven. At Warwickshire, the sloth has escaped. Adam Hose has fifty, and Warwicks do a one-handed chin up with an unbuttoned shirt - 253 for five you say? Foakes and Borthwick rebuilding at Guildford - 39 runs to rescue Surrey from 38/3. England women\u2019s squad to face West Indies on Thursday - Sarah Taylor returns from injury. England squad: Heather Knight (Berkshire, captain), Tammy Beaumont (Kent), Katherine Brunt (Yorkshire), Kate Cross (Lancashire), Sophie Ecclestone (Lancashire), Alex Hartley (Lancashire), Jenny Gunn (Nottinghamshire), Amy Jones (Warwickshire), Laura Marsh (Kent), Nat Sciver (Surrey), Anya Shrubsole (Berkshire), Sarah Taylor (Sussex, wicketkeeper), Fran Wilson (Kent), Lauren Winfield (Yorkshire), Danni Wyatt (Sussex). And a thunder-footed Graham Onions is out for two. Lancs 418 for nine. Bailey, who must have been under instruction to get on with it, cuts once too many times, and is caught by Wright off Dexter for 57. With the unreliable forecast, Lancs presumably relying on not having to bat again. Josh Bohannon 77 not out though... Lancs 415 for eight. It\u2019s overcast and Leicestershire\u2019s openers are feeling twitchy. And in World Cup news, South Africa\u2019s Dale Steyn is out because of his shoulder injury, to be replaced by Beuran Hendricks. Wow and big Tom Bailey steps, heaves and lofts hugely - six! - up and over the sightscreen at the Mersey end, and on to the grass tennis courts beyond. That\u2019s his fifty and Lancashire galloping away here, 410 for seven. News on Joe Burns, Lancashire\u2019s overseas player who had to return back home to Australia early. He has been diagnosed with a protracted post-virus fatigue disorder dating back to an October 2018 viral infection and is recovering with rest and recuperation. He hopes to play cricket again in the near future. Fifty for Dom Bess! Who wouldn\u2019t be happy for him? Fortune can be a bastard as well as a fickle friend, but he\u2019s got the character to (literally) bounce back. Yorkshire 325 for six. They\u2019re off for bad light at Lord\u2019s with Middlesex 24 for 1 (Holden out for five). And the ball has gone out of shape at Headingley. Glamorgan\u2019s No.11 Michael Hogan has fifty! Seven fours and two sixes as his side keep an eye on 450. Surrey 36 for 2, as big hands Trescothick holds on at slip and Rory Burns goes for a Warwickshire-esque 2, off 39 balls. Leicestershire, home of Simon de Montfort, the father of parliaments (and other rather less savoury things), has elected a female chairperson to work alongside a female CEO. The first female double-act in county cricket. And, with a smart straight drive, Josh Bohannon has fifty! Lancashire 371 for seven. Dom Sibley falls for 87, adding just six more runs to his overnight score. Would it be wrong to hope, for the benefit of any spectators, that his replacement gets his skates on? Warwickshire 202 for four. Er, just what is happening to Glamorgan? Timm van der Gugten and Paul Hogan knock up fifty in less than six overs and Glamorgan waltz past 500 towards...six? At Guildford, Stoneman has gone for 21, a wicket for birthday boy Jack Brooks. It\u2019s raining, again. But the men in white play through. A hardy band of supporters round the boundary put up their brollies and fold their papers small and smaller again. Abhijato Sensarma has been thinking about Durham. \u201cAt the moment I start to type out this email, EJH Eckersley is 6* off 55 deliveries in a classical attempt at making useful first-inning slower order runs. His partner-in-crime, MJ Potts is 3* (25) too. As they try to survive out in the middle as long as possible for Durham in the Second Division, I do have to send some love their way. \u201cAfter all, seeing people who aren\u2019t meant to do much with the willow deadbat their way to underrated glory is surprisingly refreshing in a mad era where England scores above 300 in an ODI and still loses!\u201d Hmmm, Eoin Morgan escapes censure for a slow over rate, but Archer and Roy aren\u2019t so lucky. Mohammad Abbas has the ball and we get underway here at a cloudy Aigburgh! Play all round the country - life is good. Mark Stoneman starting like Marcus Trescothick did yesterday - with a six! Surrey 18/0. Paul Horton being greeted happily by lots of Lancashire fans, he was captain of Sefton Park for many years, and played for them this weekend. And, I should have said, a very jolly Eid Mubarak to all readers celebrating today! It has stopped raining at Headingley, play will strike up, but you\u2019ve time for a coffee. And the pitter patter restarts on the canvas roof. Arrived at Aigburth station, to find a sun and the birds tweeting (is there a more technical term?) in the Triffid-sized horse-chestnuts frowning over the rose-filled front gardens. The teams are warming up on the outfield, Leicester disconcertingly all in black, and after an inspection, play will start at a civilised 11.15. Vic\u2019s report from yesterday: Division One Somerset 344 v Surrey 0-0 Warwickshire 181-3 v Nottinghamshire Yorkshire 289-6 v Essex Division Two Durham 254-8 v Derbyshire Lancashire 347-7 v Leicestershire Middlesex 138 &amp; 9-0 v Sussex 481-9 dec (after day two) Middlesex trail by 334 with 10 wickets remaining Northamptonshire 209 v Glamorgan 452-9 (after day two) Glamorgan lead by 243 with one wicket remaining Good morning! A confession: it is wet and ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chilly so I\u2019m writing this in the relative warmth of Liverpool Lime Street before dragging anorak et al to the canvas confines of the Aigburth tent. The forecast round the grounds today is fair-to-miserable, so expect stop-start-stop with a sprinkling of stardust. Lots of intriguing cricket to keep an eye on - can Somerset\u2019s bowlers stick it to Surrey at Guildford (where Jack Leach was concussed by Morne Morkel last year)? Can Warwickshire\u2019s batsmen move into first gear? Yorkshire v Essex is in the balance, as is Durham v Derby. I think Lancs are on top at Aigburth, while Middlesex and Northants can expect to pack their bags tonight with a sad face and a lesson learnt. If you\u2019re still tingling from Pakistan\u2019s take-that-and-party yesterday, don\u2019t forget to keep an eye on Afghanistan v Sri Lanka at Cardiff, OBO here with your two crackers Tom Davies and Rob Smyth. And finally, how can it be 26 years since this?",

      "body": "<p>Johanna Konta has always believed in herself. After her quite superb victory over the American Sloane Stephens on day 10 of the French Open, so do most of her critics, along with a growing army of fans and former players \u2013 including the best clay-courter in the history of women\u2019s tennis, Chris Evert.</p> \n<p>It was not just the result \u2013 a 71-minute 6-1, 6-4 drubbing of the 2018 finalist and US Open champion of a year earlier to reach the semi-finals \u2013 but the ruthless performance, which followed a similarly excellent win in the fourth round on Sunday, when the British No 1 thrashed her friend Donna Vekic in two sets. Before that, there were a string of wins from Rabat to Rome, as she clambered back up the WTA rankings from a low of 47 at the start of the clay season, arriving in the French capital seeded 26th, and convinced she could wipe away the memory of four successive first-round defeats.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jun/04/french-open-quarter-finals-johanna-konta-sloane-stephens-roger-federer-wawrinka-rafa-nadal-nishikori\">French Open quarter-finals: Konta blitzes Stephens in straight sets \u2013&nbsp;live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was that depressing sequence that made people wonder if she had what it takes to leave her impression on the red dirt of Roland Garros. Now she is in a good place to replicate the deeds of Sue Barker in the 70s and Jo Durie in the 80s, the last British women to go this deep in Paris.</p> \n<p>But Konta is not making her charge at the title for them, as she has made clear, politely but firmly. She is doing it for herself \u2013 and quite possibly her dog, Bono, whom she adores and who will no doubt be sitting at the feet of her parents watching on TV back in Eastbourne when she walks on to court on Thursday to face Marketa Vondrousova, the exciting young Czech, who beat the 31st seed, Petra Martic, 7-6 (1), 7-5 in fast- fading light on Court Suzanne Lenglen.</p> \n<p>Evert, who had predicted that her US compatriot would win the quarter-final, perhaps easily, led the accolades on Tuesday . The seven-times French Open champion, whose winning record on clay of 94.55% is the best in her sport\u2019s history, conceded afterwards: \u201cPlaying like this, there isn\u2019t anyone who could beat her. That was one of the best clay-court matches ever. I could not see this coming. I\u2019m speechless. Not even giving her a glimpse \u2026 Jo Konta, I take my hat off to you.\u201d</p> \n<p>Konta has already matched Durie\u2019s feat of getting to the semi-final in 1983, and is now following Barker\u2019s achievements in more ways than one. Barker, known to the current generation for her TV appearances on the BBC as much as her tennis, is the last British woman to win here, and it is an indictment of the game, perhaps, that her triumph over Renata Tomanova in the final was 43 years ago. She also made semi-finals at Wimbledon and Melbourne and reached the fourth round at the US Open \u2013 which Konta has done.</p> \n<p>Now she has the challenge of going two steps further to rank alongside Barker. If she wins the whole show she will return to the top 10 for the first time since 2017, her golden summer, and she will go to Wimbledon, via Eastbourne, with renewed ambitions of winning again.</p> \n<p>It might all fall to pieces, of course, but she showed in her dominance of Stephens, who had recovered from a slow start to eliminate the 2016 champion Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza on Sunday, that she deserves to compete and win in this company.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is not much you can do when someone is playing like that,\u201d Stephens said of Konta. \u201cShe definitely played her game today. I didn\u2019t get a chance to get into the match, but sometimes that happens.\u201d And always for a reason. The reason this time was all on Konta\u2019s racket.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5cf9dd5377b9a8a669d2a3bb64dbe942b991afea\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cf9dd5377b9a8a669d2a3bb64dbe942b991afea/0_0_3500_2324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Konta in action during her quarter-final against Sloane Stephens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Konta in action during her quarter-final against Sloane Stephens.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The only sign of nerves from her was in the first game, when she saved a break point and held through deuce. From there to the end, she bossed nearly every exchange. The first set flew by in 25 minutes. Konta pushed on relentlessly, giving her opponent no chance to get back into the fight.</p> \n<p>She surrendered just one point on her serve in the second set \u2013 with a double fault. That was the difference between them, along with Konta\u2019s power hitting on both wings.</p> \n<p>The American might have thought she was playing herself, so pinpoint direct were the replies across the net. Particularly memorable was a backhand return into the deuce corner that left Stephens gobsmacked and rooted to the clay.</p> \n<p>This was as good as Konta can play, and a deal better than Stephens was managing in response. If Konta had found her best tennis to beat Vekic in the fourth round, this was a notch up. Her challenge was to sustain a level that must have surprised even her \u2013 and probably her low-key coach, Dimitri Zavialoff.</p> \n<p>There was no hiding place for Stephens in the second set, as Konta broke her for the third time. Down a set and 1-3 with ball in hand, the American looked distinctly uninterested until she found a couple of huge forehands and a good serve to hold to love. But she went to the service line after just over an hour needing to hold to stay in the tournament, and she just about hung on. Her final forehand slid into the tramlines \u2013 and only then did Konta\u2019s face reveal her true joy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Johanna Konta has always believed in herself. After her quite superb victory over the American Sloane Stephens on day 10 of the French Open, so do most of her critics, along with a growing army of fans and former players \u2013 including the best clay-courter in the history of women\u2019s tennis, Chris Evert. It was not just the result \u2013 a 71-minute 6-1, 6-4 drubbing of the 2018 finalist and US Open champion of a year earlier to reach the semi-finals \u2013 but the ruthless performance, which followed a similarly excellent win in the fourth round on Sunday, when the British No 1 thrashed her friend Donna Vekic in two sets. Before that, there were a string of wins from Rabat to Rome, as she clambered back up the WTA rankings from a low of 47 at the start of the clay season, arriving in the French capital seeded 26th, and convinced she could wipe away the memory of four successive first-round defeats. It was that depressing sequence that made people wonder if she had what it takes to leave her impression on the red dirt of Roland Garros. Now she is in a good place to replicate the deeds of Sue Barker in the 70s and Jo Durie in the 80s, the last British women to go this deep in Paris. But Konta is not making her charge at the title for them, as she has made clear, politely but firmly. She is doing it for herself \u2013 and quite possibly her dog, Bono, whom she adores and who will no doubt be sitting at the feet of her parents watching on TV back in Eastbourne when she walks on to court on Thursday to face Marketa Vondrousova, the exciting young Czech, who beat the 31st seed, Petra Martic, 7-6 (1), 7-5 in fast- fading light on Court Suzanne Lenglen. Evert, who had predicted that her US compatriot would win the quarter-final, perhaps easily, led the accolades on Tuesday . The seven-times French Open champion, whose winning record on clay of 94.55% is the best in her sport\u2019s history, conceded afterwards: \u201cPlaying like this, there isn\u2019t anyone who could beat her. That was one of the best clay-court matches ever. I could not see this coming. I\u2019m speechless. Not even giving her a glimpse \u2026 Jo Konta, I take my hat off to you.\u201d Konta has already matched Durie\u2019s feat of getting to the semi-final in 1983, and is now following Barker\u2019s achievements in more ways than one. Barker, known to the current generation for her TV appearances on the BBC as much as her tennis, is the last British woman to win here, and it is an indictment of the game, perhaps, that her triumph over Renata Tomanova in the final was 43 years ago. She also made semi-finals at Wimbledon and Melbourne and reached the fourth round at the US Open \u2013 which Konta has done. Now she has the challenge of going two steps further to rank alongside Barker. If she wins the whole show she will return to the top 10 for the first time since 2017, her golden summer, and she will go to Wimbledon, via Eastbourne, with renewed ambitions of winning again. It might all fall to pieces, of course, but she showed in her dominance of Stephens, who had recovered from a slow start to eliminate the 2016 champion Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza on Sunday, that she deserves to compete and win in this company. \u201cThere is not much you can do when someone is playing like that,\u201d Stephens said of Konta. \u201cShe definitely played her game today. I didn\u2019t get a chance to get into the match, but sometimes that happens.\u201d And always for a reason. The reason this time was all on Konta\u2019s racket. The only sign of nerves from her was in the first game, when she saved a break point and held through deuce. From there to the end, she bossed nearly every exchange. The first set flew by in 25 minutes. Konta pushed on relentlessly, giving her opponent no chance to get back into the fight. She surrendered just one point on her serve in the second set \u2013 with a double fault. That was the difference between them, along with Konta\u2019s power hitting on both wings. The American might have thought she was playing herself, so pinpoint direct were the replies across the net. Particularly memorable was a backhand return into the deuce corner that left Stephens gobsmacked and rooted to the clay. This was as good as Konta can play, and a deal better than Stephens was managing in response. If Konta had found her best tennis to beat Vekic in the fourth round, this was a notch up. Her challenge was to sustain a level that must have surprised even her \u2013 and probably her low-key coach, Dimitri Zavialoff. There was no hiding place for Stephens in the second set, as Konta broke her for the third time. Down a set and 1-3 with ball in hand, the American looked distinctly uninterested until she found a couple of huge forehands and a good serve to hold to love. But she went to the service line after just over an hour needing to hold to stay in the tournament, and she just about hung on. Her final forehand slid into the tramlines \u2013 and only then did Konta\u2019s face reveal her true joy.",

But the pair clashed over Change UK\u2019s future direction, with Soubry determined that it should continue as a political party, while Umunna became convinced it could only survive by striking up a close alliance with the Lib Dems. Cable\u2019s party positioned themselves as the leading pro-remain party at the European elections, with a punchy \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d slogan.

With Cable stepping aside, frontrunners for the Lib Dem leadership, Ed Davey and Jo Swinson, have suggested they would welcome new recruits. Swinson said: \u201cAs the European and local election results showed, the old, two-party politics is fracturing. The Liberal Democrats are at the heart of the fight against nationalism and populism and I want to lead this party to grow that movement.\u201d Davey, who had been more sceptical about the idea of an electoral pact with the breakaway group, said: \u201cChange UK\u2019s swift demise shows that my reluctance from the beginning to discuss mergers and pacts, and to hold firm in our belief that the Liberal Democrats are the clear home for all who want to stop Brexit, was the right call.\u201d",

About 3,000 people are estimated to have died and more than 25,000 may have been infected.</p> <p>Phillips, now 37, was diagnosed with mild haemophilia at the age of one but did not have frequent bleeds and did not need to receive factor VIII blood-clotting products until he injured himself in a fall when he was three.</p> <p>A letter sent to his consultant at the Royal Free hospital in north London in June 1985 said he was to be tested for the presence of viruses and it was hoped \u201che would be suitable for the heat-treated trial\u201d. The letter was copied to a pharmaceutical firm, Alpha Therapeutics.</p> <p>Phillips\u2019s mother, Shelagh O\u2019Shea, 59, told the inquiry she was never told he might have been exposed to infection through factor VIII products or that he was being prepared for a medical trial. The NHS letter referred to him as a \u201cvirgin haemophiliac\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI had never heard that expression before,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cThere was never any discussion about him being entered into a trial. I would never have allowed my child to be part of [it]. I would have picked him up and walked out of the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>Phillips\u2019s notes at the time were stamped with the warning \u201cdanger of infection\u201d. The doctor treating him said such a notice was standard in haemophilia cases, the inquiry heard.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea said she did not discover her son was infected with hepatitis C, a potentially fatal disease, until she received a hospital letter in January 1997 \u201ccasually informing me that I was aware that he had hepatitis C\u201d, she said. \u201cThis was the first time I had heard about it. I was shocked beyond belief.\u201d</p> <p>Phillips\u2019s doctors told the inquiry his mother was warned earlier, but the inquiry was shown NHS documents from 1993 that said: \u201cPatient and family unaware at present.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Shea said: \u201cI felt overwhelmed by the deceit. I felt totally and utterly powerless.\u201d</p> <p>Phillips told the inquiry the diagnosis disrupted his life, forcing him away from social situations in case he infected friends. \u201cI became disengaged from school work. It became hard to build friendships with new people. I felt like a walking infection machine. I had a sense of hopelessness because there was no treatment at that stage,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI went into hospital with a non life-threatening disease and came out with a life-threatening disease. Someone saw me as so irrelevant that they can do that to me. When you are treated with that much disrespect you feel utterly worthless.\u201d</p> <p>He eventually underwent a year-long treatment with interferon proteins and the antiviral drug ribavirin at Chelsea and Westminster hospital, which temporarily knocked down his white cell level and cleared the infection.</p> <p>\u201cI managed to clear the virus from my system,\u201d he said, but he was left with anger and fear that the infection might return. He has since had counselling to help him recover and is now married with a young child.</p> <p>There have been renewed calls for compensation for relatives and victims since the inquiry began. Last month Jeremy Corbyn and the leaders of six other parties wrote to the government calling for compensation for those who have been infected or affected by disastrous medical treatments.</p> <p>The hearing continues. </p>",

Phillips, now 37, was diagnosed with mild haemophilia at the age of one but did not have frequent bleeds and did not need to receive factor VIII blood-clotting products until he injured himself in a fall when he was three. A letter sent to his consultant at the Royal Free hospital in north London in June 1985 said he was to be tested for the presence of viruses and it was hoped \u201che would be suitable for the heat-treated trial\u201d. The letter was copied to a pharmaceutical firm, Alpha Therapeutics. Phillips\u2019s mother, Shelagh O\u2019Shea, 59, told the inquiry she was never told he might have been exposed to infection through factor VIII products or that he was being prepared for a medical trial. The NHS letter referred to him as a \u201cvirgin haemophiliac\u201d. \u201cI had never heard that expression before,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cThere was never any discussion about him being entered into a trial. I would never have allowed my child to be part of [it]. I would have picked him up and walked out of the hospital.\u201d Phillips\u2019s notes at the time were stamped with the warning \u201cdanger of infection\u201d. The doctor treating him said such a notice was standard in haemophilia cases, the inquiry heard. O\u2019Shea said she did not discover her son was infected with hepatitis C, a potentially fatal disease, until she received a hospital letter in January 1997 \u201ccasually informing me that I was aware that he had hepatitis C\u201d, she said. \u201cThis was the first time I had heard about it. I was shocked beyond belief.\u201d Phillips\u2019s doctors told the inquiry his mother was warned earlier, but the inquiry was shown NHS documents from 1993 that said: \u201cPatient and family unaware at present.\u201d O\u2019Shea said: \u201cI felt overwhelmed by the deceit. I felt totally and utterly powerless.\u201d Phillips told the inquiry the diagnosis disrupted his life, forcing him away from social situations in case he infected friends. \u201cI became disengaged from school work. It became hard to build friendships with new people. I felt like a walking infection machine. I had a sense of hopelessness because there was no treatment at that stage,\u201d he said. \u201cI went into hospital with a non life-threatening disease and came out with a life-threatening disease. Someone saw me as so irrelevant that they can do that to me. When you are treated with that much disrespect you feel utterly worthless.\u201d He eventually underwent a year-long treatment with interferon proteins and the antiviral drug ribavirin at Chelsea and Westminster hospital, which temporarily knocked down his white cell level and cleared the infection. \u201cI managed to clear the virus from my system,\u201d he said, but he was left with anger and fear that the infection might return. He has since had counselling to help him recover and is now married with a young child. There have been renewed calls for compensation for relatives and victims since the inquiry began. Last month Jeremy Corbyn and the leaders of six other parties wrote to the government calling for compensation for those who have been infected or affected by disastrous medical treatments. The hearing continues.",

      "bodyText": "Update: Wall Street is now hailing Powell\u2019s pledge to take appropriate action to help the US economy ride the trade war rapids. The Dow is now up 414 points at 25,235, a strong gain of 1.6%. Hopes of an imminent rate cut are building! Finally, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has ended the day 29 points higher at 7,214. That\u2019s a gain of 0.4%. Jay Powell\u2019s pledge to do what it takes to address the trade war helped shares to close a little higher. Still, morale was also dampened by the steady drip of poor economic news (from weak construction activity in Britain to a downturn in South Africa). Goodnight! GW A deal to restructure Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group may be close.... the retailer is expected to announce he\u2019ll provide more money to address the firm\u2019s pension deficit. More here: David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, agrees that the luke-warm words from China helped markets recover today. He writes: The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said the trade spat with the US will need to be worked out with additional talks. In the era of heighted trade tensions, any language that isn\u2019t hostile, and advocates further dialogue, is seen as a step forward. The situation is far from diffused, but the absence of aggression has promoted traders to snap up stocks. The FTSE 100 is lagging behind its Continental counterparts as big oil stocks are holding back the London index. The Italian FTSEMIB is holding up well even though the coalition government in Rome is looking a little shaky. There has been chatter of a possible collapse in administration, but it was reported that the two coalition heads, Matteo Salvini, and Luigi Di Maio had a long and cordial telephone conversation, so that should take the heat off Italian government bonds in the near-term. Newsflash: America\u2019s top central banker has pledged to take \u201cappropriate\u201d measures to protect the US economy from the impact of trade wars. It may be a hint that US Federal Reserve could cut interest rates soon, as a growing number of investors suspect. Fed chair Jerome Powell is making the comments at a monetary policy conference in Chicago right now. Powell has told attendees that the Fed is \u201cclosely monitoring the implications\u201d the ongoing trade disputes, which helped to drive markets down last month. He said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know how or when these issues will be resolved. As always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2% objective.\u201d Powell hasn\u2019t explicitly mentioned an interest rate cut, but these comments look like a central banker\u2019s \u2018eyebrow-waggle\u2019 at the markets. A few months ago, the Fed was expected to raise interest rates several times in 2019 and 2020 -- now, the markets are pricing in cuts to borrowing costs, to prevent the US sliding into recession. Just in: American factory orders have fallen, in (yet another) sign that global manufacturing is weak. Orders shrank by 0.8% in April, new official figures show. March\u2019s data has been revised lower too, to a 1.3% increase (from 1.9% before). Demand for durable goods, such as computers and electronics equipment, dropped. Ding Ding! The New York stock exchange has opened higher, following the turnaround in Europe today. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 263 points, or just over 1%, in early trading, as investors grip onto hopes of trade war progress with Beijing and/or Mexico City. Just in: Donald Trump has warned Mexico that he will press on with tariffs on their goods. He told a press conference in London that Mexico needed to do more to prevent migration to the US, saying he \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that Mexico is run by the ... cartels and the coyotes.\u201d Investors are taking comfort from those mollifying comments from China (here) and Mexico (here). European stock markets are all positive, shaking off their earlier losses, on hopes that the trade tensions will ease - before they cause even more damage to the global economy. The oil price is also clawing back some losses, having hit a three-month low this morning. Brent crude is now back around $61 per barrel, from $60.20 earlier. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the oil price is being moved by the latest trade war issues: Against the background of uncertainty over US tariffs on China, Mexico and now possibly India, the market is waiting for new clues before making any decisive trade moves. Mexico\u2019s foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard has also talked up the prospects of an agreement with the US. Ebrard is in Washington on a diplomatic mission to prevent America hiking tariffs on Mexican imports, as threatened by Donald Trump late last week. He\u2019s told reporters that his officials will present a new proposal to control immigration from Mexico to the US tomorrow. It may help placate the White House, which wants the flow of migrants curbed. Ebrard told a news conference that talks have already been productive, pledging: \u201cWe\u2019re going to find common ground, I think... We are ready. China\u2019s latest statement on the trade war with America is a classic blend of carrot and stick. On the one hand, the Ministry of Commerce insists that the trade war will only be resolved through fresh talks, saying: \u201cThe Chinese side always believes that the differences and frictions between the two sides in the economic and trade field will ultimately need to be resolved through dialogue and consultation.\u201d But that conciliatory tone is immediately followed by a reminder that Beijing blames Washington for the recent deterioration in relations (which have seen China\u2019s Huawei blacklisted from trading with US firms...) \u201cHowever, consultations are principled and need to be based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit... It is hoped that the US will abandon its wrong practices and work in tandem with the Chinese side. In the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, we will control differences and strengthen cooperation to jointly safeguard the healthy and stable development of China-US economic and trade relations.\u201d Newsflash: China commerce ministry has called for \u201cdialogue and negotiations\u201d to resole the ongoing trade war with the US. Details to follow... Anxiety over global growth prospects, and fears that stock markets will fall, have pushed the gold price to a three-month high today. Gold has gained 4%, or nearly $50 per ounce, this week to nearly $1,320/ounce - its highest level since the end of February. South Africa\u2019s central bank needs to follow Australia\u2019s lead, and cut interest rates fast, argues Jameel Ahmad of curency trading firm FXTM. He says South Africa\u2019s economic contraction shows that the global economy is weakening, partly due to the ongoing global trade war. Policymakers don\u2019t have time to hang around, given the fears over the global economy, he writes: Emerging markets are having to contend with a tornado of different external headwinds, and these including persistent trade tensions that are adding further downside anxieties to economies that are reliant on resilient global demand. South Africa is just one of the many nations that is heavily exposed to the fears of another world recession arising at the turn of the next decade. The problem that is not helping South Africa, or other emerging markets across the world by any means is that the latest Manufacturing PMIs across the world are confirming further contractions. South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Russia, Poland, Turkey, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom have all seen Manufacturing PMIs contracting in recent weeks. This is a reliable signal that a coordinated world slowdown is close to arriving, and the GDP reading out of South Africa has reinforced these expectations further. South Africa\u2019s currency, the rand, has fallen sharply since the weak GDP figures were released. More gloom! South Africa\u2019s economy has suffered its worst quarter since the financial crisis. South African GDP shrank at an annual rate of 3.2% in the first three months of 2019, new government data shows. That\u2019s twice as bad as expected (it\u2019s effectively a 0.8% contraction quarter-on-quarter). South Africa\u2019s manufacturing, mining and agricultural sectors all shrank, in a blow to newly re-elected president Cyril Ramaphosa. Agriculture industry contracted by 13%, mining fell 11%, while manufacturing decreased by 8.8% year-on-year. The downturn was partly due to a series of national power cuts, as supplier Eskom Holdings struggled to keep the lights on. That badly hurt business and investor confidence. It\u2019s only six months since South Africa emerged from its last recession - now it risks falling into another one, unless growth picks up this quarter. The latest eurozone inflation data is also flashing a warning light. Consumer price inflation across the currency block fell to 1.2% per year in May, new \u2018flash\u2019 figures from Eurostat show. That\u2019s down from 1.7% in April - so a very substantial decline. Eurostat reports that energy prices rose by 3.8% year-on-year in May, down from 5.3% in April. Food, alcohol &amp; tobacco inflation crept up to 1.6% from 1.5%, but services inflation slumped to 1.1%, from 1.9%. Prices of non-energy industrial goods were only up 0.3%, from 0.2% a month ago. Consumers will be pleased, but it will cause serious head-scratching at the European Central Bank. Despite its massive money-printing QE bond-buying programme, inflation is not back at its target of just below 2%. So it\u2019s hard to see how the ECB can raise interest rates anytime soon, as it had once hoped. In better news, eurozone unemployment has dropped to 7.6%, the best since the financial crisis. Today\u2019s UK construction PMI report is surprisingly weak, says Max Jones, relationship director in Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking\u2019s infrastructure and construction team. \u201cThe drop can partly be attributed to a change in focus, with a lot of contractors now placing more emphasis on cashflow rather than revenues. However, many are also feeling the pinch on their working capital, as requirements to pay clients within 30 days become more stringent. Cash will be king in the coming months, and those able to reduce debt while improving cashflow will be in a much stronger position when activity picks up again. Jones adds that some \u201cmegaprojects\u201d are running behind schedule (Crossrail, for example), which is causing anxiety among contractors. It\u2019s only Tuesday morning, and we\u2019ve already had three piece of weak UK economic data, namely: UK construction shrank in May, at the fastest pace in a year (see earlier post) UK manufacturing also contracted last month, at the fastest rate in almost three years (see yesterday\u2019s news story) UK retail sales fell by 2.7% in May, the worst fall since the British Retail Consortium started counting (see this morning\u2019s news story) Tomorrow we discover how the UK service sector fared in May. Economists predict very modest growth (the Services PMI is expected to rise to 50.6, from 50.4 in April). Anything weaker would be another blow. Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit, also blames the confusion over Britain\u2019s departure from the EU for the construction slowdown. \u201cMay data reveals another setback for the UK construction sector as output and new orders both declined to the greatest extent since the first quarter of 2018. Survey respondents attributed lower workloads to ongoing political and economic uncertainty, which has led to widespread delays with spending decisions and encouraged risk aversion among clients. \u201cCommercial building remained hardest-hit by Brexit uncertainty, with construction firms reporting the steepest fall in this category of activity since September 2017. Civil engineering work also dried up in May and a fourth consecutive monthly fall in activity marked the longest period of decline since the first half of 2013. Construction companies often commented that recent tender opportunities for civil engineering work had been insufficient to replace completed projects. \u201cHouse building was the only sub-category of construction output to buck the downward trend in May, but growth remained softer than on average in 2018. This chart shows how Britain\u2019s construction PMI (which measures activity across the sector) has weakened in recent months: Brexit uncertainty is having a chilling effect on UK builders, says Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. Here\u2019s his explanation for why UK construction went into reverse last month: \u201cA fragile dreariness descended on the sector this month with lower workloads leading to the fastest decline in purchasing of construction materials since September 2017. With the continuing uncertainty around Brexit and instabilities in the UK economy, client indecision affected new orders which fell at their fastest since March 2018 and particularly affected commercial activity. \u201cThe previously unshakeable housing sector barely kept its head above water, growing at its weakest level since February as residential building started to lose momentum. The biggest shock however, came in the form of job creation as hesitancy to hire resulted in the largest drop in employment for six and a half years. Not much to be happy about it seems though an easing in some input costs for raw materials offered some relief while energy and fuel prices continued to rise. \u201cThis is unlikely to be nearly enough to turn around the sector\u2019s fortunes, as optimism about the strength of the sector\u2019s future was the lowest since October 2018. Policymakers will need to pull a large rabbit out of the hat, and fast, to improve these difficult conditions and prevent a further entrenchment of gloom and contraction this summer.\u201d Newsflash: Britain\u2019s construction sector has slumped back into a contraction. Activity across UK building firms fell last month, driven by a sharp decline in commercial construction and civil engineering, according to data firm Markit. Markit\u2019s monthly survey of purchasing managers at construction firms also found that new orders fell last month. Builders blamed \u201csubdued domestic economic conditions\u201d, which deterred hesitant clients from committing to new projects. In another blow, business optimism across the sector fell to its weakest since October 2018. Many builders blamed concerns that domestic political and economic uncertainty would dampen business activity growth over the next 12 months. This pulled the UK construction PMI down sharply to 48.6 in May, down from 50.5 in April. That\u2019s below the 50-point level that shows whether activity rose or fell during the month. It\u2019s also the weakest reading since March 2018, when the Beast from the East froze construction output. Markit also found that builders cut jobs at the fastest rate since November 2012. Reaction to follow... Ireland\u2019s factory sector has weakened, mirroring the global slowdown in manufacturing. Activity at Irish manufacturers grew at its slowest rate in nearly three years in May, new figures from data firm Markit shows. Factory bosses reporting that new orders shrank, while the boost from pre-Brexit stockpiling has faded. This pulled Markit\u2019s Irish manufacturing PMI down to 50.4 in May, from 52.5 in April. Here are the key points (more details here). Output posts first fall since UK\u2019s EU referendum New business contracts at fastest pace in six years Purchasing activity declines as firms reduce stockpiling The Woodford debacle could cause significant damage to investor confidence. Will people be as willing to put their money into such funds, if they can suddenly be frozen without warning? Shares in Hargreaves Lansdown, which provides easy access to retail funds (for a fee!), have slumped by 6% this morning - the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. It has been forced to remove the now-frozen Woodford Equity Income from its Wealth 50 list of favourite funds (given recent losses, should it have ever been there?!). Emma Wall, head of Investment Analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, says another Woodford vehicle has also been kicked off the Wealth 50 list. \u201cThe suspension follows a period of underperformance and outflows for the Woodford Equity Income Fund. We are advocates of long-term investing and think Woodford\u2019s multi-decade track record remains compelling \u2013 but we don\u2019t underestimate the disappointment investors must feel with Woodford\u2019s recent performance. \u201cThe suspension is understandably frustrating, but it\u2019s important to remember that the value of your investment will be dependent on the share prices of the portfolio\u2019s underlying holdings, which are not directly impacted by the suspension. \u201cBecause the fund has been suspended we\u2019ve removed it from our Wealth 50 list of favourite funds. We have also removed the Woodford Income Focus Fund, as we would prefer to see a resolution to the dealing suspension before we conduct a review.\u201d It\u2019s a grim morning for investors who backed one-time top stock picker Neil Woodford. Yesterday, Woodford blocked investors from pulling cash from his flagship fund -- called \u2018equity income\u2019 -- after becoming overwhelmed by customer withdrawals following a series of bad market bets. It\u2019s a major, embarrassing blow to Woodford, once the darling of the City for his ability to invest money wisely. He was forced to freeze equity income redemptions after a series of poor punts, often on medium-sized UK firms (the last straw may have been Kier Group, who issued a profits warning on Monday). Investors have been fleeing in recent weeks, forcing Woodford to take the draconian step of locking them in. Another of his vehicles, Woodford Patient Capital Trust, is traded on the London stock market. Traders have been impatiently ditching the stock, sending its shares slumping by 13% to a record low. Technology stocks are vulnerable to global slowdown worries, and the US-China trade war, so it\u2019s notable how far they\u2019ve fallen recently: European stock markets have also fallen in early trading. Technology stocks are the big fallers, following the FAANG losses on Wall Street overnight, followed by healthcare and consumer goods firms. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is down 0.3%, while France\u2019s CAC has lost 0.7%. Only Italy is bucking the trend, up 0.25% after prime minister Giuseppe Conte warned his coalition partners to end their bickering. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says the prospect of antitrust probes into Google, Facebook et al is worrying traders: Markets remain on the hook to the trade war rumblings, but a new war has opened up that threatens equity investors \u2013 a war on tech. What the Fed threatens to give, the DoJ takes away..... Political pressure is building \u2013 lawmakers sniff votes in tackling big tech. The shift really happened last year with Facebook\u2019s scandals, which broken the illusion of Silicon Valley being in it for the little guy. They\u2019re just big corporations out to make money like any other \u2013 the politicians can smell blood. As I noted a year or two ago, I always thought Trump had the hallmarks of a Teddy Roosevelt trust-buster. Anxiety over the economic outlook hit shares in Asia today. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite fell by almost 1%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng has lost 0.65% and India\u2019s Sensex dipped by 0.5%. Investors were particularly jittery after seeing shares in US technology giants slide last night, amid concerns of antitrust investigations into companies such as Alphabet. Overnight, the US Congress announced a new bipartisan investigation into digital markets and the tech industry, looking into giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon for \u201ccompetition problems\u201d and \u201canti-competitive conduct\u201d. Slowdown fears have forced Australia\u2019s central bank to slash interest rates to a record low. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut borrowing costs to just 1.25%, warning that household spending is suffering from low income growth and falling housing prices. It\u2019s the latest sign that the world\u2019s central bankers are turning more dovish, and worried that the economic picture is weakening. Here\u2019s our liveblog on the RBA\u2019s decision: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. How healthy is the world economy? Fears of a global slowdown are building, as America\u2019s pugnacious trade policies threaten to derail the long, slow, recovery from the financial crisis. We saw yesterday that factory output in the UK and eurozone is shrinking, while American factories are growing at their slowest pace in a decade. This is now fuelling calls for US central bankers to slash interest rates before the economy suffers a recession. A chorus of Wall Street economists are now predicting a sharp slowdown in America, as the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports reverberates. Morgan Stanley fears the US could slump by early 2020 unless the trade war calms down. Trump\u2019s latest threat - to impose levies on Mexican imports - has intensified concerns. As JP Morgan analysts put it: \u201cThe latest developments this week are likely to have lasting damaging effects on business confidence. Growth concerns are unlikely to dissipate over the near term, and could in fact build further.\u201d After a turbulent May, analysts fears that the stock markets could remain volatile - with the risk of chunky losses in the months ahead. John Higgins of Capital Economics predicts that the US S&amp;P500 could slide by another 17% by the end of the year - on top of the 7% decline in recent weeks. He warned clients: We remain of the view that the bond market is simply running ahead of the stock market. We think that the equities will \u201ccatch up\u201d in due course. Admittedly, we aren\u2019t explicitly forecasting another recession, just a significant economic slowdown. But our end-2019 forecast of 2,300 for the S&amp;P 500 would only leave it 22% or so below its recent peak. This would be a much smaller drop than the declines seen around the two recessions of the 2000s. Coming up today The latest eurozone inflation figures are out this morning, and likely to show that the cost of living slowed last month. Great news for consumers, but a blow to the European Central Bank\u2019s plans - ahead of its monetary policy meeting on Thursday. A new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s builders is likely to show limited growth last month. The UK construction PMI is tipped to inch up to 50.6, from 50.5 in April, barely above stagnation. Overnight, we\u2019ve learned that UK consumer spending fell at the fastest rate in at least 25 years last month - a worrying sign for the economy. Plus, it\u2019s stock market reshuffle day in Britain. Budget airline Easyjet looks likely to be ejected from the FTSE 100 to make room for sports fashion chain JD Sports. But Marks &amp; Spencer, another laggard, might avoid being kicked out, if the powers at FTSE Russell decide to add its ongoing \u00a3600m cash call to its market capitalisation.

In Europe we have a traditional football pyramid, and in Germany we have the [Bundesliga] league with the highest attendances [in Europe], more than 42,000 average, and that has been developed step by step. So we don\u2019t want to destroy it with one decision.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to make clear that the national league is most important.

      "bodyText": "Combined opposition from the Premier League and Bundesliga will block the plans developed by the European Club Association for a new \u201csuper league\u201d in 2024, the German Football League president has said. Speaking as world football\u2019s associations and confederations gathered for Wednesday\u2019s Fifa congress in Paris, Reinhard Rauball, who is also president of Borussia Dortmund and vice-president of the German Football Association, said that the ECA proposals could \u201cdestroy\u201d national leagues. He did acknowledge, however, that some reform may be needed to the Champions League format when the current agreed football calendar concludes in 2024. Within Uefa there is widespread satisfaction with the Champions League\u2019s popularity and commercial success \u2013 the president, Aleksander Ceferin, said there had been 900,000 applications for final tickets \u2013 but widely held concerns at the automatic qualification of four clubs from Europe\u2019s top four leagues, and at the financial dominance of the Premier League. The Premier League and Bundesliga have made public statements opposing the ECA plans, and David Gill, the Football Association\u2019s representative on the Uefa executive committee, is understood to have expressed serious reservations within Uefa. The plans \u2013 principally worked up by the ECA, whose president, the Juventus president Andrea Agnelli, called for an expansion of the Champions League last year \u2013 are for more group stage matches by having four groups of eight clubs, and a system of promotion and relegation with the Europa League which would leave 24 clubs remaining in the Champions League at the end of each season. \u201cI am the president of the German league and president of Borussia Dortmund; our league, the Bundesliga, decided 100% that we don\u2019t go this way with the ECA,\u201d Rauball said. \u201cDavid Gill thinks in the same way, the German and British leagues are opposing it and I don\u2019t think it is possible we will find a solution without Germany and without England.\u201d Rauball said of the ECA proposals, which were presented by Uefa to the European Leagues organisation this month and met outspoken opposition: \u201cThis is a typical American kind of competition, a kind of closed shop. In Europe we have a traditional football pyramid, and in Germany we have the [Bundesliga] league with the highest attendances [in Europe], more than 42,000 average, and that has been developed step by step. So we don\u2019t want to destroy it with one decision. \u201cWe have to make clear that the national league is most important. If you make a pyramid like the ECA, we would destroy all the clubs and that is what is dangerous. We are traditionalists and we want that this is the future of football as well.\u201d The new Champions League proposals were also condemned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, after a meeting with the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, in advance of the Women\u2019s World Cup which kicks off in France on Friday. The president of the France Football Federation, No\u00ebl Le Gra\u00ebt, has expressed firm opposition. \u201cI fully support president Le Gra\u00ebt to go against the reform that is planned at Uefa,\u201d Macron said. The ECA, having met such widespread opposition to its plans \u2013 which the ECA has not yet publicly confirmed, issuing only a set of \u201cprinciples\u201d \u2013 is holding a special general assembly of member clubs in Malta on Thursday or Friday this week to further discuss them. Rauball said of the current format that he agreed with Edwin van der Sar, the Ajax chief executive, that it is wrong for Ajax, despite their splendid run to the Champions League semi-finals this season, to have to start in the qualifying rounds next season. \u201cPeople are saying: \u2018Let\u2019s take the problem and cool it down,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s first discuss and perhaps we find a [compromise], and after that we will decide it, step by step.\u201d",

Designed as a modernist estate in 1954, the Pruitt-Igoe development in St Louis was initially a segregated area, and although that didn\u2019t last, the estate was predominantly occupied by African Americans and left to decay.

The world\u2019s greatest rainforest \u2013 which is a vital provider of oxygen and carbon sequestration \u2013 lost 739sq km during the 31 days, equivalent to two football pitches every minute, according to data from the government\u2019s satellite monitoring agency.

His environment minister, Ricardo Salles, who was convicted for environmental fraud and had never visited the Amazon region before this year, has further undermined morale by failing to appoint regional chiefs and by firing veteran inspectors. Earlier this week, Folha reported he was moving to privatise the satellite monitoring of the forest. He has also vexed donors Norway and Germany by proposing to weaken the voice of civil society in deciding how the $1.3bn Amazon Fund is spent.

The march continued to Parliament Square where the now familiar 20-foot high Trump blimp and a similarly sized robotic caricature of the president perched on a gold toilet took centre stage as part of protests. While the numbers taking part might not quite have reached the levels expected \u2013 pre-prepared placards lay in unclaimed piles in Trafalgar Square \u2013 organisers estimated that some 75,000 people had taken part.

On the morning after the US president basked in the glow of a Buckingham Palace welcome, protesters from around the country slowly streamed into Trafalgar Square behind banners and placards covering the full gamut of causes mobilised in opposition to him, from climate crisis to abortion rights. When the march reached Whitehall, however, it was the leader of the opposition who elicited the loudest cheers when he addressed crowds who had been stopped by the police just short of Downing Street. \u201cI am absolutely not refusing to meet anybody,\u201d said Corbyn, an absent figure from the banquet that the Queen had hosted the night before, and which had also been boycotted by a number of political figures. \u201cI want to be able to have that dialogue to bring about the better and more peaceful world that we all want to live in.\u201d Without naming the Trumps \u2013 who he referred to as \u201cour visitors\u201d \u2013 the Labour leader urged them to: \u201cThink on, please, about a world that is aiming for peace and disarmament, that defeats racism and misogyny.\u201d The roars of approval were no doubt heard inside the Downing Street garden party being hosted at the same time by Philip May and Melania Trump.

More than 270,000 people have been displaced in recent weeks, leaving thousands to celebrate Eid with what little they have left under sheets stretched over the branches of olive trees. At least 25 hospitals and other critical infrastructure such as civil defence rescue centres have been targeted in what dozens of prominent doctors have said is a blatant breach of international humanitarian law. In May, 5,400 airstrikes killed at least 316 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Medical workers in Idlib said on Monday they would no longer share the locations of hospitals and clinics with the United Nations after doing so failed to stop them becoming Syrian and Russian targets.

A ceasefire brokered last September to avert what aid agencies warned would be the worst humanitarian crisis in the already bloody war has been shattered, after control of Idlib was seized by the hardline Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Damascus and Moscow say the HTS takeover legitimises the campaign against Idlib as they are targeting terrorists not covered by the ceasefire deal. At the UN on Monday night, Russia blocked a security council statement criticising the Syrian government campaign on Idlib, the second such move by the delegation since the escalation began on 30 April. Russia said the proposed statement was \u201cunbalanced\u201d because it did not mention the Syrian towns of Hajin or Baghuz, where it says civilians have suffered during US-backed fighting against Islamic State, according to Agence France-Presse. Russia has also rejected a tweet from the US president, Donald Trump, demanding Russia and Syria \u201cstop bombing the hell out of Idlib\u201d and \u201cindiscriminately killing innocent civilians\u201d.

      "bodyText": "THE REAL DEAL? Everybody loves Madrid. Just ask Spurs fans. And Gareth Bale. And Catalonia. The allure is sometimes just too much: the glory of wearing the white shirt, as Cristiano Ronaldo did, before he was booed out of town for not scoring enough goals, or something. The prestige of being embarrassed by Zinedine Zidane each day in training, bunking up with famed b@nter-merchant Sergio Ramos on away trips or being publicly shamed for having the audacity to go to bed at 11pm. Sounds like a laugh! Buena suerte, then, Luka Jovic, who was confirmed as being the latest merengue to walk the well-worn path to the Bernab\u00e9u, this time in exchange for at least \u20ac65m. Not bad business from Madrid for one of the most in-demand strikers in world football, considering today\u2019s prices, in which you normally have to waste a few zeroes just to get a whiff of The Next Big Thing\u2019s socks. \u201cIt was clear that there was a limit to what kind of bid we could refuse \u2013 for Eintracht Frankfurt this is a good and important transfer,\u201d roared former Bolton striker/current Eintracht suit Fredi Bobic, despite the sell-on small-print which dictates the German club have to punt around \u00a310m of the transfer fee over to Jovic\u2019s old side, Benfica. \u201cWe wish Luka all the best in the future. He has all the attributes to have a great career. And we are proud that we have supported him on his way. From a sporting point of view selling Luka Jovic is a big blow,\u201d continued Bobic, as the realisation of what he had done finally started to take hold. \u201cHis explosiveness and capacity to score goals propelled us into [Big Vase] and we have benefited from more than just his goals in the past two years.\u201d Madrid making moves, then, which may well put the jitters up their rivals. Sevilla have responded by naming a man \u2013 former Madrid and Spain coach Julen Lopetegui \u2013 who managed to get sacked twice in less than five months, while Atl\u00e9tico are resigned to losing Antoine Griezmann, Diego God\u00edn and Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez in the coming weeks. Thank goodness there\u2019s Barcelona, who \u2013 news just in \u2013 have an announcement of their own! Oh wait, it\u2019s just a tired-looking Philippe Coutinho at a kit launch wearing an awful shirt inspired by Ivan Rakitic\u2019s tablecloth. Roll on La Liga 2019-20, we might just have a title race on our hands. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cNo one can find out about this and no one means no one, eh. Not your friends, no one\u201d \u2013 sticking with La Liga, here\u2019s what former footballer Carlos Aranda was heard saying, according to El Mundo, in a recording relating to the alleged fixing of Valladolid\u2019s 2-0 loss to Valencia on the final day of the season. Aranda denies any wrongdoing. RECOMMENDED LOOKING It\u2019s the Liverpool, champions of Europe edition from David Squires. And you can get your hands on a printed copy too. FIVER LETTERS \u201cCan I please beg The Fiver and its readers not to mention hapless Dutch striker Philippe Hes (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs) to Brighton\u2019s chief scout, as I fear he\u2019ll be on the first ferry from Harwich waving the chairman\u2019s golden chequebook. \u2018Our\u2019 record of buying forward players from the Eredivisie isn\u2019t too great; the last two, signed for a total in excess of \u00a330m, have between them made 45 appearances, with a combined tally of two league goals. Though perhaps the club could swap both of them for one Philippe Hes?\u201d \u2013 Tony Crawford. \u201cAs a London-born, [USA! USA!! USA!!!] citizen who has long been a fan of The Fiver\u2019s always irreverent and often humorous take on the wonderful world of football, I have to express disappointment and take umbrage at your injection of personal, partisan politics into yesterday\u2019s offering. While you are certainly entitled to be less than a fan of our democratically elected President, I really feel the viciousness of your attack delivered an unnecessary \u2013 and quite ugly \u2013 attack by association on those of us who exercised our right at the ballot box to elect Mr Trump. Perhaps the graciousness and eloquence of the President\u2019s toast to Her Majesty and his recognition of the \u2018eternal friendship\u2019 of the peoples of the United States and United Kingdom will broaden your mind to be more inclusive of differing shades of political opinion\u201d \u2013 Chris Fuller. \u201cOpen-top bus parade. Participant clearly impacted by Tin. Is J\u00fcrgen Klopp the new Freddie Flintoff and can we expect woeful primetime TV shenanigans when he decides to retire?\u201d \u2013 Alex Folkes. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Tony Crawford. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Andy Woodward tells Daniel Taylor how a relative of Barry Bennell cast a grim shadow over his family, years before the paedophile coach began abusing him. Former England defender Laura Bassett, who made 61 appearances for her country, has announced her retirement. \u201cIt has been a privilege to play a tiny part in Lioness history and to have experienced the progression of women\u2019s football in England,\u201d she said. The Queen\u2019s Celtic are investigating a leak which allegedly revealed the club\u2019s summer transfer targets. \u201cWe\u2019re looking into it,\u201d roared a fresh and funky club suit. The next two Club World Cups will also double up as test events for the Human Rights World Cup in Qatar. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great opportunity to test the facilities. I think it hits all the marks,\u201d cheered Fifa suit Victor Montagliani. FA coffers will be bolstered by 50 million fat ones after it agreed a five-year sponsorship deal with BT. And value-for-money\u2019s Ross McCormack has been released by Aston Villa after a return of three goals in three years for the \u00a312m striker. \u201cThe club would like to wish Ross well for the future,\u201d shouted a club suit, before quickly bolting the door shut behind him and notifying Brighton\u2019s chief scout. STILL WANT MORE? Our transfer interactive is live, featuring every summer deal from Europe\u2019s top five leagues. And yes, we realise it\u2019s still officially spring so lower your guns, pedants. Our Women\u2019s World Cup 2019 team guides continue apace. Today we have No 17: Canada, and No 18: Cameroon. If England can handle Women\u2019s World Cup expectations they can capture the country\u2019s heart, writes Eni Aluko. Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman chews the fat with Ed Aarons about facing England, the young talent at his disposal and that World Cup qualifier in 1993.

Financial markets are jittery as economic growth hovers at about zero.</p> <p>Conte said: \u201cI personally remain willing to work with the utmost determination, but I can\u2019t make this choice alone. If they cannot assume responsibility then I will simply resign my mandate.\u201d</p> <p>He said he was unsure how long the government would last, while insisting that for as long as it stayed together, EU financial rules must be respected. Italy could soon face an EU infringement procedure for failing to reduce its debt.</p> <p>Salvini and Di Maio, who are reported to have had a cordial conversation by phone, initially declared their loyalty to Conte, saying the government would move forward. But by Tuesday morning, they were at odds again, with Di Maio accusing Salvini of plotting to derail the coalition.</p> <p>Francesco Galietti, the founder of Policy Sonar, a Rome-based consultancy, said: \u201cIf Conte thought he could move things with yesterday\u2019s intervention then he miscalculated the situation massively.

      "bodyText": "The fate of Italy\u2019s coalition government lies with the far-right deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, a day after the prime minister threatened to resign if Salvini\u2019s League and its coalition partner, the Five Star Movement (M5S), could not patch things up. Giuseppe Conte, a law professor who was plucked from obscurity a year ago to steer the coalition, issued the ultimatum to Salvini and M5S\u2019s Luigi Di Maio during a press conference on Monday night, urging them to set aside their many differences and \u201crevive the spirit\u201d of the coalition government\u2019s early days, or seek new elections. The bickering has intensified since the League eclipsed M5S in the European elections last month, and has stalled progress on policies. Financial markets are jittery as economic growth hovers at about zero. Conte said: \u201cI personally remain willing to work with the utmost determination, but I can\u2019t make this choice alone. If they cannot assume responsibility then I will simply resign my mandate.\u201d He said he was unsure how long the government would last, while insisting that for as long as it stayed together, EU financial rules must be respected. Italy could soon face an EU infringement procedure for failing to reduce its debt. Salvini and Di Maio, who are reported to have had a cordial conversation by phone, initially declared their loyalty to Conte, saying the government would move forward. But by Tuesday morning, they were at odds again, with Di Maio accusing Salvini of plotting to derail the coalition. Francesco Galietti, the founder of Policy Sonar, a Rome-based consultancy, said: \u201cIf Conte thought he could move things with yesterday\u2019s intervention then he miscalculated the situation massively. It was quite frustrating as you could tell that he\u2019s not in control of the ship.\u201d Salvini issued an ultimatum on Tuesday. \u201cIf in 15 days we are still having the same discussions with the same delays and postponements then there will be a problem,\u201d he said. Over the past year, the two parties have rowed over everything from immigration to ministerial ethics. Their main achievement has been the rollout of M5S\u2019s flagship basic income for poorer people. Further clashes loom over granting fiscal autonomy to wealthy northern regions, a key policy of the League, and easing bureaucracy in public tenders for infrastructure projects. Salvini has repeatedly pledged to challenge EU deficit rules in order to include a flat tax in Italy\u2019s 2020 budget. The budget is negotiated during the autumn period, so if the government falls and no alternative parliamentary majority is found, elections would need to take place by September. Franco Pavoncello, a political science professor and the president of John Cabot University in Rome, said: \u201cI have a feeling they have reached their limit, but the ball is very much in Salvini\u2019s court. \u201cHe has to decide whether to bring down the government now and then have the problem of unbearable interest rates the next day, which I\u2019m not sure he can face, or stick with it and come up with \u20ac40bn for a fiscal manoeuvre [for the 2020 budget]. It\u2019s a very problematic situation in terms of government accounts.\u201d The odds of a government collapse are greater now than they were last week, when Salvini claimed the League\u2019s EU elections success would not prompt a crisis.

      "body": "<p>Macaulay Culkin peaked young, Jane Lynch hit the big time in her late 40s and Matthew McConaughey\u2019s mid-career resurgence is the stuff of legend.</p> <p>Now researchers say they have developed an algorithm that predicts with 85% accuracy whether an actor is yet to have their most productive year, or whether they have already peaked.</p> <p>While actors and agents alike might be keen to get their hands on such a crystal ball, the researchers say there is little mystery: an actor\u2019s best year is usually preceded by a steady rise in the amount of work they are getting.</p> <p>Oliver Williams, the first author of the study from Queen Mary University of London, said: \u201cIf I were to give a piece of advice based on my findings, I would say just do more jobs and you\u2019ll get more jobs.\u201d</p> <p>The research may end up having a star turn itself. Williams said a screenwriter was considering using the work as part of a film about an actor whose career is in the doldrums and seeks help from a scientist to make her comeback.</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10213-0\">Nature Communications</a>, the team reports how they trawled through the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/\">International Movie Database</a> (IMDb), looking at the careers of actors from 1888 to 2016 \u2013 including more than 1.5 million men and almost 900,000 women. For each actor, the number of annual credits was recorded and the data analysed.</p> <p>The team found that more than two-thirds of actors had credits for only one year, perhaps suggesting that having dipped a toe in thespian waters, many had a change of heart. That might not be surprising \u2013 the authors said previous work had suggested just 2% of actors could make a living from the job.</p> <p>The results show that few actors had either a long or active career, and that women had shorter careers than men.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a sign of gender bias,\u201d Williams said, adding that, while the data shows actors tend to go through phases \u2013 with clusters of credits and career droughts \u2013 \u201cwe see that men tend to recover from cold streaks better than women do\u201d.</p> <p>Williams said the finding that few actors had high productivity and many were \u201cone-hit-wonders\u201d could be explained by a sort of \u201crich get richer\u201d effect. In other words, the more credits actors have, the more jobs they get. \u201cIt is not purely meritocratic,\u201d said Williams.</p> <p>They then looked at actors with careers of at least 20 years and whose peak year had at least five credits, to explore patterns in when an actor had their most productive year. For both men and women, their peak year was more likely to occur in the first part of their career than later \u2013 with the effect being stronger in women than men. </p> <p>The team found that by building a model based just on the number of acting credits per year in this subset of actors, they could predict with about 69-75% accuracy if an actor had already had their most productive year, or if the best was yet to come. They then improved the model by training it with chunks of data from before and after the actors\u2019 \u201cbest year\u201d, allowing them to develop an algorithm that accounted for the ups and downs of actors\u2019 careers.</p> <p>The resulting model was able to predict with about 85% accuracy whether an actor had already had their most productive year. The team said some of those that were misclassified were \u201ccomeback cases\u201d, which were \u201cfundamentally difficult to predict\u201d\u2013 as those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/07/matthew-mcconaughey-dark-tower-box-office-flops\">watching McConaughey\u2019s career</a> might agree.</p> <p>But the study has limitations, not least that the team defined an actor\u2019s <em>annus mirabilis</em> by the number of acting credits. The team argue that for most actors, the key measure of success is making a living from the job, but many might consider high-profile roles in two major films preferable to a large number of smaller, more obscure parts.</p> <p>\u201cThis work is really focused on productivity being what you want to achieve,\u201d said Williams, adding that it was not clear if the same results would hold for winning awards. \u201cThis is something that maybe should be looked at in the future.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Macaulay Culkin peaked young, Jane Lynch hit the big time in her late 40s and Matthew McConaughey\u2019s mid-career resurgence is the stuff of legend. Now researchers say they have developed an algorithm that predicts with 85% accuracy whether an actor is yet to have their most productive year, or whether they have already peaked. While actors and agents alike might be keen to get their hands on such a crystal ball, the researchers say there is little mystery: an actor\u2019s best year is usually preceded by a steady rise in the amount of work they are getting. Oliver Williams, the first author of the study from Queen Mary University of London, said: \u201cIf I were to give a piece of advice based on my findings, I would say just do more jobs and you\u2019ll get more jobs.\u201d The research may end up having a star turn itself. Williams said a screenwriter was considering using the work as part of a film about an actor whose career is in the doldrums and seeks help from a scientist to make her comeback. Writing in the journal Nature Communications, the team reports how they trawled through the International Movie Database (IMDb), looking at the careers of actors from 1888 to 2016 \u2013 including more than 1.5 million men and almost 900,000 women. For each actor, the number of annual credits was recorded and the data analysed. The team found that more than two-thirds of actors had credits for only one year, perhaps suggesting that having dipped a toe in thespian waters, many had a change of heart. That might not be surprising \u2013 the authors said previous work had suggested just 2% of actors could make a living from the job. The results show that few actors had either a long or active career, and that women had shorter careers than men. \u201cThere is a sign of gender bias,\u201d Williams said, adding that, while the data shows actors tend to go through phases \u2013 with clusters of credits and career droughts \u2013 \u201cwe see that men tend to recover from cold streaks better than women do\u201d. Williams said the finding that few actors had high productivity and many were \u201cone-hit-wonders\u201d could be explained by a sort of \u201crich get richer\u201d effect. In other words, the more credits actors have, the more jobs they get. \u201cIt is not purely meritocratic,\u201d said Williams. They then looked at actors with careers of at least 20 years and whose peak year had at least five credits, to explore patterns in when an actor had their most productive year. For both men and women, their peak year was more likely to occur in the first part of their career than later \u2013 with the effect being stronger in women than men. The team found that by building a model based just on the number of acting credits per year in this subset of actors, they could predict with about 69-75% accuracy if an actor had already had their most productive year, or if the best was yet to come. They then improved the model by training it with chunks of data from before and after the actors\u2019 \u201cbest year\u201d, allowing them to develop an algorithm that accounted for the ups and downs of actors\u2019 careers. The resulting model was able to predict with about 85% accuracy whether an actor had already had their most productive year. The team said some of those that were misclassified were \u201ccomeback cases\u201d, which were \u201cfundamentally difficult to predict\u201d\u2013 as those watching McConaughey\u2019s career might agree. But the study has limitations, not least that the team defined an actor\u2019s annus mirabilis by the number of acting credits. The team argue that for most actors, the key measure of success is making a living from the job, but many might consider high-profile roles in two major films preferable to a large number of smaller, more obscure parts. \u201cThis work is really focused on productivity being what you want to achieve,\u201d said Williams, adding that it was not clear if the same results would hold for winning awards. \u201cThis is something that maybe should be looked at in the future.\u201d",

Two days after his death, on 17 April, several hundred students marched to Tiananmen Square and laid a wreath to him. They called for greater freedom of speech, economic freedoms and curbs on corruption. The demonstrations spread to hundreds of cities.</p>\n    <p>On 26 April, an editorial in the Communist Party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily denounced the student demonstrations as a \u2018premeditated and organised conspiracy and turmoil\u2019. The next day, tens of thousands of students in Beijing staged a demonstration to protest against the editorial. On 13 May, just two days before the arrival of Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev for a state visit, hundreds of students began a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square. The protests forced the cancellation of the welcoming ceremony. On 20 May, martial law was declared in parts of Beijing. Troops moved in, but were blocked by the civilians and demonstrations continued.</p>\n    <p>In the early hours of 4 June, Chinese troops launched a two-pronged attack with orders to put down the protests. Armoured cars and tanks smashed through the citizens\u2019 barricades. Some forty workers who went to plead with the soldiers were shot. On 5 June, an unidentified young man stood in front of a tank convoy leaving Tiananmen Square, in a final act of defiance. The actual number of deaths from the crackdown remains unknown, but it is believed the Chinese army killed at least 10,000 people, according to a secret diplomatic cable from the British ambassador to Beijing.</p>\n    <p>Thirty years on, the Chinese authorities continue to view the Tiananmen protests as one of the most sensitive and taboo subjects. \u2018June 4\u2019, as the movement is commonly known as in China, remains largely scrubbed from official history and is censored from school text books and online. The authorities punish those who try to commemorate the event, and relatives of the victims who died during the massacre are barred from openly mourning their loved ones.<br></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/verna-yu\"><b>Verna Yu</b></a>&nbsp;<i>in Hong Kong</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAfter 30 years, there is still so many candlelight vigils \u2026 and so many people come out to fight for their rights, you feel hopeful.

      "bodyText": "The World Cup has been invigorated by two upsets. The victories for Bangladesh and Pakistan do not constitute acts of giantkilling, but they were unexpected. The higher-ranked sides have been outplayed. As a consequence South Africa, in particular, are feeling the strain while England are chastened \u2013 or at least they should be. The two vastly experienced captains of the defeated teams reacted differently. Faf du Plessis, after the defeat by Bangladesh, said that he was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d; he was \u201cgutted\u201d that his team were \u201cjust not firing\u201d and he admitted that he had probably made a substantial mistake at the toss when \u2013 for the second time at the Oval \u2013 he decided to field on a dry surface. Eoin Morgan was not so candid and more predictable after England\u2019s defeat. He was naturally critical of his side\u2019s performance in the field, a deficiency that could be spotted by beach cricketers upwards. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from probably one of our best performances in the field at the Oval to not extremely bad, but it\u2019s cost us probably about 15 or 20 runs in the field, which is a lot in a one-day game,\u201d he said. Ostensibly it is hard to argue with any of that. Yet there is an odd assumption by Morgan here. Take away 20, the number of unnecessary runs conceded by England, according to Morgan, and we reach the figure of 328. The England captain may well remember that the highest successful run-chase in World Cup history is 328. This took place in Bengaluru in 2011; the chasers were Ireland, the victims were England. Somehow Morgan was not playing for either side. So Morgan is implying that he would have been reasonably content if his England side had only to equal the highest run-chase to defeat Pakistan on Monday. If that really is the case a rethink may be needed. There is a huge difference between a World Cup match and a standard one-day international, which is part of a three- or five-match series. Even in the preliminary stages of the tournament there is far more tension and adrenaline in a World Cup contest. One only has to witness the hard hands and wayward thinking of so many English fielders at Trent Bridge. They were out of focus and easily riled. Some of them seemed keener to look for an argument than the ball. Morgan did not even consider the wisdom of his decision at the toss. The sun had been out for more than five hours by the start of the match; the pitch was dry, brown and true yet Morgan routinely chose to bowl; he has declared to the world that his team prefer to chase and, to be fair, they have been successful batting second. He was in no mood to change tack, especially after Pakistan\u2019s collapse against the West Indies. However, there is surely virtue in paying more attention to the conditions than the instinctive preferences of his team. At the toss the captain must calculate how his side can be in the ascendancy after the first innings in the match. If he senses an opportunity to bowl the opposition out for something under about 260-270 then that is a good option. But if there is the opportunity to post a score in excess of 300, why not take it?

A person briefed on Jingye's thinking said the company wanted to preserve as many jobs as possible, but could not say how many of the company's 4,000 workers would keep their jobs. British Steel accounts for a third of UK production, so is seen as a key national asset in many quarters.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What went wrong at British Steel?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>When Greybull Capital bought British Steel in 2016 it promised great things. The private equity firm pledged to invest \u00a3400m and within months it was boasting of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/01/scunthorpe-steelworkers-enjoy-happy-outcome-to-act-of-faith\">return to profit and a bright future ahead</a>. Three years later it collapsed. In a letter to staff, the British Steel chief executive blamed weak market demand, high raw material prices, the weakness of sterling and uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit discussions.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who is Jingye?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Jingye emerged as the most likely owner after talks with Ataer, a division of the Turkish military pension fund Oyak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/23/british-steel-turkish-army-fund-takeover-in-danger-of-collapse\">fell through in October</a>. Founded in 1988 by a former Communist party official, Li Ganpo, the Chinese conglomerate has hotel and retail interests. However, steelmaking, which it started doing in the early 1990s, is now its primary focus: its Chinese mills produce about 15m tonnes of steel a year, exporting to 80 countries.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How much is Brexit to blame?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It is not the only factor in the crisis, but it is important and will remain crucial even if Jingye buys British Steel. Steel contracts are typically agreed well in advance of the product being delivered. As things stand, the UK is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/28/eu-agrees-brexit-extension-to-31-january-flextension\">due to leave the EU on 31 January after another delay,</a> and the terms of that separation are yet to be agreed, meaning British Steel\u2019s overseas customers do not know what tariffs will apply to steel they buy from the company. Sources close to the company said orders from customers in the EU and further afield had dried up as a result.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is the whole UK steel industry in trouble?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The UK steel industry has been in decline for some time because of a variety of factors such as overcapacity in EU steelmaking and Chinese state-subsidised firms flooding the global market with cheap product. An industry that employed 323,000 people in 1971 now employs less than a tenth of that, at 31,900. The closure of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/02/redcar-steel-plant-goes-into-liquidation\">Redcar steelworks in 2015</a>&nbsp;was a significant blow to the sector and left the UK with only two blast furnace steelworks: Scunthorpe and the Tata Steel-owned Port Talbot in south Wales.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The idea seemed a hybrid of Conservative and Labour policy: while the Conservative government looks for a private buyer for British Steel, Jeremy Corbyn <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/jeremy-corbyn-government-must-prepared-nationalise-british-steel/\">wants it to be nationalised</a>.</p> \n<p>Tice dismissed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/26/uk-steel-industry-brexit-eu-damage-exports\">warnings</a> from Gareth Stace, the director general of the trade body UK Steel, who said Brexit \u201cwill not improve the situation for the steel sector but it has the potential to cause a great deal of damage\u201d.</p> \n<p>Stace was an \u201cestablishment\u201d figure, Tice claimed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid some of these industry lobby groups are part of the establishment and are simply wrong.

      "bodyText": "The Brexit party has announced its first policy beyond leaving the EU: saving British Steel by turning it into a \u201cJohn Lewis-style\u201d company part-owned by the workers. The party\u2019s chairman, Richard Tice, unveiled the policy on Tuesday in Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire, where 5,000 jobs are on the line after privately owned British Steel went into insolvency last month. He proposed a \u201cstrategic national corporation, which will blend the best of private sector expertise and capital; long-term, patient state capital; as well as improving productivity through a John Lewis-style form of shared ownership for the workers\u201d. The idea seemed a hybrid of Conservative and Labour policy: while the Conservative government looks for a private buyer for British Steel, Jeremy Corbyn wants it to be nationalised. Tice dismissed warnings from Gareth Stace, the director general of the trade body UK Steel, who said Brexit \u201cwill not improve the situation for the steel sector but it has the potential to cause a great deal of damage\u201d. Stace was an \u201cestablishment\u201d figure, Tice claimed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid some of these industry lobby groups are part of the establishment and are simply wrong. What is most important to make British steel is not the tariffs, it\u2019s the cost of business rates, it\u2019s the cost of energy and it\u2019s the emissions trading scheme.\u201d UK Steel has previously called on the government to tackle industrial electricity prices, which are twice those in France, as well as a reduction in UK business rates. According to Stace, these are \u201cfive to 10 times higher than elsewhere in the EU, perversely increasing costs for those that modernise and upgrade\u201d. Tice was accompanied in Scunthorpe by Simon Boyd, the managing director of Reidsteel, a structural steel company based in Dorset. He said EU regulations meant it was \u201ceasier for us to export to Mongolia than France\u201d, drawing tuts of disapproval from the carefully vetted audience, who had each paid \u00a32.50 to attend the press conference. Boyd, who campaigned against the working time directive, said EU competition rules meant his firm lost a contract in Rotherham to a Portuguese firm, who benefited from significantly lower energy costs in Portugal and then came to Yorkshire and employed eastern European labourers. Not everyone was convinced by the Brexit party\u2019s proposal.

      "bodyText": "A lost play about the miners\u2019 strike by the acclaimed author behind Kes is to be performed in public for the first time, more than 30 years after it was deemed too controversial for television. After the Strike was written by the novelist Barry Hines in 1985 and depicted graphic scenes of police violence against striking miners at the Battle of Orgreave a year earlier. Despite Hines being at the height of his critical acclaim at the time, the work was never broadcast and lay untouched for 35 years until it was discovered by researchers in the late author\u2019s university archive. The work, which will be performed for the first time at Sheffield\u2019s Kelham Island Museum on 18 June, is described as an unflinching account of clashes between police and miners at Orgreave on 18 June 1984 and the \u201cmultiple corrosive effects\u201d it had on the South Yorkshire community. The play was found among other unpublished works in Hines\u2019s archive, which was donated to the University of Sheffield after his death, aged 76, in March 2016. It was accompanied by a note from his wife, Eleanor Hines, which said she had a \u201cvague memory of \u2018the powers that be\u2019 not being interested in the strike any more\u201d. Dr David Forrest, a senior lecturer in film studies at the University of Sheffield, said Hines became deeply embedded with the National Union of Mineworkers and carried out a series of interviews with miners after the clashes at Orgreave. His two unpublished accounts, one of which is After the Strike, were too politically sensitive to be aired at the time, Forrest said. \u201cIt\u2019s true that they are very, very politically didactic and explicit and they make absolutely no bones about their position,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been unrealistic to expect any broadcaster to have picked them up at the time, particularly because they depict quite graphically police brutality at Orgreave. It was clearly something he had to get out of his system.\u201d Hines, whose most famous book A Kestrel for a Knave inspired Ken Loach\u2019s classic film Kes, was at the height of his acclaim in 1985 following his Bafta-winning drama-documentary Threads, which was set in Sheffield during the cold war and chronicled the effect of a nuclear bomb dropped on a northern English city. The son and grandson of mineworkers, Hines \u201cmourned what he saw as the wanton destruction of communities\u201d, Forrest said, and was \u201cparticularly exercised by the events at Orgreave and their consequences\u201d. \u201cAs a committed working-class writer, Hines felt duty-bound to document what he had seen over the course of the strike,\u201d he said. \u201cThis performance is now a chance for people to experience one of Hines\u2019s unpublished pieces of work for the first time while also celebrating his legacy and commemorating the struggles of miners and their families on the 35th anniversary of the Battle of Orgreave.\u201d Hines, who was born in a mining village near Barnsley, had described how he desperately wanted to write television screenplays about the miners\u2019 strike and wrote scripts for the BBC, but \u201cthey did not work\u201d. After the Strike\u2019s first airing is taking place as part of a series of exhibitions on gentrification, hipster culture and regeneration hosted by the University of Sheffield and the Kelham Island Museum. Built in the 1100s, Kelham Island was for centuries a key part of the steel city\u2019s industrial power. In recent years, however, the island\u2019s once-booming cutlery and steel works, factories and workshops have become transformed into a hipster paradise with microbreweries, galleries and independent shopping arcades. Dr Amanda Crawley Jackson, the director of engagement at the University of Sheffield\u2019s faculty of arts and humanities, said the exhibition aimed to tell the untold stories behind the island\u2019s regeneration \u201cand the impact this change has and continues to have on people in the local community\u201d.",

While most people who aren\u2019t impacted by stop and search think it\u2019s just a five-minute stop, actually it can be up to 40 minutes and mean you\u2019re late for work.\u201d</p> <p>Gracie Bradley, the policy and campaigns manager at Liberty, said: \u201cRace discrimination in stop and search is rising, and is at its worst under suspicionless powers. Research shows there is no significant link between ethnicity and knife crime and that prohibited items are found across all ethnicities at similar rates.</p> <p>\u201cStop and search without suspicion is a recipe for state abuse of power and does untold damage to communities\u2019 trust in fair policing. It is the antithesis of the targeted, considered and accountable policy interventions that we really need to address complex problems such as youth violence over the long term.\u201d</p> <p>The enhanced powers, announced by the Home Office on March 31, reduced the authorisation required for a section 60 from a senior officer to inspector. They also lowered the degree of certainty required by police officers; they must believe only that serious violence \u201cmay\u201d, rather than \u201cwill\u201d, occur.</p> <p>Asked if he thought the current powers were sufficient, House told the committee: \u201cI think we are seeing, due to the use of stop and search, a greater awareness among people who might be likely to carry knives, that they might be stopped and searched and therefore I do hope they would leave the knife at home and stop carrying knives.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the motive behind stop and search. I believe we have what we need at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Homicides were down about 30% year-on-year and knife crime injuries for under-25-year-olds were down nearly 20%, although knife crime as a whole remained flat, he told the committee.</p>",

While most people who aren\u2019t impacted by stop and search think it\u2019s just a five-minute stop, actually it can be up to 40 minutes and mean you\u2019re late for work.\u201d Gracie Bradley, the policy and campaigns manager at Liberty, said: \u201cRace discrimination in stop and search is rising, and is at its worst under suspicionless powers. Research shows there is no significant link between ethnicity and knife crime and that prohibited items are found across all ethnicities at similar rates. \u201cStop and search without suspicion is a recipe for state abuse of power and does untold damage to communities\u2019 trust in fair policing. It is the antithesis of the targeted, considered and accountable policy interventions that we really need to address complex problems such as youth violence over the long term.\u201d The enhanced powers, announced by the Home Office on March 31, reduced the authorisation required for a section 60 from a senior officer to inspector. They also lowered the degree of certainty required by police officers; they must believe only that serious violence \u201cmay\u201d, rather than \u201cwill\u201d, occur. Asked if he thought the current powers were sufficient, House told the committee: \u201cI think we are seeing, due to the use of stop and search, a greater awareness among people who might be likely to carry knives, that they might be stopped and searched and therefore I do hope they would leave the knife at home and stop carrying knives. \u201cThat\u2019s the motive behind stop and search. I believe we have what we need at the moment.\u201d Homicides were down about 30% year-on-year and knife crime injuries for under-25-year-olds were down nearly 20%, although knife crime as a whole remained flat, he told the committee.",

Two days after his death, on 17 April, several hundred students marched to Tiananmen Square and laid a wreath to him. They called for greater freedom of speech, economic freedoms and curbs on corruption. The demonstrations spread to hundreds of cities.</p>\n    <p>On 26 April, an editorial in the Communist Party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily denounced the student demonstrations as a \u2018premeditated and organised conspiracy and turmoil\u2019. The next day, tens of thousands of students in Beijing staged a demonstration to protest against the editorial. On 13 May, just two days before the arrival of Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev for a state visit, hundreds of students began a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square. The protests forced the cancellation of the welcoming ceremony. On 20 May, martial law was declared in parts of Beijing. Troops moved in, but were blocked by the civilians and demonstrations continued.</p>\n    <p>In the early hours of 4 June, Chinese troops launched a two-pronged attack with orders to put down the protests. Armoured cars and tanks smashed through the citizens\u2019 barricades. Some forty workers who went to plead with the soldiers were shot. On 5 June, an unidentified young man stood in front of a tank convoy leaving Tiananmen Square, in a final act of defiance. The actual number of deaths from the crackdown remains unknown, but it is believed the Chinese army killed at least 10,000 people, according to a secret diplomatic cable from the British ambassador to Beijing.</p>\n    <p>Thirty years on, the Chinese authorities continue to view the Tiananmen protests as one of the most sensitive and taboo subjects. \u2018June 4\u2019, as the movement is commonly known as in China, remains largely scrubbed from official history and is censored from school text books and online. The authorities punish those who try to commemorate the event, and relatives of the victims who died during the massacre are barred from openly mourning their loved ones.<br></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/verna-yu\"><b>Verna Yu</b></a>&nbsp;<i>in Hong Kong</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Peter Ngan, government staffer, 28, Wellington</h2> \n<p>When I hear about it I feel sad, and I feel most people don\u2019t know about it.

      "bodyText": "Iranian people are being failed by all political sides While Ben Armbruster is right about the dangerous, bellicose John Bolton, all commentators seem to paint the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action as a panacea (24 May). I\u2019ve been to Iran and seen its lovely people crying that \u201cwe live in a big prison\u201d or whispering \u201ccareful, there are spies everywhere\u201d, not to mention being stopped daily myself by police. The JCPOA does nothing for the Iranians\u2019 human rights and in fact may worsen the situation by entrenching the government and giving it legitimacy. Richard Abram Sydney, Australia \u2022 Simon Tisdall is gravely mistaken in his somewhat distorted Spotlight article on Iran (24 May). US-Iran enmity dates back to 1953, when the US and UK overthrew democratically elected president Mosadegh and installed the Shah\u2019s puppet regime. This led to the 1979 revolution and explains events today. Christine Barnard London, UK Many Europeans are still lacking a voice Thank you so much to Alberto Alemanno (We mobile citizens deserve to be heard in the European Union, 10 May). I am gratified to know that there are so many of us mute mobile Europeans, although disheartened that we continue to remain without a voice. There was one thing Alemanno overlooked, however \u2013 not every country allows their citizens to vote if they are not resident in that country at the time of elections. As an Irish citizen resident in France, I can\u2019t vote in national elections in either France or Ireland. I have made France my home, lived here for 20 years, bought a house, brought up my kids here; I pay my taxes, but I have no voice. I never miss an opportunity to vote in European elections, as how else can we change our status? But I have not yet come across a French MEP candidate who considers my voice and the voices of the other 17 million like me to be worth fighting for. Monique Gallwey Saint-Louis, France China\u2019s frontier policy about more than mosques Some context is needed for your article How Beijing is quietly razing the mosques of Xinjiang (17 May). Since 1949 China\u2019s frontier policy has been to absorb, erase or overwhelm with Han immigrants all the distinct peoples of its long frontier. The Uighurs stand in the way of the extension of China\u2019s supremacy west \u2013 and southwards via its Belt and Road inititative. A weak and fragmenting Europe (17 May) might look eastwards at this geopolitical process with some alarm. Douglas Porteous Victoria, British Columbia, Canada Mandatory monitoring will help fish populations I read with interest in George Monbiot\u2019s article that in the UK monitoring equipment for fishing boats is not mandatory (17 May). In British Columbia, where we have five species of wild salmon to protect \u2013 as well as halibut, cod and prawns \u2013 monitoring is mandatory. Every boat is equipped with a GPS so that the fisheries officials know exactly where they are and if they are in an area that is open for fishing. All boats have a camera that records the entire catch and when the boat comes into harbour every single fish is counted. Our salmon are under threat despite this, but the industry is still considered sustainable. If the rest of the world did this, and if we controlled fishing on the high seas, we might have a chance of reversing this problem. Jane McCall Delta, British Columbia, Canada Boris Johnson as PM is not worth the risk Nausea: the very idea of Boris Johnson at the wheel of the ship-of-state roils my innards (24 May). Matthew d\u2019Ancona characterises the Tory rationale: \u201cYes, he\u2019s terrible; but he\u2019ll see us through the storm until we find someone\u201d. The Conservatives may well regret such a dismissal of their enfant terrible \u2013 it\u2019s the voyage of the Magic Christian on the horizon.

      "bodyText": "Brexit uncertainty has led to a mothballing of commercial and civil engineering projects and caused a contraction of the UK\u2019s struggling construction industry, the latest snapshot of the sector has found. A monthly update on business conditions revealed a worse than expected performance in May as the cautious mood affecting manufacturing and retailing spread to building projects. The Chartered Institution of Procurement and Supply said its survey conducted by IHS Markit showed its purchasing managers\u2019 index slipping back from 50.5 in April to 48.6 in May. A finding below 50 indicates the sector is contracting. A breakdown of construction found that, of the three subsectors, only house-building expanded last month but not by enough to compensate for the weakness of commercial and civil engineering work. The purchasing managers\u2019 indices released by the Cips on the first three working days of the month are closely watched as guides to how well the economy is performing. After the scores below 50 for both manufacturing and construction \u2013 which between them account for about a sixth of gross domestic product \u2013 attention will now be focused on how well the much bigger services sector performed. Tim Moore, an associate director of IHS Markit, said: \u201cMay data reveals another setback for the UK construction sector as output and new orders both declined to the greatest extent since the first quarter of 2018. Survey respondents attributed lower workloads to ongoing political and economic uncertainty, which has led to widespread delays with spending decisions and encouraged risk aversion among clients. \u201cCommercial building remained hardest-hit by Brexit uncertainty, with construction firms reporting the steepest fall in this category of activity since September 2017. Civil engineering work also dried up in May and a fourth consecutive monthly fall in activity marked the longest period of decline since the first half of 2013.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.faithringgold.com/\">Faith Ringgold </a>graduated from high school in 1948 she headed to the City College of New York to sign up for an art degree. Ringgold lived around the corner from the campus in Harlem, and used to \u201csee the boys coming out of the subway and going up the hill to the college\u201d. It had never occurred to her that they were all white, and that it was a men-only college. When the bemused college administrators informed her she wouldn\u2019t be able to attend, Ringgold refused to budge. She wasn\u2019t taking a stand, she just didn\u2019t understand why they were telling her she couldn\u2019t do art.</p> <p>\u201cArt is what I wanted to do,\u201d she says matter-of-factly. \u201cAs a child you think you have the freedom to do what you want. You learn later in life that maybe you\u2019re not supposed to do this or that. Then, hopefully, you realise that you can try.\u201d Eventually, a college official helped her sort out a compromise. Women were allowed to teach \u2013 that was acceptable; she could get an art degree as long as she minored in education at the college\u2019s teaching institute. She was in, but it wasn\u2019t exactly a breeze from there: she experienced racism and several teachers tried to discourage her. But she never doubted her ability: \u201cSorry, but I\u2019m here. And I\u2019m going to be here. And you better know it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bcb744237b322b6530a0677901f5ccb3a41cd8f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcb744237b322b6530a0677901f5ccb3a41cd8f4/59_42_4203_5055/831.jpg\" alt=\"Jazz Stories: Mama Can Sing, Papa Can Blow #1: Somebody Stole My Broken Heart, 2004.\" width=\"831\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jazz Stories: Mama Can Sing, Papa Can Blow #1: Somebody Stole My Broken Heart, 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ARS, New York/courtesy ACA Galleries, New York</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ringgold has certainly made good on her words. The 88-year-old isn\u2019t just a successful artist: she\u2019s an author, activist and cultural icon. Her career has been prolific and diverse; she\u2019s worked across 16 different media. A survey of her work spanning 50 years is about to open at <a href=\"https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/faith-ringgold\">the Serpentine in London</a>, her first in a European arts institution.</p> <p>I\u2019m chatting to Ringgold at ACA, the New York gallery that has been representing her since 1995. We\u2019re sitting in leather armchairs next to Tar Beach #2<em>, </em>one of her signature \u201cstory quilts\u201d. She turned to quilting out of necessity. She enjoyed sculpting in wood and clay but the dust provoked her asthma, so she started experimenting with \u201csoft sculpture\u201d, combining fabric, painting and narrative. She produced her first such work, Echoes of Harlem<em>, </em>in 1980 in collaboration with her mother, <a href=\"http://iraaa.museum.hamptonu.edu/page/Faith-Ringgold%2C-Who-I-Am-and-Why\">Willi Posey Jones</a>, a fashion designer.</p> <p>Quilts were practical for other reasons. Ringgold, a vocal feminist, didn\u2019t want to rely on her husband to help her carry her work to a gallery \u2013 \u201cThat ain\u2019t right!\u201d However large her latest piece, she could just roll it up and take it wherever she needed.</p> <p>Quilts also became a stealthy means of getting her own story out there. \u201cI have always wanted to tell my story or, more to the point, my side of the story,\u201d Ringgold writes in the preface to her memoir, <a href=\"https://www.dukeupress.edu/we-flew-over-the-bridge\">We Flew Over the Bridge</a><em>, </em>which was published in 1995. Her first autobiography, completed in 1980, was met with a string of rejections. \u201cIt was then that I hit on the strategy of self-publication through masked performance pieces and readings of my story quilts at college lecture dates and exhibitions,\u201d she explains in her book.</p> <p>For a long time, quilts have been both a utilitarian and subversive medium. \u201cIt was an art form that slaves used to keep themselves warm and to also import their art because they couldn\u2019t bring the art forms that they practised in Africa,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThis was a way of them being able to continue their art in a way that was acceptable to the slavers because it was keeping them warm.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9a55f7c0a1a8bf5f913323f8d05d11a80c2d790c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a55f7c0a1a8bf5f913323f8d05d11a80c2d790c/0_0_2362_1273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"American People #15: Hide Little Children, 1966.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"539\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">American People #15: Hide Little Children, 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Faith Ringgold/ARS, courtesy Pippy Houldsworth Gallery, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tar Beach #2 is one of a number of story quilts in Ringgold\u2019s Woman on a Bridge<em> </em>series, named after the tar rooftops of the apartment buildings in Harlem where people used to go to cool off on a hot day. Ringgold was a child during the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/roaring-twenties/harlem-renaissance\">Harlem </a><a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/roaring-twenties/harlem-renaissance\">renaissance</a>; artists and musicians such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2008/oct/23/jacob-lawrence-art\">Jacob Lawrence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/duke-ellington\">Duke Ellington</a> and <a href=\"https://www.biography.com/artist/aaron-douglas\">Aaron Douglas</a> lived around the corner from her family. \u201cThere was excitement and festiveness\u201d in the air, she says. People would gather on the roofs and tell stories: \u201cI guess that\u2019s why I became a storyteller, because I heard so many stories.\u201d</p> <p>Another of Ringgold\u2019s story quilts, Coming to Jones Road #6: Baby Freedom Came One Night, is hanging nearby. The series was partly inspired by Ringgold\u2019s experience of moving to a house in New Jersey in the 90s. She\u2019d bought the property from another artist and planned to build a studio, but the neighbours weren\u2019t keen on a black neighbour and took her to court. \u201cThe neighbours figured, \u2018If we keep her from building this studio, she\u2019ll go. We\u2019ll stall her, and eventually she\u2019ll leave.\u2019 But they didn\u2019t know: I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>In Coming to Jones Road Part 1, Ringgold tells the story by harking back to the experience of runaway slaves migrating to the north. <em>\u201c</em>Out of every awful thing is something beautiful,\u201d she says. \u201cAs an artist I want to see the beauty, especially in situations that I can\u2019t change and that are so prevalent.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4444aba4e028dbf4cec24c64efcb6bd7b9d34137\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4444aba4e028dbf4cec24c64efcb6bd7b9d34137/0_135_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Faith Ringgold.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I want to tell my side of the story\u2019 \u2026 Faith Ringgold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ringgold is adept at presenting ugly themes in beautiful ways. There have been times when people have spectacularly missed those layers. In 1970, just after her second solo show in New York, Ringgold caught the attention of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/26/david-rockefeller-obituary\">David Rockefeller</a>, the chief executive of Chase Manhattan bank. He sent a couple of representatives to buy a piece to hang in the bank. They walked past the pieces that looked too obviously political and then stood approvingly in front of a piece featuring the American flag. \u201cThe flag, very patriotic. Yeah, let\u2019s get it,\u201d she remembers the woman saying. \u201cAnd then the guy says to the woman, \u2018But did you read it?\u2019 The woman began to read the letters in the star section of the flag. \u201cD-I-E.\u201d That was fine. Edgy but fine. \u201cYeah, but put your head to the side, to the left side, and read,\u201d Ringgold told them. \u201cOK, hold on. \u2018N-I-G-G ...\u2019 Oh. Oh my goodness.\u201d The pair ran out of the door and did not buy the piece: Flag for the Moon, Die Nigger, 1969. (Eventually they returned and bought a more palatable piece called Black Light #9: American Spectrum, which is in the Serpentine show).</p> <p>Ringgold has lived through momentous political and cultural change. Is any of her current work addressing Donald Trump? \u201cOh my God,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cYou had to bring him in! Well, I\u2019ve started a series on him: Trump the Chump. I\u2019ve done lots of sketches on him. And I\u2019m gonna come up with some paintings shortly. He is something, he really is.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump sketches are just a diversion, a form of art therapy, rather than a real project at the moment. Ringgold\u2019s current focus is a series about ageing called Aging-aling-aling. All over the world people are living longer and longer, she notes, and this series will be an exploration of our elongated lives. While she may be nearing 90, age hasn\u2019t slowed her down much. She still gets up early and heads to her studio to paint every morning. \u201cI want to get that work done,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t stop until it is done.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/faith-ringgold\">Faith Ringgold</a> is at the Serpentine Gallery, London, 8 June to 8 September. <a href=\"https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/evening-faith-ringgold\">An Evening with Faith Ringgold</a> is at the Conway Hall, London, 6 June.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Faith Ringgold graduated from high school in 1948 she headed to the City College of New York to sign up for an art degree. Ringgold lived around the corner from the campus in Harlem, and used to \u201csee the boys coming out of the subway and going up the hill to the college\u201d. It had never occurred to her that they were all white, and that it was a men-only college. When the bemused college administrators informed her she wouldn\u2019t be able to attend, Ringgold refused to budge. She wasn\u2019t taking a stand, she just didn\u2019t understand why they were telling her she couldn\u2019t do art. \u201cArt is what I wanted to do,\u201d she says matter-of-factly. \u201cAs a child you think you have the freedom to do what you want. You learn later in life that maybe you\u2019re not supposed to do this or that. Then, hopefully, you realise that you can try.\u201d Eventually, a college official helped her sort out a compromise. Women were allowed to teach \u2013 that was acceptable; she could get an art degree as long as she minored in education at the college\u2019s teaching institute. She was in, but it wasn\u2019t exactly a breeze from there: she experienced racism and several teachers tried to discourage her. But she never doubted her ability: \u201cSorry, but I\u2019m here. And I\u2019m going to be here. And you better know it.\u201d Ringgold has certainly made good on her words. The 88-year-old isn\u2019t just a successful artist: she\u2019s an author, activist and cultural icon. Her career has been prolific and diverse; she\u2019s worked across 16 different media. A survey of her work spanning 50 years is about to open at the Serpentine in London, her first in a European arts institution. I\u2019m chatting to Ringgold at ACA, the New York gallery that has been representing her since 1995. We\u2019re sitting in leather armchairs next to Tar Beach #2, one of her signature \u201cstory quilts\u201d. She turned to quilting out of necessity. She enjoyed sculpting in wood and clay but the dust provoked her asthma, so she started experimenting with \u201csoft sculpture\u201d, combining fabric, painting and narrative. She produced her first such work, Echoes of Harlem, in 1980 in collaboration with her mother, Willi Posey Jones, a fashion designer. Quilts were practical for other reasons. Ringgold, a vocal feminist, didn\u2019t want to rely on her husband to help her carry her work to a gallery \u2013 \u201cThat ain\u2019t right!\u201d However large her latest piece, she could just roll it up and take it wherever she needed. Quilts also became a stealthy means of getting her own story out there. \u201cI have always wanted to tell my story or, more to the point, my side of the story,\u201d Ringgold writes in the preface to her memoir, We Flew Over the Bridge, which was published in 1995. Her first autobiography, completed in 1980, was met with a string of rejections. \u201cIt was then that I hit on the strategy of self-publication through masked performance pieces and readings of my story quilts at college lecture dates and exhibitions,\u201d she explains in her book. For a long time, quilts have been both a utilitarian and subversive medium. \u201cIt was an art form that slaves used to keep themselves warm and to also import their art because they couldn\u2019t bring the art forms that they practised in Africa,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThis was a way of them being able to continue their art in a way that was acceptable to the slavers because it was keeping them warm.\u201d Tar Beach #2 is one of a number of story quilts in Ringgold\u2019s Woman on a Bridge series, named after the tar rooftops of the apartment buildings in Harlem where people used to go to cool off on a hot day. Ringgold was a child during the Harlem renaissance; artists and musicians such as Jacob Lawrence, Duke Ellington and Aaron Douglas lived around the corner from her family. \u201cThere was excitement and festiveness\u201d in the air, she says. People would gather on the roofs and tell stories: \u201cI guess that\u2019s why I became a storyteller, because I heard so many stories.\u201d Another of Ringgold\u2019s story quilts, Coming to Jones Road #6: Baby Freedom Came One Night, is hanging nearby. The series was partly inspired by Ringgold\u2019s experience of moving to a house in New Jersey in the 90s. She\u2019d bought the property from another artist and planned to build a studio, but the neighbours weren\u2019t keen on a black neighbour and took her to court. \u201cThe neighbours figured, \u2018If we keep her from building this studio, she\u2019ll go. We\u2019ll stall her, and eventually she\u2019ll leave.\u2019 But they didn\u2019t know: I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d In Coming to Jones Road Part 1, Ringgold tells the story by harking back to the experience of runaway slaves migrating to the north. \u201cOut of every awful thing is something beautiful,\u201d she says. \u201cAs an artist I want to see the beauty, especially in situations that I can\u2019t change and that are so prevalent.\u201d Ringgold is adept at presenting ugly themes in beautiful ways. There have been times when people have spectacularly missed those layers. In 1970, just after her second solo show in New York, Ringgold caught the attention of David Rockefeller, the chief executive of Chase Manhattan bank. He sent a couple of representatives to buy a piece to hang in the bank. They walked past the pieces that looked too obviously political and then stood approvingly in front of a piece featuring the American flag. \u201cThe flag, very patriotic. Yeah, let\u2019s get it,\u201d she remembers the woman saying. \u201cAnd then the guy says to the woman, \u2018But did you read it?\u2019 The woman began to read the letters in the star section of the flag. \u201cD-I-E.\u201d That was fine. Edgy but fine. \u201cYeah, but put your head to the side, to the left side, and read,\u201d Ringgold told them. \u201cOK, hold on. \u2018N-I-G-G ...\u2019 Oh. Oh my goodness.\u201d The pair ran out of the door and did not buy the piece: Flag for the Moon, Die Nigger, 1969. (Eventually they returned and bought a more palatable piece called Black Light #9: American Spectrum, which is in the Serpentine show). Ringgold has lived through momentous political and cultural change. Is any of her current work addressing Donald Trump? \u201cOh my God,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cYou had to bring him in! Well, I\u2019ve started a series on him: Trump the Chump. I\u2019ve done lots of sketches on him. And I\u2019m gonna come up with some paintings shortly. He is something, he really is.\u201d The Trump sketches are just a diversion, a form of art therapy, rather than a real project at the moment. Ringgold\u2019s current focus is a series about ageing called Aging-aling-aling. All over the world people are living longer and longer, she notes, and this series will be an exploration of our elongated lives. While she may be nearing 90, age hasn\u2019t slowed her down much. She still gets up early and heads to her studio to paint every morning. \u201cI want to get that work done,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t stop until it is done.\u201d \u2022 Faith Ringgold is at the Serpentine Gallery, London, 8 June to 8 September. An Evening with Faith Ringgold is at the Conway Hall, London, 6 June.",

But on the global scene they can only be described as novices, having made their international debut at the 2012 Olympic Games (crashing out of the tournament without a single point).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/04/womens-world-cup-2019-team-guide-no-17-canada\">Women's World Cup 2019 team guide No 17: Canada</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cameroon sealed their spot at the 2019 World Cup after finishing third at the 2018 Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations with a team that had an average age of 27 and a mix of experienced domestic and overseas players that gives the squad a good blend.</p> <p>They usually start in a 4-3-3 formation, reliant on the players\u2019 hard work and aggressiveness to win games. Blessed with a plethora of talented attackers, the Indomitable Lionesses prefer to play on the counter. Gabrielle Aboudi Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9 and Ajara Nchout Njoya are pacy and clever and play with the sort of pragmatism that makes them thorns in the flesh of rival defenders.</p> <p>Likely to start on the bench, Cameroon\u2019s all-time leading scorer, the 35-year-old Madeleine Ngono Mani, who has scored 40 goals in a 17-year-stint with the national team, is set to play a bit-part role in France. Albeit in the twilight of her career, the former Guingamp striker, who is now with Albi Croix in the French second division, always performs when called upon.</p> <p>Cameroon have a solid supply line from the midfield to the attack courtesy of the superbly versatile Raissa Feudjio but the ability to stop the opponents is down to the holding midfielder, Genevieve Ngo Mbeleck, whose incredible work rate is key to the team.</p> <p>But for all the talent that Cameroon have up front and in midfield, there are problems in defence. The glory days of 33-year-old goalkeeper Annette Ngo Ndom appear to be over and there are some concerns over whether the four-time Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations captain and centre-back Christine Manie, now 35, is past her best too. She was questioned after Cameroon conceded four goals in five games at the 2018 Africa Cup of Nations.</p> <h2><strong>Coach</strong></h2> <p>Appointed in January 2019, five months before the World Cup, Alain Djeumfa has to shoulder the hopes of fans from a football-mad nation \u2013 but he relishes it. The 46-year-old has previously coached a host of top-tier teams in Cameroon. He worked under the former women\u2019s national team coach, Carl Enow Ngachu, and likes to play with a high press. An unflappable and pragmatic tactician, Djeumfa has said he feels his team has the quality and desire to test the planet\u2019s best teams.</p> <h2><strong>Star player</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b726b7c88f83900becb4e69f031b5f45a7884a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b726b7c88f83900becb4e69f031b5f45a7884a9/0_20_3048_1829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ga\u00eblle Enganamouit emerged at the last World Cup in Canada and Cameroon will look to her for goals again.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ga\u00eblle Enganamouit emerged at the last World Cup in Canada and Cameroon will look to her for goals again.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maddie Meye/FIFA via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A lot of the attention will focus on the forward Ga\u00eblle Enganamouit when the World Cup kicks off. A lanky and astute attacker, she turns 27 the day before Cameroon\u2019s group opener against Canada in Montpellier on 10 June.

      "bodyText": "This article is part of the Guardian\u2019s 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup Experts\u2019 Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 24 countries who have qualified for France. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 7 June. Overview Four years after impressing in their debut World Cup in Canada, progressing from the group before losing in the last 16 to China, Cameroon are heading to France this summer with a renewed impetus. Regulars at the Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations since its creation in 1991 with 11 appearances, the Indomitable Lionesses have finished runners up in the continental showpiece four times. But on the global scene they can only be described as novices, having made their international debut at the 2012 Olympic Games (crashing out of the tournament without a single point). Cameroon sealed their spot at the 2019 World Cup after finishing third at the 2018 Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations with a team that had an average age of 27 and a mix of experienced domestic and overseas players that gives the squad a good blend. They usually start in a 4-3-3 formation, reliant on the players\u2019 hard work and aggressiveness to win games. Blessed with a plethora of talented attackers, the Indomitable Lionesses prefer to play on the counter. Gabrielle Aboudi Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9 and Ajara Nchout Njoya are pacy and clever and play with the sort of pragmatism that makes them thorns in the flesh of rival defenders. Likely to start on the bench, Cameroon\u2019s all-time leading scorer, the 35-year-old Madeleine Ngono Mani, who has scored 40 goals in a 17-year-stint with the national team, is set to play a bit-part role in France. Albeit in the twilight of her career, the former Guingamp striker, who is now with Albi Croix in the French second division, always performs when called upon. Cameroon have a solid supply line from the midfield to the attack courtesy of the superbly versatile Raissa Feudjio but the ability to stop the opponents is down to the holding midfielder, Genevieve Ngo Mbeleck, whose incredible work rate is key to the team. But for all the talent that Cameroon have up front and in midfield, there are problems in defence. The glory days of 33-year-old goalkeeper Annette Ngo Ndom appear to be over and there are some concerns over whether the four-time Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations captain and centre-back Christine Manie, now 35, is past her best too. She was questioned after Cameroon conceded four goals in five games at the 2018 Africa Cup of Nations. Coach Appointed in January 2019, five months before the World Cup, Alain Djeumfa has to shoulder the hopes of fans from a football-mad nation \u2013 but he relishes it. The 46-year-old has previously coached a host of top-tier teams in Cameroon. He worked under the former women\u2019s national team coach, Carl Enow Ngachu, and likes to play with a high press. An unflappable and pragmatic tactician, Djeumfa has said he feels his team has the quality and desire to test the planet\u2019s best teams. Star player A lot of the attention will focus on the forward Ga\u00eblle Enganamouit when the World Cup kicks off. A lanky and astute attacker, she turns 27 the day before Cameroon\u2019s group opener against Canada in Montpellier on 10 June. She scored three goals in Canada 2015 and was voted the African women\u2019s footballer of the year after clinching the Golden Boot in Sweden with her club side Avaldsnes. Despite having had her fair share of injuries and the fact that she is currently without a club after departing M\u00e1laga in April, the Yaound\u00e9 native is poised for a starring role in France. Did you know? The defender Estelle Johnson is set to make her international debut for Cameroon at the 2019 World Cup in France despite having an American father and a Malian mother.

Reaching the quarter-finals. They have matured since the last World Cup and have made huge strides by playing a Cup of Nations final in 2016 and finishing third in 2018. Anything short of a quarter-final spot will be considered an underachievement. Annual budget for the women\u2019s national team (compared to men\u2019s): Cameroon\u2019s football federation (Fecafoot) has disbursed about 1.5 billion FCFA (\u00a32m) for the Indomitable Lionesses\u2019 preparation for France. Number of registered female players in Cameroon Close to 22,000 male players are licensed at Fecafoot for the 2018-2019 season with just 908 women having licences. During the 2017-2018 championship, 1,452 women footballers were registered with Cameroon\u2019s football ruling body. Njie Enow works for Cameroon Radio Television. Follow him here on Twitter.",

What we said: \u201cFull of subtle charm, it\u2019s an album of deceptive depths in which to immerse yourself.\u201d Read the full review Cass McCombs \u2013 Tip of the Sphere The Californian troubadour, who has steadily wound his way through the fringes of Americana and indie for over 15 years, delivers another romantic, faintly psychedelic masterpiece. What we said: \u201cMcCombs rewards deep listening. Tip of the Sphere is his ninth studio album of ever-expansive Americana, one where his myth properly matures.\u201d Read the full review The Comet Is Coming \u2013 Trust in the Life Force of the Deep Mystery With as much an affinity with hip-hop and progressive rock as jazz, the trio of reeds player Shabaka Hutchings, synth player Dan Leavers and drummer Max Hallett make one of the most cosmic statements of the current British jazz revival. What we said: \u201cThis is hardcore music for a generation weaned on rave and grime, jazz\u2019s cutting edge. The comet isn\u2019t coming, it\u2019s arrived.\u201d Read the full review Dave \u2013 Psychodrama Socially engaged and emotionally complex, Streatham\u2019s finest frets on black history and family strife with his clearly enunciated flow \u2013 but there\u2019s still a faint summery heat to tracks such as Location, Disaster and Voices. What we said: \u201cThe album lasts for the best part of an hour, and not a minute of its running time seems wasted or padded out. The end result is certainly the boldest album to emerge from UK hip-hop\u2019s renaissance. It may also be the best.\u201d Read the full review Angel Bat Dawid \u2013 The Oracle Spiritual jazz is reborn in Dawid\u2019s beguiling songs, layered from recordings made on her phone: dizzyingly beautiful runs on her clarinet are paired with keening harmonised vocals. What we said: \u201cThis is an intriguing album, futuristic in tone but hardwired to an ancient and deeply spiritual vision of what music can achieve.\u201d Read the full review Dawn \u2013 New Breed Simpler than the futuristic trio of albums that preceded it, New Breed welds musical reflections from Dawn\u2019s home town of New Orleans with spacey psychedelia as indebted to krautrock as southern screw, coupled with forthright lyrical assertions of the effort it has taken to forge her musical identity. What we said: \u201cThe music on New Breed is often hugely inventive but it also functions as pop: you get the feeling she spends as much time bulletproofing her choruses as she does tinkering with the futuristic sound design.\u201d Read the full review Deerhunter \u2013 Why Hasn\u2019t Everything Already Disappeared? Bradford Cox\u2019s outfit continue to be the best indie rock band in the US, considering everything from Jo Cox\u2019s death to environmental collapse over Kinks-y psychedelia with wit and wonderment intact. What we said: \u201cThere\u2019s a confidence about its stylistic leaps that means it feels like the expression of an authentically idiosyncratic imagination rather than someone being weird and eclectic for the sake of it.\u201d Read the full review Durand Jones &amp; the Indications \u2013 American Love Call An overlooked masterpiece of modern soul, the Indiana quintet are shamelessly retro in their style: all pert brass and crooning close harmonies. But when the songwriting is this perfect, who cares about originality? What we said: \u201cThere simply isn\u2019t a weak or even middling track, and the strongest can go toe to toe with the best of Al Green or Bobby Womack.\u201d Read the full review Billie Eilish \u2013 When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? The gothic teen queen came through with some characteristically unsettling productions on her debut album, but equally showed an unexpected love of show tunes that posited her as a Gen-Z Fiona Apple. What we said: \u201cLike a horror auteur, Eilish uses intimacy to amplify scares. She sings in a discomfitingly close gasp, like an ASMR actor having a panic attack.\u201d Read the full review Fontaines DC \u2013 Dogrel The most exciting new Irish band in a generation, Fontaines DC\u2019s songs, populated by a vivid cast of characters from yuppies to nationalists, are full of vim and vigour \u2013 but also tenderness. What we said: \u201cThis is the kind of songwriting quality that bands can take years to reach, or never reach at all: brilliant, top to bottom.\u201d Read the full review Rhiannon Giddens with Francesco Turrisi \u2013 There Is No Other The purposeful folk star Rhiannon Giddens teams with the Italian multi-instrumentalist for an album that explores how sounds and rhythms from Africa and the Arabic world connect with traditional music from Europe and America. What we said: \u201cThe project could have got suffocated in impossible worthiness, but fear not \u2013 it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Read the full review Ariana Grande \u2013 Thank U, Next Released just six months after Sweetener, an album that channelled Grande\u2019s resilience in the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing, Thank U, Next was a looser, more experimental creative burst that delved deeper into Grande\u2019s psyche following the death of former fiance Mac Miller, and let her swaggering id run free on tracks such as 7 Rings and Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I\u2019m Bored. What we said: \u201cAs with Rihanna\u2019s Anti, this feels like the work of a pop star previously happy to act as conduit for other people, finally working out who they are and what they want to say.\u201d Read the full review Aldous Harding \u2013 Designer The finely turned folk-pop on Harding\u2019s third album was as beautiful as her lyrics were cryptic \u2013 you can join her in puzzling over what she was doing in Dubai (indeed, were she ever there) while swooning to her finger-picked nylon guitar. What we said: \u201cIt occasionally sounds like a lost Laurel Canyon singer-songwriter album from the immediately post-psychedelic era.\u201d Read the full review Holly Herndon \u2013 Proto For Proto, Herndon processed human voices through an \u201cAI baby\u201d she named Spawn, though the results remained pleasingly human: choirs spliced into fractal wonders, and on Eternal, a towering pop song to tickle the synapses. What we said: \u201cHerndon counters the hysteria around AI with an album that presents it as a quizzical, cute pet on the leash of a human master: a sensitive, responsive part of the family.\u201d Read the full review Jayda G \u2013 Significant Changes Born out of Jayda G\u2019s research as an environmental toxicologist and her clubbing life as a resident of Berlin, Significant Changes is a funky delight that shifts nimbly from exhilarating highs (Leave Room 2 Breathe) to orca-aided ambience. What we said: \u201cJayda G\u2019s own grooves are as captivating as her DJ sets, whether they\u2019re freely bathing beneath Chi-town sun or dipping into more sombre waters.\u201d Read the full review Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo \u2013 Celia Last year, the Beninese artist released an inspired full-album cover of Talking Heads\u2019 Remain in Light; this year, she turned her hand to songs by Celia Cruz, queen of salsa, highlighting the Cuban star\u2019s African roots with assistance from Tony Allen, the west African Gangb\u00e9 Brass Band, Britain\u2019s Sons of Kemet and American Meshell Ndegeocello on bass. What we said: \u201cThis is not just an album of covers but an inventive reinterpretation.\u201d Read the full review Kelsey Lu \u2013 Blood The New York-based cellist transcended her status as a collaborator with artists including Solange and Blood Orange on her stirring debut: disco reverie Poor Fake is a particular highlight. What we said: \u201cBlood is an enticingly restrained debut, showing a consistency of tone without compromising on Lu\u2019s inventiveness.\u201d Read the full review Rustin Man \u2013 Drift Code His naive, trembling voice may be a little like Robert Wyatt\u2019s, but is still a uniquely arresting instrument, haunting a series of wonderfully meandering folk-rock backings. What we said: \u201cEach instrument\u2019s contribution to the album was recorded in turn, rather than track by track, yet it sounds like an organic whole. In fact, it sounds magnificent.\u201d Read the full review Our Native Daughters \u2013 Songs of Our Native Daughters A supergroup comprising North American roots musicians Rhiannon Giddens, Leyla McCalla, Allison Russell and Amythyst Kiah: together, these banjo-wielding heroines confronted the historic and continued abuse of African American women with authority and intimacy. What we said: \u201cBut what Giddens and her cohorts have managed to create is a record of great importance and exceptional beauty, its darker moments countered by points of bright wonder.\u201d Read the full review Maja SK Ratkje \u2013 Sult One of the most plainly beautiful releases from the experimental Norwegian vocalist \u2013 using a retrofitted pump organ, plaintive ballads sit alongside whimsical flights of fancy. What we said: \u201cRatkje can write strong, vocal-led songs, such as Sayago and \u00d8ine Som R\u00e5silke, that transform this collection from background music into something that stands alone.\u201d Read the full review Lucy Rose \u2013 No Words Left Made in the throes of an identity crisis and a floundering sense of purpose, Rose\u2019s fourth record paradoxically found her at her most artistically assured, possessed of a new lyrical profundity and melodic weightiness. What we said: \u201cHer fourth album is her starkest, filled with lyrics about uncertainty and isolation, and yet her most striking, conveying the strongest sense of her artistic identity yet.\u201d Read the full review Sleaford Mods \u2013 Eton Alive The one saving grace of Brexit Britain being so utterly toxic is that Sleaford Mods still have something to write about: they remain the great contemporary poets of a nation that is much worse than it thinks it is. What we said: \u201cDespite its title, Eton Alive isn\u2019t a grand statement on the health of the nation or the ever-powerful English ruling class. It prefers to critique this troubled isle through the minutiae of daily life, which is perhaps even more effective and damning.\u201d Read the full review Slowthai \u2013 Nothing Great About Britain Another wretched yet amused state-of-the-nation address delivered in a broad, leering Midlands accent, Slowthai draws on sounds that have long chimed with the disaffected in the UK: grime, garage, punk and trip-hop. What we said: \u201cClever, bleak, funny, bracing, aware of a broad musical heritage but never in thrall to it.\u201d Read the full review Sharon Van Etten \u2013 Remind Me Tomorrow An ambitious and richly produced album, with buzzing industrial electronics newly folded into Van Etten\u2019s torrid indie-rock songcraft: here are big emotions splashed across an even bigger canvas. What we said: \u201cThis ambitious, arresting album feels like the work of an artist wielding her considerable talents with newfound confidence and conviction.\u201d Read the full review Aki Takase/Japanic \u2013 Thema Prima At 71, jazz pianist Aki Takase is more sprightly and inventive than people half her age: Thema Prima bursts with energy, with blurts of sassy big band, screwball improv and classy balladeering. What we said: \u201cIt\u2019s a wilfully intoxicating jazz brew that only Takase could have stirred in quite this way.\u201d Read the full review Vampire Weekend \u2013 Father of the Bride Returning after a six-year break, Vampire Weekend \u2013 now Ezra Koenig and a heap of collaborators \u2013 remain smart but never smart-arse. Addressing the environment, Jewishness and love, this is classic American songwriting reaches back to classic country and Paul Simon while facing forward. What we said: \u201cIt deals with many topics that have exercised songwriters of late, from the noise of social media and its bubbles to the rise of populist politics, and does so with an elegant turn of phrase: \u2018Why\u2019s it felt like Halloween since Christmas 2017?\u2019\u201d Read the full review WH Lung \u2013 Incidental Music Every other year seems to throw up its own nervy motorik combo \u2013 and this year\u2019s contenders are the Manchester group WH Lung, whose debut adds to the equation exhilarating psychedelia and compellingly obscure lyricism. What we said: \u201cIncidental Music is like a rollercoaster ride you want to get straight back on and do all over again.\u201d Read the full review Jamila Woods \u2013 Legacy! Legacy! With each track title named after a significant black cultural figure \u2013 Zora, Eartha, Basquiat, and so on \u2013 this beautiful record also draws from across the black musical spectrum: rap, R&amp;B, soul and gospel. What we said: \u201cHer contemplative, modern style of soul is built both for marching, and for recuperation, when you need to recover from the fight.\u201d Read the full review Nil\u00fcfer Yanya \u2013 Miss Universe The London guitarist hardly needed the between-song skits about contemporary anxieties to make her point on her rapturous and compellingly uneasy debut, laced with rare, bona fide indie anthems (In Your Head) and ripcord yelp shocks (Heavyweight Champion of the Year). What we said: \u201cA ragged miscellany of styles \u2013 rackety alt-rock, radio-ready pop, saxophones that appear to have escaped from a Sade album, jagged left-field guitars, primitive drum machines and what sounds like an attempt to make the kind of 80s AOR ballad that\u2019s popular with Magic Radio on a lo-fi, bedroom-bound budget.\u201d Read the full review",

      "bodyText": "There is almost nowhere on Earth Jeremy Corbyn belongs more than on a protest against a rightwing US president. His whole life might have been a preparation for this moment: 40 lonely years of preaching anti-US sermons in the rain to a handful of Stop the War faithful, only to find himself on the big stage for the big one. It marks a rare outbreak of leftwing unity after weeks of rage over Brexit, too. The revoltingness of Donald Trump is one of the few things on which virtually all factions of the Labour party still agree \u2013 and resistance has been a bonding experience for Britons more generally. From the student who mowed a giant penis into a meadow under his flight path to the Duchess of Cornwall being caught winking behind his back, every indignity heaped on Trump is a joy. How could Corbyn not be on the march, especially when the resurgent Liberal Democrats will be there in force, threatening once again to outflank him? It\u2019s arguably a mark of the trouble we\u2019re in, however, that for the leader of the opposition to protest against the most easily offended US president in living memory feels like a complete no-brainer. Conventional wisdom has always been that anyone who wants to be considered a prime minister-in-waiting should put the national interest above personal feelings when dealing with foreign politicians \u2013 and it\u2019s still in the national interest to keep the US close on the grounds that alliances between nations outlive the people they occasionally elect. In 2006, when David Cameron said something mildly disobliging about George W Bush\u2019s foreign policy, the internal row raged for weeks. Even Charles Kennedy\u2019s decision to march against the Iraq war worried some senior Lib Dems, regardless of the fact that he was never realistically going to be prime minister. By comparison, Trafalgar Square currently features a giant replica of Donald Trump on the toilet, tweeting with his trousers round his ankles.

      "body": "<p>Even though it was not unexpected, it is still horrifying. To assume that the Sudanese revolution would manage to topple not only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/14/sudan-protests-turn-violent-death-as-omar-al-bashir-is-charged\" title=\"\">Omar al-Bashir</a> but also uproot the deeply entrenched network of military and security interests behind him was always optimistic. But the success of the protests so far, and the extent and consistency of the protesters\u2019 efforts, offered a glimmer of hope that while civilians were negotiating with the transitional military government to end military rule, their leverage in the streets was strong.</p> <p>It became obvious, however, that the military regime and its associated security bodies were simply playing for time. And they have finally run out of patience. On Monday night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/03/sudan-khartoum-protest-gunfire-explosions-heard\" title=\"\">the massacre began</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/29/hemedti-the-feared-commander-pulling-the-strings-in-sudan\" title=\"\">Rapid Support Forces</a> (RSF), a paramilitary group created from the remnants of the infamous Janjaweed militia, moved against the main areas where sit-ins were occurring in Khartoum and opened fire. The troops burned the encampments, beat whoever they did not kill, and blockaded roads and hospitals so that medical support could not reach the wounded and the dying. There are reports of rape, pillage, and the bodies of the executed floating in the river Nile.</p> <p>The country was then plunged into a communications blackout, with sporadic access to the internet only producing howls of bereavement and desperation as the faces of missing loved ones were circulated on social media. The body count continues to rise; the last official figure was 31, but dozens more are missing and hundreds are injured.</p> <p>These are unfamiliar scenes in Khartoum. In Darfur, where the Janjaweed originated, and in other parts of Sudan from where Bashir\u2019s government, holed up in the garrison city of Khartoum, dispatched mercenaries to violently suppress rebellion, they were commonplace. But rebellion has finally come to Khartoum, and so the Janjaweed, briefly restrained by the military and led by the deputy leader of the transitional government, were unmuzzled to do what they do best \u2013 scorched-earth suppression.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/25/sudan-people-revolt-stalls-trump-looks-other-way\">Sudan, Algeria, Libya: new Arab spring stalls as Trump looks away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was always clear that the Sudanese revolution was going to be a long process of attrition. The protesters were praised for their canniness in understanding that, even though the dictator had been toppled, there would be no returning home until the military went back to the barracks. There would be no hoodwinking them with transitional periods and election promises only made in order to give the \u201cnew\u201d military government time to bed in. But the immensity of the task has quickly become clear.</p> <p>Bashir\u2019s regime not only impoverished the country and murdered its restive and marginalised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/12/bashir-charged-with-darfur-genocide\" title=\"\">ethnic groups</a>, it created an entire parallel security infrastructure outside the army. This grew from an informal ragtag band of village-torchers into a large organised body with its own culture, its own economy, its own grudges against the coddled elites of Khartoum \u2013 even its own foreign policy and funding. An organised body that seems to relish the opportunity to show those comfortable Khartoum dwellers \u2013 absent from the bush and desert, the wars and skirmishes of the past 20 years \u2013 who is boss. What the Sudanese revolution is reckoning with now is the very heart of Bashir\u2019s government distilled into its essential parts: networks of patronage with too much to lose, militias grown too large to disband, and dirty deals with regional allies too important to jettison.</p> <p>The RSF and the military\u2019s foreign alliances with the powers of the Gulf represent another front against the Sudanese revolution. The RSF\u2019s leader, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, has supported the Saudi war in Yemen by providing Sudanese soldiers \u2013 some of them <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/28/world/africa/saudi-sudan-yemen-child-fighters.html\" title=\"\">reported to be children</a> \u2013 in exchange for financial assistance. The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia\u2019s partner in the coalition in Yemen, also has a strong interest in ensuring that this access to Sudan\u2019s cannon fodder continues.</p> <p>Egypt, another ally in the axis of the counter-revolution, is also wary of any civilian government in Sudan. A delegation from the Sudanese military council met with representatives of all three countries in the run-up to this week\u2019s massacre, strongly suggesting that the plan was hatched \u2013 or at least blessed \u2013 by these allies, eager to prevent the disruption of any military support they receive from Sudan, and keen to avoid the undesirable optics of a successful civilian revolution in the region.</p> <p>And so the Sudanese revolution is fighting against four governments. The international community \u2013 so interested and morally exercised by Bashir\u2019s human rights abuses in the past that it has left Sudan hobbled by years of economic sanctions and international isolation \u2013 has now moved on. It will only issue the usual boilerplate condemnations of violence.</p> <p>The Sudanese remain alone, locked in a death grip with a government that has now dropped all pretence of negotiation or compromise. Layer by layer, Bashir\u2019s regime has been stripped back to show its true face. There is no longer any amnesty afforded to those from the right class or ethnic background, if the price for that mercy would mean the relinquishing of power. Sudan\u2019s wars have come home to the capital.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Even though it was not unexpected, it is still horrifying. To assume that the Sudanese revolution would manage to topple not only Omar al-Bashir but also uproot the deeply entrenched network of military and security interests behind him was always optimistic. But the success of the protests so far, and the extent and consistency of the protesters\u2019 efforts, offered a glimmer of hope that while civilians were negotiating with the transitional military government to end military rule, their leverage in the streets was strong. It became obvious, however, that the military regime and its associated security bodies were simply playing for time. And they have finally run out of patience. On Monday night the massacre began. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group created from the remnants of the infamous Janjaweed militia, moved against the main areas where sit-ins were occurring in Khartoum and opened fire. The troops burned the encampments, beat whoever they did not kill, and blockaded roads and hospitals so that medical support could not reach the wounded and the dying. There are reports of rape, pillage, and the bodies of the executed floating in the river Nile. The country was then plunged into a communications blackout, with sporadic access to the internet only producing howls of bereavement and desperation as the faces of missing loved ones were circulated on social media. The body count continues to rise; the last official figure was 31, but dozens more are missing and hundreds are injured. These are unfamiliar scenes in Khartoum. In Darfur, where the Janjaweed originated, and in other parts of Sudan from where Bashir\u2019s government, holed up in the garrison city of Khartoum, dispatched mercenaries to violently suppress rebellion, they were commonplace. But rebellion has finally come to Khartoum, and so the Janjaweed, briefly restrained by the military and led by the deputy leader of the transitional government, were unmuzzled to do what they do best \u2013 scorched-earth suppression. It was always clear that the Sudanese revolution was going to be a long process of attrition. The protesters were praised for their canniness in understanding that, even though the dictator had been toppled, there would be no returning home until the military went back to the barracks. There would be no hoodwinking them with transitional periods and election promises only made in order to give the \u201cnew\u201d military government time to bed in. But the immensity of the task has quickly become clear. Bashir\u2019s regime not only impoverished the country and murdered its restive and marginalised ethnic groups, it created an entire parallel security infrastructure outside the army. This grew from an informal ragtag band of village-torchers into a large organised body with its own culture, its own economy, its own grudges against the coddled elites of Khartoum \u2013 even its own foreign policy and funding. An organised body that seems to relish the opportunity to show those comfortable Khartoum dwellers \u2013 absent from the bush and desert, the wars and skirmishes of the past 20 years \u2013 who is boss. What the Sudanese revolution is reckoning with now is the very heart of Bashir\u2019s government distilled into its essential parts: networks of patronage with too much to lose, militias grown too large to disband, and dirty deals with regional allies too important to jettison. The RSF and the military\u2019s foreign alliances with the powers of the Gulf represent another front against the Sudanese revolution. The RSF\u2019s leader, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, has supported the Saudi war in Yemen by providing Sudanese soldiers \u2013 some of them reported to be children \u2013 in exchange for financial assistance. The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia\u2019s partner in the coalition in Yemen, also has a strong interest in ensuring that this access to Sudan\u2019s cannon fodder continues. Egypt, another ally in the axis of the counter-revolution, is also wary of any civilian government in Sudan. A delegation from the Sudanese military council met with representatives of all three countries in the run-up to this week\u2019s massacre, strongly suggesting that the plan was hatched \u2013 or at least blessed \u2013 by these allies, eager to prevent the disruption of any military support they receive from Sudan, and keen to avoid the undesirable optics of a successful civilian revolution in the region. And so the Sudanese revolution is fighting against four governments. The international community \u2013 so interested and morally exercised by Bashir\u2019s human rights abuses in the past that it has left Sudan hobbled by years of economic sanctions and international isolation \u2013 has now moved on. It will only issue the usual boilerplate condemnations of violence. The Sudanese remain alone, locked in a death grip with a government that has now dropped all pretence of negotiation or compromise. Layer by layer, Bashir\u2019s regime has been stripped back to show its true face. There is no longer any amnesty afforded to those from the right class or ethnic background, if the price for that mercy would mean the relinquishing of power. Sudan\u2019s wars have come home to the capital. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist",

Odds: 10/1 Andrea Leadsom The former House of Commons leader, who left Theresa May as the last candidate standing when she pulled out of the previous leadership race in 2016, has decided to have another tilt at the top job, saying she has the \u201cexperience and confidence\u201d to \u201clead this country into a brighter future\u201d. But even with her staunch Brexiter tendencies, she would be seen as an outsider. Odds: 10/1 Jeremy Hunt Fears that the foreign secretary would be another overly woolly compromise choice were hardly assuaged when after a set-piece speech he seemed unable to outline why his brand of Conservatism might appeal to voters. Odds: 12/1 Matt Hancock The health secretary remains a relative outsider, but the longer the race goes on, the more he gains ground for the seemingly basic virtues of being apparently competent and broadly similar to a normal human being, albeit a particularly energetic one. A concerted effort would probably require an image consultant. Odds: 33/1 Rory Stewart The cabinet\u2019s most recent arrival \u2013 Penny Mordaunt\u2019s promotion to defence led to Stewart becoming international development secretary \u2013 certainly has the necessary ambition and self-belief, plus a privileged if unorthodox backstory covering Eton, Oxford, a senior role in postwar Iraq and a bestselling book about walking across Afghanistan. He remains an outsider, not least because of his remain tendencies and slightly 2010 view of compassionate Conservatism. Odds: 25/1 Esther McVey The former work and pensions secretary, who quit last year over May\u2019s Brexit plans, has launched her own in-party campaign group/leadership vehicle called Blue Collar Conservatism. It promises to make the party more amenable to voters in deprived communities \u2013 mainly through a promise to deliver a strong Brexit and policies such as diverting much of the foreign aid budget to schools and police. Odds: 50/1 Sajid Javid The home secretary still has the same weaknesses: he is an uninspiring speaker and some worry he is too fond of headline-grabbing, illiberal political gestures. But he is almost as ubiquitous as Liz Truss, and clearly believes this is his time. He even has a grassroots/astroturf Twitter feed \u2013 \u201cAvid4Javid\u201d. Odds: 20/1 Kit Malthouse The housing minister is credited as the convener of both Conservative leavers and remainers to develop a compromise on May\u2019s withdrawal agreement. He said there was a \u201cyearning for change\u201d. The 52-year-old is a former deputy mayor of London and entered the Commons in 2015 when David Cameron\u2019s Conservatives won a majority. His name was given to the \u201cMalthouse compromise\u201d \u2013 a proposal drawn up by backbenchers from leave and remain wings of the Tory party, which would have implemented May\u2019s Brexit deal with the backstop replaced by alternative arrangements. Odds 100/1 Mark Harper The Forest of Dean MP is one of the less well-known names to have expressed an interest in the top job, and has odds to match. The 49-year-old worked under Theresa May as immigration minister and was behind the controversial campaign that sent vans around the country displaying the slogan: \u201cHere illegally? Go home or risk arrest\u201d. His tenure was cut short after he discovered his self-employed cleaner did not have permission to work in the UK. He later became the minister for disabled people and the chief whip. Odds 100/1 Sam Gyimah The former universities minister is the only Conservative MP running on the offer of a second Brexit referendum \u2013 but with odds of 200/1 he looks unlikely to be putting this into practice. Gyimah, the MP for East Surrey since 2010, became the 13th candidate to run for Theresa May\u2019s job. The former Goldman Sachs investment banker resigned from the government in November in protest at her deal. Odds 200/1 Other possible candidates Sir Graham Brady While hugely influential within the Conservative party, he is little known outside it. Brady stood down as the chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs shortly after May\u2019s announcement and later confirmed that he was considering running, saying he had been approached by several Tory colleagues. Odds: 20/1 Penny Mordaunt Previously seen as a definite outsider, her promotion from international development secretary to defence after the sacking of Gavin Williamson has significantly bolstered her position. As both a confirmed Brexiter and a social liberal, she could unite different camps, but Mordaunt remains relatively untested. Odds: 20/1 James Brokenshire A not entirely serious place in the list for the housing and communities secretary, who insists he is not standing, for the achievement of gaining unexpected prominence simply through owning four ovens. Leadership bids have been made and lost on less. Odds: 200/1 All odds via Ladbrokes Dropped out James Cleverley The former deputy chair of the Conservative party pulled out of the race on 4 June. He had been the 11th person to declare his leadership bid. Not running Liz Truss The chief secretary to the Treasury has ruled herself out, but told the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cWe need someone who has backed Brexit from the start.\u201d Amber Rudd The work and pensions secretary says: \u201cI don\u2019t think it is my time at the moment,\u201d but has hinted she would be prepared to work with Johnson.",

Cleverly\u2019s decision reduces the field to 12 candidates. The Brexit minister and former Tory vice-chairman would have been unlikely to meet a threshold of 12 endorsements, which the party\u2019s backbench executive could introduce this week to cut the number of candidates. \u201cIt is clear that despite much support, particularly from our party\u2019s grassroots, MPs weren\u2019t comfortable with such a move [his candidacy] and it has been clear that I would not progress to the final two candidates,\u201d Cleverly said in a statement. Earlier on Tuesday, Liam Fox backed the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, to be the next Conservative leader, in a further splintering of cabinet endorsements in five different directions. The international trade secretary is the first cabinet member to support Hunt, who is one of the four frontrunners alongside Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Dominic Raab. Fox, one of the cabinet\u2019s most dedicated Brexiters, surprised some other leadership camps on Tuesday with his endorsement of Hunt, who has said pursuing no deal would be \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d because it would lead to a general election.

David Gauke, the justice secretary, who has repeatedly cautioned against a no-deal Brexit, has backed the outsider candidate Rory Stewart, formerly a junior minister in his department. Stewart, who has ruled out pursuing a no-deal Brexit, has attracted mass media attention for his campaign, which has been based on social media videos of him meeting the public at short-notice events around the country. Several high-profile cabinet names are yet to declare who they will back, including the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, who has been one of the most vocal cabinet voices against leaving the EU without an agreement. Rudd\u2019s 60-strong group of One Nation Conservative MPs will hold its first of three hustings on Tuesday night for Tory candidates.

Rules must then be agreed by the party board on Wednesday and the first round of voting is expected to take place the following Thursday. Several members of the committee favour new rules under which each candidate would need a proposer, a seconder and 10 supporters to make the ballot of MPs \u2013 a total of 12 endorsements.

      "body": "<p>Sheila Hollins is one of the UK\u2019s foremost authorities on learning disability and mental health. But the crossbench peer says her greatest achievement is founding <a href=\"https://booksbeyondwords.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Beyond Words</a>, a pioneering not-for-profit organisation that produces picture books to help people with communication issues. \u201cBeyond Words is what I feel most passionate about because it\u2019s about transforming people\u2019s lives,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Its origins lie in Hollins\u2019 use of pictures to interact with her son, Nigel, who has a learning disability. \u201cHe would roar with laughter at Laurel and Hardy [silent] films but didn\u2019t put a word together till he was eight.\u201d When Nigel was nervous about an adventure holiday, his parents drew pictures depicting activities like abseiling: \u201cWhen we put things into pictures, he felt more in control.\u201d </p> <p>Thirty years on, Beyond Words has distributed or sold 100,000 copies of its 57 titles, which cover everything from relationships to surviving abuse. Each title involves 100 learning disabled people as advisers or authors. There are 60 associated book clubs with 350-400 members.</p> <p>Nigel Hollins, now 47, is a Beyond Words adviser and runs one of the Surrey book clubs. He lives independently in a flat near his family with support from a personal assistant. His mother says: \u201cPeople see Nigel in the shops, cafe or train station. He has a life in the community.\u201d</p> <p>He is part of a theatre company for actors with learning disabilities and, interviewed with his mother, says he relaxes with \u201csomething to eat with my girlfriend and watching a film\u201d. His favourite film is The Rewrite, which, he explains, \u201c I was in with Hugh Grant\u201d. His friendship with Grant, who got him the film role, came after the actor contacted the Hollins family for a documentary about press intrusion (the family experienced unwanted press attention when Nigel\u2019s sister was paralysed in 2005 after a knife attack).</p> <p>Hollins championed disability awareness through an employment scheme as professor of the psychiatry of disability at St George\u2019s, University of London. She employed five learning disabled people over 25 years to teach medical students how to communicate better. (In the UK, just 5.8% of people with a learning disability are in paid work, compared with 74% of non-disabled people.) \u201cIn my department, the medical students weren\u2019t there to impress the professor, they had to talk in a way that people with learning disabilities could understand,\u201d she explains. </p> <p>Despite an <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/report/supporting-disabled-people-to-work/\" title=\"\">National Audit Office report</a> in March that criticised the government\u2019s lacklustre strategy to get a million more disabled people into work by 2027, Hollins, a former government adviser on learning disability and autism when New Labour\u2019s Alan Milburn was health secretary, accepted a grant from the Department for Work and Pensions to create four Beyond Words books about finding and keeping a job. \u201cThe project is helping Beyond Words and jobcentres to refine a support programme to encourage and steer more people with learning disabilities into employment \u2013 whether voluntary, part or full-time\u201d, she explains.</p> <p>What does she think of the state of support for people with learning disabilities and autism today?</p> <p>Hollins says returning people from inpatient units to communities \u201cwill never work until people understand it\u2019s not about a building and a staff team, or rotas and procedures, but about putting somebody like Nigel at the centre of the plans\u201d. Professionals should understand that what people need to live their life is to belong [in communities], she states. But she is all too aware that progress is slow</p> <p>The healthcare regulator, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/20/too-many-children-in-england-mental-health-hospitals-unnecessarily-report\" title=\"\">Care Quality Commission, recently published a report on the long-term segregation of people with learning disabilities in mental health units</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00059qb\" title=\"\">BBC\u2019s Panorama</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00059qb\" title=\"\"> exposed abuse at </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00059qb\" title=\"\">Whorlton Hall, an NHS-funded, privately</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00059qb\" title=\"\"> run hospital </a>for learning disabled and autistic people in County Durham.</p> <p>The latest scandal came eight years after a government promise to shut institutions such as Whorlton Hall and move people back to communities following similar abuse exposed by Panorama at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/30/seven-years-winterbourne-view-learning-disabled-people-abuse\" title=\"\">Winterbourne View</a> near Bristol.</p> <p> And the latest <a href=\"https://www.hqip.org.uk/resource/the-learning-disabilities-mortality-review-annual-report-2018/#.XPU3raZJlHY\" title=\"\">NHS-commissioned review of mortality rates</a>, published last month, finds that people with learning disabilities are disproportionately likely to die in hospital. </p> <p>A lot more needs to be done to tackle the lack of parity in healthcare for learning disabled people, says Hollins. When her son was attacked by two men in London 20 years ago, doctors were reluctant to operate on his fractured cheekbone \u201cbecause [they said] it\u2019s only cosmetic\u201d, she recalls.</p> <p>\u201cIt was discrimination\u201d She argued for an operation. Since then, Hollins says attitudes have improved, not least because more people live in communities. But a big challenge is still the gulf between the health and care systems that learning disabled people rely on: \u201cWe need a continuum \u2013 social care is integral to health.\u201d</p> <p>What hopes does she have for her son, who inspired Beyond Words? \u201cI hope Nigel will be so embedded in his community that there will always be people who\u2019ll look out for him, love him and care for him after I\u2019m no longer here.

His favourite film is The Rewrite, which, he explains, \u201c I was in with Hugh Grant\u201d. His friendship with Grant, who got him the film role, came after the actor contacted the Hollins family for a documentary about press intrusion (the family experienced unwanted press attention when Nigel\u2019s sister was paralysed in 2005 after a knife attack). Hollins championed disability awareness through an employment scheme as professor of the psychiatry of disability at St George\u2019s, University of London. She employed five learning disabled people over 25 years to teach medical students how to communicate better. (In the UK, just 5.8% of people with a learning disability are in paid work, compared with 74% of non-disabled people.) \u201cIn my department, the medical students weren\u2019t there to impress the professor, they had to talk in a way that people with learning disabilities could understand,\u201d she explains. Despite an National Audit Office report in March that criticised the government\u2019s lacklustre strategy to get a million more disabled people into work by 2027, Hollins, a former government adviser on learning disability and autism when New Labour\u2019s Alan Milburn was health secretary, accepted a grant from the Department for Work and Pensions to create four Beyond Words books about finding and keeping a job. \u201cThe project is helping Beyond Words and jobcentres to refine a support programme to encourage and steer more people with learning disabilities into employment \u2013 whether voluntary, part or full-time\u201d, she explains. What does she think of the state of support for people with learning disabilities and autism today? Hollins says returning people from inpatient units to communities \u201cwill never work until people understand it\u2019s not about a building and a staff team, or rotas and procedures, but about putting somebody like Nigel at the centre of the plans\u201d. Professionals should understand that what people need to live their life is to belong [in communities], she states. But she is all too aware that progress is slow The healthcare regulator, the Care Quality Commission, recently published a report on the long-term segregation of people with learning disabilities in mental health units, and BBC\u2019s Panorama exposed abuse at Whorlton Hall, an NHS-funded, privately run hospital for learning disabled and autistic people in County Durham. The latest scandal came eight years after a government promise to shut institutions such as Whorlton Hall and move people back to communities following similar abuse exposed by Panorama at Winterbourne View near Bristol. And the latest NHS-commissioned review of mortality rates, published last month, finds that people with learning disabilities are disproportionately likely to die in hospital. A lot more needs to be done to tackle the lack of parity in healthcare for learning disabled people, says Hollins. When her son was attacked by two men in London 20 years ago, doctors were reluctant to operate on his fractured cheekbone \u201cbecause [they said] it\u2019s only cosmetic\u201d, she recalls. \u201cIt was discrimination\u201d She argued for an operation. Since then, Hollins says attitudes have improved, not least because more people live in communities. But a big challenge is still the gulf between the health and care systems that learning disabled people rely on: \u201cWe need a continuum \u2013 social care is integral to health.\u201d What hopes does she have for her son, who inspired Beyond Words? \u201cI hope Nigel will be so embedded in his community that there will always be people who\u2019ll look out for him, love him and care for him after I\u2019m no longer here. That\u2019s what every parent wants,\u201d she replies. Curriculum vitae Age: 72. Lives: Surrey. Family: Married, four adult children.

      "bodyText": "Protests and controversy await Donald Trump when he flies into Ireland on Wednesday, but there is at least one corner of the country preparing a heartfelt welcome. The village of Doonbeg in County Clare has erected US flags and plans to give a mighty cheer if the presidential cavalcade swooshes past. Trump, after all, is making Doonbeg great again. The village, population 262, abuts the US president\u2019s 400-acre hotel and golf resort, an opulent visitor magnet sprayed by Atlantic ocean waves. \u201cThe people are 99.9% behind him,\u201d said Fr Joe Haugh, the parish priest. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else doing for us what he\u2019s doing.\u201d For locals it is an economic lifeline, a source of jobs, investment and hope. Without Trump, they say, the village and surrounding communities would wither. \u201cHe\u2019s the biggest employer in west Clare,\u201d said Martin Kelly, 48, a trucking company owner who receives business from the resort. \u201cHe has done a brilliant job. He\u2019s keeping west Clare going. Doonbeg would be a different place if he wasn\u2019t here.\u201d The president and his wife, Melania, are due to stay at the resort from 5-7 June following a two-day state visit to the UK filled with Buckingham Palace pomp and D-day commemorations. Activists have promised big demonstrations against Trump\u2019s policies on the environment, immigration and other issues. Irish activists also plan to mobilise. Ireland is shaping up to be a haven and potential irritant for the president. He will bypass Dublin and fly into Shannon airport, 40 miles from his resort. After meeting the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar \u2013 who in 2014 gave Trump a sympathetic hearing over a windfarm concern \u2013 the US president will be free to savour golf, ocean views and the gratitude of locals. The Trump International Organisation bought the resort, with fairways designed by Greg Norman, in 2014. It has spent \u20ac40m, including the purchase price, on expanding and upgrading facilities, which include a spa, restaurants and cottages. Trump has visited six times, calling the resort \u201cterrific\u201d and \u201cincredible\u201d. Protesters are planning a rally in Dublin and possibly a \u201cpeace camp\u201d at Shannon but are expected to steer clear of Doonbeg. Security will be tight \u2013 a no-fly zone, road closures, \u201csniper towers\u201d, soldiers, police and secret service agents. Police reportedly quizzed workers at Shannon industrial estate asking if they had any \u201canimosity\u201d towards the visitor. \u201cNobody was declaring any negatives towards Donald Trump,\u201d one employee told the Clare Echo. Should the president wander around Trumpland\u2019s Irish outpost he will experience psychological balm, for here he is a hero. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it. It would be great to see him,\u201d said Kathleen Whelan, who runs Doonbeg\u2019s grocery shop. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day a US president comes here. It\u2019s all good.\u201d Sean O\u2019Donnell, a local contractor, said he had friends and relatives among the 310 people employed at the resort during summer. \u201cHe\u2019s brought jobs and investment, just what we need.\u201d O\u2019Donnell also praised Trump as a straight shooter. \u201cOther politicians lie. He tells it like it is.\u201d Not everyone would agree with that. The Washington Post has tracked more than 10,000 lies and misleading claims made by the president since taking office. The casino mogul won the White House partly by promising to save dying rustbelt communities in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Keeping that promise has proved hard \u2013 he does not control global economic trends. But for Doonbeg his wallet is enough. Trump\u2019s resort contributes a \u201cseismic\u201d \u20ac8m per annum to the local economy, said an editorial in the Clare Champion newspaper. Without Trump a region that is losing jobs, post offices and population \u201cwould be further bereft\u201d, it said. There is, however, a snag. Storms and rising sea levels are eroding dunes that dot the golf course, damaging fairways and threatening the entire course. Trump executives have applied to build a protective coastal wall \u2013 evidence the president will act on climate change when it threatens his business interests. Clare county council approved a scaled-down plan for 38,000 tonnes of rock to form two barriers of 630 metres and 260 metres in length in front of Doughmore beach. Locals in Doonbeg support the plan, saying it will protect farmland from flooding. But environmental groups have stalled it, saying the flood risk is overstated and that the barriers would harm wildlife and the dune system. An Bord Plean\u00e1la, a planning regulator, is expected to rule on the case later this year. \u201cI am confident \u2026 this wall will not go ahead,\u201d said Peter Sweetman, a veteran campaigner who has led opposition to other projects in the west of Ireland. Tony Lowes, of Friends of the Irish Environment, said the group hoped to deliver to the resort an online petition of 100,000 signatures against the plan. \u201cThis proposal threatens the whole evolution of one of our most important dune systems. They have no business messing with it.\u201d Environmental objections blocked a separate attempt by the resort two years ago to build new facilities. Trump called it \u201ca very unpleasant experience\u201d. Defeat over the sea barriers would tee up another one.",

You have to be true to the property, but you\u2019re also responsible for writing a compelling narrative.\u201d</p> <p>The American author Chuck Wendig, who has written a trilogy of novels set in the Star Wars universe after Return of the Jedi, also counts himself a fan. That may not be an absolute requirement, but for all the freedom writers have to invent new characters and situations, staying faithful to the source material is the bottom line.</p> <p>\u201cThe movies are king,\u201d Wendig says. \u201cEverything follows behind them in Star Wars.\u201d With the lion\u2019s share of money and time devoted to the cinematic versions, writers have to make sure everything moves together at the same time, \u201cnot disagreeing with the films but also not stealing their thunder\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d07700ac4a8c4d7a3cc923edf2b0559acd102de5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d07700ac4a8c4d7a3cc923edf2b0559acd102de5/285_62_3651_2191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doctor Who - Series 7Programme Name: Doctor Who - TX: n/a - Episode: Asylum of the Daleks (No. 1) - Embargoed for publication until: 15/08/2012 - Picture Shows: Rory Williams (ARTHUR DARVILL), The Doctor (MATT SMITH), Amy Pond (KAREN GILLAN) - (C) BBC - Photographer: Todd Antony\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jenny Colgan\u2019s Doctor Who novel Dark Horizons featured the 11th Doctor, portrayed by Matt Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Todd Antony/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like both Wendig and Christopher, Jenny Colgan made her name with her own original fiction before she was approached to write licensed novels.

And when you\u2019re dealing with a long-running property you have to watch for duplication \u2013 there are, for example, not a lot of British historical figures the Doctor hasn\u2019t met.\u201d But there\u2019s fun to be had bending all these rules. \u201cI always feel like I\u2019ve scored something if I get something through \u2013 for example, I got through the way the Doctor smells (a pleasant mix of chalk dust, lime and diesel) and how that stays the same through every regeneration, so I feel that\u2019s my building brick in the universe.

I don\u2019t feel comfortable pushing back on people who simply didn\u2019t like the book, but I did feel a certain responsibility to push back against some of that specific brand of toxicity.\u201d</p> <p>Even though they\u2019re working with someone else\u2019s characters, Wendig continues, writers must remember where their duties really lie. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of responsibility writing any story, and that responsibility is first to yourself, I think: telling the best story you can in the way that you choose to tell it. So you can be proud of it \u2013 because though it will say Star Wars, it will also say your name, and so you have to be satisfied with what you\u2019ve done first and foremost. And if you\u2019re a fan of that world you have a standard to hold yourself to, which is: does this please me both as the author of the work and as a fan who might be reading it?\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Stranger Things: Darkness on the Edge of Town by Adam Christopher is published by Century.

      "bodyText": "If you\u2019ve ever wondered what Han Solo did after the Battle of Endor, or whether Doctor Who would enjoy the Isle of Lewis, then you\u2019re in luck. These days, fans of the biggest movie and TV franchises can discover depth and texture in the lives of their favourite characters with a wealth of tie-in fiction. The novels aren\u2019t just movie adaptations, spin-offs or fan fiction, they\u2019re added to the canon of the film or TV series that inspired them \u2013 stories that haven\u2019t made it to the screen but are officially part of those universes. The latest is Darkness on the Edge of Town, a novel by Adam Christopher set in the world of Netflix\u2019s horror series Stranger Things. Christopher\u2019s novel moves away from the series\u2019 fictional town of Hawkins and goes back to the 1970s, when police chief Jim Hopper was a cop in New York City. The third series of the TV drama is due in July, so when the US publisher Del Rey approached Christopher with an idea for a story about Hopper hunting a serial killer, he had to make sure the novel was a perfect fit in terms of tone and continuity. \u201cMy editor and I worked closely with the Netflix team \u2013 including Paul Dichter, one of the staff writers \u2013 to get everything aligned with the TV show,\u201d Christopher says. \u201cAs with any licensed work, there are a lot of eyes on it, and there are a lot of channels it has to go through for comment and approval \u2013 everything from the way the characters speak to detailed timelines is talked about and confirmed.\u201d It may be easier work for writers \u2013 like Christopher \u2013 who are already fans, but he says it\u2019s crucial not to get too close to your material. \u201cA story can easily become too fannish and you can get lost in minutiae that just turn readers off, so you have to know where to draw the line. You have to be true to the property, but you\u2019re also responsible for writing a compelling narrative.\u201d The American author Chuck Wendig, who has written a trilogy of novels set in the Star Wars universe after Return of the Jedi, also counts himself a fan. That may not be an absolute requirement, but for all the freedom writers have to invent new characters and situations, staying faithful to the source material is the bottom line. \u201cThe movies are king,\u201d Wendig says. \u201cEverything follows behind them in Star Wars.\u201d With the lion\u2019s share of money and time devoted to the cinematic versions, writers have to make sure everything moves together at the same time, \u201cnot disagreeing with the films but also not stealing their thunder\u201d. Like both Wendig and Christopher, Jenny Colgan made her name with her own original fiction before she was approached to write licensed novels. Her romance bestsellers have have brought her enough attention to fuel a second writing life as JT Colgan, writing adaptations of existing Doctor Who episodes as well as original novels set in that world. For Colgan the key is to get everything approved in advance. \u201cThere\u2019s no point just going for it and having to throw all the work out of the window if the people at the top have already decided the character can\u2019t swim,\u201d she says. Working within such strict constraints can sometimes be challenging, Colgan continues. \u201cThe most common thing to happen is you hit on something they want to use for the TV show, which obviously takes priority. And when you\u2019re dealing with a long-running property you have to watch for duplication \u2013 there are, for example, not a lot of British historical figures the Doctor hasn\u2019t met.\u201d But there\u2019s fun to be had bending all these rules. \u201cI always feel like I\u2019ve scored something if I get something through \u2013 for example, I got through the way the Doctor smells (a pleasant mix of chalk dust, lime and diesel) and how that stays the same through every regeneration, so I feel that\u2019s my building brick in the universe. And I invented River\u2019s sonic trowel, which then turned up in the telly version.\u201d As the market for tie-in fiction has expanded, so have the ways for fans to voice their enthusiasm or vent their frustration with any new material \u2013 enough to give Christopher pause for thought. \u201cWith a phenomenon like Stranger Things, I was very much aware that was I was creating would become part of the fabric of the show \u2013 officially \u2013 and I also knew that the fans would really be paying attention,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I got something wrong, they would have had no qualms in voicing their concerns.\u201d Fans may be protective of the stories they love, but new stories can also stir up strong emotions \u2013 as Wendig discovered when the first novel of his Star Wars trilogy was swamped with angry reviews. \u201cThe negative feedback can be pretty overwhelming,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me it was complicated by a specific kind of toxicity: fans mad that the book contained \u2018politics\u2019 in the form of LGBT characters or people of colour or what-have-you. I don\u2019t feel comfortable pushing back on people who simply didn\u2019t like the book, but I did feel a certain responsibility to push back against some of that specific brand of toxicity.\u201d Even though they\u2019re working with someone else\u2019s characters, Wendig continues, writers must remember where their duties really lie. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of responsibility writing any story, and that responsibility is first to yourself, I think: telling the best story you can in the way that you choose to tell it. So you can be proud of it \u2013 because though it will say Star Wars, it will also say your name, and so you have to be satisfied with what you\u2019ve done first and foremost. And if you\u2019re a fan of that world you have a standard to hold yourself to, which is: does this please me both as the author of the work and as a fan who might be reading it?\u201d Stranger Things: Darkness on the Edge of Town by Adam Christopher is published by Century.

And although a lack of women leaders isn\u2019t helping, let\u2019s not be shallow enough to think that simply putting women in charge of a broken system would fix the problem. Only deep economic change will provide the foundations for gender equality \u2013 and perhaps that\u2019s why those who are doing just fine, thank you very much, are dragging their heels.</p> <p>Britain currently ranks 17 out of 129 across the world, in a chart topped by Denmark. But since no country is set to meet the 2030 target at this point, there\u2019s no reason why Britain can\u2019t leapfrog over the 16 countries above it, achieve gender equality and act as a blueprint for other nations to follow. So how would we do it? Here are some ideas:</p> <h2>An end to austerity and massive investment in the welfare system</h2> <p>Contrary to what the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/sheryl-sandberg-facebook-cambridge-analytica\" title=\"\">Sheryl Sandbergs</a> of this world might have you believe, the most effective way to make life better for the majority of women is not to fill up boardrooms, but to invest in a strong welfare state. According to Commons figures in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/09/women-bearing-86-of-austerity-burden-labour-research-reveals\" title=\"\">86% of spending cuts fell on women</a>. This is because women are less likely to be in work, and more likely to be caregivers and take charge of household tasks. It\u2019s rarely couched in this way, but the government\u2019s austerity programme was actually a massive transfer of wealth from the poorest women to the richest men \u2013 whose wealth has actually increased since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/wealth-inequality-reasons-richest-global-gap\" title=\"\">financial crisis of 2008</a>. It\u2019s time to reverse this trend, and perhaps we could use some of the gargantuan wealth amassed by these rich men to do it.</p> <h2>Invest in measures to keep women safe from male violence</h2> <p>The majority of gender-based violence is carried out by <a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures\" title=\"\">men towards women</a>. So to achieve equality, women must first be freed from the threat of this violence. According to Women\u2019s Aid, in just one day in 2017, 94 women and 90 children were <a href=\"https://www.womensaid.org.uk/what-we-do/campaigning-and-influencing/campaign-with-us/sos/\" title=\"\">turned away from domestic violence shelters</a>. No country can claim gender equality without addressing this appalling situation, and that means massive investment in women\u2019s refuges, the opening of new ones, and investment in specialist services for women of colour, trans women, women with disabilities, and any other category of women who have specific needs that could be neglected by one-size-fits-all services. Really, it should be the minimum standard for a civilised society that women not be left destitute when they leave a violent partner. I mean, come on.</p> <h2>Strengthen trade unions and improve working conditions</h2> <p>I\u2019ve written about this before, but when Harvey Weinstein\u2019s accusers came forward, a lot of them said they\u2019d stayed quiet for years because they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/08/celebrate-international-womens-day-why-not-join-union\" title=\"\">afraid they\u2019d lose work</a>. There are very straightforward ways of erasing this fear, and one of them is repealing anti-trade union legislation so that women can take action against their bosses without fear of being punished. Better trade union representation would also lay the groundwork for reducing the pay gap, improving women\u2019s pensions and protecting women from <a href=\"https://maternityaction.org.uk/advice/pregnancy-discrimination/\" title=\"\">dismissal or demotion if they become pregnant</a>.</p> <h2>Improve women\u2019s social status</h2> <p>I appreciate that someone at Gillette has started reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/07/feminists-advance-prominent-women-metoo\" title=\"\">bell hooks</a> and is trying its darndest to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPPf3sZIo-Q\" title=\"\">smash the patriarchy</a>. But shaving adverts are not going to cut it (no pun intended). There needs to be a concerted effort to assert women\u2019s equality in the public sphere. That means educating men and boys about sexism, it means deliberately funding more culture created by women, about women (remember that only <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/female-representation-in-movies-has-barely-changed-in-a-decade-but-theres-a-way-we-can-fix-it-9940849\" title=\"\">one-third of speaking roles in Hollywood films are for women</a>), addressing the way women are talked about in the media via regulation, and it means elevating women to more positions of power. Most importantly, improving women\u2019s social status also means lowering men\u2019s social status if they harass or abuse women. That means addressing the low conviction rates for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/sep/26/rape-prosecutions-plummet-crown-prosecution-service-police\" title=\"\">rape and sexual assault</a>, categorising misogyny as a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45423789\" title=\"\">hate crime</a>, and taking punitive measures against men who harass, degrade or abuse women in their <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48366835\" title=\"\">places of work or education</a>.</p> <h2>Go internationalist</h2> <p>Buried at the bottom of yesterday\u2019s gender inequality news is the fact that some states with low GDP are outperforming wealthier states in terms of improvement, even though overall they still lag behind because the starting points are different. Britain\u2019s history of colonialism has not helped with this fact. To that end, part of our role as a world leader in gender equality means addressing the damage caused by our colonial past, by working with other countries to invest properly in healthcare and economic improvements, as well as tackling international tax avoidance and corruption, which are supported by the <a href=\"https://www.taxjustice.net/2017/09/19/city-london-capital-invisible-empire/\" title=\"\">City of London</a>. This is not about Brits viewing ourselves as white knights; rather it is about accepting that lower GDP in developing countries is partly our fault, and taking steps to put it right.</p> <p>If you\u2019re starting to suspect that these suggestions are less a manifesto and more a list of ways to undermine capitalism, you may be right. But what\u2019s clear from this damning news is that attempting to tackle gender inequality within the current system simply isn\u2019t working. Perhaps it\u2019s time to create a new one.</p> <p>\u2022 Ellie Mae O\u2019Hagan writes about politics and culture for the Guardian</p>",

      "bodyText": "Walking through the densely built metropolis of Athens, few visitors or even locals realise the Greek capital was once crisscrossed by three major rivers, not to mention some 700 smaller streams that flowed into them. The Kifisos, the Iridanos and the Ilisos were buried under concrete during the city\u2019s postwar car-centred development, in what daily newspaper Kathimerini has labelled \u201ca crime against the city\u201d. But part of the Ilisos, on whose banks the philosophers Socrates, Plato and Aristotle all taught \u2013 could soon be freed from its concrete sarcophagus, if a proposal by Anaplasis \u2013 a government organisation seeking to renew the centre of Athens through design \u2013 gains approval. The Ilisos River is one of three major rivers to cross Athens, but much of it was buried under concrete during postwar redevelopment The catalyst for the river\u2019s potential rebirth came about after a survey in October showed the parlous state of the walls that entomb the Ilisos under tram lines near the city\u2019s central Syntagma square. The tram lines have been \u201cclosed until further notice\u201d and a report revealed that extensive maintenance \u2013 or even a complete and prohibitively costly replacement \u2013 would be required to make the tram safe again. Tramlines running over the Ilisos have been closed because of the parlous state of the walls keeping the river contained Instead, Anaplasis (\u201cRegeneration\u201d) has suggested that instead of wasting money on short-term solutions, the tram lines could be rerouted and the city get its river back. Katerina Christoforaki, one of the architects working with Anaplasis, says she wants to see \u201cexactly the opposite of what was happening when the Ilisos was covered up\u201d. \u201cWe want to move Athens to a more contemporary planning ideal,\u201d she adds. The Kifisos River Anaplasis places its plan, which is still in its early stages, in the context of the \u201cdaylighting urban waterways\u201d movement, that has seen great success in cities from Seoul, South Korea, which resurrected its Cheonggyecheon stream in 2005 to Sheffield, which opened up part of the Porter Brook in 2017 and created a \u201cpocket park\u201d. Athens has increasingly been hit by flash floods over the past few years, with the obstruction of streams blamed by many.In 2017, in the suburb of Mandra, at least 20 were killed in a flood. The stream that once crossed the area had been built over \u2013 and a car park and supermarket now block the space where it once flowed. Last year, while wildfires swept through east Attica, claiming more than 100 lives, a flash storm flooded the central neighbourhood of Marousi. The culprit was another blocked stream. Sections of the Kifisos still above ground But some experts warn \u201cdaylighting\u201d the Ilisos is not straightforward. \u201cIlisos is a stream with limited flow,\u201d Kostis Chatzimichalis, a professor of geography at Charokopeio University, told the Greek daily efsyn.gr. \u201cKaliroi, the ancient spring that fed the stream, doesn\u2019t exist any more, while even engravings from 1893, photos from 1900 and those from the 1950s and the 1960s show its limited flow. Kaliroi, the ancient spring that fed the Ilisos, no longer exists, which means the river has limited flow and \u2018daylighting\u2019 the Ilisos may not be straightforward \u201cAll the branches of its water network are now underneath the urban sprawl. The full \u2018restoration\u2019 of all the branches would be required for [the Ilisos] to be able to operate like a normal river.\u201d Warning Athenians to be realistic about the Anaplasis proposal\u2019s potential, he added: \u201cOne planning mistake isn\u2019t fixed with another planning mistake.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter \u2022 This article was amended on 9 July 2019.

      "bodyText": "Travellers are being warned to expect delays on roads, rail, waterways and in the skies amid a day of wild weather, including snow falls in parts of New South Wales and Queensland and icy winds. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a road warning for drivers in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs to exercise extreme care as gusty winds, slippery roads and rain will make driving conditions dangerous. A huge swell forced the the cancellation of some Sydney ferry services between Manly and Circular Quay on Tuesday. Jetstar cancelled a flight from Melbourne to Sydney on Tuesday afternoon while one Qantas and two Virgin flights going in the other direct were also grounded. A flight from Wellington to Sydney was facing a delayed arrival. Airlines have warned passengers to check for up dates. Train commuters have also been told to allow extra travel time with delays to some services due to the wet weather conditions. An estimated 800 households on the NSW Central Coast \u2013 Canton Beach, Noraville and Toukley \u2013 lost power and emergency crews have been working to restore electricity. Sarah Scully, a Bureau of Meteorology forecaster, said a cold front that has headed north from Victoria has developed into a deep low pressure system off the coast of NSW and brought gale to storm force southerly winds. \u201cThe worst of the winds have moved through Sydney now and overnight are expected to ease below the warning criteria,\u201d she told the Guardian. However, dangerous surf conditions will continue until about Thursday. Victoria\u2019s weather is expected to be settled until the weekend, because the state experienced the worst of it on Sunday and Monday, Scully said. The NSW State Emergency Service has received almost 460 calls for help since Monday from as far south as Eden up to the mid north coast. In Sydney, there have been 230 requests for assistance, with Sutherland, Warringah and Blacktown the worst affected areas. \u201cThe majority of those jobs have been related to wind damage, we\u2019ve had trees down on rooves and vehicles and roof damage from intense rain \u2013 issues with gutters,\u201d an SES spokeswoman told the Guardian. The SES is urging people to move their cars away from trees, secure loose outdoor items and steer clear of fallen power lines. The Blue Mountains west of Sydney woke to a blanket of snow, while the bureau said there had also been falls in Queensland\u2019s Granite Belt region, west of Brisbane, but flakes were few and far between and it was not expected to settle. Snow was also reported across the border in northern NSW. \u201cIt was sleeting for maybe 10 minutes, then some flurries of pure snow flakes started coming down,\u201d Ken Kato told the ABC from Eukey. About five centimetres of snow settled on Katoomba, Blackheath and surrounding areas on Tuesday morning, as a burst of cold weather hits the state. The ice and snow temporarily forced the closure of the Great Western Highway at Katoomba, Mount Victoria and Blackheath, as well as a section of the Bells Line of Road. Snow also affected several local roads in the Central Tablelands and Snowy Mountains, with falls recorded in Oberon, Lithgow, and Armidale in the state\u2019s north. The arrival of a cold air mass about midnight caused temperatures to fall, and icy winds made it seem much colder. At Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, the temperature felt like -4.6C early on Tuesday morning, even though the official temperature was 3.1C. It was a similar situation in other southern inland communities, where the \u201cfeels like\u201d temperature was at or slightly below zero. Sydneysiders are being warned to take care as damaging and destructive winds lash the coast. The intense Tasman low and associated cold front is producing winds averaging 60 to 70km/h, with gusts of more than 90km/h. Ulladulla, on the south coast, recorded a wind gust of 130km/h just before 4am on Tuesday - the highest in its nine years of data. Sydney Airport recorded a gust of 91km/h at 10am, while on the harbour it peaked at 85km/h. NSW assistant police commissioner Michael Corboy said roads will be slippery and visibility poor, and stressed the need to go slow and follow directions. \u201cIt\u2019s not just your life at risk \u2013 it\u2019s the lives of the emergency service workers some of whom are volunteers,\u201d he said in a statement. with agencies",

Longing for that old state of things has caused long-lasting, not always irrational nostalgia for communism. </p> <p>Of course, 1989 brought a unique atmosphere of excitement. I was living with my mother in a typically large and ugly block of flats. I was almost 10, but could feel the spirit of the time because my mother was so caught up in it. She was glued to the television, constantly sighing. There were discussions and interviews with people from the opposition who we\u2019d never seen before. They were intelligent, had a great sense of humour, and said things that had previously been unutterable. My mother would never have imagined something like this could happen. But when I wrote the slogan \u201cDown with communism\u201d on a paper airplane and launched it from the balcony, she told me off : there might be trouble. No one knew how the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2019/feb/06/polish-round-table-talks-1989\">round-table discussions</a> between the regime and the opposition would end.</p> <p>The first free elections, 30 years ago on 4 June 1989, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/5/newsid_2496000/2496895.stm\">marked a great victory</a> for the Solidarity movement. Suddenly everything accelerated. Everything became colourful and exotic. The omnipresent kitsch did not bother anyone. The first bazaars and the first entrepreneurial startups had already appeared.

The life I experienced was fairly typical of transformation-era society. My mother worked as a middle manager in a large lightbulb factory in Warsaw named after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/germans-take-to-the-streets-to-celebrate-rosa-luxemburg-karl-liebknecht-berlin\">Rosa Luxemburg</a>. We lived in a 38sq m apartment. This was not the social sphere of the opposition, which primarily belonged to the intelligentsia. She quickly came to fear that she would lose her job, that the factory would be privatised and that 8,000 people would become unemployed.</p> <p>Indeed, 3 million people in Poland lost their jobs in just a few years. The finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz introduced a nationwide shock therapy that was aimed primarily at large enterprises. With the opening of the market and the inflow of western goods, the country\u2019s outdated factories collapsed. Today, there is no trace of the massive factory where my mother once worked. Even the buildings have been demolished.</p> <p>That constant fear characterised my teenage years. I knew I had to study to get into the right high school and go to university. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. My mother warned me that otherwise I might have to become a cowherd.</p> <p>The education boom was one of the most important features of the 1990s\u2013 but it was also another source of stress. My generation is very different from those that came afterwards. We are much less relaxed. We are much more concerned with security, because a sense of security is what everyone lost so suddenly in 1989. Many people never recovered from losing their jobs; inequality increased drastically.</p> <p>Another shocking development was a new, bitter antagonism between politicians. Before, the Sejm (parliament) worked very harmoniously. There were no squabbles \u2013everything was passed quickly and smoothly. But since 1989, the Polish parliament has been constantly embroiled in quarrels. By 1991, we had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Polish_parliamentary_election\">29 parties in the Sejm</a>.</p> <p>As change washed over the country, abortion suddenly became the most important issue for the Polish right. The Catholic church bestowed on itself the right to intervene in political life, as a reward for its previous support of the opposition. Everything that could possibly be baptised was baptised: streets, fire engines, the stock exchange.</p> <p>This was so overdone that the electorate replaced the former opposition with former communists, who by 1993 returned to power as part of a coalition. In 1995, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2018/nov/14/lech-walesa-wins-the-nobel-peace-prize-archive-1983\">Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa</a>, the hero of Solidarity, was defeated by Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski, a former minister for sport under the communist regime. Wa\u0142\u0119sa had turned out to be such a bad president (egocentric, intemperate, conflictual) that my mother, previously an ardent supporter of the opposition, would mute the television when he spoke. By then we had a remote, so I no longer had to run up to the TV set.</p> <p>Looking back, I believe the true success of 1989 was that former communists remained true to democracy. They did not violate the constitution. They had their faults, of course, but they proved loyal to the newly created democratic system.</p> <p>Recently, those very same former communists ran in the EU elections as defenders of democracy, in opposition to the ruling populists of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/poland-right-law-justice-party-europe\">Law and Justice party</a>, who are supported by the Solidarity trade-union and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/22/european-elections-sex-and-religion-dominate-campaigning-in-poland\">Catholic </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/22/european-elections-sex-and-religion-dominate-campaigning-in-poland\">church</a>. More than anything, this very paradox embodies the success of 1989 \u2013 the year our lives became complicated but free. It was the best time in three centuries of Polish history.</p> <p>\u2022 S\u0142awomir Sierakowski is a Polish writer and founder of the Krytyka Polityczna (Political Critique) movement</p> <p><br></p>",

But since 1989, the Polish parliament has been constantly embroiled in quarrels. By 1991, we had 29 parties in the Sejm. As change washed over the country, abortion suddenly became the most important issue for the Polish right. The Catholic church bestowed on itself the right to intervene in political life, as a reward for its previous support of the opposition. Everything that could possibly be baptised was baptised: streets, fire engines, the stock exchange. This was so overdone that the electorate replaced the former opposition with former communists, who by 1993 returned to power as part of a coalition. In 1995, Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, the hero of Solidarity, was defeated by Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski, a former minister for sport under the communist regime. Wa\u0142\u0119sa had turned out to be such a bad president (egocentric, intemperate, conflictual) that my mother, previously an ardent supporter of the opposition, would mute the television when he spoke. By then we had a remote, so I no longer had to run up to the TV set. Looking back, I believe the true success of 1989 was that former communists remained true to democracy. They did not violate the constitution. They had their faults, of course, but they proved loyal to the newly created democratic system. Recently, those very same former communists ran in the EU elections as defenders of democracy, in opposition to the ruling populists of the Law and Justice party, who are supported by the Solidarity trade-union and the Catholic church. More than anything, this very paradox embodies the success of 1989 \u2013 the year our lives became complicated but free. It was the best time in three centuries of Polish history. \u2022 S\u0142awomir Sierakowski is a Polish writer and founder of the Krytyka Polityczna (Political Critique) movement",

To be a part of this is cool.\u201d</p> <p>Last Saturday, a club record 25,218 fans crammed into arguably the most atmospheric venue in the United States to see the Portland Timbers mark the renovation party with a defeat against in-form MLS leaders LAFC. Yet the most telling evidence of Portland\u2019s thriving soccer ecosystem came the next day. Decked out in red, Thorns supporters of all ages and genders flooded the streets before kick-off and made their way into rejuvenated surroundings, which cost around $85m to complete and have added an extra 4,000 seats to the stadium\u2019s east side.</p> <p>The Thorns had been on the road for the first six games of the NWSL season, and had been sorely missed. A record season-opening home attendance of 19,461 spoke of a genuine longing to see Parsons\u2019 team in action. The Rose City Riveters\u2019 fan group banged the drums, shuffled their dancing feet, and belted out songs for 90 minutes. Forward Midge Purce\u2019s cooly taken first-half double sent the crowd suitably wild. Their match with the Chicago Red Stars felt like top-level soccer should \u2013 atmospheric, lively, and exciting. At the end of the 3-0 win, Thorns players mingled with family on the pitch before signing autographs for young fans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/28/washington-spirit-nwsl-dc-united-soccer\">Does partnering with men's clubs help or hinder women's football teams?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The women\u2019s game continues to grow and evolve, but nowhere makes it come alive like Portland. Ever since they attracted 16,479 for their first NWSL match in 2013, interest has soared. League bosses must wish for similar crowds elsewhere \u2013 the Utah Royals are the only other club generating turnouts over 13,000, while other teams are hovering around 5,000 \u2013 but the front office at Providence Park know how fortunate they are.

      "bodyText": "Mark Parsons gazes towards the gleaming new main stand at Providence Park and smiles. \u201cI just love walking in every day,\u201d the Englishman, who coaches the Portland Thorns and landed the National Women\u2019s Soccer League (NWSL) championship in 2017, tells the Guardian. \u201cI take 60 seconds and let it all sink in: that I work at the Thorns. To be a part of this is cool.\u201d Last Saturday, a club record 25,218 fans crammed into arguably the most atmospheric venue in the United States to see the Portland Timbers mark the renovation party with a defeat against in-form MLS leaders LAFC. Yet the most telling evidence of Portland\u2019s thriving soccer ecosystem came the next day. Decked out in red, Thorns supporters of all ages and genders flooded the streets before kick-off and made their way into rejuvenated surroundings, which cost around $85m to complete and have added an extra 4,000 seats to the stadium\u2019s east side. The Thorns had been on the road for the first six games of the NWSL season, and had been sorely missed. A record season-opening home attendance of 19,461 spoke of a genuine longing to see Parsons\u2019 team in action. The Rose City Riveters\u2019 fan group banged the drums, shuffled their dancing feet, and belted out songs for 90 minutes. Forward Midge Purce\u2019s cooly taken first-half double sent the crowd suitably wild. Their match with the Chicago Red Stars felt like top-level soccer should \u2013 atmospheric, lively, and exciting. At the end of the 3-0 win, Thorns players mingled with family on the pitch before signing autographs for young fans. The women\u2019s game continues to grow and evolve, but nowhere makes it come alive like Portland. Ever since they attracted 16,479 for their first NWSL match in 2013, interest has soared. League bosses must wish for similar crowds elsewhere \u2013 the Utah Royals are the only other club generating turnouts over 13,000, while other teams are hovering around 5,000 \u2013 but the front office at Providence Park know how fortunate they are. Mass interest in the beautiful game did not happen accidentally. The lack of an NHL, NFL or MLB franchise in the city certainly helps capture eyeballs in one of the country\u2019s less-saturated sporting market \u2013 the Portland Trail Blazers definitely made a mark during their recent run to the NBA Western Conference finals \u2013 while the the prominence of the University of Portland women\u2019s soccer program has also been instrumental. Nine top players were missing last weekend as they gear up for this month\u2019s World Cup (the Thorns have provided more players than any NWSL roster, while Tobin Heath and Alex Morgan started the final in 2015 for the USWNT as Thorns players), though the excitement wasn\u2019t diluted. \u201cA buzzword which gets used a lot is \u2018authenticity,\u2019 but that\u2019s the core of our brand \u2013 both for the Timbers and the Thorns, who have become one of the most successful women\u2019s team in the world,\u201d says the teams\u2019 owner, Merritt Paulson. \u201cIt\u2019s a DIY ethos and we provide the canvas for the fans.

      "body": "<p>Coming hot on the heels of the disturbing real-life rollback of reproductive rights in the States, the award-winning dystopian drama returns this month in the US for a third season. Having left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/apr/02/reading-group-margaret-atwood-books-the-handmaids-tale\">Margaret Atwood\u2019s</a> seminal source material far behind at the end of season one, the show\u2019s writers are now plotting a path for our protagonist June entirely under their own steam. The action picks up 10 minutes after the final scene of season two \u2013 here\u2019s what to expect \u2026</p> \n<h2>1. They have dialled back the \u2018torture porn\u2019</h2> \n<p>Even some ardent fans of the show abandoned season two, unable to endure its unremitting brutality, from the fake public executions to the drowning of two young lovers. Showrunner Bruce Miller has taken that on board. \u201cWe listened to the feedback, and in terms of it being too harsh, I agree. June went through a really tough year last year, and in the end she triumphed, but it was really hard,\u201d he says. This season, the on-screen brutality has been reduced. \u201cSo much of this season is about hope,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/05/elisabeth-moss-handmaids-tale-this-is-happening-in-real-life-wake-up-people\">Elisabeth Moss</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s radically important to have that for the world right now, and for our audience, to show that there is hope and that there is a way out.\u201d</p> \n<h2>2. There is a resistance in Gilead</h2> \n<p>The tagline for this season is Blessed Be the Fight, and our protagonist is gearing up to take on the barbaric, oppressive Gilead regime. \u201cJune\u2019s struggle has been a very personal one until now \u2013 for survival for herself and her unborn child, and for Hannah,\u201d says the show\u2019s producer Warren Littlefield. \u201cBut having got Nicole [June\u2019s daughter in Gilead] out, it now becomes about being an active part of the resistance; what does it take to align forces to fight the Gilead regime?\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcTvQx1Wot0\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RcTvQx1Wot0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>3. We travel to Washington DC, where the oppression is worse</h2> \n<p>The show\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/03/avengers-endgame-trailer-toy-story-4-handmaids-tale-us-jordan-peele-super-bowl-videos\">2019 Super Bowl</a> advert previewed some of the most eerie scenes from the series so far: the Washington Monument replaced with a cross, thousands of Handmaids assembled in front. Washington DC is still the centre of power in Gilead \u2013 \u201cGilead on steroids,\u201d says Littlefield \u2013 and the regime in the capital, where June, Fred and Serena all spend time, is more fundamentalist, orthodox and restrictive.</p> \n<h2>4. New depths of religious fervour means more extreme uniforms</h2> \n<p>The red robes of the Handmaids have achieved significance well beyond the story, co-opted by protesters in the US, Brazil and beyond, campaigning against restrictions on women\u2019s reproductive freedoms. In Gilead\u2019s capital, the uniforms are even stricter, with all women\u2019s mouths (bar those of the Aunts) entirely covered by veils, and Handmaids\u2019 mouths pierced closed, with three rings through the lips. \u201cGilead claims that a vow of silence has been taken by the most devout Handmaids,\u201d says the show\u2019s producer, Kim Todd.</p> \n<h2>5. Even Aunt Lydia has her limits</h2> \n<p>A fearsome enforcer of Gilead\u2019s oppressive regime for the past two seasons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/14/ann-dowd-interview-handmaids-tale-hulu-leftovers\">Aunt Lydia</a>, we shall see, has limits to her adherence. \u201cThe creepy thing about Washington, other than the veils, is that everyone seems to be so in compliance,\u201d says the actor behind Lydia, Ann Dowd. \u201cPeople have either given up or it\u2019s like in North Korea, where you don\u2019t even dare step out of line. This is not Aunt Lydia\u2019s thing. She doesn\u2019t believe in these extra, more extreme steps. She just wants to go home.\u201d </p> \n<p><em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale starts on Hulu on Wednesday 5 June in the US and on Channel 4 in the UK on Sunday 9 June</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element

      "bodyText": "Coming hot on the heels of the disturbing real-life rollback of reproductive rights in the States, the award-winning dystopian drama returns this month in the US for a third season. Having left Margaret Atwood\u2019s seminal source material far behind at the end of season one, the show\u2019s writers are now plotting a path for our protagonist June entirely under their own steam. The action picks up 10 minutes after the final scene of season two \u2013 here\u2019s what to expect \u2026 1. They have dialled back the \u2018torture porn\u2019 Even some ardent fans of the show abandoned season two, unable to endure its unremitting brutality, from the fake public executions to the drowning of two young lovers. Showrunner Bruce Miller has taken that on board. \u201cWe listened to the feedback, and in terms of it being too harsh, I agree. June went through a really tough year last year, and in the end she triumphed, but it was really hard,\u201d he says. This season, the on-screen brutality has been reduced. \u201cSo much of this season is about hope,\u201d says Elisabeth Moss. \u201cIt\u2019s radically important to have that for the world right now, and for our audience, to show that there is hope and that there is a way out.\u201d 2. There is a resistance in Gilead The tagline for this season is Blessed Be the Fight, and our protagonist is gearing up to take on the barbaric, oppressive Gilead regime. \u201cJune\u2019s struggle has been a very personal one until now \u2013 for survival for herself and her unborn child, and for Hannah,\u201d says the show\u2019s producer Warren Littlefield. \u201cBut having got Nicole [June\u2019s daughter in Gilead] out, it now becomes about being an active part of the resistance; what does it take to align forces to fight the Gilead regime?\u201d 3. We travel to Washington DC, where the oppression is worse The show\u2019s 2019 Super Bowl advert previewed some of the most eerie scenes from the series so far: the Washington Monument replaced with a cross, thousands of Handmaids assembled in front. Washington DC is still the centre of power in Gilead \u2013 \u201cGilead on steroids,\u201d says Littlefield \u2013 and the regime in the capital, where June, Fred and Serena all spend time, is more fundamentalist, orthodox and restrictive. 4. New depths of religious fervour means more extreme uniforms The red robes of the Handmaids have achieved significance well beyond the story, co-opted by protesters in the US, Brazil and beyond, campaigning against restrictions on women\u2019s reproductive freedoms. In Gilead\u2019s capital, the uniforms are even stricter, with all women\u2019s mouths (bar those of the Aunts) entirely covered by veils, and Handmaids\u2019 mouths pierced closed, with three rings through the lips. \u201cGilead claims that a vow of silence has been taken by the most devout Handmaids,\u201d says the show\u2019s producer, Kim Todd. 5. Even Aunt Lydia has her limits A fearsome enforcer of Gilead\u2019s oppressive regime for the past two seasons, Aunt Lydia, we shall see, has limits to her adherence. \u201cThe creepy thing about Washington, other than the veils, is that everyone seems to be so in compliance,\u201d says the actor behind Lydia, Ann Dowd. \u201cPeople have either given up or it\u2019s like in North Korea, where you don\u2019t even dare step out of line. This is not Aunt Lydia\u2019s thing. She doesn\u2019t believe in these extra, more extreme steps. She just wants to go home.\u201d The Handmaid\u2019s Tale starts on Hulu on Wednesday 5 June in the US and on Channel 4 in the UK on Sunday 9 June",

Senior politicians and members of the royal family as well as hundreds of veterans will attend ceremonies to mark one of the main turning points of the second world war and the biggest amphibious invasion in military history.</p> <p>More than 200 veterans have boarded a cruise ship, MV Boudicca, charted by the Royal British Legion, to attend the events, while others are descending en masse on Portsmouth and Normandy. Here we hear the stories of those who were there on 6 June 1944 and others involved in this week\u2019s commemorations.</p> <h2>Prisoner of war: \u201cI looked at him. He looked at me. I put my hands up\u201d</h2> <p>Percy Lewis, 96, a wireless operator with No 6 Beach Group, spent most of D-day sheltering in the sand dunes off Sword beach. After landing at 11am on a small landing craft, he had to wait for the rest of his battalion to come. \u201cNow and again there were a few shells coming over, but all the infantry and tanks had gone,\u201d he said. The remainder of the second world war, however, would not prove so straightforward for him.</p> <p>In the first week in July, while posted with 1st Battalion Black Watch, \u201cgoing up towards Rouen and having not seen \u2018Jerry\u2019 [a nickname given to Germans during the war] for two days\u201d, he and his comrades dug in. As he set up his wireless near a barn, \u201cJerry started mortaring, and I got shrapnel in the left ankle. It was only a flesh wound, but it was blood everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis, from Guildford, was evacuated and treated in Staffordshire before returning, this time to the Netherlands. In October 1944, while advancing through the country, his platoon found themselves at night in a small village \u201csomewhere in the Venray area\u201d and occupied the crossroads.</p> <p>But he had to retrace his steps to retrieve some wireless equipment. \u201cI started walking back alone, rifle over my shoulder, and the moon had just come up behind my back. I got a fair way back. Someone shouted: \u2018Halt.\u2019 I said: \u2018Friend.\u2019 Nothing. I walked a bit further. \u2018Halt.\u2019 I said: \u2018Friend.\u2019 Nothing. I took the rifle off my shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a row of cottages. A door was open. I thought: \u2018I\u2019ll make for that door.\u2019 And just as I got to the door, Jerry stepped out with his rifle on me. I looked at him. He looked at me. I put my hands up. Two German paratroopers about two doors away pushed me into the middle of the road.</p> <p>\u201cI thought: \u2018They\u2019ll start shooting in a minute.\u2019 Nothing happened. They took me round the corner, and down into the cellar. And it was full of German paratroopers cleaning all their kit.\u201d</p> <p>With a rifle pushed into his back, he was handed over to a Panzer division. He was now a prisoner of war, and would be interned in the Stalag XI-B Fallingbostel PoW camp in Germany. It was liberated in April 1945.</p> <p>\u201cEleven of us go to Normandy, to Arromanches, every year,\u201d said Lewis, who has regularly given the exhortation on the seafront during the annual commemorations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a723e4f4257427b6d7ff984de3e1a2b79ad0cb3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a723e4f4257427b6d7ff984de3e1a2b79ad0cb3b/0_113_1512_1903/795.jpg\" alt=\"Ron Smith\" width=\"795\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ron Smith: \u2018It\u2019s a long time ago.

As troops disembarked, a shell hit one of the tanks on the landing craft, immobilising it and blocking the craft\u2019s exit ramp. Torpedoes on the landing craft exploded, killing the colonel on board and three others.

One was Lt Col Arthur Cocks, the first British officer killed in the landings. \u201cHe\u2019s now celebrated in Portsmouth Cathedral with a window,\u201d said Smith.</p> <p>On their final briefings, he said: \u201cWe were told we were going to France, \u2018and you won\u2019t need a passport\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>But nothing could really prepare for the beach landings. \u201cI don\u2019t reckon a winkle survived on that beach. It was just one heap of explosives \u2013 it was amazing the way the tanks went off.</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as we landed, our role was to clear off quickly so the next could come in.\u201d But after the LCT was hit, \u201cwe couldn\u2019t land anything else\u201d.</p> <p>He spent a week in Portsmouth as the LCT was repaired, then headed back to Normandy. But the LCT hit a mine off the coast of Arromanches, near the Mulberry harbour. The crew managed to swim to a nearby merchant ship, which had been deliberately half-sunk to provide defence for the artificial harbour.</p> <p>\u201cWe went up a rope, up three steps, and were over the gunnel on to the deck. Then we went to the wheelhouse. And the only thing we rescued was a huge jar of rum. And we drunk the lot,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThere were 12 of us, and we were on there for 14 hours.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone was too busy to rescue us. We had to just stop on there. Eventually a landing craft came alongside and we were off. We were taken to an army camp, and they served us with half a loaf of bread and soup you could stand a spoon up in, and it was the best meal I\u2019ve ever tasted. Amazing.\u201d</p> <p>Smith was then dispatched to the UK, where he recovered from his injuries in a hospital in Scotland. He was later sent to Burma.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long time ago. This is the most I ever talk about it. I was only 19, that\u2019s all I was,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1d12e3080ddf0bedb76afc6604e0e41fd474079\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1d12e3080ddf0bedb76afc6604e0e41fd474079/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marie Scott composite, photos taken in 2019 and during the second world war\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marie Scott: \u2018We had long shifts, so we had to sleep down there as well.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Switchboard operator: \u201cI could hear very loud, sustained gunfire\u201d</h2> <p>Marie Scott, 92, a switchboard operator, volunteered for the Women\u2019s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) at 17. She was posted to the labyrinthine Fort Southwick, the underground Combined Operations Underground HQ, and the nerve centre on D-day, which was run from tunnels deep in the cliffs overlooking Portsmouth. On D-day, her job was as a very high frequency (VHF) radio operator, relaying messages to and from the invasion fleet and landing troops.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a series of tunnels. Quite spartan,\u201d she said of Fort Southwick. \u201cThe tunnels were very deep. We had to go down about 350 steps to get into the tunnels and, indeed, come up 350 steps. But at 17 you could do it.</p> <p>\u201cWe had long shifts, so we had to sleep down there as well. There was no natural light. There was no fresh air. So we had air conditioning and electric lights. On and off I was down there certainly for six to nine months, over D-day and after D-day,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe knew something big was afoot because there was an armada of boats in Portsmouth harbour. That was a giveaway.</p> <p>\u201cThe VHF radio was a one-way system. When you raised your lever to transmit, the recipient couldn\u2019t make any interjections until you had finished, and said: \u2018Roger and out.\u2019 or whatever. Then they would raise their lever, and transmit their message\u201d.</p> <p>On D-day she was in direct contact with the wireless operators on the allied invasion fleet as they stormed the beaches.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they raised their lever, I could hear very loud, sustained gunfire. It was really so bad that you thought: \u2018Oh my God. There\u2019s a battle going on.\u2019 You knew. You thought: \u2018God, men are dying.\u2019 The reality suddenly hit you. For a rather naive 17-year-old, I think it was terrifying. But it was a job. You got on with it.</p> <p>\u201cThe messages were all in code, so you didn\u2019t know what was being said. But you could hear the gunfire, every time the lever was lifted. I\u2019ve never forgotten what I heard. Never.\u201d</p> <p>On the 75th anniversary, Scott, from New Malden, Surrey, will be in Normandy, travelling as a guest of the <a href=\"https://www.taxicharity.org/\">Taxi Charity</a>, that annually takes veterans to Normandy. This year more than 30 taxis will be involved.</p> <p>It will be a special moment for Scott, who after the war became a secretary, married, raised a family and then worked for Surrey county council. She has been awarded the Legion D\u2019Honneur by the French, which will be presented by a French general at a ceremony at the Pegasus museum in Ranville.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m deeply honoured, and very humbled. You feel that you can\u2019t be deserving because men laid down their lives. We were the backroom people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming, really. And it\u2019s going to be fantastic.</p> <p>\u201cAll that really concerns me is that somebody will be available \u2013 hopefully a strapping young soldier or sailor or airman \u2013 to help me up the steps!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11dadd339520a42464bad18fb2d84dd7efdf361e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11dadd339520a42464bad18fb2d84dd7efdf361e/0_262_1512_1310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mick Jennings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"866\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mick Jennings: \u2018I can still see it.

They landed under German shellfire and the craft was beached, leaving personnel open to attack. \u201cIt was a very rough crossing. I\u2019m afraid the American troops weren\u2019t used to being on that sort of thing [the LCT] and so a lot of them were very sick. Their only concern was: \u2018Please let us get over there and get off this thing,\u2019\u201d he said.</p> <p>He saw one LCT break up. \u201cThey weren\u2019t really meant for that sort of sea,\u201d said Jennings, from Emsworth, near Chichester.</p> <p>\u201cApparently, we landed on the wrong side of the beach. It should have been further left, I think, but we didn\u2019t know it at the time. I can still see it. It\u2019s like a cin\u00e9 film. I can see us coming in and thinking: \u2018Well, there were mines on the beach.\u2019 There were all sorts there. Luckily, the tide took us and we landed on a reasonably safe beach.\u201d</p> <p>His abiding memory was wishing \u201cjust to get back, to be honest\u201d.</p> <p>Jennings said: \u201cI\u2019m just one of thousands who was doing the job you were trained for. I\u2019m nothing special.\u201d He continued to ferry troops back and forth across the Channel during the liberation.</p> <h2>Victory didn\u2019t come cheap: \u201cI had just my achilles holding my foot on\u201d</h2> <p>Bill Gladden, 95, who was in the 6th Airborne Armoured Recce Regiment, was 20 years old when he took off from a Dorset airfield on D-day in a Hamilcar glider, which dwarfed the Halifax towing it. It was the first time tanks had been flown into a battlefield, and he was squashed alongside one tank and six motorbikes, weighing a total of 16 tonnes.</p> <p>As they crossed the Channel he climbed on top of the tank to look out of a porthole. But then, suddenly, the towrope dropped. \u201cI felt the towrope go, because once it drops it\u2019s like you hit a brick wall. I couldn\u2019t move, I just hung on, and that\u2019s how I landed in Normandy, spread-eagled on top of a Tetrarch tank.\u201d</p> <p>Their job was to quickly make their way to Ranville Bridge over the Orne, taken earlier in the day, and hold it. He spent his first night in Normandy dug in there, then he moved to an orchard at Ranville. His stay would be brief.</p> <p>\u201cEach day we went out, pretty deep into the countryside, to find out where the Germans were and report back,\u201d said Gladden. \u201cWe got chased back a few times.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d been there about 12 days. We could hear the Germans start up their tanks of a morning. And, although we used to go out quite a bit, the fighting went on in the Ranville area for a long time.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/02/dday-veterans-normandy-75th-anniversary-second-world-war\">\u2018The sea around was red with blood, but you had to keep going\u2019: D-day veterans attend their last big gathering</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On 18 June he came back from patrol as usual. \u201cAnd I was just about to pour the water out and have a brew up when suddenly there was a bang, and I was on my back.\u201d A German Tiger tank had fired on the group. The whole of the front of his ankle was blown off. \u201cI had just my Achilles holding my foot on,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Colleagues carried him to an old barn used to treat casualties. Two days earlier, Gladden had helped carry the bodies of two friends to the same barn. \u201cLittle did I know that within the next two days they would be carrying me over.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel any pain at first. When the pain comes on, they start pushing the old morphine into you. And then you sail away.\u201d</p> <p>He remembers coming to a field hospital. Doctors were struggling to save his foot. \u201c\u2018Amputation considered\u2019: that was on the ticket I read around my neck when I came to, lying on a stretcher on the grass being sick as a dog.\u201d</p> <p>Gladden was evacuated to the UK. He spent the following three years in hospital, with his foot only finally being saved by a sophisticated bone graft involving both his legs being temporarily sewn and plastered together. His foot has troubled him ever since. The injury meant he was discharged from the army on medical grounds.</p> <p>\u201cI count myself very lucky,\u201d said Gladden, from Welling, Kent, who went on to work in the accounts department at Siemens. \u201cI survived, thousands didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He has returned to Ranville 10 times during recent years, since becoming a widower, and was heading there again for the 75th anniversary of D-day as a guest of the Taxi Charity. \u201cIt\u2019s a nostalgic visit. And it is nice to get thanks from the people out there. But I think the main thing is to keep alive the fact that victory didn\u2019t come cheap.</p> <p>\u201cThere were thousands of young men who were killed and maimed in those first few days, and we just don\u2019t want any more wars.

We had all of our gear on our backs and a rubber ring around our stomach to help keep us afloat. Let\u2019s face it, the landing was very gory. You didn\u2019t have time to think, survival instinct kicked in,\u201d he said in his account published on the Royal Hospital Chelsea\u2019s website.</p> <p>\u201cAfter reaching the beach, I ran up towards a parapet, and searched for mines. After 12 hours of being on the go we were exhausted and then had to dig a foxhole to sleep in. We had to dig six foot down and two foot wide.</p> <p>\u201cI slept outside for the next year or so, we had no protection from the elements. We had an oversized gas cape to go over our clothes and all our gear. We rarely slept lying down. Each time we slept in a barn we were ravaged by fleas \u2013 so even that was no good.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a different time: I wasn\u2019t a hero, I was a little cog in a big wheel.

Alan \u2013 who has visited Normandy, in particular Hill 112 west of Caen, which his father fought to recapture, and Bayeux war cemetery, where he is buried \u2013 has retained his last letters written from the front.</p> <p>The letters, read by Alan, form part of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission\u2019s <a href=\"https://liberation.cwgc.org/\">Voices of Liberation audio archive</a>. During the 75th anniversary commemorations at Portsmouth and Bayeux, there will be installations where the public can listen to many of those voices.</p> <p>William and his wife, Ethel, already had a daughter, Joyce, aged four, when Alan was born. \u201cAlan William was born on 6 June at Harrogate hospital.

Yes, I felt as I look back that I would have wished to have a father as a male role model, which is so important. But my mother was an amazing woman.</p> <p>\u201cShe was left with a four-year-old and a six-week-old baby to fend for herself. People now don\u2019t realise how difficult it was for war widows.

As supervisor of the sector that takes in Normandy, Moody, 67, has a responsibility for ensuring the Bayeux military cemetery, the largest British second world war cemetery in France, looks perfect for the 75th anniversary.</p> <p>There are 4,144 Commonwealth burials there, each one marked with a white headstone. Maintenance is ongoing throughout the year. Each headstone is cleaned. The turf is fertilised and cropped short to maintain its vivid green. Seasonal plantings include roses, designed to bloom in June on the anniversary.</p> <p>\u201cThe headstone is the identity of the soldier, with his badge, and his name and his regiment. So it\u2019s so important. You see old veterans, standing by the graves of perhaps a friend they lost. Sometimes they rest their hand on the headstone. This is their comrade, whom they lost in the landings. As I walk past, I keep very quiet, because they are honouring their comrades. They are here to see their friends. It\u2019s very emotional,\u201d said Moody.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the plantings, to me, it is as if each one has their own little garden, like they might have done back home, if they had lived. I am proud to be able to honour those that fell and to give them a place that seems like home, although they are sometimes so far from home.</p> <p>\u201cI feel as though I am passing the legacy of remembrance on to future generations, ensuring that we can always come to these remarkable places to reflect on the courage, sacrifice and the real cost in human terms that these men and women made to preserve our freedom.\u201d</p> <p>Moody has worked for 52 years with the CWGC, starting as a pupil gardener. His father, who is from Aberystwyth in Wales, served with the Royal Signals, serving in India before coming to France after the Normandy landings and staying there to work for the CWGC in northern France.</p> <p>He has witnessed many anniversaries at Bayeux, and other CWGC cemeteries throughout Europe and north Africa. But it is the scale of the Bayeux commemorations he always finds so moving. \u201cI am always amazed when I see the veterans go past marching. They try to keep straight, they are soldiers still, and the pride is there.

A huge depression rapidly moving into the Channel did not augur well for 5 June, the original planned day of the Normandy invasion, thought Stagg. Krick thought 5 June was \u201cgood to go\u201d.</p> <p>Ike was living on his nerves, \u201csmoking five packs of cigarettes a day, drinking too much coffee, eating little and sleeping less,\u201d said Green.</p> <p>With disagreements among the meteorologists, Stagg decided it fell to him to give an \u201cunequivocal and firm opinion on the deterioration of the weather\u201d. He told him 5 June would be overcast, stormy, with winds too strong to land troops, and cloud offering just 500ft-to-zero visibility.</p> <p>His words were greeted with silence, said Green.</p> <p>In the end, Eisenhower\u2019s decision rested on Stagg\u2019s opinion that there would be a brief \u201cinterlude\u201d on 6 June. Eisenhower made his fateful decision. His diary records that on what should have been invasion day he awoke in the early hours to find \u201cour little camp was shaking and shuddering under a wind of almost hurricane proportions and the accompanying rain seems to be travelling in horizontal streaks\u201d.</p> <p>Stagg had been right. If the invasion had started that morning, it would have failed.</p> <p>Hours later, at the morning meeting, he announced his decision. Trusting Stagg, once more, the invasion was on for 6 June.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65ab4f3d6cf2e49c7264d2e1c760bb225b9882c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65ab4f3d6cf2e49c7264d2e1c760bb225b9882c0/0_0_3500_2330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Veterans wave flags from the MV Boudicca to mark the 75th anniversary of D-day\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Veterans wave flags from the MV Boudicca as it leaves the port of Dover in Kent on 2 June to mark the 75th anniversary of D-day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty O\u2019Connor/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Naval commander: \u201cHistory may not repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme\u201d</h2> <p>Commander Craig Wood, of the Portsmouth flotilla, has responsibility for the naval homage to commemorate D-day in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an opportunity to commemorate our comrades who have gone before us, and to salute those who are still with us. And to recognise the phenomenal feat they embarked upon, which, I think, even after 30 years of service, is very difficult to even begin to imagine what that must have been like,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Part of the Portsmouth flotilla\u2019s role during the D-day event is to perform a salute to the 300 veterans aboard the Royal British Legion\u2019s specially chartered MV Boudicca. \u201cAs the Boudicca sails with veterans to arrive in Normandy on 6 June, as they did 75 years ago, we are escorting her out, and further RN ships at sea will salute them as they go past,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The frigate andsubmarine hunter HMS St Albans will escort the Boudicca and fire a salute to the veterans on board. The flotilla includes frigates and minehunters taking part in a sailpast in the Solent.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been really heartening to see the young men and women of the armed forces coming together for this. Those same values and standards, the ethos of the armed forces 75 years ago and before, still resonate today,\u201d he said.</p> <p>With the dwindling number of second world war veterans, many have predicted this will be the last such occasion to commemorate D-day.</p> <p>\u201cNever say never,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThe 70th anniversary was going to be the last event, and here we are five years later, And we still have a number of veterans. A naval historian once told me that history may not repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. And it is wonderful we can still engage with the veterans to remind ourselves about what they went through.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s humbling to see that spark in their eye as they recall what they did. Their humility is the thing that resonates with me. The \u2018I was just doing my job, I played a very small part\u2019. Not one of them would ever claim to be a hero of the day.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 June 2019. Percy Lewis regularly recites the exhortation, not the exultation, during the annual commemorations.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of people are preparing to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-day landings at commemoration events in the UK and France this week. Senior politicians and members of the royal family as well as hundreds of veterans will attend ceremonies to mark one of the main turning points of the second world war and the biggest amphibious invasion in military history. More than 200 veterans have boarded a cruise ship, MV Boudicca, charted by the Royal British Legion, to attend the events, while others are descending en masse on Portsmouth and Normandy. Here we hear the stories of those who were there on 6 June 1944 and others involved in this week\u2019s commemorations. Prisoner of war: \u201cI looked at him. He looked at me. I put my hands up\u201d Percy Lewis, 96, a wireless operator with No 6 Beach Group, spent most of D-day sheltering in the sand dunes off Sword beach. After landing at 11am on a small landing craft, he had to wait for the rest of his battalion to come. \u201cNow and again there were a few shells coming over, but all the infantry and tanks had gone,\u201d he said. The remainder of the second world war, however, would not prove so straightforward for him. In the first week in July, while posted with 1st Battalion Black Watch, \u201cgoing up towards Rouen and having not seen \u2018Jerry\u2019 [a nickname given to Germans during the war] for two days\u201d, he and his comrades dug in. As he set up his wireless near a barn, \u201cJerry started mortaring, and I got shrapnel in the left ankle. It was only a flesh wound, but it was blood everywhere.\u201d Lewis, from Guildford, was evacuated and treated in Staffordshire before returning, this time to the Netherlands. In October 1944, while advancing through the country, his platoon found themselves at night in a small village \u201csomewhere in the Venray area\u201d and occupied the crossroads. But he had to retrace his steps to retrieve some wireless equipment. \u201cI started walking back alone, rifle over my shoulder, and the moon had just come up behind my back. I got a fair way back. Someone shouted: \u2018Halt.\u2019 I said: \u2018Friend.\u2019 Nothing. I walked a bit further. \u2018Halt.\u2019 I said: \u2018Friend.\u2019 Nothing. I took the rifle off my shoulder. \u201cThere was a row of cottages. A door was open. I thought: \u2018I\u2019ll make for that door.\u2019 And just as I got to the door, Jerry stepped out with his rifle on me. I looked at him. He looked at me. I put my hands up. Two German paratroopers about two doors away pushed me into the middle of the road. \u201cI thought: \u2018They\u2019ll start shooting in a minute.\u2019 Nothing happened. They took me round the corner, and down into the cellar. And it was full of German paratroopers cleaning all their kit.\u201d With a rifle pushed into his back, he was handed over to a Panzer division. He was now a prisoner of war, and would be interned in the Stalag XI-B Fallingbostel PoW camp in Germany. It was liberated in April 1945. \u201cEleven of us go to Normandy, to Arromanches, every year,\u201d said Lewis, who has regularly given the exhortation on the seafront during the annual commemorations. Sunk and stranded: \u201cI helped lay three of them out\u201d Ron Smith, 94, an electrician (then known as a wireman) from Rustington, West Sussex, was on landing craft tank (LCT) 947, which approached Sword beach at 7.35am on D-day. As troops disembarked, a shell hit one of the tanks on the landing craft, immobilising it and blocking the craft\u2019s exit ramp. Torpedoes on the landing craft exploded, killing the colonel on board and three others. Smith helped wrap up the bodies, as the LCT was forced to retreat and make its way back to Portsmouth. \u201cI helped to lay three of them out,\u201d he said. One was Lt Col Arthur Cocks, the first British officer killed in the landings. \u201cHe\u2019s now celebrated in Portsmouth Cathedral with a window,\u201d said Smith. On their final briefings, he said: \u201cWe were told we were going to France, \u2018and you won\u2019t need a passport\u2019.\u201d But nothing could really prepare for the beach landings. \u201cI don\u2019t reckon a winkle survived on that beach. It was just one heap of explosives \u2013 it was amazing the way the tanks went off. \u201cAs soon as we landed, our role was to clear off quickly so the next could come in.\u201d But after the LCT was hit, \u201cwe couldn\u2019t land anything else\u201d. He spent a week in Portsmouth as the LCT was repaired, then headed back to Normandy. But the LCT hit a mine off the coast of Arromanches, near the Mulberry harbour. The crew managed to swim to a nearby merchant ship, which had been deliberately half-sunk to provide defence for the artificial harbour. \u201cWe went up a rope, up three steps, and were over the gunnel on to the deck. Then we went to the wheelhouse. And the only thing we rescued was a huge jar of rum. And we drunk the lot,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThere were 12 of us, and we were on there for 14 hours. \u201cEveryone was too busy to rescue us. We had to just stop on there. Eventually a landing craft came alongside and we were off. We were taken to an army camp, and they served us with half a loaf of bread and soup you could stand a spoon up in, and it was the best meal I\u2019ve ever tasted. Amazing.\u201d Smith was then dispatched to the UK, where he recovered from his injuries in a hospital in Scotland. He was later sent to Burma. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time ago. This is the most I ever talk about it. I was only 19, that\u2019s all I was,\u201d he said. Switchboard operator: \u201cI could hear very loud, sustained gunfire\u201d Marie Scott, 92, a switchboard operator, volunteered for the Women\u2019s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) at 17. She was posted to the labyrinthine Fort Southwick, the underground Combined Operations Underground HQ, and the nerve centre on D-day, which was run from tunnels deep in the cliffs overlooking Portsmouth. On D-day, her job was as a very high frequency (VHF) radio operator, relaying messages to and from the invasion fleet and landing troops. \u201cIt was a series of tunnels. Quite spartan,\u201d she said of Fort Southwick. \u201cThe tunnels were very deep. We had to go down about 350 steps to get into the tunnels and, indeed, come up 350 steps. But at 17 you could do it. \u201cWe had long shifts, so we had to sleep down there as well. There was no natural light. There was no fresh air. So we had air conditioning and electric lights. On and off I was down there certainly for six to nine months, over D-day and after D-day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe knew something big was afoot because there was an armada of boats in Portsmouth harbour. That was a giveaway. \u201cThe VHF radio was a one-way system. When you raised your lever to transmit, the recipient couldn\u2019t make any interjections until you had finished, and said: \u2018Roger and out.\u2019 or whatever. Then they would raise their lever, and transmit their message\u201d. On D-day she was in direct contact with the wireless operators on the allied invasion fleet as they stormed the beaches. \u201cWhen they raised their lever, I could hear very loud, sustained gunfire. It was really so bad that you thought: \u2018Oh my God. There\u2019s a battle going on.\u2019 You knew. You thought: \u2018God, men are dying.\u2019 The reality suddenly hit you. For a rather naive 17-year-old, I think it was terrifying. But it was a job. You got on with it. \u201cThe messages were all in code, so you didn\u2019t know what was being said. But you could hear the gunfire, every time the lever was lifted. I\u2019ve never forgotten what I heard. Never.\u201d On the 75th anniversary, Scott, from New Malden, Surrey, will be in Normandy, travelling as a guest of the Taxi Charity, that annually takes veterans to Normandy. This year more than 30 taxis will be involved. It will be a special moment for Scott, who after the war became a secretary, married, raised a family and then worked for Surrey county council. She has been awarded the Legion D\u2019Honneur by the French, which will be presented by a French general at a ceremony at the Pegasus museum in Ranville. \u201cI\u2019m deeply honoured, and very humbled. You feel that you can\u2019t be deserving because men laid down their lives. We were the backroom people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming, really. And it\u2019s going to be fantastic. \u201cAll that really concerns me is that somebody will be available \u2013 hopefully a strapping young soldier or sailor or airman \u2013 to help me up the steps!\u201d Seasickness: \u201cPlease let us get over there and get off this thing\u201d Mick Jennings, 93, served as an electrician on LCT 795 to carry troops of the US 531 Engineer Shore Regiment on to Utah beach on D-day. They landed under German shellfire and the craft was beached, leaving personnel open to attack. \u201cIt was a very rough crossing. I\u2019m afraid the American troops weren\u2019t used to being on that sort of thing [the LCT] and so a lot of them were very sick. Their only concern was: \u2018Please let us get over there and get off this thing,\u2019\u201d he said. He saw one LCT break up. \u201cThey weren\u2019t really meant for that sort of sea,\u201d said Jennings, from Emsworth, near Chichester. \u201cApparently, we landed on the wrong side of the beach. It should have been further left, I think, but we didn\u2019t know it at the time. I can still see it. It\u2019s like a cin\u00e9 film. I can see us coming in and thinking: \u2018Well, there were mines on the beach.\u2019 There were all sorts there. Luckily, the tide took us and we landed on a reasonably safe beach.\u201d His abiding memory was wishing \u201cjust to get back, to be honest\u201d. Jennings said: \u201cI\u2019m just one of thousands who was doing the job you were trained for. I\u2019m nothing special.\u201d He continued to ferry troops back and forth across the Channel during the liberation. Victory didn\u2019t come cheap: \u201cI had just my achilles holding my foot on\u201d Bill Gladden, 95, who was in the 6th Airborne Armoured Recce Regiment, was 20 years old when he took off from a Dorset airfield on D-day in a Hamilcar glider, which dwarfed the Halifax towing it. It was the first time tanks had been flown into a battlefield, and he was squashed alongside one tank and six motorbikes, weighing a total of 16 tonnes. As they crossed the Channel he climbed on top of the tank to look out of a porthole. But then, suddenly, the towrope dropped. \u201cI felt the towrope go, because once it drops it\u2019s like you hit a brick wall. I couldn\u2019t move, I just hung on, and that\u2019s how I landed in Normandy, spread-eagled on top of a Tetrarch tank.\u201d Their job was to quickly make their way to Ranville Bridge over the Orne, taken earlier in the day, and hold it. He spent his first night in Normandy dug in there, then he moved to an orchard at Ranville. His stay would be brief. \u201cEach day we went out, pretty deep into the countryside, to find out where the Germans were and report back,\u201d said Gladden. \u201cWe got chased back a few times. \u201cI\u2019d been there about 12 days. We could hear the Germans start up their tanks of a morning. And, although we used to go out quite a bit, the fighting went on in the Ranville area for a long time.\u201d On 18 June he came back from patrol as usual. \u201cAnd I was just about to pour the water out and have a brew up when suddenly there was a bang, and I was on my back.\u201d A German Tiger tank had fired on the group. The whole of the front of his ankle was blown off. \u201cI had just my Achilles holding my foot on,\u201d he said. Colleagues carried him to an old barn used to treat casualties. Two days earlier, Gladden had helped carry the bodies of two friends to the same barn. \u201cLittle did I know that within the next two days they would be carrying me over. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel any pain at first. When the pain comes on, they start pushing the old morphine into you. And then you sail away.\u201d He remembers coming to a field hospital. Doctors were struggling to save his foot. \u201c\u2018Amputation considered\u2019: that was on the ticket I read around my neck when I came to, lying on a stretcher on the grass being sick as a dog.\u201d Gladden was evacuated to the UK. He spent the following three years in hospital, with his foot only finally being saved by a sophisticated bone graft involving both his legs being temporarily sewn and plastered together. His foot has troubled him ever since. The injury meant he was discharged from the army on medical grounds. \u201cI count myself very lucky,\u201d said Gladden, from Welling, Kent, who went on to work in the accounts department at Siemens. \u201cI survived, thousands didn\u2019t.\u201d He has returned to Ranville 10 times during recent years, since becoming a widower, and was heading there again for the 75th anniversary of D-day as a guest of the Taxi Charity. \u201cIt\u2019s a nostalgic visit. And it is nice to get thanks from the people out there. But I think the main thing is to keep alive the fact that victory didn\u2019t come cheap. \u201cThere were thousands of young men who were killed and maimed in those first few days, and we just don\u2019t want any more wars. That\u2019s the way I look at it.\u201d Get off this bloody beach: \u201cLooking at the bodies, you felt sorry about it\u201d Before the 75th commemorations, seven surviving veterans from the Battle of Normandy and D-day were honoured at an event at the Royal Hospital Chelsea. Chelsea pensioner Bill Fitzgerald, 94, who served with the Sussex regiment and was only 18 at the time, said: \u201cWe were the third in on the day. We got so far in and then we hit something underneath, so we knew we were going to get wet. \u201cThe beach master was there shouting out: \u2018Get off this bloody beach and don\u2019t get killed.\u2019 \u201cThe water was full of bodies and they were mostly all Marine Commandos \u2013 but you couldn\u2019t take too much notice, all you were thinking of was helping each other,\u201d he said. \u201cLooking at the bodies, you felt sorry about it, but you had a job to get on that beach and wait for your friends.\u201d He was injured nine days after D-day in a shelling on 15 June. \u201cWe had a horrible day fighting and the tanks decided to stop in the woods,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve me, they shelled the hell out of us. \u201cAll I can remember is getting a shell very near me, going up in the air and coming down and one of my friends putting a helmet over my face,\u201d he said, speaking at the Royal Hospital Chelsea last month. His femur was broken in half and he was flown back to the UK on 17 June. \u201cAfter I was discharged, I got my suit, I got my hat, and you\u2019re outside the door saying: \u2018What\u2019s next?\u2019\u201d Bomb disposal: \u201cLet\u2019s face it, the landing was very gory\u201d Chelsea pensioner Frank Mouqu\u00e9, 94, was a corporal in the Royal Engineers who landed on Sword beach and whose job was to dispose of bombs on a stretch of land beyond the parapet next to the beach. \u201cWe approached Sword beach in a landing craft. We had all of our gear on our backs and a rubber ring around our stomach to help keep us afloat. Let\u2019s face it, the landing was very gory. You didn\u2019t have time to think, survival instinct kicked in,\u201d he said in his account published on the Royal Hospital Chelsea\u2019s website. \u201cAfter reaching the beach, I ran up towards a parapet, and searched for mines. After 12 hours of being on the go we were exhausted and then had to dig a foxhole to sleep in. We had to dig six foot down and two foot wide. \u201cI slept outside for the next year or so, we had no protection from the elements. We had an oversized gas cape to go over our clothes and all our gear. We rarely slept lying down. Each time we slept in a barn we were ravaged by fleas \u2013 so even that was no good. \u201cIt was a different time: I wasn\u2019t a hero, I was a little cog in a big wheel. When you add all those little cogs together \u2013 then we became important. We all worked together towards peace.\u201d Born on D-day: \u201cIt isn\u2019t my wish that you remain a widow\u201d Alan Gaudern was born on D-day in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. His father, William, a teacher, would never see him. Serving in Normandy with the Somerset Light Infantry, William was killed on 10 July 1944 at the age of 37. Alan \u2013 who has visited Normandy, in particular Hill 112 west of Caen, which his father fought to recapture, and Bayeux war cemetery, where he is buried \u2013 has retained his last letters written from the front. The letters, read by Alan, form part of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission\u2019s Voices of Liberation audio archive. During the 75th anniversary commemorations at Portsmouth and Bayeux, there will be installations where the public can listen to many of those voices. William and his wife, Ethel, already had a daughter, Joyce, aged four, when Alan was born. \u201cAlan William was born on 6 June at Harrogate hospital. Ethel and he are both doing well, from what I hear,\u201d William wrote to family friends. \u201cI haven\u2019t see my son and heir yet, so you can guess how much I am looking forward to my next leave. When that will be, I don\u2019t know.\u201d But it was not to be. William\u2019s last letter to Ethel was dated 18 June 1944. He was on the move, he said. \u201cIt is a lovely summer morning, so we should have as comfortable a trip as is possible. The countryside was perfect as we came along, so fresh and full of beauty,\u201d he wrote. He enclosed a \u00a35 cheque, sent to him at the front by his father. \u201cPlease cash it and spend it on yourself, on something you would really like. I shall look forward to hearing what it is, and later to seeing you wearing it,\u201d he wrote. The letter continues: \u201cYou know we\u2019ve faced up to the likelihood that I may not come back. But you know I feel I shall come back because I want to so much. We\u2019ve had a perfect married life together, haven\u2019t we?\u201d He adds: \u201cBut if I don\u2019t come back, I want you to know how much I owe to you and to thank you for our lovely life together. And to let you know that it isn\u2019t my wish that you remain a widow if you really fall in love again. I am happy in the knowledge that you\u2019ll bring up Joyce and Alan to be useful and good God-fearing citizens. If I don\u2019t come back, teach them as much nature study as you know, which is a great deal. \u201cI hope we can sit down one day and laugh at what I\u2019ve written. Wish me a happy landings and be a brave lass like you always are. You\u2019re not to worry or else the milk will go sour.\u201d Alan, a retired bank manager, and himself a father, said: \u201cMy mother was both mother and father to me and I think she did a good job with that. Yes, I felt as I look back that I would have wished to have a father as a male role model, which is so important. But my mother was an amazing woman. \u201cShe was left with a four-year-old and a six-week-old baby to fend for herself. People now don\u2019t realise how difficult it was for war widows. Yes, my mother got a war widow\u2019s pension, but that was taxable. Taxable! For a war widow.\u201d Bayeux cemetery: \u201cI feel as though I am passing the legacy of remembrance on to future generations\u201d Three generations of William Moody\u2019s family have worked for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) in France. As supervisor of the sector that takes in Normandy, Moody, 67, has a responsibility for ensuring the Bayeux military cemetery, the largest British second world war cemetery in France, looks perfect for the 75th anniversary. There are 4,144 Commonwealth burials there, each one marked with a white headstone. Maintenance is ongoing throughout the year. Each headstone is cleaned. The turf is fertilised and cropped short to maintain its vivid green. Seasonal plantings include roses, designed to bloom in June on the anniversary. \u201cThe headstone is the identity of the soldier, with his badge, and his name and his regiment. So it\u2019s so important. You see old veterans, standing by the graves of perhaps a friend they lost. Sometimes they rest their hand on the headstone. This is their comrade, whom they lost in the landings. As I walk past, I keep very quiet, because they are honouring their comrades. They are here to see their friends. It\u2019s very emotional,\u201d said Moody. \u201cAnd the plantings, to me, it is as if each one has their own little garden, like they might have done back home, if they had lived. I am proud to be able to honour those that fell and to give them a place that seems like home, although they are sometimes so far from home. \u201cI feel as though I am passing the legacy of remembrance on to future generations, ensuring that we can always come to these remarkable places to reflect on the courage, sacrifice and the real cost in human terms that these men and women made to preserve our freedom.\u201d Moody has worked for 52 years with the CWGC, starting as a pupil gardener. His father, who is from Aberystwyth in Wales, served with the Royal Signals, serving in India before coming to France after the Normandy landings and staying there to work for the CWGC in northern France. He has witnessed many anniversaries at Bayeux, and other CWGC cemeteries throughout Europe and north Africa. But it is the scale of the Bayeux commemorations he always finds so moving. \u201cI am always amazed when I see the veterans go past marching. They try to keep straight, they are soldiers still, and the pride is there. They walk straight, and some of them have difficulties walking, but they still do it, they try to march, and its a huge effort for them, but they want to show the public they are still there,\u201d he said. Weather: \u201cEisenhower was smoking five packs a day\u201d Col Jeremy Green (retired), is a historian and expert on Southwick House, the Allied HQ near Portsmouth, from where Gen \u201cIke\u201d Eisenhower made the decision to delay by one day. Green said initially there were huge differences between American and British and Norwegian meteorologists. And had Ike, the supreme allied commander, listened to his fellow Americans, D-day could have been a disaster. \u201cThe Americans came here with great enthusiasm based upon an analogue system of taking the weather by a guy called Irving Krick. He basically said if you look at historical weather patterns, and if those conditions are replicated again, the same weather would occur,\u201d said Green. \u201cAnd the problem for us, the Brits, was he was briefing Eisenhower direct.\u201d The American military initially refused to talk to the British chief meteorologist, James Stagg, \u201cbecause he was a civilian\u201d, until Stagg was temporarily made a group captain in the Royal Air Force. Stagg was receiving information from weather stations including, crucially, Blacksod Lighthouse in County Mayo, on Ireland\u2019s west coast. A huge depression rapidly moving into the Channel did not augur well for 5 June, the original planned day of the Normandy invasion, thought Stagg. Krick thought 5 June was \u201cgood to go\u201d. Ike was living on his nerves, \u201csmoking five packs of cigarettes a day, drinking too much coffee, eating little and sleeping less,\u201d said Green. With disagreements among the meteorologists, Stagg decided it fell to him to give an \u201cunequivocal and firm opinion on the deterioration of the weather\u201d. He told him 5 June would be overcast, stormy, with winds too strong to land troops, and cloud offering just 500ft-to-zero visibility. His words were greeted with silence, said Green. In the end, Eisenhower\u2019s decision rested on Stagg\u2019s opinion that there would be a brief \u201cinterlude\u201d on 6 June. Eisenhower made his fateful decision. His diary records that on what should have been invasion day he awoke in the early hours to find \u201cour little camp was shaking and shuddering under a wind of almost hurricane proportions and the accompanying rain seems to be travelling in horizontal streaks\u201d. Stagg had been right. If the invasion had started that morning, it would have failed. Hours later, at the morning meeting, he announced his decision. Trusting Stagg, once more, the invasion was on for 6 June. Naval commander: \u201cHistory may not repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme\u201d Commander Craig Wood, of the Portsmouth flotilla, has responsibility for the naval homage to commemorate D-day in the UK. \u201cThis is an opportunity to commemorate our comrades who have gone before us, and to salute those who are still with us. And to recognise the phenomenal feat they embarked upon, which, I think, even after 30 years of service, is very difficult to even begin to imagine what that must have been like,\u201d he said. Part of the Portsmouth flotilla\u2019s role during the D-day event is to perform a salute to the 300 veterans aboard the Royal British Legion\u2019s specially chartered MV Boudicca. \u201cAs the Boudicca sails with veterans to arrive in Normandy on 6 June, as they did 75 years ago, we are escorting her out, and further RN ships at sea will salute them as they go past,\u201d he said. The frigate andsubmarine hunter HMS St Albans will escort the Boudicca and fire a salute to the veterans on board. The flotilla includes frigates and minehunters taking part in a sailpast in the Solent. \u201cIt\u2019s been really heartening to see the young men and women of the armed forces coming together for this. Those same values and standards, the ethos of the armed forces 75 years ago and before, still resonate today,\u201d he said. With the dwindling number of second world war veterans, many have predicted this will be the last such occasion to commemorate D-day. \u201cNever say never,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThe 70th anniversary was going to be the last event, and here we are five years later, And we still have a number of veterans. A naval historian once told me that history may not repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. And it is wonderful we can still engage with the veterans to remind ourselves about what they went through. \u201cIt\u2019s humbling to see that spark in their eye as they recall what they did. Their humility is the thing that resonates with me. The \u2018I was just doing my job, I played a very small part\u2019. Not one of them would ever claim to be a hero of the day.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 3 June 2019.

      "bodyText": "A five-year-old boy with a rare form of cancer, who inspired Lewis Hamilton to victory in the Spanish Grand Prix, has died. The reigning Formula One world champion was among a number of sports stars, including the cricketer Jos Buttler, former footballer Gary Lineker and grand slam tennis champion Novak Djokovic, to support fundraising by Harry Shaw. Harry, who was diagnosed with Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, a form of bone cancer, in August 2018, died on Saturday. He had recently moved back to his home in Redhill, Surrey, for his final days. A post on a JustGiving page set up for the Royal Marsden Cancer charity said Harry took \u201chis last breath after a tough 10-month battle\u201d. The youngster had \u201cfought to the very end\u201d, his family said. \u201cHis pain and suffering is over. It is impossible to imagine life without Harry and the hole he will leave in our lives. We are SO proud of Harry and everything he achieved in his life and the legacy he has created to help others. We miss him so much.\u201d The post on his fundraising page added: \u201cLosing Harry means our happy family unit of four now becomes three. We lose our firstborn child; our two-year-old daughter Georgia loses her brother who she will probably never remember; and the wider family lose their first grandchild and nephew. \u201cWe would like to say Harry died in peace and comfort; to an extent he did, dying at home in his own bed surrounded by his toys and the people he loved. But the actual truth is the last few weeks of Harry\u2019s life were marked by terrible pain and suffering that no human, not least a five-year-old boy, should endure.\u201d Hamilton dedicated his win at last month\u2019s Spanish Grand Prix to the child, describing him as his \u201cspirit angel\u201d, while Mercedes sent the trophy and one of its F1 cars to Harry\u2019s home. The Formula One driver had been alerted to his plight after he received a video message before the race in Barcelona. He wrote in an Instagram post at the time: \u201cYou are such a strong boy, I wish I was as strong as you, I wanted the world to see how strong you are.\u201d Harry\u2019s parents, Charlotte and James Shaw, set up the fundraising page after he was given just seven days to live on 29 April.",

Pipped to fourth place by Tottenham, an expensive and ultimately humiliating trip to Azerbaijan, and their north London rivals reaching the Champions League final has left most Gunners feeling a little jaded. Cue a summer of upheaval, but not necessarily in a good way. One of the few shining lights from last season, Golden Boot joint-winner <strong>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</strong>, has been offered a whopping \u00a3300,000-a-week to join one of <strong>Guangzhou Evergrande</strong> and <strong>Shanghai SIPG</strong>, according to The Times. That would dwarf the \u00a3190,000-a-week the 29-year-old is on at the moment, and could be a significant distraction with just two years left on his contract.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/03/west-ham-renewed-20-million-bid-andre-gomes-barcelona-transfer-window-football\">West Ham bid \u00a320m for Barcelona\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Gomes but fear Everton interest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To compound problems, one of the club\u2019s best new youngsters, <strong>Xavier Amaechi</strong>, is also considering leaving, having been left out of the Europa League final matchday squad.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a tough few weeks for Arsenal fans. Pipped to fourth place by Tottenham, an expensive and ultimately humiliating trip to Azerbaijan, and their north London rivals reaching the Champions League final has left most Gunners feeling a little jaded. Cue a summer of upheaval, but not necessarily in a good way. One of the few shining lights from last season, Golden Boot joint-winner Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, has been offered a whopping \u00a3300,000-a-week to join one of Guangzhou Evergrande and Shanghai SIPG, according to The Times. That would dwarf the \u00a3190,000-a-week the 29-year-old is on at the moment, and could be a significant distraction with just two years left on his contract. To compound problems, one of the club\u2019s best new youngsters, Xavier Amaechi, is also considering leaving, having been left out of the Europa League final matchday squad. Oh, and Stephan Lichtsteiner has left. Welcome to the summer, Arsenal! Unai Emery will have some money to spend \u2013 around \u00a340m \u2013 and could blow it all on a couple of players from Sampdoria, the same club that Lucas Torreira arrived from. Dennis Praet and Joachim \u2018Julian\u2019 Anderson have both caught the eye of Arsenal scouts, while Milan are also jostling for the central midfielder and centre-back. Media in Spain are reporting that Real Madrid should have their summer business wrapped up as early as next week, as Zinedine Zidane aims to have everything sorted by the end of the international break. With pre-season starting in a month\u2019s time, a trio of Eden Hazard (\u00a3105m), Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s Luka Jovic (\u00a360m) and Lyon\u2019s Ferland Mendy (around \u00a340m) are all expected to punt balls into the Bernab\u00e9u crowd after their respective press conferences. Mendy in particular is close to his move, with Real doctors reportedly visiting the left-back for a medical in Paris, where he is training with France prior to Saturday\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier against Turkey. The Mill has been spared a summer of diligent Google translating after PSG knocked back Barcelona\u2019s enquiry for Neymar with a firm \u201cno\u201d. That refusal comes straight from the top, with PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi unwilling to entertain any offers for the Brazilian, who is apparently the preferred choice of Leo Messi over Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s Antoine Griezmann. Watford manager Javi Gracia is one of the names linked with the position at Chelsea should Maurizio Sarri depart, with the Italian reportedly offered a three-year deal worth \u00a36.22m per season to manage Juventus. Elsewhere, Cardiff City have turned down an \u00a38m bid by Aston Villa for keeper Neil Etheridge, while Middlesbrough are concentrating on trying to sign both Newcastle\u2019s Dwight Gayle and Hull\u2019s Kamil Grosicki.",

The first things you see are not her works but popular prints, bold textiles and a country woman\u2019s costume. Her art enthusiastically embraced these flowery, bright influences. In fact she went so deep into Russia\u2019s traditional arts that some of her own works can be mistaken for folk products. Her 1912-13 image The Lives of St Florus and Laurus is a comic-strip portrayal of two Byzantine saints, stonemasons who dedicated their artistic skills to God. Goncharova shows them performing miracles and being buried alive, in images straight out of a Russian icon. In her 1910-11 triptych Christ the Saviour, the big central face of Christ is a homage to the mystical 14th century Russian artist Andrei Rublev.</p> <p>This is Russian modernism, but not as we know it. Goncharova and her lover Mikhail Larionov were the dynamic duo of the Russian avant garde in the years preceding the first world war. In 1913, Goncharova had a smash-hit one-woman show in Moscow, the first time any Russian modern artist got national attention. She paraded the streets in \u201cfuturist\u201d makeup with slashes, scars and crosses all over her face. Yet it doesn\u2019t take long to notice that Russians in 1913 had a very idiosyncratic idea of what futurism was.</p> <p>Far from the jagged, restless celebration of speed that the Italian futurist movement celebrated, the paintings gathered here from Goncharova\u2019s sensational solo exhibition are poetic reveries on an older, seemingly eternal world. In Hay Cutting, a peasant swings a scythe while two boys carry freshly cut hay. All wear white smocks that contrast with a green forest beyond. Goncharova abstracts these stark shapes and colours: the peasants are strongly outlined in black, their faces primitive ovals. In Picking Apples, young women in white enjoy a picnic as they collect fruit under the trees, their simplified forms sharpened against a pink sky. It\u2019s like a scene from Chekhov, reimagined by Matisse.</p> <p>It quickly becomes clear that modernism in Russia on the eve of the first world war had almost nothing in common with the image of the Soviet avant garde we still lap up in the west. Really, we\u2019ve no excuse any more for equating early Russian modern art with the abstract propaganda of <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/inventingabstraction/?work=226\">Tatlin\u2019s tower</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_the_Whites_with_the_Red_Wedge\">El Lissitsky\u2019s red wedge</a>. The museums of Moscow and St Petersburg are full of modernist paintings of viking ships and Orthodox churches. Goncharova was the co-leader, with Larionov, of this folkloric avant garde. There was nothing naive about her project. Her generation were in direct contact with the latest art from Paris, for some of the most extravagant collectors of Parisian modern art before 1917 were Russian.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1661ebf4269111025c2967ae39d5175e6958baf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1661ebf4269111025c2967ae39d5175e6958baf1/0_0_5011_5292/947.jpg\" alt=\"Harvest: The Phoenix, 1911.\" width=\"947\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harvest: The Phoenix, 1911.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Natalia Goncharova/\u00a9 ADAGP, Paris and DACS, London 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This show includes Picasso\u2019s 1909 early Cubist painting <a href=\"https://www.agefotostock.com/age/en/Stock-Images/Rights-Managed/MDO-158532\">Queen Isabeau</a>, an example of the modernist masterpieces already in Russian collections in Goncharova\u2019s time. Picasso was reinventing art by embracing influences Europeans considered \u201cprimitive\u201d \u2013 from gothic sculpture as here to masks from Africa and Oceania. That cult of the primal set Goncharova\u2019s mind on fire.</p> <p>Looking closer at the photograph of her with futurist face paint, her scarifications are reminiscent of African masks \u2013 or how she may have imagined them. Yet she didn\u2019t need to look to Africa for such so-called \u201cprimitivism\u201d. She found the raw and passionate all around her in the Russian countryside. In her most ambitious work, Harvest, she infuses figures inspired by icons and church frescoes with a stark orange flesh colour, reminiscent of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_(Matisse)\">Matisse\u2019s Dance</a>. That\u2019s no coincidence. Matisse painted his red-bodied dancers in 1910 for the Moscow art collector Sergei Shchukin. Goncharova painted Harvest in 1911, but she relocates the primal energy of Dance into the middle ages. A naked woman rides a two-headed monster straight out of the Book of Revelation while peasant feet tread out the grapes of wrath.</p> <p>Russia was on the edge of an upheaval of biblical proportions and Goncharova\u2019s paintings knew it. Her depictions of modern city life are fraught with unease and terror. The City, painted circa 1911, shows towering monolithic modern apartment blocks with a factory chimney belching black smoke into a sky already crowded with aeroplanes. At the base of this colossal cubistic nightmare walk tiny people. In Factory (Futurist), one of the massive tubular chimney stacks filling a sky of restless fragments lowers like the barrel of a howitzer.</p> <p>Goncharova\u2019s art is full of passion for the people \u2013 but they\u2019re not a homogenous urban \u201cproletariat\u201d. Her Russia is diverse and unpredictable. Paintings here from her 1913 exhibition include a depiction of a Jewish neighbourhood and a black female nude. In 1916, she and Larionov went to Paris to experience the heart of modernism first hand. After the Revolution, they had no reason to go home. In exile, she survived by turning her flaming dreamscapes of folk life into brilliant fashion designs. Her drawings for the House of Myrbor in Paris translated peasant culture into jazz-age chic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ba832e3b451c6633a2a7f3adbc7182f4cabc128\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ba832e3b451c6633a2a7f3adbc7182f4cabc128/0_0_3856_3867/997.jpg\" alt=\"Study for textile design for House of Myrbor 1925-1928.\" width=\"997\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Study for a textile design for House of Myrbor 1925-1928.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Natalia Goncharova/\u00a9 ADAGP, Paris and DACS, London 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Right through this exhibition I imagined a soundtrack of Russian modern music.

I struggle to reconcile its voguish credentials with the gape-mouthed horror before me.</p> <p>The machine is dull gold with a brown headstrap and is quite, quite chilling. It looks like one of the masks with which Mayans decorated their dead, to face a long battle in the underworld. What a mouthwatering prospect.</p> <p>Inside, it is even stranger, with 150 numbered LEDs arranged grid-like on a face-hugging sheet, encased within the chunky frame. Surely it won\u2019t work.

You\u2019re looking at the snappily named Light Therapy Golden Facial Treatment Device from MZ Skin. A golden facial sounds quite the off-menu request, but this is a big deal in dermatology circles, an at-home version of the LED phototherapy beloved of celebrities. I struggle to reconcile its voguish credentials with the gape-mouthed horror before me. The machine is dull gold with a brown headstrap and is quite, quite chilling. It looks like one of the masks with which Mayans decorated their dead, to face a long battle in the underworld. What a mouthwatering prospect. Inside, it is even stranger, with 150 numbered LEDs arranged grid-like on a face-hugging sheet, encased within the chunky frame. Surely it won\u2019t work. It has a plastic signal box and many wires, and it looks as if someone has grafted the face of Thomas the Tank Engine on to a potato waffle. But where wellness goes, we go. I strap it on.

      "bodyText": "An ancient mutation that spread through humans after the advent of cooking may protect people against high blood sugar and diabetes today, scientists have said. Researchers at University College London (UCL) discovered the mutation while studying a gene called CLTCL1, which is heavily involved in removing sugar from the bloodstream. While a certain amount of blood sugar is necessary to provide energy to the brain and other organs, too much leads to type 2 diabetes, where the body loses its ability to control how much sugar is circulating. The scientists found that about half the world\u2019s population carries a mutation that helps the body to clear sugar from the circulation more effectively than in the past. The scientists believe the mutant form of the gene became common when humans turned to cooking nearly half a million years ago, though it may be a more recent event that took off with farming about 12,500 years ago. \u201cCooking and farming meant more sugar in the diet, so we needed to clear it more readily,\u201d said Prof Frances Brodsky, a biochemist who led the research. \u201cThis is an example of evolution in action which influences human metabolism and vice versa.\u201d By comparing the DNA of humans and various other species, the scientists traced the CLTCL1 gene back nearly 500m years to when the first jawed vertebrates evolved.

But writing in the journal eLife, the scientists describe how humans not only retain the gene but carry different forms of it, with the mutant variant becoming popular only after cooking and farming became widespread.

Guardian Australia understands Morris is in Canberra on Tuesday and is unable to meet with union delegates. \u201cThere was no complaint,\u201d an ABC spokeswoman told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe only communication we received from Adani was a request for more time to respond to our questions. \u201cIn light of the need to provide parties with a fair opportunity to respond and the strength of the other stories in the mix for Saturday AM, the decision was taken at an editorial level to not proceed with the story.\u201d Concern was also raised by the union about revelations in Guardian Australia last week that Adani had lodged several Freedom of Information requests about ABC journalists who had covered the controversial Indian mining company. The ABC\u2019s Queensland-based investigative reporter Josh Robertson referred to the Adani FOI application in an earlier ABC report about the company\u2019s aggressive legal approach to opponents, through its lawyers AJ &amp; Co. \u201cSince it was engaged by Adani, AJ &amp; Co has pushed to bankrupt a cash-strapped Indigenous opponent of the mine, threatened legal action against a community legal service and an environmental group, and applied to access an ABC journalist\u2019s expenses and documents,\u201d Robertson reported. Reporters Mark Willacy and Michael Slezak were asked for documents relating to news reports on allegations Adani was illegally drilling bore holes. These requests were made by AJ &amp; Co, a legal firm acting for Adani which refers to itself as a \u201ctrained attack dog\u201d. Willacy and Slezak\u2019s travel and accommodation costs and some heavily redacted phone logs were released but the majority of the application was rejected. The MEAA media director, Katelin McInerney, said she was alarmed by attempts to access journalists\u2019 records. \u201cThis is a blatant attempt to intimidate and harass journalists going about their duties to report legitimate news stories in the public interest,\u201d McInerney said. \u201cAttacks on press freedom must not be tolerated in a healthy functioning democracy \u2013 regardless of whether those assaults come from political interests or powerful corporations seeking to deter legitimate scrutiny of their activities. \u201cABC journalists must be given the backing and support of ABC management to continue doing their job and fulfilling their responsibilities to keep their audience informed.\u201d",

The money-saving site mozo.com.au has done a very quick calculation about how the ANZ will be saving by only cutting its standard rate by 0.18% rather than the full 0.25%. They\u2019ve also looked at how much it saves by delaying implementation of the cut for nine days. </p> <p>Using Apra\u2019s monthly banking stats on the big four banks\u2019 loan book values, Tom Godfrey of Mozo says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>By delaying their partial cut by nine days ANZ is banking $13.4m.

The unemployment rate had been steady at around 5 per cent for some months, but ticked up to 5.2 per cent in April. The strong employment growth over the past year or so has led to a pick-up in wages growth in the private sector, although overall wages growth remains low. A further gradual lift in wages growth is expected and this would be a welcome development. Taken together, these labour market outcomes suggest that the Australian economy can sustain a lower rate of unemployment.</p> <p>The recent inflation outcomes have been lower than expected and suggest subdued inflationary pressures across much of the economy. Inflation is still however anticipated to pick up, and will be boosted in the June quarter by increases in petrol prices. The central scenario remains for underlying inflation to be 1\u00be per cent this year, 2 per cent in 2020 and a little higher after that.</p> <p>The adjustment in established housing markets is continuing, after the earlier large run-up in prices in some cities. Conditions remain soft, although in some markets the rate of price decline has slowed and auction clearance rates have increased. Growth in housing credit has also stabilised recently.

      "bodyText": "NAB has also cut is rate by 0.25% That\u2019s about it for the blog. Thanks for reading on this momentous afternoon. Mortgage holders will be grateful for the extra bucks but savers will be counting the cost. These are the main points: The RBA, as widely expected, has cut the cash rate from 1.5% to a fresh historic low of 1.25%. The RBA governor Philip Lowe said the move would help reduce unemployment and boost inflation back towards its 2-3% target range. He remains optimistic about the Australian economy, seeing 2.75% growth this year and next, despite some headwinds from the US-China trade dispute. ANZ was the first big bank to cut its lending rate, knocking off 0.18%. CBA has passed on the full 0.25%. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg welcomed the RBA cut but said ANZ had \u201clet down\u201d its customers and that the bank\u2019s decision was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d. The Aussie dollar stayed pretty flat after the RBA announcement, settling at US69.76c at 4pm. The ASX200 closed at up 15 points, or 0.25%, at 6336. Many economists expect the RBA to cut rates at least one more time this year. Capital Economics thinks the rate could hit 0.75%. Philip Lowe will make a speech in Sydney tonight which might shed more light on how he sees rates panning out. Our economics expert Greg Jericho has been looking at the RBA decision and concludes that the government should feel \u201cgreat shame\u201d at such a low lending rate. Even during the global financial crisis the cash rate stayed generally 1% above the inflation rate. Having to cut it so low during a period when the economy is growing (albeit slowly) and unemployment is just above 5% is a pretty sad indictment of how the economy has been handled. Read his whole piece here: This is interesting. The money-saving site mozo.com.au has done a very quick calculation about how the ANZ will be saving by only cutting its standard rate by 0.18% rather than the full 0.25%. They\u2019ve also looked at how much it saves by delaying implementation of the cut for nine days. Using Apra\u2019s monthly banking stats on the big four banks\u2019 loan book values, Tom Godfrey of Mozo says: By delaying their partial cut by nine days ANZ is banking $13.4m. Also, by holding back 7 basis point ANZ is set to rake in $152.5m over the year. Welcoming the CBA\u2019s move to give the whole 0.25%, Tom nevertheless points out it is saving a fair bit by delaying the cut: It\u2019s encouraging that CBA is passing on the full 25 basis point cut but by delaying the date it takes effective until June 25, CBA is banking $50m. In a statement the CBA said its move meets \u201ccommunity expectations\u201d ie what the public wants. Angus Sullivan, the retail banking boss, says: We have carefully considered the RBA rate decision and the current funding environment, together with how we continue to meet our regulatory commitments, capital requirements, and community expectations. Here\u2019s the statement in full. The Commonwealth has passed the rate cut on in full to its customers. Some more reaction to this afternoon\u2019s events. Labour\u2019s Andrew Leigh raises the \u201cmismanagement\u201d issue. (Surely a blunder that they failed to make more of that in the election campaign): The ANZ move is a big talking point. The team at RateCity point out that the small lenders Athena, RACQ and Reduce Home Loans have all passed on the cut in full. Sally Tindall, research director at RateCity.com.au, said all lenders needed to step up and pass on the cut in full. ANZ\u2019s decision to not pass on today\u2019s cut in full is a huge disappointment and now all eyes will on the remaining Big Banks to see if they can go one better. Reduce, RACQ and Athena were the first out of the starting blocks. This now puts immediate pressure on other lenders to pass the full cut on to both their new and existing customers. He\u2019s also asked if the RBA cut is a sign that the economy is in trouble. After all, rates are basically at an emergency level never seen before, and have been for some years now. He dead-bats the question, saying the \u201cfundamentals are sound\u201d. Unconvincingly, he points to Philip Lowe\u2019s statement as proof. The governor says the economy will grow by 2.75%, so it will, OK? You have heard from the Reserve Bank Governor today. He said employment growth has been strong and the central scenario remains for the Australian economy to grow by around 2.75% for 2019 and 2020. That was the comment from the Reserve Bank Governor today in his statement. Frydenberg\u2019s press conference is continuing. He has been asked if he thinks the bank\u2019s own borrowing costs have been reduced by this cut. Banks have sometimes claimed that their costs are not reduced by such cuts and therefore can\u2019t afford to pass them on to customers. Frydenberg says that he thinks their costs have come down: In my conversations with the bank CEOs and chairman they have made it clear that some of their funding costs have come down. So this is a 25-basis-point reduction. It is the first movement in around three years and so in that sense it is significant but we would expect that the Australian people would see the benefit of these reductions in rates and the decision by the RBA and I\u2019m very disappointed in the decision by the ANZ today. The treasurer is quizzed about the ANZ cut, specifically what he thinks of the bank\u2019s decision not to pass the cut on in full. He says ANZ has \u201clet down\u201d its customers. I think the ANZ has let down itscustomers. This is deeply disappointing from the ANZ. We heard from commissioner Hayne just months ago that the banks were putting profits before people. Actions like this don\u2019t give the Australian people any comfort that the banks have changed their behaviour. And as treasurer of Australia I have made it very clear to the banks that the public have a legitimate expectation that they will see the full benefits of rate cuts such as announced by the RBA today. The treasurer is giving a press conference now. He says it\u2019s \u201cwelcome news for Australian households and businesses\u201d and saus the government expects the banks to pass the cut on to borrowers. It is the government\u2019s expectation, indeed, it is the public\u2019s expectation that banks should pass on, in full, to consumers, the benefits of reduced funding costs as a result of the Reserve Bank\u2019s decision. The impact of a 25 basis-point cut on a $400,000 mortgage is the equivalent of saving around $60 a month or $720 a year. A timely boost for households... If you thought 1.25% was low .... The gurus at Capital Economics think the cash rate might fall as low as 0.75%, spruiking their own early predictions that the RBA would start cutting this year in the face of a falling housing market. In a note after the RBA call, Capital notes the bank is sticking to its \u201cglass-half-full rhetoric\u201d about the Australian economy. But it believes most anlaysts are too optimistic about the outlook. It sees GDP falling to 1.5% compared with the bank\u2019s 2.75% forecast and inflation staying at 1.7%. The upshot is that we expect the RBA to slash rates to 0.75% before the year is out. Rates falling below 1% will surely heighten speculation that the Bank will soon launch quantitative easing but we think that\u2019s rather unlikely. ANZ is first out of the blocks and into Josh Frydenberg\u2019s good books by reducing its headline rate by 0.18% (18 basis points as they say in the jargon where 1% = 100bps). Still keep 0.7% for itself though. The governor is speaking in Sydney tonight at 7.30pm and might provide some more insights into how he sees the cut impacting the economy. Until then, plenty of other people have an opinion: https://twitter.com/hidflect/status/1135768170633973763 The Aussie dollar has risen ever sop slightly to US69.76. That shows the 0.25% cut \u2013 an all-time low for rates here \u2013 was fully priced in and that some even thought the RBA could cut by 0.5%. It didn\u2019t, so the Aussie actually rises. The ASX200 has risen a little too. It\u2019s up 14 points or 0.2% to 6334. The stock market just loves cheap money. Lowe\u2019s tour de horizon continues with detailed comments about unemployment, inflation and the housing market. On the former he pinpoints April\u2019s rise to 5.2% as a key moment but says wages are still expected to see some improvement. Likewise with inflation, although it\u2019s way below his target at the minute it\u2019s going to rise to above 2% next year. Employment growth has been strong over the past year, labour force participation has been increasing, the vacancy rate remains high and there are reports of skills shortages in some areas. Despite these developments, there has been little further inroads into the spare capacity in the labour market of late. The unemployment rate had been steady at around 5 per cent for some months, but ticked up to 5.2 per cent in April. The strong employment growth over the past year or so has led to a pick-up in wages growth in the private sector, although overall wages growth remains low. A further gradual lift in wages growth is expected and this would be a welcome development. Taken together, these labour market outcomes suggest that the Australian economy can sustain a lower rate of unemployment. The recent inflation outcomes have been lower than expected and suggest subdued inflationary pressures across much of the economy. Inflation is still however anticipated to pick up, and will be boosted in the June quarter by increases in petrol prices. The central scenario remains for underlying inflation to be 1\u00be per cent this year, 2 per cent in 2020 and a little higher after that. The adjustment in established housing markets is continuing, after the earlier large run-up in prices in some cities. Conditions remain soft, although in some markets the rate of price decline has slowed and auction clearance rates have increased. Growth in housing credit has also stabilised recently. Credit conditions have been tightened and the demand for credit by investors has been subdued for some time. Mortgage rates remain low and there is strong competition for borrowers of high credit quality. The governor sticks to his guns about the Australian economy, predicting that it will grow by 2.75% this year and next. Big test for those numbers tomorrow in Q1 GDP data. He says investment in roads and rail is helping but the weaker outlook for domestic demand is not helping. The central scenario remains for the Australian economy to grow by around 2\u00be per cent in 2019 and 2020. This outlook is supported by increased investment in infrastructure and a pick-up in activity in the resources sector, partly in response to an increase in the prices of Australia\u2019s exports. The main domestic uncertainty continues to be the outlook for household consumption, which is being affected by a protracted period of low income growth and declining housing prices. Some pick-up in growth in household disposable income is expected and this should support consumption. In his statement, governor Philip Lowe homes in on his two main concerns \u2013 jobs and inflation\u2013 in his up-summing: Today\u2019s decision to lower the cash rate will help make further inroads into the spare capacity in the economy. It will assist with faster progress in reducing unemployment and achieve more assured progress towards the inflation target. The Board will continue to monitor developments in the labour market closely and adjust monetary policy to support sustainable growth in the economy and the achievement of the inflation target over time. Read the statement in full here The RBA has cut rates to 1.25% It\u2019s coming ... The US dollar has continued to slip amid all that talk about a possible Fed rate cut. With the Aussie dollar downside all-but totally priced in ahead of the RBA move, that could even mean a mini rally in the Aussie today. Greg McKenna, strategist at McKenna Macro, told Reuters earlier that a Fed rate cut could be a circuit-breaker for the current gloomy market mood. Unless there\u2019s a circuit breaker, and it may come in terms of a Fed cut, or it may come in terms of more Chinese stimulus or the European Central Bank later this week ... equity prices and bond rates are going to continue to go lower. The folks at the money-saving site mozo.com.au have attempted an analysis of how much the big four banks have saved by not passing on the last rate cut in full. Here is Tom Godfrey from Mozo: We have calculated the \u2018big four\u2019 have pocketed approximately $3.6bn in revenue by not passing on the August 2016 cut in full. Also, by delaying the date at which their partial cuts in August 2016 took effect, they pulled in $7.1m per day - $113m in total. For more detail on what a cut might mean for indebted homeowners, this is a useful thing: While economists and traders will pore over the fineprint of the RBA\u2019s statement at 2.30, the impact of a rate cut on other Australians will obviosuly depend on whether you are a mortgage holder or a saver. Josh Frydenberg showed this morning that the votes are with the mortgage holders as he called on the banks to pass on any cut without delay. Borrowers with an average home loan of $400,000 would save about $58 on their monthly repayments if the cut was fully passed on. \u201cI expect all banks to pass on the benefits of sustained reductions in funding costs,\u201d the treasurer said, adding that the royal commission should remind the banks that they are on notice. \u201cThe royal commission highlighted how the culture within financial institutions needed to improve ... and how the conduct had fallen below public expectations.\u201d Lowe said in his speech (see post below) that cutting rates would also help to lift inflation. This is a crucial point. The bank is mandated to keep inflation between 2-3%, which is generally regarded as the optimum, Goldilocks level \u2013 not too high, not too low. It has failed to reach this target for more than three years but has held back from applying the obvious remedy of cutting interest rates in order to stimulate the economy and boost prices. Its reluctance was due to concern about the impact of lower rates on already-soaring house prices. Declining property values have neutralised this issue but another key measure \u2013 unemployment \u2013 has remained low enough for the bank to argue that no stimulus has been needed. A recent rise in joblessness, however, could finally be the trigger for rates to come down today. Quite why inflation has remained so stubbornly low despite a decade of cheap money in the wake of the global financial crisis has puzzled central bankers all over the western world. The conundrum is such that the US Federal Reserve is rethinking how it tackles inflation and whether it should even be that focused on the metric that has dominated conventional monetary policy since the 1970s. Quite a lot of observers now think the Fed will join the rate-cutting set soon. We\u2019re going to party like it\u2019s 2008 all over again. Bank governor Philip Lowe last month gave a very strong steer that the board would cut this time. In a speech he said that unemployment would not go down with cutting rates and said that \u201cwe will consider the case for lower interest rates\u201d. So far pretty clear cut. But an article in the Australian Financial Review yesterday set out three possible reasons why the bank might sit tight again today. If you didn\u2019t see the piece, allow me to summarise for you. The first reason is that the bank might think that if it cuts rates it will have no ammunition left to stimulate the economy if it tipsm into recession, which some think is possible later this year. Number two is that unemployment is still not rising high enough to justify a cut; the bank has consistently said that the jobs market has to weaken more in order to justify cuts. The final reason is that the RBA might think that with the Coalition back in power, its tax cuts will provide stimulus enough for the economy. Stock markets have been tumbling again across the rest of Asia Pacific as the US-China trade/tech/geopilitical standoff continues to rumble on without much propsect of a resolution. The Nikkei is down 0.6%, Hang Seng is off 0.65%, Shanghai -1% and the Kospi in Seoul is just into the red by a couple of points. It followed a volatile session on Wall Street which saw the stocks fall on weak factory data. But the Nasdaq dropped by 1.61% to 7,333.02, taking it more than 10% lower than its May 3 closing record, amid concerns that US regulators could target Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon for antitrust violations. Read the full report hewre: While the Aussie dollar dipped slightly after those retail figures, the ASX200 has remained flat as investors sit on their hands ahead of the decision at 2.30. The index is up 1.7 points, o.03%, at 6,322. Writing yesterday before the retail figures, Craig James, chief economist at Commsec Research, said there had been a lot to like about recent economic data. Company profits are at a record high, he says ,sales are growing near the fastest pace in a decade in 12 out of 15 industry sectors and wages are growing at a faster pace than the decade average. With inflation low, he says the figures mean the RBA can \u201cgo for growth\u201d by cutting rates and trying to get more people into work. Worth highlighting a chart from Greg Jericho\u2019s aforementioned article showing that profits have been rising but wages haven\u2019t kept up: The chances of a cut looked even more likely after this morning\u2019s weak retail sales figures. The release from the Australian Bureau of Statistics said that retail sales fell 0.1% in April, compared with growth of 0.2% predicted by economists. Spending on household goods fell by 0.9%, leading economists to make a direct read across to impact from the falling property market. Cafes, restaurant and takeaway food services fell 0.7%; and clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing dropped by 1.2% for the month. The falls were offset by a 0.2% lift in food retail and a healthy 1.8% rise in department store spending. The Australian dollar dipped slightly to US69.64c on the news at 11.30am although it has since moved up againto US69.73c. More or less everyone thinks today will be the day when the cash rate moves into yet more uncharted territory. All four of Australia\u2019s big banks believe that rates will fall today \u2013 and probably fall again by the end of the year. The doyen of bank economists, Bill Evans, thinks today will see the first of three rate cuts this year. JP Morgan goes further and sees the cash rate as low as 0.5% sometime next year. Westpac\u2019s Matthew Hassan believes a cut is nailed on so focuses on what a reduction in borrowing costs might mean for economic sentiment. He thinks it\u2019s going to be \u201creasonably positive\u201d and, because it is likely to be the first of several more cuts this year, \u201cthe more interesting aspect may be the extent to which a June rate cut and follow up moves in coming months generate a more sustained lift in housing related sentiment\u201d. Welcome to the live blog on the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s board meeting. It\u2019s widely expected that the board will move the cash rate for the first time since August 2016 with all signs pointing to a 0.25% reduction to 1.25% at 2.30pm today. Bloomberg says that 36 out of 38 economists polled believe that the RBA will reduce the cash rate from its current 1.5%, itself already a record low. The chances of a cut have hardened with figure this morning showing that retail sales in Australia fell by 0.1% in April. Forecasts were for the figure to rise 0.2% so that\u2019s what market experts call a big miss on the downside. More analysis of that coming up soon. We\u2019ll also be looking at whether the banks will pass on a cut to mortgage holders in the event that the RBA does reduce rates. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said this morning that banks must pass the cut on. More on that too coming up. This is all part of a big week of economic data for Australia with tomorrow seeing the release of GDP figures for the first three months of the year. For analysis of that and everything else this week you can read this excellent piece by my colleague Greg Jericho: And to get a little bit topical (apologies to readers in WA and the NT) ...",

      "body": "<p>University College London, founded nearly 200 years ago, was inspired by Jeremy Bentham, the philosopher who believed that rulers should aim for \u201cthe greatest happiness of the greatest number\u201d. Today, UCL has grown to 42,500 students with plans to recruit a further 4,000, making it the largest UK university apart from the Open University. For the past six years, Michael Arthur, the softly spoken son of a cabinet-maker and a probation service assistant, who went to a state comprehensive in Harlow, Essex, has presided over this success story as UCL\u2019s provost (vice-chancellor). But he has not achieved Bentham\u2019s goal of the \u201cgreatest happiness\u201d among UCL\u2019s 6,500 academic and research staff.</p> <p>All university leaders encounter hostility, but few can have attracted quite as much as Arthur. Some UCL academics feel such a \u201cfrenzy of hatred\u201d against him that they would prefer \u201ca blind, three-legged elephant\u201d as provost \u2013 and that judgment, in a privately circulated note last year, came from his press officer (since departed). \u201cHe\u2019s been a disaster,\u201d one academic tells me. \u201cThis was once an egalitarian, collaborative place. It has become a Stalinist institution. The whole ethos has changed.\u201d</p> <p>Another says: \u201cUCL is being run as a business, not as a university.\u201d A poll of the 1,531-strong academic board (which includes all professors plus elected members) got 724 responses, of which only 100 declared their confidence in UCL\u2019s governance. Arthur says the poll was \u201cnot properly conducted\u201d.</p> <p>Some professors took allegations of \u201cacts of improper governance and breaches of the statutes\u201d to the university Visitor, a largely ceremonial post occupied at UCL by the master of the rolls, England\u2019s second most senior judge, currently Sir Terence Etherton. In an 86-page confidential report \u2013 seen by the Guardian \u2013 he found no \u201csustained or intentional infringement\u201d of UCL\u2019s constitution but described Arthur\u2019s management style as \u201cmore top-down than that of some of his predecessors\u201d.</p> <p>On some occasions, Etherton continued, \u201cchallenge has not been received as it should have been\u201d.

      "bodyText": "University College London, founded nearly 200 years ago, was inspired by Jeremy Bentham, the philosopher who believed that rulers should aim for \u201cthe greatest happiness of the greatest number\u201d. Today, UCL has grown to 42,500 students with plans to recruit a further 4,000, making it the largest UK university apart from the Open University. For the past six years, Michael Arthur, the softly spoken son of a cabinet-maker and a probation service assistant, who went to a state comprehensive in Harlow, Essex, has presided over this success story as UCL\u2019s provost (vice-chancellor). But he has not achieved Bentham\u2019s goal of the \u201cgreatest happiness\u201d among UCL\u2019s 6,500 academic and research staff. All university leaders encounter hostility, but few can have attracted quite as much as Arthur. Some UCL academics feel such a \u201cfrenzy of hatred\u201d against him that they would prefer \u201ca blind, three-legged elephant\u201d as provost \u2013 and that judgment, in a privately circulated note last year, came from his press officer (since departed). \u201cHe\u2019s been a disaster,\u201d one academic tells me. \u201cThis was once an egalitarian, collaborative place. It has become a Stalinist institution. The whole ethos has changed.\u201d Another says: \u201cUCL is being run as a business, not as a university.\u201d A poll of the 1,531-strong academic board (which includes all professors plus elected members) got 724 responses, of which only 100 declared their confidence in UCL\u2019s governance. Arthur says the poll was \u201cnot properly conducted\u201d. Some professors took allegations of \u201cacts of improper governance and breaches of the statutes\u201d to the university Visitor, a largely ceremonial post occupied at UCL by the master of the rolls, England\u2019s second most senior judge, currently Sir Terence Etherton. In an 86-page confidential report \u2013 seen by the Guardian \u2013 he found no \u201csustained or intentional infringement\u201d of UCL\u2019s constitution but described Arthur\u2019s management style as \u201cmore top-down than that of some of his predecessors\u201d. On some occasions, Etherton continued, \u201cchallenge has not been received as it should have been\u201d. There was \u201ca loss of trust and morale\u201d among \u201ca significant number\u201d of academics (though not a majority) and that \u201ccannot be simply ignored\u201d. The academics\u2019 complaints are wide-ranging and some date back to 2015, when the Nobel prize-winning biochemist Sir Tim Hunt resigned his UCL honorary professorship after comments made about his \u201ctrouble with girls\u201d. Hunt\u2019s supporters said the university, anxious to protect its \u201cbrand\u201d, created an unnecessary fuss and gave Hunt no option but to step down. \u201cArthur was extremely unpleasant to him,\u201d said one insider. \u201cHe was given no opportunity to explain himself.\u201d Arthur replies: \u201cI am confident we accepted a genuine resignation.\u201d But the nub of the grievances concerns UCL\u2019s expansion \u2013 and particularly plans for a \u00a3516m, 11-acre second campus at the Olympic Park in Stratford, six miles east of the site it has occupied since 1826 in Bloomsbury, traditionally London\u2019s academic and high cultural heart. The first hole in the ground for UCL East has just been dug, Arthur tells me when we meet in his awesomely spacious office. Arthur has big ideas for the future: a school of politics and public policy to rival the Kennedy School of Government in the US; a school of \u201cthe health of the public\u201d; a business school for the real estate industry (\u201cfor estate agents?\u201d I ask; \u201cdefinitely not for estate agents\u201d, he says firmly). UCL, having recently swallowed the London University Institute of Education, will then cover just about all human knowledge and activity except theology and performing arts. But isn\u2019t UCL too big already? \u201cWe want to be a global player,\u201d says Arthur. \u201cRound the world, you\u2019re seeing universities of 90,000, 100,000 students. If you have critical mass, you can create outstanding cross-disciplinary research on things like climate change. You can do research that makes a difference.\u201d He mentions a treatment recently developed at UCL that makes HIV, the virus that causes Aids, untransmittable. If UCL didn\u2019t increase student numbers, thus maximising fee revenue, such research would have to be cut back. \u201cTo me,\u201d Arthur says, \u201cthat is unthinkable.\u201d His opponents disagree, saying UCL should make money from research spin-offs in areas such as healthcare, not from student fees, an unpredictable source of future income, particularly if the government carries out the Augar review\u2019s proposal to cut them from \u00a39,000 a year to \u00a37,500.

      "bodyText": "Hands brushing as he picks up a water bottle. A casual chat about motorbikes at the end of night of bartending. A wink in a Sydney cinema. Fans of Keanu Reeves have been sharing stories of unexpected, fleeting interactions with the actor. The outpouring of stories intensified after a New Yorker story in which writer Naomi Fry proclaimed Reeves to be \u201ctoo good for this world\u201d and the \u201cunlikely antidote to everything wrong with the news cycle.\u201d The story ended with an endearing anecdote about the author spotting Reeves squeezing into a chair in the cheap seats at a local theatre. In a tweet, Fry dubbed him \u201cAmerica\u2019s crush\u201d, although commentators were quick to point out the Canadian/American actor, who was born in Beirut to a British mother and a Chinese-Hawaiian father, is in fact \u201cthe world\u2019s crush\u201d. Reeves is back in the spotlight thanks to his role in the new Netflix film Always be my Maybe. In the film he plays a version of himself as lead actor Ali Wong\u2019s new boyfriend, and gets to deliver lines like: \u2018The only stars that matter are the ones you look at when you dream.\u201d After the editor of the New Yorker website put out a call for Keanu Stories, fans jumped online to share their encounters. But there were already many circulating, thanks perhaps to Reeves frequently travelling alone. One Twitter user remembered meeting the actor 15 years ago after the success of The Matrix as a bartender and described the actor as \u201cthe nicest of people\u201d. \u201cWe talked guitars, motorcycles and scotch for about 30 minutes,\u201d he wrote. PJ Quint recalled bumping into him in New York City: \u201cI was almost at my apartment building in NYC, and Keanu was walking toward me. I look at him and it registered who he was, he smiled, gave a little wave and said, \u201cHey, how are you?\u201d It was a quick moment of connection, but I\u2019ve never forgotten it.\u201d This was quickly seconded by Lauren Murdoch: \u201cI had the same moment, in a restaurant in Sydney. Never forgotten it either.\u201d New Zealand actor Melanie Lynskey said she hung out on the fringes of a party with Reeves and talked about animals. \u201cHe asked if I had any photos of my dog in costume. (I did.) He seemed like a very beautiful soul from that brief interaction.\u201d Amanda Meynke said she worked with Reeves on reshoots of the John Wick film and once \u201ctold him shyly how much his work meant to me in my life.\u201d \u201cHe was incredibly kind to me, thanked me so genuinely, kissed me on the cheek.\u201d Australian author Rosie Waterland remembered when she was a struggling university student working at a Sydney cinema when Reeves appeared. Waterland was charged with escorting him to the stage and said Reeves appeared \u201cso sweet and quiet and nervous.\u201d \u201cI was holding a cinema torch and was way out of my depth. He turned to me, while an entire cinema full of people were cheering for him, and said, \u201cwish me luck\u201d and I laughed, because I didn\u2019t know how to respond to that. \u201cSo I said, \u2018you won\u2019t need it.\u2019 And he looked at me, winked, and said, \u2018wanna bet?\u2019 Then he walked down to the front of the cinema, charmed everyone in the fkn room, and left.\u201d Her story prompted a slew of replies. Amber Robinson wrote about serving Reeves at a bistro in Sydney, saying he was \u201cvery sweet and apologetic and super polite\u201d after realising there was no table service and he had to order at the counter. Karina shared her story of seeing him play in his band Dogstar in the Western Australia capital Perth in the mid 90s: \u201cHe dropped his water bottle. I picked it up, handed it to him, touched his hand. He said thank you. Bliss.\u201d",

Single people are also more likely to volunteer and to participate in social events. By contrast, married and cohabiting individuals tend to become more socially isolated, even without the excuse of children. The longitudinal nature of these data suggests this relationship is causal, with those entering marriage more likely to lose existing connections than those who do not marry.

      "bodyText": "At the Hay festival late last month, I gave a talk about my new book, Happy Ever After, which discusses happiness data surrounding relationships. My conclusion \u2013 that single women might be healthier and happier than married women and married women with children \u2013 was met with surprise from many, delight from single women and shock and even outrage from other quarters, especially on social media. Many pointed to their own experience to criticise me, saying that they \u2013 or their wives \u2013 were happier now that they were married or parents than they were when they were single. One man tweeted photos of his wife as apparent proof. I was accused of spreading propaganda. \u201cHow far will the media push this \u2018independent woman\u2019 narrative?\u201d was one popular tweet.

She said that while rulings from the human rights commission have no enforcement mechanism, they can help pressure governments to act. \u201cThe human rights system doesn\u2019t have an army, but what we know is many national courts follow that jurisprudence in their own rulings,\u201d she said. \u201cIt builds up a body of law.\u201d Gilmore described meeting with a 14-year-old girl from Nicaragua which, she said, kept her focused. The girl had two children; the eldest, aged three, was the result of rape by an uncle. Nicaragua has a complete ban on abortion, so the girl was not allowed to terminate the pregnancies. \u201cShe was threatened for asking for a termination.\u201d \u201cShe told me her story, and it\u2019s always stayed with me,\u201d said Gilmore. \u201cShe said, \u2018I\u2019m telling you because people like you make a difference, so no other girl goes through what I\u2019ve been through.\u201d That\u2019s what sits on my shoulder.\u201d",

Over the course of James\u2019 multiple emergency room visits and surgeries, hospital charges alone cost more than $956,000.</p> <p>But that hardly accounted for all bills. Physicians in Texas, even those whose specialized skills are only available in hospital settings, don\u2019t work for hospitals. They charge separately, and are exempt from not-for-profit hospital \u201ccharity\u201d policies. Feeding bags, night nurses and out-of-network providers were also their own category of bills.</p> <p>Nearly three years after James\u2019 death, the family has been unable to determine exactly how much they might owe, or have paid.</p> <p>In one typical insurance document the Cavatores received, called an \u201cexplanation of benefits\u201d by their insurance company, they were told that as of October 2016 they \u201cmay or may not have to pay\u201d $387,270.69 to doctors and hospitals.</p> <p>In March 2018, Federico was told the family\u2019s balance was \u201czeroed out\u201d.

A 38-year-old human resources worker, she had good insurance through a supportive job.</p> <p>But she found out early in the pregnancy her twins were \u201cmono-mono\u201d or \u201cmomo\u201d \u2013 short for monochorionic-monoamniotic twins who grow in the same amniotic sac.

During one of those visits, \u201cone of the hearts stopped\u201d momentarily, \u201ca few seconds\u201d. Elle was immediately sent to a hospital maternity ward, where she was on bed rest for nearly five weeks.</p> <p>One day her husband came to visit, and in hopes of private time, she asked a nurse to check the twins\u2019 vitals early.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad I did, because if I hadn\u2019t said, \u2018Do it right then\u2019, they probably would have both died,\u201d Elle said. \u201cRight at the moment she put the monitor on my stomach, she noticed one of the heart rates was going up, and accelerating and then decelerating.\u201d</p> <p>The babies\u2019 umbilical cords had twisted. With both babies in the same amniotic sack, doctors couldn\u2019t figure out which child was under stress, so they rushed to deliver. Aides cut off Elle\u2019s clothes and she was put under anesthesia for an emergency cesarean section.</p> <p>\u201cThe next thing, when I woke up, the babies had been born,\u201d said Elle. The babies were delivered at exactly 28 weeks and six days. Thomas was 2lb 9oz, and James was 2lb 12oz.</p> <p>Both babies immediately went to the neonatal intensive care unit, a hospital ward with ultra-specialized equipment and staff designed to care for tiny babies. Both breathed through tubes and lay in incubators with round-the-clock nursing. The Cavatores could not hold their children.</p> <p>It soon became apparent James was much sicker than Thomas. Within two weeks, James needed cardiac surgery to help a heart valve close, a chest tube to breathe, surgery for a tear in his intestines, and was later diagnosed with retinopathy, a condition which left him blind.</p> <p>But by far the most serious complication James faced was severe bleeding in the brain. James had a grade IV intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), a condition where tiny vessels around the brain\u2019s spinal fluid-filled areas \u2013 called ventricles \u2013 rupture.</p> <p>To relieve the condition, a shunt is placed. This is a tube which drains spinal fluid from the brain to the belly, regulating pressure. The risks accompanying these surgeries are profound.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"divider\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">divider</a> </figure>  <p><strong>The high price of caring for James</strong> quickly became apparent.</p> <p>Over the course of seven months, James underwent nearly a dozen surgeries, as his parents attempted to cope with the pressures of caring for a child with overwhelming needs and overwhelming costs.</p> <p>\u201cMy pediatrician said: \u2018You should be eligible for 24-hour nursing with the feeding tube and not being able to sleep, because you had to feed him every five hours,\u2019\u201d said Elle, \u201cBut they said we made too much money to be eligible for that. We were paying a night nurse just a couple nights a week so we could have two nights a week to sleep.\u201d</p> <p>Every feeding bag cost the family $5. They used about four a day. Then there was special formula. Once, James\u2019 two-year-old older brother pulled out one of his brother\u2019s tubes, called a Mic-Key button, and he had to be rushed to the emergency room. All of it costs money.</p> <p>\u201cThey recommended we have [physical] therapy three times a week for both [twins],\u201d said Elle. \u201cBut you only are allotted a certain number of visits [by insurance], and then you\u2019re paying out of pocket, and it\u2019s expensive, too. You want the best for your child.\u201d</p> <p>Night nurses rarely lasted two weeks. Elle suspected they were scared by the child\u2019s fragile condition. Her stepsister helped pay for medical supplies and bills.</p> <p>After three months of maternity leave \u2013 something just <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2018/06/29/493643.htm\">15% of American workers receive</a> \u2013 Cavatore left her job to care for the twins full-time. As a result, the family was forced to switch from employer-provided insurance to the individual marketplace commonly called Obamacare, a pejorative used by Republicans to describe the safety net which caught the Cavatore family.</p> <p>\u201cI was sitting outside the NICU trying to figure out what to do,\u201d said Federico, about how to pick a health insurance policy. When they switched to Obamacare, the family was suddenly forced to pay $1,600 a month to maintain health insurance. \u201cWe paid that for a year.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d36356ccf34920ec51c85cfb0b156c51b947c6f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d36356ccf34920ec51c85cfb0b156c51b947c6f5/0_116_6720_4192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elle Cavatore poses with a photo of her deceased baby, James, at her home in Houston, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elle Cavatore: \u2018We were paying a night nurse just a couple nights a week so we could have two nights a week to sleep.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Kramer/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During this time, the Cavatores said they were able to ignore the letters demanding money. But the burden became greater with the phone calls.</p> <p>\u201cI [would] just get calls from random different collectors like: \u2018You owe this from the gastroenterologist\u2019 and \u2018You owe this to the ophthalmologist\u2019,\u201d said Elle.</p> <p>\u201cIt mean it was like survival mode for us,\u201d said Federico. \u201cI felt like it was all about the money. It was a horrible experience.\u201d</p> <p>They were ripe targets for fraud. With so many bills at once, it was impossible to sort which were legitimate, which they should pay right away and which might eventually be resolved by their insurance plan.</p> <p>It was during this time some of her highest bills rolled in \u2013 including $387,270.69 from Memorial Hermann, from a time when Elle was listed as uninsured in their system.</p> <p>After months of sleeping in the NICU, bringing James to the emergency room every week or so, of sleepless nights, midnight phone calls from nurses, heart-wrenching decisions for one brutal surgery after another, James developed bacterial meningitis, which caused swelling of the tissues surrounding his brain and spinal cord.</p> <p>\u201cBy that time he was just in such bad shape. They were giving him anti-seizure medications,\u201d said Elle. \u201cHe looked so beaten and bruised up \u2026 One neurologist had given me a pretty rosy outlook.\u201d</p> <p>Then, a new doctor came in the room.</p> <p>\u201cShe just announced to us: \u2018I don\u2019t expect him to walk, talk, he is deaf, blind \u2013 I can\u2019t see why they told you that,\u2019\u201d said Elle. \u201cI just burst into tears.\u201d </p> <p>It was nearly the end of the road.</p> <p>To put their son in hospice, the Cavatores had to argue their position before the hospital\u2019s ethics board, before residents and physicians. Among the panel, just one physician wanted to operate again. Memorial Hermann would not confirm or deny this portion of the Cavatore\u2019s case, citing patient privacy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do in my life is talk about wanting to put my son in hospice</p> <footer> <cite>Federico Cavatore</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do in my life is talk about wanting to put my son in hospice,\u201d said Federico. \u201cKnowing this was the best thing for him because he was suffering, and they wanted to keep it going.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf he did have any type of life, it wasn\u2019t going to be any type of life that anybody was going to want to live, and it was going to be a year or two years,\u201d he added. </p> <p>While James was in hospice, the Cavatores received a statement from their insurance company, saying they \u201cowe or already paid\u201d $306,357.75. The company would not pay the claims because, the statement said, because \u201cthis dependent is not enrolled under this plan.

Nearly one-third of Americans who have employer-sponsored health insurance are underinsured, according to a <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/press-release/2019/underinsured-rate-rose-2014-2018-greatest-growth-among-people-employer-health\">report from the Commonwealth Fund</a>. About half struggle to pay medical bills, and 41% delayed going to the doctor.</p> <p>The Cavatores\u2019 bills were a combination of deductibles, co-payments and \u201csurprise bills\u201d. Each year, the couple paid $10,000<strong> </strong>in deductibles, a one-time payment required before insurance even kicks in.</p> <p>Because they also switched insurance early in the year after Elle quit her job to care for her son, which sponsored the family\u2019s insurance, they had to pay an additional $10,000<strong> </strong>deductible for a new insurance plan the family purchased.</p> <p>In addition, they had to pay \u201csurprise bills\u201d, or the cost of healthcare providers their insurance did not cover. Even though the family had insurance, hospitals and doctors negotiate separately with insurance, meaning families can often go to a hospital covered by their insurance, and see a doctor who is not.</p> <p>The problem is so acute in Texas, a remarkable alliance of insurance companies and consumers groups came together to <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Coalition-of-insurance-business-and-consumer-13609469.php\">ask lawmakers to protect consumers</a>. In some cases, people even hire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/16/why-does-it-cost-32093-just-to-give-birth-in-america\">professional medical billing negotiators</a> to try to resolve these bills.</p> <p>In addition to these expenses, the Cavatores\u2019 insurance switch complicated matters. Some hospital charges appeared to be billed to an old insurance plan, rather than their new one, causing confusion and resulting in bills which it is still unclear whether they are paid today.</p> <p>Those who buy insurance through Obamacare marketplaces, which the law set up for people who can\u2019t get insurance through an employer, are even more likely to be underinsured.</p> <p>There have been repeated warning calls about families facing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2018/jan/16/bankrupted-by-giving-birth-having-premature-twins-cost-me-everything\">mountainous bills</a> after having a premature child.</p> <p>As estimated 380,000 babies per year are born prematurely in the United States, about half of them to mothers on Medicaid, reserved for disabled and low-income Americans. Mothers on Medicaid are highly unlikely to receive any hospital bills.</p> <p>For those with private insurance or uninsured patients, it is a different story.</p> <p>\u201cThe question we face in America, like every other industrialized country and a lot of non-industrialized nations: do we collectively want to spend the money it takes to save these tiny babies? And if so, can we develop a system of financing that\u2019s fair?\u201d said Lantos.</p> <p>\u201cMost other countries in Europe have NICUs that are every bit as good as ours \u2013 nobody gets a bill,\u201d said Lantos. \u201cWe in American take a different approach.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>This article was amended on 4 June 2019 to correct the birth month for Thomas and James Cavatore.</em></p></li> </ul>",

The Cavatores were hit with \u201csurprise bills\u201d, expenses for medical supplies, co-payments and deductibles, and calls from bill collectors. James\u2019 birth and treatment probably cost the family close to $38,000 out-of-pocket, though they were served with bills charging them many times that amount, forcing them to spend hours challenging the claims and bringing their financial costs down, even as their emotional costs spiraled upwards. Even now, nearly three years after James\u2019 death, it is unclear whether the family still owes money to doctors and the hospital where James was treated, Memorial Hermann. Their story is emblematic of America\u2019s deeply flawed healthcare system, similar versions of which play out every day, in every corner of the country. \u201cAlmost everything in health economics in the US is complex, difficult to explain and somewhat arbitrary and idiosyncratic,\u201d said Dr John Lantos, a bioethicist and expert in neonatal intensive care units. In the US health system, \u201ceverybody\u2019s always getting ridiculous bills that they thought were covered by their insurance\u201d, said Lantos. \u201cI never pay attention to any medical bills I get for six months, because it seems like it takes that long for the hospital to deal with the doctor.\u201d James\u2019 first stint in NICU lasted 99 days, from his birth in December to April 2016, and cost more than $774,000 for hospital facility charges alone. Over the course of James\u2019 multiple emergency room visits and surgeries, hospital charges alone cost more than $956,000. But that hardly accounted for all bills. Physicians in Texas, even those whose specialized skills are only available in hospital settings, don\u2019t work for hospitals. They charge separately, and are exempt from not-for-profit hospital \u201ccharity\u201d policies. Feeding bags, night nurses and out-of-network providers were also their own category of bills. Nearly three years after James\u2019 death, the family has been unable to determine exactly how much they might owe, or have paid. In one typical insurance document the Cavatores received, called an \u201cexplanation of benefits\u201d by their insurance company, they were told that as of October 2016 they \u201cmay or may not have to pay\u201d $387,270.69 to doctors and hospitals. In March 2018, Federico was told the family\u2019s balance was \u201czeroed out\u201d. As recently as January 2019, Elle Cavatore said she received a phone call from Memorial Hermann asking for $11,000 for the twins\u2019 care. The hospital offered a \u201cpayment plan\u201d. Insurance documents described bills for hundreds of thousands of dollars the family \u201cmay or may not have to pay\u201d. \u201cI need to close it in my own mind, and move on from this, but it\u2019s continuous,\u201d Federico said. The Guardian could not determine an exact amount the Cavatores may owe because of restrictions on patient records and the large number of providers involved in their case. Although the Cavatores gave the Guardian access to hospital records to tell this story, Memorial Hermann declined to comment, citing patient privacy. \u201cWhile we are unable to comment specifically due to patient privacy, we express our deepest sympathies for the loss this family has suffered,\u201d Memorial Hermann Health System said in a statement. \u201cWe recognize that healthcare billing can be complex and, like many health systems, we are committed to helping patients and their families better navigate the billing process and to making care more affordable for all.\u201d The Cavatores\u2019 journey began when Elle found out she was pregnant. A 38-year-old human resources worker, she had good insurance through a supportive job. But she found out early in the pregnancy her twins were \u201cmono-mono\u201d or \u201cmomo\u201d \u2013 short for monochorionic-monoamniotic twins who grow in the same amniotic sac. James and Thomas were so close in the womb her obstetrician initially thought they were conjoined, Elle said. \u201cThey were nervous enough to have me go in for monitoring,\u201d said Elle. During one of those visits, \u201cone of the hearts stopped\u201d momentarily, \u201ca few seconds\u201d. Elle was immediately sent to a hospital maternity ward, where she was on bed rest for nearly five weeks. One day her husband came to visit, and in hopes of private time, she asked a nurse to check the twins\u2019 vitals early. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I did, because if I hadn\u2019t said, \u2018Do it right then\u2019, they probably would have both died,\u201d Elle said. \u201cRight at the moment she put the monitor on my stomach, she noticed one of the heart rates was going up, and accelerating and then decelerating.\u201d The babies\u2019 umbilical cords had twisted. With both babies in the same amniotic sack, doctors couldn\u2019t figure out which child was under stress, so they rushed to deliver. Aides cut off Elle\u2019s clothes and she was put under anesthesia for an emergency cesarean section. \u201cThe next thing, when I woke up, the babies had been born,\u201d said Elle. The babies were delivered at exactly 28 weeks and six days. Thomas was 2lb 9oz, and James was 2lb 12oz. Both babies immediately went to the neonatal intensive care unit, a hospital ward with ultra-specialized equipment and staff designed to care for tiny babies. Both breathed through tubes and lay in incubators with round-the-clock nursing. The Cavatores could not hold their children. It soon became apparent James was much sicker than Thomas. Within two weeks, James needed cardiac surgery to help a heart valve close, a chest tube to breathe, surgery for a tear in his intestines, and was later diagnosed with retinopathy, a condition which left him blind. But by far the most serious complication James faced was severe bleeding in the brain. James had a grade IV intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), a condition where tiny vessels around the brain\u2019s spinal fluid-filled areas \u2013 called ventricles \u2013 rupture. To relieve the condition, a shunt is placed. This is a tube which drains spinal fluid from the brain to the belly, regulating pressure. The risks accompanying these surgeries are profound. The high price of caring for James quickly became apparent. Over the course of seven months, James underwent nearly a dozen surgeries, as his parents attempted to cope with the pressures of caring for a child with overwhelming needs and overwhelming costs. \u201cMy pediatrician said: \u2018You should be eligible for 24-hour nursing with the feeding tube and not being able to sleep, because you had to feed him every five hours,\u2019\u201d said Elle, \u201cBut they said we made too much money to be eligible for that. We were paying a night nurse just a couple nights a week so we could have two nights a week to sleep.\u201d Every feeding bag cost the family $5. They used about four a day. Then there was special formula. Once, James\u2019 two-year-old older brother pulled out one of his brother\u2019s tubes, called a Mic-Key button, and he had to be rushed to the emergency room. All of it costs money. \u201cThey recommended we have [physical] therapy three times a week for both [twins],\u201d said Elle. \u201cBut you only are allotted a certain number of visits [by insurance], and then you\u2019re paying out of pocket, and it\u2019s expensive, too. You want the best for your child.\u201d Night nurses rarely lasted two weeks. Elle suspected they were scared by the child\u2019s fragile condition. Her stepsister helped pay for medical supplies and bills. After three months of maternity leave \u2013 something just 15% of American workers receive \u2013 Cavatore left her job to care for the twins full-time. As a result, the family was forced to switch from employer-provided insurance to the individual marketplace commonly called Obamacare, a pejorative used by Republicans to describe the safety net which caught the Cavatore family. \u201cI was sitting outside the NICU trying to figure out what to do,\u201d said Federico, about how to pick a health insurance policy. When they switched to Obamacare, the family was suddenly forced to pay $1,600 a month to maintain health insurance. \u201cWe paid that for a year.\u201d During this time, the Cavatores said they were able to ignore the letters demanding money. But the burden became greater with the phone calls. \u201cI [would] just get calls from random different collectors like: \u2018You owe this from the gastroenterologist\u2019 and \u2018You owe this to the ophthalmologist\u2019,\u201d said Elle. \u201cIt mean it was like survival mode for us,\u201d said Federico. \u201cI felt like it was all about the money. It was a horrible experience.\u201d They were ripe targets for fraud. With so many bills at once, it was impossible to sort which were legitimate, which they should pay right away and which might eventually be resolved by their insurance plan. It was during this time some of her highest bills rolled in \u2013 including $387,270.69 from Memorial Hermann, from a time when Elle was listed as uninsured in their system. After months of sleeping in the NICU, bringing James to the emergency room every week or so, of sleepless nights, midnight phone calls from nurses, heart-wrenching decisions for one brutal surgery after another, James developed bacterial meningitis, which caused swelling of the tissues surrounding his brain and spinal cord. \u201cBy that time he was just in such bad shape. They were giving him anti-seizure medications,\u201d said Elle. \u201cHe looked so beaten and bruised up \u2026 One neurologist had given me a pretty rosy outlook.\u201d Then, a new doctor came in the room. \u201cShe just announced to us: \u2018I don\u2019t expect him to walk, talk, he is deaf, blind \u2013 I can\u2019t see why they told you that,\u2019\u201d said Elle. \u201cI just burst into tears.\u201d It was nearly the end of the road. To put their son in hospice, the Cavatores had to argue their position before the hospital\u2019s ethics board, before residents and physicians. Among the panel, just one physician wanted to operate again. Memorial Hermann would not confirm or deny this portion of the Cavatore\u2019s case, citing patient privacy. \u201cThe hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do in my life is talk about wanting to put my son in hospice,\u201d said Federico. \u201cKnowing this was the best thing for him because he was suffering, and they wanted to keep it going.\u201d \u201cIf he did have any type of life, it wasn\u2019t going to be any type of life that anybody was going to want to live, and it was going to be a year or two years,\u201d he added. While James was in hospice, the Cavatores received a statement from their insurance company, saying they \u201cowe or already paid\u201d $306,357.75. The company would not pay the claims because, the statement said, because \u201cthis dependent is not enrolled under this plan. If you can verify this dependent was effective at the time of service(s), we will reconsider this claim.\u201d James died two days later, on 25 July 2016. The heroic task of caring for their son was finally over. But the bills resulting from that care were only beginning. The Cavatores\u2019 collision of tragedy and financial strife related to medical bills is not uncommon. It is a feature of the middle class. More than 150 million Americans get health insurance through an employer. Although Obamacare helped expand insurance coverage in 2014, it did little to reform employer-sponsored insurance. Now, coverage among this group appears to be eroding. Nearly one-third of Americans who have employer-sponsored health insurance are underinsured, according to a report from the Commonwealth Fund. About half struggle to pay medical bills, and 41% delayed going to the doctor. The Cavatores\u2019 bills were a combination of deductibles, co-payments and \u201csurprise bills\u201d. Each year, the couple paid $10,000 in deductibles, a one-time payment required before insurance even kicks in. Because they also switched insurance early in the year after Elle quit her job to care for her son, which sponsored the family\u2019s insurance, they had to pay an additional $10,000 deductible for a new insurance plan the family purchased. In addition, they had to pay \u201csurprise bills\u201d, or the cost of healthcare providers their insurance did not cover. Even though the family had insurance, hospitals and doctors negotiate separately with insurance, meaning families can often go to a hospital covered by their insurance, and see a doctor who is not. The problem is so acute in Texas, a remarkable alliance of insurance companies and consumers groups came together to ask lawmakers to protect consumers. In some cases, people even hire professional medical billing negotiators to try to resolve these bills. In addition to these expenses, the Cavatores\u2019 insurance switch complicated matters. Some hospital charges appeared to be billed to an old insurance plan, rather than their new one, causing confusion and resulting in bills which it is still unclear whether they are paid today. Those who buy insurance through Obamacare marketplaces, which the law set up for people who can\u2019t get insurance through an employer, are even more likely to be underinsured. There have been repeated warning calls about families facing mountainous bills after having a premature child. As estimated 380,000 babies per year are born prematurely in the United States, about half of them to mothers on Medicaid, reserved for disabled and low-income Americans. Mothers on Medicaid are highly unlikely to receive any hospital bills. For those with private insurance or uninsured patients, it is a different story. \u201cThe question we face in America, like every other industrialized country and a lot of non-industrialized nations: do we collectively want to spend the money it takes to save these tiny babies? And if so, can we develop a system of financing that\u2019s fair?\u201d said Lantos. \u201cMost other countries in Europe have NICUs that are every bit as good as ours \u2013 nobody gets a bill,\u201d said Lantos. \u201cWe in American take a different approach.\u201d This article was amended on 4 June 2019 to correct the birth month for Thomas and James Cavatore.",

The council\u2019s overall budget has fallen 14% in actual terms over that time as central government funding shrank from \u00a355m in 2013-14 to \u00a310m in 2019-20. Productivity is lower than the rest of the UK and more of its working age people have no formal qualifications than the national average.</p>\n    <p>In the last 15 years there has been considerable migration from eastern Europe, including the Baltic states, joining longer established British Asian groups that make up almost 12% of the population, above the average of almost 8% for England. The extent of eastern European immigration is reflected in the nearly 11% of the population that identified as \u201cother white\u201d in the 2011 census, compared with 4.6% for England.</p>\n    <p>Since the May 2019 local elections, the council has been in no overall control, but is led by the Conservatives, which retain the most seats. The last parliamentary election in 2017 was won by Labour with 48.1% of the vote, beating the incumbent Conservatives by just 607 votes. The Lib Dems were on 3.3% and the Greens on 1.8%.

      "bodyText": "At election time, political parties have long tried to woo the mythical \u201cwhite-van man\u201d: the working-class, self-motivated, but low-income voter. At the 2014 Rochester byelection, Labour\u2019s Emily Thornberry was forced to resign from the shadow cabinet for tweeting a \u201ccondescending\u201d picture of a house flying multiple St George\u2019s cross flags with a white van parked in front. At the EU referendum, Boris Johnson made a play for white-van man by promising Brexit meant cheaper fuel. In Peterborough\u2019s parliamentary byelection on Thursday, this voting demographic will have another big say, but its members are not in an upbeat mood. Between 2009 and 2017, average wages in the Cambridgeshire city slid by 13% in real terms \u2013 a \u00a34,000 loss that few can afford. Their response on Thursday could take the form of an \u201cup yours\u201d to politics. \u201cI will not be voting,\u201d said Marc Cornell, 62, who delivers parcels 12 hours a day in his white Mercedes Sprinter for a courier company. \u201cIf we end up having another referendum I will never vote on anything again. I think it\u2019s pointless.\u201d Cornell earns the equivalent of the minimum wage but because he is among the estimated 1.1 million gig economy workers in the UK, he receives no sick pay, no pension and no paid leave. He has not taken a holiday in six years and has little more than the state pension to look forward to. \u201cIf there was something else out there I would be gone in a shot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economy is not working for people like me. The government has allowed this and it just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d He complained of an absence of dignity in the gig economy. \u201cYou are just treated like a number,\u201d he said. He voted leave and normally votes Conservative, but has lost faith that Brexit is a good idea. Cornell and the rest of his family are fairly typical of workers in Peterborough these days: hard-working, low-paid and often in precarious employment. They rent their family home on an estate and rents have been rising. His wife, Susanne, works in a local care home and his son, Max, 23, has worked in Amazon\u2019s vast distribution warehouse, one of Peterborough\u2019s biggest employers. Covering 5 hectares (12 acres), it employs 1,000 people all year round and more than 1,000 more temporarily at peak periods. Max \u201chated every minute of it\u201d. Max voted remain and will vote Labour on Thursday, but he also feels uneasy about the future. \u201c[Amazon] was the only job I\u2019ve had where I didn\u2019t feel like a person, I felt like a sheep,\u201d he said. He described being accosted in the toilet by security guards after he made a couple of trips to check a football score on his phone. The trade union GMB mounted protests outside Amazon last November to coincide with the Black Friday peak period, with banners that read: \u201cWe are not robots.\u201d Amazon said it offered \u201cindustry-leading pay, comprehensive benefits and career growth opportunities, all while working in a safe, modern work environment\u201d. But Max Cornell doesn\u2019t see any future for himself in Peterborough, or even the UK. \u201cThe only jobs available for people my age are call centre, retail or warehouse,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way this country is going.\u201d He now works for Addison Lee, a minicab firm which also relies on gig economy drivers. The most visible change to working life in Peterborough has been net migration into the city from abroad, running at around 2,000 people a year for the last decade, bringing the non-British population to 16% by the end of 2017, compared with 10% across England. Shops named Bucharest Mini Market, the Baltic Store, the Mercearia Portuguesa and the Kabul Food Store line the Lincoln Road. The changes have upset some long-term residents. However, the quality of work and the large number of low-autonomy, low-paid jobs in the city is at least as much of a worry as the headline-grabbing issue of immigration. Alongside Amazon, Peterborough\u2019s biggest employers include Perkins, an engine manufacturer, owned by the US firm Caterpillar, which employs around 2,500 people, and BGL, which owns the Compare the Market insurance brand. The council has invested in improving Peterborough\u2019s attractive historic centre but its fabric quickly frays into betting shops, pawnbrokers and discount stores. Workers have below-average levels of vocational training and efforts are under way to try and reshape the economy. A new university is planned, while a closed M&amp;S in the city centre is being turned into 98 apartments, and car parks are being earmarked for new offices to lure tech companies wanting to connect with Google and Facebook, headquartered an hour away by train in King\u2019s Cross, London. \u201cWe need all of our residents, including those that have lived here for a long time, to benefit from the opportunities,\u201d said Tom Hennessy, the chief executive of Opportunity Peterborough, the city\u2019s economic development company. \u201cThere is a feeling that some have not and this in turn can lead to feelings of disconnect from the rest of society.\u201d Carl Mings, another courier, moved from a staff job at Parcel Force hoping the gig economy would offer a reward for hard work. Mings, who asked to use a pseudonym because he feared speaking out could cost him work, started earning more than \u00a32 a parcel but is now on 15% less. \u201cThey don\u2019t want you winning,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have no employment rights. The government needs to sort this out but they haven\u2019t sorted Brexit out. This charade has been going on for three years. They have wasted all that time.\u201d He is among those who watched closely as Theresa May made her maiden speech as prime minister in 2016, promising to rule on behalf of the \u201cjust managing\u201d. And then he watched as in 2018 she promised to crack down on bogus self-employment in the gig economy and boost workers\u2019 rights. But little had happened, he said. His pessimism was not shared by Sorin Ciobotaru, 36, a lorry driver from Romania, who has lived in Peterborough for three years with his partner, Mirela, 31, and their infant daughter. \u201cLife is what you make it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe minimum wage is going up. If you want to work you can find a job. It\u2019s only hard if you don\u2019t want to work and drink beer every day. Everyone wants a better job, but you have to start from the bottom.\u201d Even so, Ciobotaru is considering moving back to Bucharest at some point, while Mings remains. Toiling in the gig economy has meant he has developed no new skills, and now he feels trapped. \u201cThe only opportunity is packing fruit in a box in a factory,\u201d said Mings. \u201cYou make as much as you can now, because tomorrow you know it is going to get bleaker. It shouldn\u2019t be like that. There\u2019s no hope. People don\u2019t feel they have a stake in society.\u201d",

Three-quarters of them favour a no-deal exit \u2013 far ahead of any other option. It is not just that they fear the Brexit party. They want to be the Brexit party. They long for the simplicity of Farage\u2019s demagoguery, the uncomplicated fervour of his rallies. After three years of parliamentary drudgery, they crave the politics of spectacle, excitement and tub-thumping vindication \u2026 It is extraordinary to think that, not so very long ago, the Conservatives considered themselves \u2013 with statistics on their side \u2013 as the \u201cnatural party of government\u201d. Now they more closely resemble a herd of lemmings, squeaking furiously about who should lead them to oblivion. How noisy the Tories have become, and how small.</p> </blockquote> <p>And the historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/02/britain-cant-be-reborn-while-while-were-still-lost-fantasies-about-past\">David Olusoga says Britain cannot be reborn</a> while it is lost in fantasies of the past:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If, on 31 October 2019, the fanatics and the Faragists win and we crash out of the EU, that moment, when the borders close, and the markets open, and the truth sinks in, will not be Britain\u2019s \u201cIndependence Day\u201d. A hard Brexit would be so damaging to the true interests of the UK that what might follow \u2013 if we are lucky \u2013 is a great unmasking, not just of the political fantasists and chancers who peddled the great Brexit swindle, but of the historical delusion that empowered them. The most extreme among the Brexiters are convinced they can ride the chaos and deploy the \u201cshock doctrine\u201d to remake the nation in their ideological image. But awoken from our dreamtimes by the smelling salts of economic reality, Britain might go the other way and begin the process that would see us start to decolonise our history and our self-image. Through such a process, Britain would, in effect, become the last country to leave the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/british-empire\">British empire</a>. No matter what happens at Halloween, the dangers of England\u2019s dreaming are surely now clear and manifest.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Top tweet</h2> <p>Liverpool supporters celebrate their Champions League win:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/stefwig/status/1135533712945418240\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Liverpool?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Liverpool</a> supportes didn&#39;t miss their chance to spread their <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#brexit</a> view.<br>Great stuff! <a href=\"https://t.co/toj6VvNmgx\">pic.twitter.com/toj6VvNmgx</a></p>&mdash; SteWig (@stefwig) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stefwig/status/1135533712945418240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 3, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>",

All the rest are busy telling Conservative members, 76% of whom favour a no-deal Brexit, that that\u2019s precisely what they\u2019re prepared to deliver if necessary. Among them, Andrea Leadsom promised it would be \u201cmanaged\u201d, something of an oxymoron. Dominic Raab is so gung-ho about no deal that a \u201cStop Raab\u201d campaign has been launched by Tory moderates, and Sajid Javid is also prepared to leave without a deal, ruling out a second referendum, general election or revoking article 50. Moderates are alarmed: Amber Rudd warned candidates against backing no deal; Philip Hammond said backing no deal would mean losing a no-confidence vote; Jeremy Hunt sought the middle line, saying he would back no deal \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d. UK manufacturers added their weight to the warnings, describing a no deal as \u201ceconomic lunacy\u201d following the news that British car production had plunged amid the \u201cuntold damage\u201d of the chaos surrounding Britain\u2019s exit date. Top scientists warned of a \u201cmajor blow\u201d to national science if ministers could not secure access to a vast EU research programme, and Elton John said he was ashamed of Britain and was \u201ca European, not a stupid, colonial, imperialist English idiot\u201d. After briefly attempting clarity on a second public vote, meanwhile, Labour appeared to backtrack somewhat, with Jeremy Corbyn saying a second referendum was \u201csome way off\u201d and that Labour still wanted to negotiate a better Brexit deal. What next Nothing has materially changed, so see last week\u2019s \u201cWhat next\u201d. Much could obviously depend on who becomes the the next Conservative leader and prime minister; my colleague Peter Walker has a useful look at the runners and riders \u2013 and their odds at the bookies. Best of the rest UK factory output shrinks on back of Brexit uncertainty More EU citizens are seeking help for stress and anxiety over Brexit Trouble brews at the court of King Corbyn Donald Trump: send in Nigel Farage to negotiate with the EU Conservative MP Phillip Lee loses vote of no confidence Brexit too complicated for referendum, says Jared Diamond UK consumer borrowing sees lowest rise since 2014 on Brexit fears EU citizens in UK at risk of Windrush-style catastrophe, say MPs EU chief negotiator blames Brexit on \u2018nostalgia for the past\u2019 John Bercow staying on as Speaker \u2018may not be enough to stop no-deal\u2019 EU promotes deputy Brexit negotiator to senior trade job Labour chair: some remainers are sneering at ordinary people EU students will not face Brexit penalty next year Top comments In the Guardian, Matthew d\u2019Ancona bemoans what Brexit has done to the Tory party: Tory members have drunk the Kool-Aid when it comes to Brexit: for them, it has ceased to be a geopolitical and commercial process and become a religion. Three-quarters of them favour a no-deal exit \u2013 far ahead of any other option. It is not just that they fear the Brexit party. They want to be the Brexit party. They long for the simplicity of Farage\u2019s demagoguery, the uncomplicated fervour of his rallies. After three years of parliamentary drudgery, they crave the politics of spectacle, excitement and tub-thumping vindication \u2026 It is extraordinary to think that, not so very long ago, the Conservatives considered themselves \u2013 with statistics on their side \u2013 as the \u201cnatural party of government\u201d. Now they more closely resemble a herd of lemmings, squeaking furiously about who should lead them to oblivion. How noisy the Tories have become, and how small. And the historian David Olusoga says Britain cannot be reborn while it is lost in fantasies of the past: If, on 31 October 2019, the fanatics and the Faragists win and we crash out of the EU, that moment, when the borders close, and the markets open, and the truth sinks in, will not be Britain\u2019s \u201cIndependence Day\u201d. A hard Brexit would be so damaging to the true interests of the UK that what might follow \u2013 if we are lucky \u2013 is a great unmasking, not just of the political fantasists and chancers who peddled the great Brexit swindle, but of the historical delusion that empowered them. The most extreme among the Brexiters are convinced they can ride the chaos and deploy the \u201cshock doctrine\u201d to remake the nation in their ideological image. But awoken from our dreamtimes by the smelling salts of economic reality, Britain might go the other way and begin the process that would see us start to decolonise our history and our self-image. Through such a process, Britain would, in effect, become the last country to leave the British empire. No matter what happens at Halloween, the dangers of England\u2019s dreaming are surely now clear and manifest. Top tweet Liverpool supporters celebrate their Champions League win:",

The legal change is in response to a case last year in which a Melbourne reproductive clinic told a woman that under Victoria\u2019s Assisted Reproductive Treatment Act, she first needed her estranged husband\u2019s consent. The 45-year-old woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had been separated and living apart from her husband since late 2017. The matter was urgent because patients were generally able to use their own eggs in an IVF procedure only when they are younger than 46. The woman took her case to the federal court and the judge ruled in her favour. Lawyers from Maurice Blackburn, who represented the woman, relied on Victoria\u2019s Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act to argue she had a right not to be discriminated against based on her marital status. During the court case, the clinic, Melbourne IVF, said it had no objection to offering the treatment to the woman without her husband\u2019s consent if the court found it was legal to do so. Justice John Griffiths ordered that the woman could undergo IVF without consent and declared parts of the Victorian laws were \u201cinvalid and inoperable\u201d. Victorian Assisted Reproductive Treatment Authority chief executive Louise Johnson said divorce proceedings could take a long period of time, which some women trying to conceive did not have. \u201cI recently had a phone call from a clinic telling me that a single woman, who was going through a divorce and separated, was considering travelling interstate for treatment,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhen it comes to fertility treatment, time matters.

It is an astonishingly low number.</p> <p>By way of context, when John Howard and the Liberal party bragged, during the 2004 election, of keeping interest rates at record lows, the cash rate was 5.25% and the record low reached in early 2002 was 4.25%.</p> <p>No one should be bragging about this number \u2013 not the government, nor the Reserve Bank.</p> <p>Cutting the rate ensures the cash rate should remain below the inflation rate \u2013 meaning the rate is negative in real terms \u2013 a rarity in our history:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"cash rate\">  <iframe title=\"Cash rate\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qryfC/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Even during the global financial crisis the cash rate stayed generally 1% above the inflation rate. Having to cut it so low during a period when the economy is growing (albeit slowly) and unemployment is just above 5% is a pretty sad indictment of how the economy has been handled.</p> <p>Nothing in the <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/2019/mr-19-15.html\">governor\u2019s statement</a> justifying the rate cut could not have been said last month.</p> <p>He noted that \u201cemployment growth has been strong over the past year, labour force participation has been increasing, the vacancy rate remains high and there are reports of skills shortages in some areas. Despite these developments, there has been little further inroads into the spare capacity in the labour market of late.\u201d</p> <p>When he talks of spare capacity he means underutilisation \u2013 those either unemployed or those seeking more work. Currently the rate is 13.7% seasonally adjusted, and it has been rising since February.</p> <p>Historically, inflation growth doesn\u2019t begin to accelerate until the underutilisation rate gets near 11%, so we had a long way to go before the RBA needed to worry about triggering an inflation spike:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Underutilisation rate\">  <iframe title=\"Underutilisation rate\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Mjjho/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The governor\u2019s statement also noted that \u201cthe recent inflation outcomes have been lower than expected and suggest subdued inflationary pressures across much of the economy\u201d.</p> <p>Given that the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2019/apr/24/the-economy-is-struggling-and-the-election-campaign-needs-to-start-facing-up-to-it\">CPI figures</a> came out on 24 April \u2013 two weeks before the RBA board met in May \u2013 showed core inflation growth at 1.6% and CPI growth at 1.3%, I\u2019m not sure what other signs they were waiting for:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual inflation rate\">  <iframe title=\"Annual inflation growth\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JcKje/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It would seem the decision not to cut rates in May was a political decision \u2013 in that the bank did not wish to be seen to be interfering in an election campaign.</p> <p>The government, while it may take some solace from the fact the bank ensured it did not have to respond to suggestions the economy was faltering so badly the RBA needed to cut rates to a previously unheard of level, should still feel a great deal of shame at this rate.</p> <p>It has boasted about a strong economy, when plainly it is not so. It has also chosen to keep to the surplus mania at a time when the economy was crying out for fiscal stimulus to help reduce spare capacity and get wages rising.</p> <p>Instead it has left it all to the Reserve Bank, and is hoping that there are businesses and people out there who were thinking about borrowing, but decided the previous low rates were not enough to entice them, and that this extra 0.25% off the rate is enough to do so.</p> <p>The issue of course is whether the banks will pass on the full amount.</p> <p>They should. As the governor noted: \u201cIn Australia, long-term bond yields are at historically low levels. Bank funding costs have also declined further, with money-market spreads having fully reversed the increases that took place last year.\u201d</p> <p>Yes short-term funding costs for banks did spike last year, but they are now back at previous levels:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Cost of banks' short-term debt\">  <iframe title=\"Cost of banks' short-term debt\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GE54r/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The rate banks are offering for term deposits above the cash rate is now lower than it was when the RBA last cut rates in 2016 \u2013 meaning the cost of long-term borrowing is also reduced:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Term deposit rates and the cash rate\">  <iframe title=\"Term deposit rates and the cash rate\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pttKk/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That the ANZ is only cutting its mortgage rates by 17 basis points rather than the full 25 is a disgrace.</p> <p>Over the past decade the gap between mortgage rates and small business loan rates offered by banks and the cash rate have grown ever larger:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Gap between mortgage &amp; small business loan rates &amp; cash rate\">  <iframe title=\"Gap between mortgage &amp; small business loan rates &amp; cash rate\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aYxvb/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The only small thing in the banks favour is that over the past two years the average mortgage rate of all owner-occupier home loans has fallen while the rate offered has gone up \u2013 meaning people are starting to negotiate better rates:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Owner-occupier mortgage rates since August 2016\">  <iframe title=\"Owner-occupier mortgage rates since August 2016\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/e2lcg/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But that is no excuse for not cutting rates by the full amount.</p> <p>It also goes to the problem of using monetary policy to stimulate the economy \u2013 you need the banks to play along. I suspect this cut and the banks\u2019 reaction will mean further cuts are still to come \u2013 something the market was predicting before this announcement.</p> <p>The market was fully pricing in another cut to 1.0% by October and around an 80% chance of a further cut to 0.75% by this time next year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Market expectations of the RBA cash rate (3 June)\">  <iframe title=\"Market expectations of the RBA cash rate (3 June)\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uJ286/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>If that happens it will mean the economy remains very much in the doldrums, and the government\u2019s chances of actually delivering a budget surplus will be almost as low as the interest rates.</p> <p>\u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia</p>",

By way of context, when John Howard and the Liberal party bragged, during the 2004 election, of keeping interest rates at record lows, the cash rate was 5.25% and the record low reached in early 2002 was 4.25%. No one should be bragging about this number \u2013 not the government, nor the Reserve Bank. Cutting the rate ensures the cash rate should remain below the inflation rate \u2013 meaning the rate is negative in real terms \u2013 a rarity in our history: Even during the global financial crisis the cash rate stayed generally 1% above the inflation rate. Having to cut it so low during a period when the economy is growing (albeit slowly) and unemployment is just above 5% is a pretty sad indictment of how the economy has been handled. Nothing in the governor\u2019s statement justifying the rate cut could not have been said last month. He noted that \u201cemployment growth has been strong over the past year, labour force participation has been increasing, the vacancy rate remains high and there are reports of skills shortages in some areas. Despite these developments, there has been little further inroads into the spare capacity in the labour market of late.\u201d When he talks of spare capacity he means underutilisation \u2013 those either unemployed or those seeking more work. Currently the rate is 13.7% seasonally adjusted, and it has been rising since February. Historically, inflation growth doesn\u2019t begin to accelerate until the underutilisation rate gets near 11%, so we had a long way to go before the RBA needed to worry about triggering an inflation spike: The governor\u2019s statement also noted that \u201cthe recent inflation outcomes have been lower than expected and suggest subdued inflationary pressures across much of the economy\u201d. Given that the latest CPI figures came out on 24 April \u2013 two weeks before the RBA board met in May \u2013 showed core inflation growth at 1.6% and CPI growth at 1.3%, I\u2019m not sure what other signs they were waiting for: It would seem the decision not to cut rates in May was a political decision \u2013 in that the bank did not wish to be seen to be interfering in an election campaign. The government, while it may take some solace from the fact the bank ensured it did not have to respond to suggestions the economy was faltering so badly the RBA needed to cut rates to a previously unheard of level, should still feel a great deal of shame at this rate. It has boasted about a strong economy, when plainly it is not so. It has also chosen to keep to the surplus mania at a time when the economy was crying out for fiscal stimulus to help reduce spare capacity and get wages rising. Instead it has left it all to the Reserve Bank, and is hoping that there are businesses and people out there who were thinking about borrowing, but decided the previous low rates were not enough to entice them, and that this extra 0.25% off the rate is enough to do so. The issue of course is whether the banks will pass on the full amount. They should. As the governor noted: \u201cIn Australia, long-term bond yields are at historically low levels. Bank funding costs have also declined further, with money-market spreads having fully reversed the increases that took place last year.\u201d Yes short-term funding costs for banks did spike last year, but they are now back at previous levels: The rate banks are offering for term deposits above the cash rate is now lower than it was when the RBA last cut rates in 2016 \u2013 meaning the cost of long-term borrowing is also reduced: That the ANZ is only cutting its mortgage rates by 17 basis points rather than the full 25 is a disgrace. Over the past decade the gap between mortgage rates and small business loan rates offered by banks and the cash rate have grown ever larger: The only small thing in the banks favour is that over the past two years the average mortgage rate of all owner-occupier home loans has fallen while the rate offered has gone up \u2013 meaning people are starting to negotiate better rates: But that is no excuse for not cutting rates by the full amount. It also goes to the problem of using monetary policy to stimulate the economy \u2013 you need the banks to play along. I suspect this cut and the banks\u2019 reaction will mean further cuts are still to come \u2013 something the market was predicting before this announcement. The market was fully pricing in another cut to 1.0% by October and around an 80% chance of a further cut to 0.75% by this time next year: If that happens it will mean the economy remains very much in the doldrums, and the government\u2019s chances of actually delivering a budget surplus will be almost as low as the interest rates. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

Seated between the Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall, the US president praised his host as a \u201cgreat, great woman\u201d who embodied \u201cthe spirit of dignity, duty and patriotism that beats proudly in every British heart\u201d. But he will get a very different reception from Londoners today as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/04/trump-visit-mass-protests-to-be-held-in-london-as-baby-blimp-returns\">thousands take to the streets</a> to voice their displeasure over his trip. Jeremy Corbyn, who refused to attend the palace dinner, said he will \u201cstand in solidarity with those he\u2019s (Trump) attacked in America, around the world and in our own country\u201d. Organisers have billed the protests a \u201ccarnival of resistance\u201d, with demonstrators gathering at Trafalgar Square from 11am to declare a \u201cTrump-free zone\u201d. Police however, said protestors will not be allowed to march past Downing Street, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/03/may-to-hail-great-partnership-with-us-as-trump-visits-no-10\">Theresa May will host trade talks with the president</a>, in one of her final acts as prime minister.

Police checked ID cards of every tourist and commuter leaving the subway near the square, where pro-democracy protesters were met by soldiers and tanks on 4 June 1989. Several activists were detained in the run up to the anniversary, while popular livestreaming sites were conspicuously offline for \u201ctechnical\u201d maintenance.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Corbyn to join protests as May hosts trade talks Good morning and welcome to the briefing with Alison Rourke. The white-tie-and-tiara state banquet for 170 guests in Buckingham Palace\u2019s grand ballroom last night was the highlight of Donald Trump\u2019s three-day state visit to London. Seated between the Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall, the US president praised his host as a \u201cgreat, great woman\u201d who embodied \u201cthe spirit of dignity, duty and patriotism that beats proudly in every British heart\u201d. But he will get a very different reception from Londoners today as thousands take to the streets to voice their displeasure over his trip. Jeremy Corbyn, who refused to attend the palace dinner, said he will \u201cstand in solidarity with those he\u2019s (Trump) attacked in America, around the world and in our own country\u201d. Organisers have billed the protests a \u201ccarnival of resistance\u201d, with demonstrators gathering at Trafalgar Square from 11am to declare a \u201cTrump-free zone\u201d. Police however, said protestors will not be allowed to march past Downing Street, where Theresa May will host trade talks with the president, in one of her final acts as prime minister. The PM will insist the relationship between the US and the UK is \u201ca great partnership, but one I believe we can make greater still\u201d but she won\u2019t hold a one-on-one meeting with Trump. * * * Tiananmen anniversary \u2013 China has marked 30 years since the deadly massacre in Beijing with silence, extra security and the tightening of internet censorship. Police checked ID cards of every tourist and commuter leaving the subway near the square, where pro-democracy protesters were met by soldiers and tanks on 4 June 1989. Several activists were detained in the run up to the anniversary, while popular livestreaming sites were conspicuously offline for \u201ctechnical\u201d maintenance. As Lily Kuo reports from Beijing, some have been remembering the crackdown by fasting for 24 hours \u2013 one of the only forms of remembrance available to those wanting to mark the day. The leading contemporary artist, activist and advocate of political reform in China, Ai Weiei, says that the west is complicit in the 30-year cover-up of what happened in Tiananmen square. * * * Package free \u2013 Waitrose is offering customers the chance shop package free in a bring-your-own packaging trial at a store in Oxford. Customers will be able to fill their bottles, Tupperware and other containers with a range of products, including wine, beer, rice, loose fruit and veg, pasta, rice, grains and even cleaning materials. And they will be roughly 15% cheaper than packaged alternatives. Waitrose\u2019s Tor Harris says the trial has the \u201cpotential to shape how people might shop with us in the future\u201d. Let\u2019s hope so, given the top 10 UK supermarkets produce 810,000 tonnes of throwaway packaging each year, according to Greenpeace UK. * * * Boris Johnson court battle \u2013 The former foreign secretary has launched an appeal against the summons issued to him over allegations of misconduct in a public office relating to claims Britain gave the EU \u00a3350m a week. The businessman prosecuting Johnson, Marcus Ball, said the Tory leadership candidate had launched a judicial review application in the administrative court. Johnson\u2019s lawyers are expected to argue the summons is unlawful and that the criminal proceedings against him should be suspended until the judicial review application has been determined, Ball said. A spokesman for Johnson declined to comment. * * * North Korea \u2013 Kim Jong-un\u2019s influential younger sister has appeared in public for the first time in more than 50 days. Kim Yo-jong, who was by Kim\u2019s side throughout his meetings with the US president at the recent failed nuclear summit, was shown seated next to her brother at the \u201cmass games\u201d gymnastic and dance display. Reports suggested she had been ordered to keep a low profile after the meeting between the two leaders collapsed. While she seemed to enjoy the performance, her brother did not, criticising organisers for their \u201cwrong spirit\u201d and \u201cirresponsible work\u201d. * * * Sweet sorrow \u2013 Half of food and drink products with popular cartoon characters such as Peppa Pig and Paw Patrol on their packaging are high in fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt, a new survey says. The research, compiled by Action on Sugar, Action on Salt and the Children\u2019s Food Campaign, accuses manufacturers and retailers of manipulating children and parents into buying unhealthy products. Peppa Pig Candy Bites were singled out for containing 99% sugar. Kinnerton\u2019s Paw Patrol mini chocolate bars, which are more than 60% sugar and 17% saturated fat, were also among the worst offenders: one 12g bar would provide a four- to six-year-old with 38% of their maximum daily recommended intake for sugar. The research found 51% of the more than 500 food and drink products assessed did not meet the health requirements to advertise on TV during children\u2019s programmes. Today in Focus podcast: Climbing Everest: death, carnage, chaos On 23 May, an image taken by climber Nirmal Pujra went viral. It showed a long queue of climbers waiting to summit Everest. Elia Saikaly, a film-maker, was on that climb. He describes the ascent while the Guardian\u2019s Michael Safi discusses why the number of people seeking to scale Everest has exploded.

The NHS advises parents to give their babies liquid paracetamol after infant vaccinations, which begin at eight weeks old. According to the UK\u2019s medicines regulator, 84% of babies will have Calpol by the time they reach the recommended age of weaning at six months.</p> <p>Calpol is only one brand of liquid paracetamol \u2013 but the sweet, viscous, strawberry-flavoured syrup in the purple box is as much a part of childcare as nappies, wipes, dummies and bottles. Babies learn to recognise that syringe well before they know how to use a spoon, and they anticipate it: their sticky fingers reach to put it further into their mouths.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/jun/28/why-parents-are-addicted-to-calpol-podcast\">Why parents are addicted to Calpol \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/childrens-medicines/\" title=\"\">NHS webpage</a> explaining how to give any medicine to children uses an image of a baby sucking from a graduated syringe with a familiar purple plunger. More than five tonnes of Calpol is sold every day \u2013 and more than 12 million units each year. Other brands cost half the price, but Calpol has 70% of the <a href=\"https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/download?ac=1075760\" title=\"\">market</a> for children\u2019s pain-relief medicine, which is three times the share of its nearest competitor and 50 times more than the next most popular brand of paracetamol. For British parents, Calpol is overwhelmingly the drug of choice.</p> <p>This drug is found in found in bedrooms, bathrooms, nurseries and creches. Kitchen drawers across the country are littered with used Calpol syringes. There are more than 12,000 search results for Calpol on the talkboards of the British parenting website Mumsnet. But the more Calpol has become synonymous with parenting, the more its ubiquity has begun to worry us.</p> <p>Over the past decade or so there has been a succession of panics over Calpol. Could it be behind the explosion in childhood asthma? Could its signature colourings and flavourings be the mysterious cause of the epidemic of ADHD? Worries over Calpol\u2019s purported sedative properties have filled the pages of countless parenting forums.</p> <p>Last year, a BBC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/health-44140151/are-we-using-too-much-calpol\" title=\"\">documentary</a> about overmedicated children set off another flurry of panic. After reporting that children swallow three times as many drugs as they did 40 years ago, the film-makers interviewed a family GP whose brief remarks filled the pages of tabloids and the sofas of daytime TV for the better part of a week. \u201cWe have children now who are almost addicted to paracetamol, to Calpol,\u201d the GP said. \u201cSome people describe it as the heroin of childhood.\u201d</p> <p>Like all paracetamol products, Calpol eases pain and lowers fever, but we give it to babies who are too young to tell us what is wrong with them in the hope it will soothe them. For many, Calpol is a panacea, a cure for baby-crying, a reliable way to settle your child and send them off to sleep. At a time when we are being forced to recognise the dangers of so many everyday items, from plastics to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/01/bacon-cancer-processed-meats-nitrates-nitrites-sausages\" title=\"\">bacon</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/nov/30/bowel-movement-change-the-way-you-poo-squatty-potty-toilet\" title=\"\">toilet seats</a>, we fear that the ubiquitous solution in the brown glass bottle must have some kind of dark side. </p> <p>In short, Calpol makes us feel guilty. It has become a soft target for an anxiety exploited by scaremongers and conspiracy theorists. But British parents cannot live without it.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The medicine of British childhood is actually produced in a vast factory in a suburb of Orl\u00e9ans. Calpol is now owned by an American company, Johnson &amp; Johnson, who have outsourced manufacturing to a French company called Famar. In their marketing, Johnson &amp; Johnson like to remind us of how Calpol has been a go-to solution for generations of British parents, but the company only acquired the brand in 2006, and don\u2019t have much information about its history. They have never given an interview about Calpol before: pharmaceutical companies don\u2019t really do press junkets.</p> <p>After several months of emails about Calpol, they invited me to their British headquarters in Maidenhead, where the receptionists wear the company colours \u2013 white shirts with red neckerchiefs \u2013 as if they were stewardesses on a Johnson &amp; Johnson airline.</p> <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson call the Calpol range of medicines The Calpol Family. \u201cFrom stuffy noses and sore throats to aches and pains, fevers and teething,\u201d the brand\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.calpol.co.uk/what-is-calpol\" title=\"\">website</a> promises, \u201cwe\u2019ve carefully developed a family of effective medicines to help you take great care of your little one\u201d \u2013 as if describing a crack team of solutions to almost any health problem the average child will encounter.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a brand that we\u2019re really proud of,\u201d Purvi Farahi, the head of marketing for Northern Europe told me. She sat with Gill Nelson, the medical director for Northern Europe, in a white boardroom with red chairs; on the other side of the table was a PR consultant who was taking notes and recording every word of our conversation. \u201cFor over 50 years, it\u2019s a brand that parents, grandparents and caregivers have grown up with. At the heart of it, I think it\u2019s really about trust.\u201d</p> <p>Trust in the Calpol brand is the reason people choose it over cheaper alternatives: parents are buying \u201cthe experience of the overall product\u201d, Nelson told me. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a poorly child and you really want to make them feel better, it\u2019s not really a time when you want to start browsing the shelves.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Andrew Green, a GP in Yorkshire and the British Medical Association\u2019s GP committee clinical and prescribing lead, took a dimmer view of our collective loyalty to the Calpol brand: \u201cIn our society we have the idea that expensive things are best,\u201d he told me after my trip to Maidenhead. \u201cBuying the expensive one that\u2019s the familiar one with the nice bottle and the advertising means parents are doing the best for their child.\u201d</p> <p>Calpol\u2019s formula is as central to its success as its familiarity. \u201cThe active ingredient is paracetamol, but the other ingredients \u2013 what we call the excipients of the product, all the other bits and pieces that are put in to make sure it doesn\u2019t go off in the bottle, has the right consistency, can be extruded into a syringe for dosing, tastes acceptable and looks acceptable to children \u2013 all those are unique to Calpol,\u201d Nelson explained, deftly avoiding the words \u201ccolouring\u201d, \u201cpreservatives\u201d, \u201cflavourings\u201d and \u201csweeteners\u201d. Calpol has 2.2g of sucrose per 5ml, which is more than four times as much sugar as there is in an equivalent amount of Coca-Cola. No wonder children can\u2019t get enough of it.</p> <p>Prof Mahendra Patel, a pharmacist and board member of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, told me that Calpol\u2019s tasty formula has made all medicines more palatable for children. \u201cCalpol educates that baby to say, actually, I will have that medicine, I won\u2019t spit it out. In terms of any medication the child takes thereafter, the seed has been sown that medicines aren\u2019t bad.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3487c006471201bb9c39587a5674f92bc8fcdb40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3487c006471201bb9c39587a5674f92bc8fcdb40/0_0_1978_1695/1000.jpg\" alt=\"various children's building blocks, including one shaped like a bottle and one like a pill\" width=\"1000\" height=\"857\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>You don\u2019t have to go to a pharmacy to buy Calpol: it\u2019s sold in petrol stations, newsagents, corner shops and supermarkets. If you can get a pint of milk, you can probably buy a bottle of Calpol alongside it. \u201cAvailability is really important, particularly for a medicine of this type where it often is a purchase that you\u2019re making in a really stressful situation,\u201d Nelson said. This doesn\u2019t quite ring true to me: I have never waited until my children were ill before buying some. Indeed, the NHS website says it\u2019s \u201ca good idea\u201d to keep children\u2019s paracetamol always stored at home.</p> <p>Patel has witnessed the power of the brand first-hand. He began his career working in areas that were densely populated with recent migrants from Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. \u201cFamilies with small children were coming through the pharmacy and they didn\u2019t speak the language, but because Calpol was Calpol it didn\u2019t need any translation: they knew it was the solution to many of their children\u2019s minor problems.\u201d</p> <p>The nurses who run immunisation clinics routinely tell parents to give their babies paracetamol to avoid adverse reactions, particularly after the meningitis B vaccination, which has a more powerful inflammatory response, was <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/meningitis-b-vaccine/\" title=\"\">recommended</a> for all infants in 2015. When my baby was immunised last year, the nurse explicitly told me to \u201cgo and buy some Calpol\u201d to give her afterwards. This means many first-time parents\u2019 first encounter with children\u2019s medicine is a healthcare professional telling them to use it before their child is ill, setting up a relationship whereby we give it before we\u2019re sure it\u2019s needed.</p> <p>Under the watchful eye of the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Calpol has managed to produce marketing messages that promise what every parent wants to hear. One recent advertising slogan is \u201cLets Kids be Kids\u201d, and TV adverts emphasise how Calpol can \u201chelp them get back to normal\u201d. A Calpol booklet offering an immunisation guide for parents depicts a blissed-out baby asleep with her arms outstretched and a smile on her face. Sick children don\u2019t have a role to play in Calpol\u2019s marketing strategy: the messages emphasise the emotional rather than medical reasons for giving the medicine. By focusing on the positives, they give the impression that Calpol can cure your child\u2019s discomfort, no matter what the reason for it might be.</p> <p>When I put this to Farahi, she told me this was intentional. \u201cThe strategy for us is always to show the end benefit that parents are looking for,\u201d she said. But their marketing strategy is about more than being back to normal: it\u2019s about portraying children who have had Calpol as being happy, or asleep, or both.</p> <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson hold competitions every few years to find the new face of Calpol \u2013 a coveted role in marketing and packaging, on par with being the Pears or Gerber <a href=\"https://www.gerberlife.com/about/who-is-the-gerber-baby\" title=\"\">baby</a>. More than 24,000 parents entered their children into a \u201cBe a Calpol Star\u201d competition on the brand\u2019s Facebook page in 2011. When two year-old Millie Foster became \u201cthe Calpol Kid\u201d in 2006, which meant her face appearing on the box, her mother, Georgina, was ecstatic. \u201cEveryone will have her in their cupboards now. Her granny and grandpa are very proud,\u201d Georgina told her local paper, the Surrey Comet, but added that Millie actually \u201cdoesn\u2019t like her photo being taken at all\u201d.</p> <p>Nelson said the main task for their marketing was raising awareness. \u201cSomething like 41% of babies are born to first-time parents. With every birth, there\u2019s a whole new raft of potential customers arriving on the scene.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the 18th and 19th centuries, mothers rubbed paregoric \u2013 a waxy tincture containing opium \u2013 into their babies\u2019 gums to soothe teething pain. As late as the mid-20th century, it was common to do the same with whisky or brandy, and \u201cgripe water\u201d containing alcohol, sugar, dill extract and baking soda was given routinely for colic. In the 1950s Gould\u2019s gripe water was advertised with strapline \u201cNo more fuss from baby\u201d.</p> <p>Even though paracetamol is the most common medicine in paediatrics, no one is entirely sure how it works. We know it inhibits an enzyme involved in producing prostaglandins, making the body less aware of pain, but the mechanism by which it acts on the brain to reduce fever is less understood. We know the inputs and the outputs, but it\u2019s a black box.</p> <p>Paracetamol was discovered after a mistake at the University of Strasburg in the 1880s. Professor Adolf Kussmaul was experimenting with naphthalene, the main ingredient of mothballs, as a possible cure for intestinal parasites. His patients were accidentally given acetanilide instead, and while it wasn\u2019t much good for worms, it dramatically lowered fever. Acetanilide was cheap and effective, but it also deactivated some of the haemoglobin in red blood cells, with potentially lethal results. Paracetamol, a derivate of acetanilide, was first used in clinical trials by the German pharmacologist Joseph von Mering in 1893, but fears lingered that it might still be dangerous, and it was only after a series of studies in the 1940s showed paracetamol to have no effect on haemoglobin that it began to be widely sold.</p> <p>Calpol was launched in 1959 by Calmic Limited, based in Crewe. (It\u2019s likely the Calpol brand name comes from the contraction of \u201cCalmic\u201d and \u201cparacetamol\u201d.) At the time, paracetamol was being given to children in solution and tasted extremely bitter; Calmic was the first to suspend it in a sweet, flavoured syrup. When Calmic was bought by Wellcome in 1966, aspirin was going out of fashion as a painkiller because it had been linked to gastro-intestinal bleeding. Wellcome marketed Calpol as \u201cBetter and safer than aspirin because it is a non-irritant\u201d. It was prescription-only at this point, but prescription medicines could be legally advertised until 1978. One of the first print adverts for Calpol reads: \u201cCalpol Suspension is a flavoured liquid \u2013 very pleasant to take from a spoon. As you know, this can be a great help when your child is ill or upset.\u201d It sold parents calmness, just as it does today.</p> <p>Calpol\u2019s advertising slogans of the mid-70s (\u201cSimple answers to everyday babycare problems\u201d, \u201cGentle and comforting, pleasant tasting too\u201d) positioned it as more than a medicine: a comfort for your child, a solution for you. One late-70s slogan, \u201cPleasant for baby, peaceful for you\u201d, is the closest the brand has ever come to explicitly claiming Calpol has the ability to make crying babies shut up. The sentiment was echoed in an animated television advert in the 1980s featuring a grumpy, grizzly baby. \u201cThere are times when every baby is just crying out for Calpol infant suspension,\u201d the mellow voiceover says, as the child\u2019s frazzled parents stand over his cot in their pyjamas pouring it into a spoon. \u201cIt makes everyone feel better.\u201d</p> <p>By the 1980s, Calpol could be bought from pharmacies without a prescription, and it became one of Wellcome\u2019s best-selling products in the UK, with more than a million bottles sold over the counter in 1983. Babies began to be given Calpol routinely after vaccinations. Calpol was now such a normal part of British parenting that it was being marketed as something you pack in your suitcase when you go abroad. \u201cWhen the family go on holiday don\u2019t take the risk of aches and pains,\u201d read a 1980s print advert, next to a cartoon of a feverish child on a beach. Discomfort had become something a \u201cconcerned parent\u201d shouldn\u2019t want to risk.</p> <p>When British parents began to worry about sugar and additives, sugar-free Calpol was launched in 1988, and a colour-free version arrived a few years later. When we became obsessed with 24-hour convenience in the late 1990s, Calpol switched from being a pharmacy-only medicine to one sold in any store. Since acquiring the brand in 2006, Johnson &amp; Johnson have expanded the Calpol \u201cfamily\u201d, launching a version that was both sugar-free and colour-free in 2011, and adding a saline nasal spray and a plug-in vapouriser that releases chamomile and lavender essential oils supposed to assist sleep; after all, this is a brand that parents have long associated with sleeping children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"755c1f63720cc1a89f5a3edbf588ea90a4f490dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/755c1f63720cc1a89f5a3edbf588ea90a4f490dd/0_0_1978_1695/1000.jpg\" alt=\"kids' toys and building blocks with 'ZZZ' on them\" width=\"1000\" height=\"857\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The link between Calpol and sleep has been discussed in countless Mumsnet threads since the site launched in 2000. In one entitled \u201cDosed on Calpol \u2013 feeling guilty\u201d, a mother tortures herself for giving her six-month-old a dose purely to make him drop off. Other parents weigh in to reassure her. \u201cCalpol wont send him to sleep. he was obviously in discomfort with pain/temp somewhere, and the calpol worked,\u201d one says. \u201cI just assumed that it was slightly sedative,\u201d the mother replies. \u201cI guess you can\u2019t use it forever though so where do you draw the line?\u201d</p> <p>In 2007 Johnson &amp; Johnson introduced a new product: Calpol Night, for children aged two years and up, with added antihistamine, to explicitly aid sleep. But in 2009 the MHRA ruled that 36 different medicines, including Calpol Night, should no longer be given to children under six: research had shown them to be of limited use in younger children, and linked them to side effects such as disturbed sleep and hallucinations. Even though Johnson &amp; Johnson could have continued to market it for older children, Calpol Night was quietly withdrawn in 2010.</p> <p>Doing the very best for your children today means not ever allowing them to suffer. But the generation of parents who are increasingly unwilling to leave their children to cry at night are the same parents who are prepared to dose them up with a nightcap of paracetamol and antihistamines to make them sleep.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Prescriptions for ADHD medication have doubled in the past decade, and prescriptions of adult sleep medication given to children have increased tenfold over the same period. But because Calpol is such a ubiquitous part of everyday parenting, every anxiety over children\u2019s medicines seems to be projected on to Calpol.</p> <p>The fame of Calpol is so great that it was even dragged into the investigation of Madeleine McCann\u2019s disappearance in 2007. The Portuguese police were under pressure to come up with new leads, and their attention briefly turned to whether Madeleine\u2019s parents, who were doctors, had accidentally killed her while trying to sedate her. Leaks from the investigation appeared in a Portuguese newspaper, claiming an oral dosing syringe had been found in their holiday apartment. The McCanns readily admitted that they occasionally gave their children Calpol, but strongly denied administering anything stronger. There was no basis whatsoever for the theory, which has been completely discredited. But still the Calpol detail was seized on by conspiracy theorists and tabloids alike: the combination of the nation\u2019s most famous missing child and our best-loved children\u2019s medicine was too sensational to resist, even though the most basic research would show that Calpol contains no sedative ingredients at all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/20/bugaboo-luxury-pram-baby-buggy-stroller-parenting\">Perfect prams for perfect parents: the rise of the bougie buggy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many of the subsequent panics have been similarly fact-free. \u201cBabies given Calpol just once a month \u2018are five times as likely to develop asthma\u2019\u201d declared a headline in the Daily Mail in 2013. The Mail was only one of many newspapers to dramatically misreport the results of a study of 20,000 Spanish children: Calpol isn\u2019t even sold in Spain; the study measured paracetamol use alongside asthma symptoms, but failed to find a causal link. The NHS issued <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/news/medication/link-between-calpol-and-asthma-not-proven/\" title=\"\">a response</a> debunking the reports, but the story still gets repeated in newspapers today.</p> <p>When a campaign group called later that year for food colourings linked to hyperactivity to be removed from children\u2019s medicines \u2013 all children\u2019s medicines \u2013 the press brought up Calpol\u2019s signature purple hue: the headline in the Times read \u201cHyperactivity link to additives in Calpol\u201d. Johnson &amp; Johnson said in an email that they use colourants \u2013 including \u201cSunset Yellow\u201d and \u201cCarmoisine\u201d, which were linked to hyperactivity, though only with much higher doses than are found in Calpol \u2013 \u201cto make the medicine look more visually appealing to poorly children who otherwise might refuse the dose\u201d, adding that \u201cthe majority of children will experience no ill effects from consuming the tiny amounts of colourants in Calpol\u201d. Of course, you could just buy the colour-free version \u2013 but the original purple formula remains the best-seller.</p> <p>But it was the GP\u2019s offhand remark about Calpol as the \u201cheroin of childhood\u201d that caused the greatest flurry in the British tabloids. In 2018, a BBC series called The Doctor Who Gave Up Drugs looked into whether we are overmedicating our children. The presenter, Dr Chris Van Tulleken, took his baby daughter to be vaccinated and then interviewed his family GP. \u201cWe have children now who are almost addicted to paracetamol, to Calpol. I don\u2019t think they are addicted to the drug itself, but they are addicted to the process,\u201d the GP said. \u201cSome people describe it as the heroin of childhood.\u201d</p> <p>The image of the Calpol-junkie baby was too powerful to leave room for nuance. Parents left angry messages on Calpol\u2019s Facebook page after the broadcast. \u201cMy children are teenagers now but I\u2019ve learned things tonight that I never questioned before \u2013 I feel like I\u2019ve been misinformed during their formative years,\u201d said one. \u201cAnybody working for this organisation needs to have more integrity,\u201d said another, \u201cspeaking as a concerned mum.\u201d</p> <p>But Chris Steele, doctor-in-residence on ITV\u2019s This Morning programme, issued a robust defence of the brand on air. \u201cEvery parent will be thankful for the paracetamol Calpol syrup,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not addictive. However, parents, I think, are psychologically dependent on Calpol, because when their children are ill they do go for the Calpol. Well, that\u2019s all right, so long as you follow the recommended dosage. It\u2019s totally safe.\u201d</p> <p>Calpol is very safe if given according to the instructions on the pack. (The only real danger is an accidental overdose, and these are very rare.) But our dependence on it makes us uneasy, which is why the scare stories refuse to die. As both scaremongers and marketing departments know, parental concern is a lucrative seam to mine.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson reject the idea that parents are giving their children too much Calpol. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any evidence that it\u2019s overused,\u201d Nelson said, and Farahi cited independent research data to back this up: \u201cOn average, households purchase 1.95, so say around two bottles a year of Calpol,\u201d she told me. \u201cUsually there\u2019s about 1.75 kids in a family, roughly two.\u201d One bottle per child per year doesn\u2019t sound like much, but an average figure takes in families of children of all ages, and, as any parent knows, Calpol is used more frequently with babies than with older kids.</p> <p>As much as paracetamol is a black box, so are babies: they are non-verbal, their internal states are opaque, and we have to work out what\u2019s wrong with them when they are upset. \u201cThere seems to be a default action to give it to a distressed child, whether or not that child has a temperature or fever,\u201d Dr Andrew Green told me. This happens at the other end of the age spectrum, he said. \u201cWhere you have an adult with dementia who is distressed, then it\u2019s a quite reasonable therapeutic intervention to try some regular low-risk medication like paracetamol, because sometimes people can\u2019t communicate pain. I wouldn\u2019t in any way criticise parents for giving it to distressed children. There are rational reasons for doing it.\u201d</p> <p>Calpol\u2019s packaging says it is for the relief of pain and fever, but we give it for distress, and the brand has always encouraged this in its marketing. There are many reasons why a drug containing no known sedatives might make a child calm and sleepy. The most obvious is that it alleviates the pain or physical discomfort from fever that was preventing them from sleeping. But it is likely Calpol\u2019s power derives primarily from its ability to comfort parents.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things that determines the distress in the child is the distress in the parent. Children and babies are extremely good at picking up anxiety,\u201d Green told me, describing how babies at immunisation clinics are always more upset by the injection when their parents are fretting. \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting for parents to have an ill child, and natural for parents to want to help that ill child. Giving the child medicine is a way of helping. The act of giving the Calpol assumes far more importance than the mere giving of a medicine: it\u2019s an expression of love, and it reduces tension. It\u2019s almost a placebo effect by proxy: the child benefits from the parent believing that they\u2019re doing good.\u201d</p> <p>We are dependent on Calpol \u2013 but it is parents, not kids, who are addicted. It is understandable that a medicine could come to take such a central role in family life. Parents are increasingly atomised, separated from wider networks of extended families and community that used to pass wisdom down. When there is a problem with our children, we are as likely to reach for Google as to ask a friend. Calpol has stepped into that void, producing booklet guides to immunisations, and online advice on teething, earache, colds, flu and many more common minor health problems. The Calpol website hosts several information <a href=\"https://www.calpol.co.uk/expert-advice/expert-chat\" title=\"\">videos</a> featuring groups of mums sharing a pot of tea with a GP around a wooden kitchen island, comparing notes about how to recognise a fever, the flu or a new tooth. The site gets over more than a million hits a year.</p> <p>But by turning to Calpol whenever our child is distressed, we contribute to an already rampant culture where problems are supposed to be solved by medication. \u201cWe can forget, in all stages of our lives, the non-drug interventions that are effective, the simple things that we can do,\u201d Green said. \u201cEvery time a GP does an emergency or a turn-up-on-the-day type of surgery, we will get an embarrassed mum in with a child who is running around the room giggling. They will say, \u2018I brought him here because he\u2019s really ill with a temperature, but he\u2019s got better.\u2019 The reason they\u2019ve got better is that they are in an environment that is interesting, and they\u2019ve had a ride in the car or bus or pushchair and cooled off a little bit.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/16/baby-advice-books-industry-attachment-parenting\">The diabolical genius of the baby advice industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson insist the wider Calpol range, with its nasal spray and vapour plug, offers non-drug alternatives for those who want them. But perhaps it would be more useful to look at this the other way round: it\u2019s not so much that we believe the answer to our children\u2019s discomfort is drugs, but that we don\u2019t view Calpol as a drug. It has infiltrated our daily lives and most protected spaces. It is part of solving our babies\u2019 problems in the same way as a dummy, a cuddle or a nappy change is. Many are as likely to reach for Calpol as they are to rock their babies when they are very upset.</p> <p>Some of this is due to clever marketing, which, over decades, has established the brand as a \u201csimple answer\u201d, an \u201ceveryday\u201d part of having kids. Some of this comes from its ubiquity \u2013 the fact that it can be bought at the same time as we buy our loaf of bread or fill the car up with petrol. Calpol has become the brand of medicine that we don\u2019t regard as a drug, no matter what its manufacturers might print on the pack. That is the secret of its success.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The first thing any British child will ever taste, after milk, will almost certainly be Calpol. The NHS advises parents to give their babies liquid paracetamol after infant vaccinations, which begin at eight weeks old. According to the UK\u2019s medicines regulator, 84% of babies will have Calpol by the time they reach the recommended age of weaning at six months. Calpol is only one brand of liquid paracetamol \u2013 but the sweet, viscous, strawberry-flavoured syrup in the purple box is as much a part of childcare as nappies, wipes, dummies and bottles. Babies learn to recognise that syringe well before they know how to use a spoon, and they anticipate it: their sticky fingers reach to put it further into their mouths. The NHS webpage explaining how to give any medicine to children uses an image of a baby sucking from a graduated syringe with a familiar purple plunger. More than five tonnes of Calpol is sold every day \u2013 and more than 12 million units each year. Other brands cost half the price, but Calpol has 70% of the market for children\u2019s pain-relief medicine, which is three times the share of its nearest competitor and 50 times more than the next most popular brand of paracetamol. For British parents, Calpol is overwhelmingly the drug of choice. This drug is found in found in bedrooms, bathrooms, nurseries and creches. Kitchen drawers across the country are littered with used Calpol syringes. There are more than 12,000 search results for Calpol on the talkboards of the British parenting website Mumsnet. But the more Calpol has become synonymous with parenting, the more its ubiquity has begun to worry us. Over the past decade or so there has been a succession of panics over Calpol. Could it be behind the explosion in childhood asthma? Could its signature colourings and flavourings be the mysterious cause of the epidemic of ADHD? Worries over Calpol\u2019s purported sedative properties have filled the pages of countless parenting forums. Last year, a BBC documentary about overmedicated children set off another flurry of panic. After reporting that children swallow three times as many drugs as they did 40 years ago, the film-makers interviewed a family GP whose brief remarks filled the pages of tabloids and the sofas of daytime TV for the better part of a week. \u201cWe have children now who are almost addicted to paracetamol, to Calpol,\u201d the GP said. \u201cSome people describe it as the heroin of childhood.\u201d Like all paracetamol products, Calpol eases pain and lowers fever, but we give it to babies who are too young to tell us what is wrong with them in the hope it will soothe them. For many, Calpol is a panacea, a cure for baby-crying, a reliable way to settle your child and send them off to sleep. At a time when we are being forced to recognise the dangers of so many everyday items, from plastics to bacon to toilet seats, we fear that the ubiquitous solution in the brown glass bottle must have some kind of dark side. In short, Calpol makes us feel guilty. It has become a soft target for an anxiety exploited by scaremongers and conspiracy theorists. But British parents cannot live without it. * * * The medicine of British childhood is actually produced in a vast factory in a suburb of Orl\u00e9ans. Calpol is now owned by an American company, Johnson &amp; Johnson, who have outsourced manufacturing to a French company called Famar. In their marketing, Johnson &amp; Johnson like to remind us of how Calpol has been a go-to solution for generations of British parents, but the company only acquired the brand in 2006, and don\u2019t have much information about its history. They have never given an interview about Calpol before: pharmaceutical companies don\u2019t really do press junkets. After several months of emails about Calpol, they invited me to their British headquarters in Maidenhead, where the receptionists wear the company colours \u2013 white shirts with red neckerchiefs \u2013 as if they were stewardesses on a Johnson &amp; Johnson airline. Johnson &amp; Johnson call the Calpol range of medicines The Calpol Family. \u201cFrom stuffy noses and sore throats to aches and pains, fevers and teething,\u201d the brand\u2019s website promises, \u201cwe\u2019ve carefully developed a family of effective medicines to help you take great care of your little one\u201d \u2013 as if describing a crack team of solutions to almost any health problem the average child will encounter. \u201cIt\u2019s a brand that we\u2019re really proud of,\u201d Purvi Farahi, the head of marketing for Northern Europe told me. She sat with Gill Nelson, the medical director for Northern Europe, in a white boardroom with red chairs; on the other side of the table was a PR consultant who was taking notes and recording every word of our conversation. \u201cFor over 50 years, it\u2019s a brand that parents, grandparents and caregivers have grown up with. At the heart of it, I think it\u2019s really about trust.\u201d Trust in the Calpol brand is the reason people choose it over cheaper alternatives: parents are buying \u201cthe experience of the overall product\u201d, Nelson told me. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a poorly child and you really want to make them feel better, it\u2019s not really a time when you want to start browsing the shelves.\u201d Dr Andrew Green, a GP in Yorkshire and the British Medical Association\u2019s GP committee clinical and prescribing lead, took a dimmer view of our collective loyalty to the Calpol brand: \u201cIn our society we have the idea that expensive things are best,\u201d he told me after my trip to Maidenhead. \u201cBuying the expensive one that\u2019s the familiar one with the nice bottle and the advertising means parents are doing the best for their child.\u201d Calpol\u2019s formula is as central to its success as its familiarity. \u201cThe active ingredient is paracetamol, but the other ingredients \u2013 what we call the excipients of the product, all the other bits and pieces that are put in to make sure it doesn\u2019t go off in the bottle, has the right consistency, can be extruded into a syringe for dosing, tastes acceptable and looks acceptable to children \u2013 all those are unique to Calpol,\u201d Nelson explained, deftly avoiding the words \u201ccolouring\u201d, \u201cpreservatives\u201d, \u201cflavourings\u201d and \u201csweeteners\u201d. Calpol has 2.2g of sucrose per 5ml, which is more than four times as much sugar as there is in an equivalent amount of Coca-Cola. No wonder children can\u2019t get enough of it. Prof Mahendra Patel, a pharmacist and board member of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, told me that Calpol\u2019s tasty formula has made all medicines more palatable for children. \u201cCalpol educates that baby to say, actually, I will have that medicine, I won\u2019t spit it out. In terms of any medication the child takes thereafter, the seed has been sown that medicines aren\u2019t bad.\u201d You don\u2019t have to go to a pharmacy to buy Calpol: it\u2019s sold in petrol stations, newsagents, corner shops and supermarkets. If you can get a pint of milk, you can probably buy a bottle of Calpol alongside it. \u201cAvailability is really important, particularly for a medicine of this type where it often is a purchase that you\u2019re making in a really stressful situation,\u201d Nelson said. This doesn\u2019t quite ring true to me: I have never waited until my children were ill before buying some. Indeed, the NHS website says it\u2019s \u201ca good idea\u201d to keep children\u2019s paracetamol always stored at home. Patel has witnessed the power of the brand first-hand. He began his career working in areas that were densely populated with recent migrants from Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. \u201cFamilies with small children were coming through the pharmacy and they didn\u2019t speak the language, but because Calpol was Calpol it didn\u2019t need any translation: they knew it was the solution to many of their children\u2019s minor problems.\u201d The nurses who run immunisation clinics routinely tell parents to give their babies paracetamol to avoid adverse reactions, particularly after the meningitis B vaccination, which has a more powerful inflammatory response, was recommended for all infants in 2015. When my baby was immunised last year, the nurse explicitly told me to \u201cgo and buy some Calpol\u201d to give her afterwards. This means many first-time parents\u2019 first encounter with children\u2019s medicine is a healthcare professional telling them to use it before their child is ill, setting up a relationship whereby we give it before we\u2019re sure it\u2019s needed. Under the watchful eye of the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Calpol has managed to produce marketing messages that promise what every parent wants to hear. One recent advertising slogan is \u201cLets Kids be Kids\u201d, and TV adverts emphasise how Calpol can \u201chelp them get back to normal\u201d. A Calpol booklet offering an immunisation guide for parents depicts a blissed-out baby asleep with her arms outstretched and a smile on her face. Sick children don\u2019t have a role to play in Calpol\u2019s marketing strategy: the messages emphasise the emotional rather than medical reasons for giving the medicine. By focusing on the positives, they give the impression that Calpol can cure your child\u2019s discomfort, no matter what the reason for it might be. When I put this to Farahi, she told me this was intentional. \u201cThe strategy for us is always to show the end benefit that parents are looking for,\u201d she said. But their marketing strategy is about more than being back to normal: it\u2019s about portraying children who have had Calpol as being happy, or asleep, or both. Johnson &amp; Johnson hold competitions every few years to find the new face of Calpol \u2013 a coveted role in marketing and packaging, on par with being the Pears or Gerber baby. More than 24,000 parents entered their children into a \u201cBe a Calpol Star\u201d competition on the brand\u2019s Facebook page in 2011. When two year-old Millie Foster became \u201cthe Calpol Kid\u201d in 2006, which meant her face appearing on the box, her mother, Georgina, was ecstatic. \u201cEveryone will have her in their cupboards now. Her granny and grandpa are very proud,\u201d Georgina told her local paper, the Surrey Comet, but added that Millie actually \u201cdoesn\u2019t like her photo being taken at all\u201d. Nelson said the main task for their marketing was raising awareness. \u201cSomething like 41% of babies are born to first-time parents. With every birth, there\u2019s a whole new raft of potential customers arriving on the scene.\u201d * * * In the 18th and 19th centuries, mothers rubbed paregoric \u2013 a waxy tincture containing opium \u2013 into their babies\u2019 gums to soothe teething pain. As late as the mid-20th century, it was common to do the same with whisky or brandy, and \u201cgripe water\u201d containing alcohol, sugar, dill extract and baking soda was given routinely for colic. In the 1950s Gould\u2019s gripe water was advertised with strapline \u201cNo more fuss from baby\u201d. Even though paracetamol is the most common medicine in paediatrics, no one is entirely sure how it works. We know it inhibits an enzyme involved in producing prostaglandins, making the body less aware of pain, but the mechanism by which it acts on the brain to reduce fever is less understood. We know the inputs and the outputs, but it\u2019s a black box. Paracetamol was discovered after a mistake at the University of Strasburg in the 1880s. Professor Adolf Kussmaul was experimenting with naphthalene, the main ingredient of mothballs, as a possible cure for intestinal parasites. His patients were accidentally given acetanilide instead, and while it wasn\u2019t much good for worms, it dramatically lowered fever. Acetanilide was cheap and effective, but it also deactivated some of the haemoglobin in red blood cells, with potentially lethal results. Paracetamol, a derivate of acetanilide, was first used in clinical trials by the German pharmacologist Joseph von Mering in 1893, but fears lingered that it might still be dangerous, and it was only after a series of studies in the 1940s showed paracetamol to have no effect on haemoglobin that it began to be widely sold. Calpol was launched in 1959 by Calmic Limited, based in Crewe. (It\u2019s likely the Calpol brand name comes from the contraction of \u201cCalmic\u201d and \u201cparacetamol\u201d.) At the time, paracetamol was being given to children in solution and tasted extremely bitter; Calmic was the first to suspend it in a sweet, flavoured syrup. When Calmic was bought by Wellcome in 1966, aspirin was going out of fashion as a painkiller because it had been linked to gastro-intestinal bleeding. Wellcome marketed Calpol as \u201cBetter and safer than aspirin because it is a non-irritant\u201d. It was prescription-only at this point, but prescription medicines could be legally advertised until 1978. One of the first print adverts for Calpol reads: \u201cCalpol Suspension is a flavoured liquid \u2013 very pleasant to take from a spoon. As you know, this can be a great help when your child is ill or upset.\u201d It sold parents calmness, just as it does today. Calpol\u2019s advertising slogans of the mid-70s (\u201cSimple answers to everyday babycare problems\u201d, \u201cGentle and comforting, pleasant tasting too\u201d) positioned it as more than a medicine: a comfort for your child, a solution for you. One late-70s slogan, \u201cPleasant for baby, peaceful for you\u201d, is the closest the brand has ever come to explicitly claiming Calpol has the ability to make crying babies shut up. The sentiment was echoed in an animated television advert in the 1980s featuring a grumpy, grizzly baby. \u201cThere are times when every baby is just crying out for Calpol infant suspension,\u201d the mellow voiceover says, as the child\u2019s frazzled parents stand over his cot in their pyjamas pouring it into a spoon. \u201cIt makes everyone feel better.\u201d By the 1980s, Calpol could be bought from pharmacies without a prescription, and it became one of Wellcome\u2019s best-selling products in the UK, with more than a million bottles sold over the counter in 1983. Babies began to be given Calpol routinely after vaccinations. Calpol was now such a normal part of British parenting that it was being marketed as something you pack in your suitcase when you go abroad. \u201cWhen the family go on holiday don\u2019t take the risk of aches and pains,\u201d read a 1980s print advert, next to a cartoon of a feverish child on a beach. Discomfort had become something a \u201cconcerned parent\u201d shouldn\u2019t want to risk. When British parents began to worry about sugar and additives, sugar-free Calpol was launched in 1988, and a colour-free version arrived a few years later. When we became obsessed with 24-hour convenience in the late 1990s, Calpol switched from being a pharmacy-only medicine to one sold in any store. Since acquiring the brand in 2006, Johnson &amp; Johnson have expanded the Calpol \u201cfamily\u201d, launching a version that was both sugar-free and colour-free in 2011, and adding a saline nasal spray and a plug-in vapouriser that releases chamomile and lavender essential oils supposed to assist sleep; after all, this is a brand that parents have long associated with sleeping children. The link between Calpol and sleep has been discussed in countless Mumsnet threads since the site launched in 2000. In one entitled \u201cDosed on Calpol \u2013 feeling guilty\u201d, a mother tortures herself for giving her six-month-old a dose purely to make him drop off. Other parents weigh in to reassure her. \u201cCalpol wont send him to sleep. he was obviously in discomfort with pain/temp somewhere, and the calpol worked,\u201d one says. \u201cI just assumed that it was slightly sedative,\u201d the mother replies. \u201cI guess you can\u2019t use it forever though so where do you draw the line?\u201d In 2007 Johnson &amp; Johnson introduced a new product: Calpol Night, for children aged two years and up, with added antihistamine, to explicitly aid sleep. But in 2009 the MHRA ruled that 36 different medicines, including Calpol Night, should no longer be given to children under six: research had shown them to be of limited use in younger children, and linked them to side effects such as disturbed sleep and hallucinations. Even though Johnson &amp; Johnson could have continued to market it for older children, Calpol Night was quietly withdrawn in 2010. Doing the very best for your children today means not ever allowing them to suffer. But the generation of parents who are increasingly unwilling to leave their children to cry at night are the same parents who are prepared to dose them up with a nightcap of paracetamol and antihistamines to make them sleep. * * * Prescriptions for ADHD medication have doubled in the past decade, and prescriptions of adult sleep medication given to children have increased tenfold over the same period. But because Calpol is such a ubiquitous part of everyday parenting, every anxiety over children\u2019s medicines seems to be projected on to Calpol. The fame of Calpol is so great that it was even dragged into the investigation of Madeleine McCann\u2019s disappearance in 2007. The Portuguese police were under pressure to come up with new leads, and their attention briefly turned to whether Madeleine\u2019s parents, who were doctors, had accidentally killed her while trying to sedate her. Leaks from the investigation appeared in a Portuguese newspaper, claiming an oral dosing syringe had been found in their holiday apartment. The McCanns readily admitted that they occasionally gave their children Calpol, but strongly denied administering anything stronger. There was no basis whatsoever for the theory, which has been completely discredited. But still the Calpol detail was seized on by conspiracy theorists and tabloids alike: the combination of the nation\u2019s most famous missing child and our best-loved children\u2019s medicine was too sensational to resist, even though the most basic research would show that Calpol contains no sedative ingredients at all. Many of the subsequent panics have been similarly fact-free. \u201cBabies given Calpol just once a month \u2018are five times as likely to develop asthma\u2019\u201d declared a headline in the Daily Mail in 2013. The Mail was only one of many newspapers to dramatically misreport the results of a study of 20,000 Spanish children: Calpol isn\u2019t even sold in Spain; the study measured paracetamol use alongside asthma symptoms, but failed to find a causal link. The NHS issued a response debunking the reports, but the story still gets repeated in newspapers today. When a campaign group called later that year for food colourings linked to hyperactivity to be removed from children\u2019s medicines \u2013 all children\u2019s medicines \u2013 the press brought up Calpol\u2019s signature purple hue: the headline in the Times read \u201cHyperactivity link to additives in Calpol\u201d. Johnson &amp; Johnson said in an email that they use colourants \u2013 including \u201cSunset Yellow\u201d and \u201cCarmoisine\u201d, which were linked to hyperactivity, though only with much higher doses than are found in Calpol \u2013 \u201cto make the medicine look more visually appealing to poorly children who otherwise might refuse the dose\u201d, adding that \u201cthe majority of children will experience no ill effects from consuming the tiny amounts of colourants in Calpol\u201d. Of course, you could just buy the colour-free version \u2013 but the original purple formula remains the best-seller. But it was the GP\u2019s offhand remark about Calpol as the \u201cheroin of childhood\u201d that caused the greatest flurry in the British tabloids. In 2018, a BBC series called The Doctor Who Gave Up Drugs looked into whether we are overmedicating our children. The presenter, Dr Chris Van Tulleken, took his baby daughter to be vaccinated and then interviewed his family GP. \u201cWe have children now who are almost addicted to paracetamol, to Calpol. I don\u2019t think they are addicted to the drug itself, but they are addicted to the process,\u201d the GP said. \u201cSome people describe it as the heroin of childhood.\u201d The image of the Calpol-junkie baby was too powerful to leave room for nuance. Parents left angry messages on Calpol\u2019s Facebook page after the broadcast. \u201cMy children are teenagers now but I\u2019ve learned things tonight that I never questioned before \u2013 I feel like I\u2019ve been misinformed during their formative years,\u201d said one. \u201cAnybody working for this organisation needs to have more integrity,\u201d said another, \u201cspeaking as a concerned mum.\u201d But Chris Steele, doctor-in-residence on ITV\u2019s This Morning programme, issued a robust defence of the brand on air. \u201cEvery parent will be thankful for the paracetamol Calpol syrup,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not addictive. However, parents, I think, are psychologically dependent on Calpol, because when their children are ill they do go for the Calpol. Well, that\u2019s all right, so long as you follow the recommended dosage. It\u2019s totally safe.\u201d Calpol is very safe if given according to the instructions on the pack. (The only real danger is an accidental overdose, and these are very rare.) But our dependence on it makes us uneasy, which is why the scare stories refuse to die. As both scaremongers and marketing departments know, parental concern is a lucrative seam to mine. * * * Johnson &amp; Johnson reject the idea that parents are giving their children too much Calpol. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any evidence that it\u2019s overused,\u201d Nelson said, and Farahi cited independent research data to back this up: \u201cOn average, households purchase 1.95, so say around two bottles a year of Calpol,\u201d she told me. \u201cUsually there\u2019s about 1.75 kids in a family, roughly two.\u201d One bottle per child per year doesn\u2019t sound like much, but an average figure takes in families of children of all ages, and, as any parent knows, Calpol is used more frequently with babies than with older kids. As much as paracetamol is a black box, so are babies: they are non-verbal, their internal states are opaque, and we have to work out what\u2019s wrong with them when they are upset. \u201cThere seems to be a default action to give it to a distressed child, whether or not that child has a temperature or fever,\u201d Dr Andrew Green told me. This happens at the other end of the age spectrum, he said. \u201cWhere you have an adult with dementia who is distressed, then it\u2019s a quite reasonable therapeutic intervention to try some regular low-risk medication like paracetamol, because sometimes people can\u2019t communicate pain. I wouldn\u2019t in any way criticise parents for giving it to distressed children. There are rational reasons for doing it.\u201d Calpol\u2019s packaging says it is for the relief of pain and fever, but we give it for distress, and the brand has always encouraged this in its marketing. There are many reasons why a drug containing no known sedatives might make a child calm and sleepy. The most obvious is that it alleviates the pain or physical discomfort from fever that was preventing them from sleeping. But it is likely Calpol\u2019s power derives primarily from its ability to comfort parents. \u201cOne of the things that determines the distress in the child is the distress in the parent. Children and babies are extremely good at picking up anxiety,\u201d Green told me, describing how babies at immunisation clinics are always more upset by the injection when their parents are fretting. \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting for parents to have an ill child, and natural for parents to want to help that ill child. Giving the child medicine is a way of helping. The act of giving the Calpol assumes far more importance than the mere giving of a medicine: it\u2019s an expression of love, and it reduces tension. It\u2019s almost a placebo effect by proxy: the child benefits from the parent believing that they\u2019re doing good.\u201d We are dependent on Calpol \u2013 but it is parents, not kids, who are addicted. It is understandable that a medicine could come to take such a central role in family life. Parents are increasingly atomised, separated from wider networks of extended families and community that used to pass wisdom down. When there is a problem with our children, we are as likely to reach for Google as to ask a friend. Calpol has stepped into that void, producing booklet guides to immunisations, and online advice on teething, earache, colds, flu and many more common minor health problems. The Calpol website hosts several information videos featuring groups of mums sharing a pot of tea with a GP around a wooden kitchen island, comparing notes about how to recognise a fever, the flu or a new tooth. The site gets over more than a million hits a year. But by turning to Calpol whenever our child is distressed, we contribute to an already rampant culture where problems are supposed to be solved by medication. \u201cWe can forget, in all stages of our lives, the non-drug interventions that are effective, the simple things that we can do,\u201d Green said. \u201cEvery time a GP does an emergency or a turn-up-on-the-day type of surgery, we will get an embarrassed mum in with a child who is running around the room giggling. They will say, \u2018I brought him here because he\u2019s really ill with a temperature, but he\u2019s got better.\u2019 The reason they\u2019ve got better is that they are in an environment that is interesting, and they\u2019ve had a ride in the car or bus or pushchair and cooled off a little bit.\u201d Johnson &amp; Johnson insist the wider Calpol range, with its nasal spray and vapour plug, offers non-drug alternatives for those who want them. But perhaps it would be more useful to look at this the other way round: it\u2019s not so much that we believe the answer to our children\u2019s discomfort is drugs, but that we don\u2019t view Calpol as a drug. It has infiltrated our daily lives and most protected spaces. It is part of solving our babies\u2019 problems in the same way as a dummy, a cuddle or a nappy change is. Many are as likely to reach for Calpol as they are to rock their babies when they are very upset. Some of this is due to clever marketing, which, over decades, has established the brand as a \u201csimple answer\u201d, an \u201ceveryday\u201d part of having kids. Some of this comes from its ubiquity \u2013 the fact that it can be bought at the same time as we buy our loaf of bread or fill the car up with petrol. Calpol has become the brand of medicine that we don\u2019t regard as a drug, no matter what its manufacturers might print on the pack. That is the secret of its success. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

To this day, a complete definition of 4 June 1989 as a historical event has not been realised, because defining a historical event requires not only the full facts but also multiple perspectives. And in its aftermath, the Chinese government intensified its oversight of free expression in China, deploying various tactics to suppress, arrest, detain and imprison anyone who spoke about \u201cJune Fourth\u201d. It remains the most taboo and politically sensitive topic in China, much like the questions of Tibet and Xinjiang for the Chinese Communist party (CCP) and its machine of propaganda and censorship. Yet the facts and significance of \u201cJune Fourth\u201d are not discussed in China.

If the CCP relied on violent revolution to overthrow the previous regime and establish its legitimacy, then \u201cJune Fourth\u201d once again overthrew the legitimacy of the ruling party.

Despite attempts to cover up, whitewash and misinterpret \u201cJune Fourth\u201d over the past 30 years, from the moment the first bullet was fired that day the regime\u2019s legitimacy was compromised.

Viewers in New York probably witnessed a more comprehensive version of the incident than my family in Beijing. In New York, I organised and participated in many demonstrations of solidarity with the students in Tiananmen Square, protested before the Chinese consulate, and took part in a hunger strike at the United Nations.Why does a political power attempt to suppress reality? I have always wondered about totalitarian regimes\u2019 fear of facts. As a political dissident, I insist on seeking the truth and resist attempts to change my memory of events.

The only reason is because they have built their power on unjust foundations. Once facts are established, justice will be restored. And this is the greatest fear of powerful regimes. This is true not only of China, North Korea, or most non-democratic societies, but also some societies with democratic frameworks. When I consider the experience of whistleblowers such as Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/26/prosecuting-julian-assange-for-espionage-poses-danger-freedom-of-press\" title=\"\">Julian Assange</a>, they remind me of my time living in a totalitarian society that suppresses and whitewashes fact, creates no-go zones and fears the light of public disclosure. Even if the lives of an entire generation are wiped out, no prisons and no amount of lies or censorship can expunge or conceal the facts. This is why memory \u2013 individual and collective \u2013 is such an important part of civilisation.

The explosion was so great that one worker instantly thought: \u201cThe Americans!\u201d Here was nuclear war, at last. The force of the explosion tossed the reactor\u2019s massive concrete lid into the air like a penny, leaving its mouth open wide, belching out radiation in a streak of eerie blue light.</p> <p>No ordinary explosion then, and that\u2019s why Luke Hull, a production designer on the series, was committed to ensuring these scenes didn\u2019t resemble a Hollywood disaster flick. During filming in the Ignalina nuclear plant in Lithuania, Hull prowled the set and shook his head at the roaring blazes and leaping sparks, saying: \u201cNah. It looks like Die Hard.\u201d This subtle approach extended elsewhere, with Hull intent on recreating the faded look of the late Soviet era, so instead of pouring his energies into kapow<em> </em>explosions, he focused on \u201clittle decorative bits\u201d that would evoke clunky Soviet style. He scoured the flea markets in Kyiv, and he found old clocks, telephones and ashtrays. While this might sound like a dream for any westerner hunting Soviet chic, Hull recalls the market as a sombre place, filled with old people selling trinkets and, to his mind, relieved to be rid of them. They see no nostalgia in these old things, he says. \u201cThey see the politics, and it\u2019s a period they want to forget.\u201d</p> <p>Costume designer Odile Dicks-Mireaux, meanwhile, was tasked with finding Soviet-era clothing . She learned elites could have obtained good western cloth for suits, but for everyone else it was a life of slippery polyester. To recreate the wan fashions of the era, she sourced contemporary patterns and had outfits made by a Lithuanian tailor who worked during the Soviet era. She also discovered that Ukrainian eBay was a treasure trove, and bought endless scarves, skirts, blouses and boxy old woollen suits. Few of these outfits could be regarded as attractive to a modern western eye but, thankfully, her boss welcomed the piles of gloomy garments. Dicks-Mireaux says: \u201cThe director [Swedish film-maker Johan Renck] really wanted this look \u2013 wanted an ugly, gritty look. He didn\u2019t want it to be glamourised in any way.\u201d</p> <p>The job of Daniel Parker, head of makeup and prosthetics,<strong> </strong>had no such light touches either. His task was to recreate the effect of radiation burns on human skin. Ask Parker what radiation does to the body and he is distressingly blunt. \u201cYou melt,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only way you can really describe it is putting salt on a slug. Tissue is breaking down. Skin just slips off. It\u2019ll just go. One day you move your arm and the skin will just fall off.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"125a9353db04944052b32b1fe5b8b2c920d5fe1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/125a9353db04944052b32b1fe5b8b2c920d5fe1c/0_143_4240_2547/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ulana (Emily Watson in Chernobyl).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ulana (Emily Watson in Chernobyl).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky Atlantic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Surprisingly, Parker didn\u2019t look to photos of Hiroshima or Nagasaki victims for examples of radiation damage, as he suspects these were tempered by wartime propaganda. He went instead to medical textbooks, and this allowed him to pioneer a technique for Chernobyl where he \u201clayered\u201d the skin: painting the actors\u2019 bodies with wounds, then putting a semi-translucent layer on top, giving the impression that sores are forcing themselves to the surface as the body degrades from within. The effect is dreadful to see. Yet, Parker was strict in saying these men must not be relegated to Hollywood \u201czombies\u201d, and he explains that the director made sure sympathy stayed with these characters: even as they lie rigid on the bed, gurgling and fading, they still speak, and a wife may still hold her husband\u2019s rotting fingers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the worst way to die,\u201d says Parker. \u201cBeyond anything you can imagine. The most horrible way to die. I think it\u2019s the worst, in line with medieval torture.\u201d What makes it particularly atrocious is that the victims were denied pain relief. In the latter stages of radiation sickness you cannot inject morphine, he explains. \u201cThe walls of the veins are breaking down.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/may/28/chernobyl-wildlife-haven-tour-belarus-created-nuclear-disaster-zone\">Chernobyl: the wildlife haven created when people left</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So the Chernobyl disaster produced agonising deaths without pain-relieving drugs, which brings us back to the horror of nuclear war.

During filming in the Ignalina nuclear plant in Lithuania, Hull prowled the set and shook his head at the roaring blazes and leaping sparks, saying: \u201cNah. It looks like Die Hard.\u201d This subtle approach extended elsewhere, with Hull intent on recreating the faded look of the late Soviet era, so instead of pouring his energies into kapow explosions, he focused on \u201clittle decorative bits\u201d that would evoke clunky Soviet style. He scoured the flea markets in Kyiv, and he found old clocks, telephones and ashtrays. While this might sound like a dream for any westerner hunting Soviet chic, Hull recalls the market as a sombre place, filled with old people selling trinkets and, to his mind, relieved to be rid of them. They see no nostalgia in these old things, he says. \u201cThey see the politics, and it\u2019s a period they want to forget.\u201d Costume designer Odile Dicks-Mireaux, meanwhile, was tasked with finding Soviet-era clothing . She learned elites could have obtained good western cloth for suits, but for everyone else it was a life of slippery polyester. To recreate the wan fashions of the era, she sourced contemporary patterns and had outfits made by a Lithuanian tailor who worked during the Soviet era. She also discovered that Ukrainian eBay was a treasure trove, and bought endless scarves, skirts, blouses and boxy old woollen suits. Few of these outfits could be regarded as attractive to a modern western eye but, thankfully, her boss welcomed the piles of gloomy garments. Dicks-Mireaux says: \u201cThe director [Swedish film-maker Johan Renck] really wanted this look \u2013 wanted an ugly, gritty look. He didn\u2019t want it to be glamourised in any way.\u201d The job of Daniel Parker, head of makeup and prosthetics, had no such light touches either. His task was to recreate the effect of radiation burns on human skin. Ask Parker what radiation does to the body and he is distressingly blunt. \u201cYou melt,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only way you can really describe it is putting salt on a slug. Tissue is breaking down. Skin just slips off. It\u2019ll just go. One day you move your arm and the skin will just fall off.\u201d Surprisingly, Parker didn\u2019t look to photos of Hiroshima or Nagasaki victims for examples of radiation damage, as he suspects these were tempered by wartime propaganda. He went instead to medical textbooks, and this allowed him to pioneer a technique for Chernobyl where he \u201clayered\u201d the skin: painting the actors\u2019 bodies with wounds, then putting a semi-translucent layer on top, giving the impression that sores are forcing themselves to the surface as the body degrades from within. The effect is dreadful to see. Yet, Parker was strict in saying these men must not be relegated to Hollywood \u201czombies\u201d, and he explains that the director made sure sympathy stayed with these characters: even as they lie rigid on the bed, gurgling and fading, they still speak, and a wife may still hold her husband\u2019s rotting fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst way to die,\u201d says Parker. \u201cBeyond anything you can imagine. The most horrible way to die. I think it\u2019s the worst, in line with medieval torture.\u201d What makes it particularly atrocious is that the victims were denied pain relief. In the latter stages of radiation sickness you cannot inject morphine, he explains. \u201cThe walls of the veins are breaking down.\u201d So the Chernobyl disaster produced agonising deaths without pain-relieving drugs, which brings us back to the horror of nuclear war. Plans for the NHS after a nuclear attack show drug stockpiles would quickly be exhausted, and those who were hopelessly injured would be allowed to die without the tiny mercy of a supermarket paracetamol. Chernobyl is a compelling and brilliantly realised drama, but it\u2019s also a warning \u2013 of the dangers of lies, arrogance and complacency, and of nuclear war itself. The final episode of Chernobyl airs Tuesday, 9pm on Sky Atlantic. The whole series is available to view on Sky Go and NowTV",

It reflects some sort of hostility to women in general.\u201d</p> <p>In the last two decades, women\u2019s voices have grown more conspicuous.</p> <p>Opinions are evenly split between the east and west, with disciples in India representing the conservative arm of Iskcon and those in the western temples having a liberal bent.</p> <p>\u201cAll the early disciples and leaders of the movement were primarily Americans,\u201d Carl says. Now that they\u2019re either retiring or dying, \u201cthe Indians feel like they\u2019re coming of age and need to reformat the movement without all that American influence\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"28edaf0cf2482844bbce6956f44df1b1682276e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28edaf0cf2482844bbce6956f44df1b1682276e4/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On campus at the University of Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On campus at the University of Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Kesl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Controversy and infighting are nothing new for the Hare Krishnas; rather, they\u2019re a common denominator for most guru-worship circles exported from India in the last century, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/07/cult-oregon-1980s-terror-netflix-documentary-wild-country\">Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh</a> and Swami Muktananada, to varying degrees. In the early 90s, the sordid tale of an Iskcon community called New Vrindaban in West Virginia, formerly the largest in North America, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/us/swami-bhaktipada-ex-hare-krishna-leader-dies-at-74.html\">threw the entire religion into crisis after news broke </a>of the temple leader\u2019s involvement in racketeering, sexual abuse and a strongman murder plot. After New Vrindaban more allegations surfaced, and Iskcon elected to internally investigate and disclose its findings of systematic child abuse at various boarding schools across the globe. The organization nearly folded. Members went to jail or declared bankruptcy; others lost their faith.</p> <p>But Iskcon remains the most successful of the various 20th-century religious movements centered around guru-worship and built upon the disillusionment of well-heeled westerners. With roughly 9 million followers worldwide, and wealthy, powerful donors (including Gainesville resident Ambarish Das \u2013 born Alfred Ford \u2013 the heir to the Ford Motor Company) opulent temple sites are still being erected in India today, such as the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium, currently under construction in Mayapur, that was funded in part by Ford\u2019s $35m donation.</p> <p>Alachua, once the site of mass lynching during Reconstruction, is much like any pastoral southern town, with verdant pine forests, rolling glades, and Baptist spires prodding a temperamental sky. But there\u2019s also the mystical side, the less kitschy Cassadaga, with multiple \u201chealing\u201d centers, the Hare Krishna Temple, and the Temple of the Universe, run by bestselling self-help guru (and friend of Oprah) Mickey Singer. The town is filled with seekers. Locals will say one major draw is the convergence of artesian springs, which carries the 10,000-year-old artifacts of Paleo-Indians and some of the purest water on earth.</p> <p>I\u2019d come to speak with one of Iskcon\u2019s venerated female elders. Visakha Dasi, an early disciple of Prabhupada\u2019s \u2013 tall and willowy, with streaky gray hair pulled back tight \u2013 lives with her family in a jungly neighborhood five minutes from the Alachua Temple.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"71e3a6a09c922487a4ae44cf846dd6a05a882f9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71e3a6a09c922487a4ae44cf846dd6a05a882f9d/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Visakha Dasi in her home in Alachua, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visakha Dasi in her home in Alachua, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Kesl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2017, she published a memoir about giving up her career in New York as a photojournalist, meeting Prabhupada in India, and joining the movement. She is thought of by fellow devotees as one of the first to be nominated for the guru position should it be permitted.</p> <p>But she quickly dispels this: \u201cI don\u2019t want to appear like I\u2019m self-serving,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are many qualified women, let me speak on their behalf.\u201d</p> <p>The official position of Iskcon on female gurus was put forth by Anuttama Dasa, global minister of communications and GBC member. \u201cThe role of guru is very sacred,\u201d he says, \u201cand trying to balance a religious tradition with modernity is complicated. The GBC is still trying to come to a consensus, but hasn\u2019t yet.\u201d</p> <p>For now, Anuttama says, there are scarcely any women who openly seek the role, in part because the religion abhors self-serving individualism. But there are plenty of advocates, and younger disciples fighting for women to be their guru. In response to those who claim Visakha is motivated by her own self-interest, Anuttama says: \u201cThat\u2019s nonsense.\u201d</p> <p>In his nigh 50-year career, \u201cI\u2019ve rarely, if ever, seen a woman who was motivated by power or position. I think they\u2019re motivated by the fidelity of the tradition and their concern for future generations of women.\u201d He adds there is parity between men and women in every country where Iskcon operates besides India, which happens to be the spiritual and administrative axis of the religion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7aaec0712e8e93c11f9b68332c5dd8aa95a0ef6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7aaec0712e8e93c11f9b68332c5dd8aa95a0ef6c/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A shrine in the home of Visakha Dasi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A shrine in the home of Visakha Dasi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Kesl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Visakha has been arguing for female gurus for 20 years, and has endured all manner of rebuff, constantly parrying the criticism that she\u2019s a sell-out, a heretic, or, worst of all, a feminist \u2013 a term deeply maligned in the religion. \u201cIf a woman is qualified to lead, then she leads. It\u2019s not very complex,\u201d she tells me. \u201cHowever, there\u2019s all sorts of pushback, very complex pushback.\u201d</p> <p>A main point she makes is the existence of female gurus throughout Indian culture, contemporary and historical. But their presence is often construed as provisional, supplementary, or licentious. One of her most outspoken critics, an American living in Mumbai called Krishna-kirti Dasa, claims that the advanced role of women in Vaishnavi culture corresponded with the sex cults of the 17th and 18th century.</p> <p>He worries that allowing the influence of women to grow will result in similar sexual indulgences. \u201cIf you do allow the unrestricted mixing of men and women, then this is what happens,\u201d he told me. \u201cThis\u201d meaning deviant sex, gender parity and \u201call sorts of abominable things in the name of religion\u201d.</p> <p>Visakha has compiled an arsenal of passages and quotes over the years from Prabhupada\u2019s writings and lectures, which includes his now infamous response to an inquiry about female gurus in 1976: \u201cShe can become guru.\u201d</p> <p>But for every quote that Visakha offers, her critics have a counteracting one, either from Vedic scripture or Prabhupada himself. Prabhupada repeatedly emphasized the importance of gender roles, and the notion that young women needed to be protected in ways that young men didn\u2019t.</p> <p>In 1972, Prabhupada wrote to a female disciple: \u201cYou are married and your husband is striving to become a devotee of KRSNA, so you become his devotee, that is the position of husband and wife \u2026 the wife will take benefit and advance in spiritual life by serving her husband.\u201d</p> <p>Krishna-kirti Dasa recently published a book-length essay full of various other examples. He argues that the meaning of Prabhupada\u2019s words are lost on Visakha, that a woman might be able to become a guru, but she must be an order of magnitude greater than the rest of mankind in order for that to occur. \u201cIt\u2019s that rare,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"break\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">break</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc3bc4b72972a7db345138b7e1c94ec8a0836362\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc3bc4b72972a7db345138b7e1c94ec8a0836362/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kira Janock organizes clothes being given away for free at the Krishna lunch on the Plaza of the Americas on University of Florida\u2019s campus in Gainesville.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kira Janock organizes clothes being given away for free at the Krishna lunch on the Plaza of the Americas on University of Florida\u2019s campus in Gainesville.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Kesl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Kira Janock, now 25,</strong> joined Iskcon and moved into the Krishna House three years ago, after eating lunch on the University of Florida campus and sharing a few encounters with devotees, which she describes as her awakening.</p> <p>She is more optimistic than her fellow disciple Shyamala Engelhart, 33, about the guru impasse. \u201cThere\u2019s people in the movement who want women to become gurus,\u201d she says, \u201cthis actually sounded hopeful.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s possible that Engelhart, who was born into Iskcon, shared that optimism in the past, but she has since developed a coolness towards the subject that can\u2019t be helped. \u201cEver since I was young I would notice the ways in which men and women are treated differently in Iskcon,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the world I knew. The fact that we\u2019re still so behind on this issue, that there\u2019s so much opposition to it, disturbs me.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, Engelhart moved out of the Krishna House and went back to school to pursue a master\u2019s degree in women\u2019s studies. Her thesis is about how women lose social value as they age. \u201cGrowing up in this movement contributed to my interest in the subject,\u201d she says.</p> <p>For Engelhart, the most difficult part is watching the first generation of female disciples age, and potentially never get the chance to lead in the way that she thinks they\u2019re qualified to. These women inspire younger devotees, who would want to be initiated by them if they were allowed. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t get resolved soon,\u201d she says, \u201cthat would be kind of tragic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9e90180920de571c43b788485b616282e3a2f3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9e90180920de571c43b788485b616282e3a2f3a/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Devotees play music and chant during Krishna lunch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Devotees play music and chant during Krishna lunch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Kesl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Admittedly, the role of women in her religion is not one of Visakha\u2019s favorite subjects to discuss. Everyone is fatigued by this minute bickering over hermeneutics. Threats of defection come from both sides of the argument. Carl says that in 47 years of devotion to Iskcon, this is the first issue that\u2019s given him pause, which says a lot, considering the organization\u2019s recent history. To think that a religious order \u2013 believed to be eons in the making, and which at its core preaches that all physical distinctions are illusory \u2013 could splinter on the altar of women\u2019s liberation is nothing if not richly ironic.</p> <p>Early in Visakha\u2019s book she quotes Prabhupada, one of the first times she encountered him. He says: \u201cSimply by arguing and reasoning you cannot make spiritual advancement \u2026 you cannot understand the absolute truth by argument, by material dealings.\u201d</p> <p>But consensus eludes them, and now they resort to arguing and reasoning. With this passage one also gleans the inner conflict: how isolating and difficult it must be for Visakha and the others to uphold these spiritual principles yet also fight for cultural progress. In other words, to nourish the soul, while at the same time litigate for the body.</p>",

In 1965 in Manhattan\u2019s East Village, he founded the Hare Krishna movement \u2013 formally known as the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, or Iskcon \u2013 which is based on an ancient monotheistic strain of Hinduism and whose followers worship Krishna as the supreme being, the highest form of divinity. They chant his name thousands of times throughout the day. Sitting at the base of the statue are Kalakantha Das and Brahmatirtha (birth names Carl and Bob, from Albuquerque and Newark, respectively), who met Prabhupada in the early 70s. By then, the guru\u2019s following had grown from a critical mass of disaffected youngsters to tens of thousands of people from all walks of life at communes across America, including Gainesville, where land was relatively cheap and abundant. He told a small group of devotees to start a lunch program on the university campus there to attract interest. It has continued for 48 years, serving roughly 1,000 students, faculty members and Gainesville residents vegetarian meals for a five-dollar donation every day school is in session. Devotees proliferated in Gainesville and a neighboring rural town called Alachua \u2013 home to the Alachua Hare Krishna Temple, a 122-acre ranch with its own cattle pastures, eco-farms, housing, elementary and high schools \u2013 buying property, opening temples and starting families. Carl and Bob have been recruiting devotees since 1977, the year Prabhupada died. Carl is now a guru himself, and the Krishna House chaplain. Bob sits on its board of directors. Carl recently returned from India, where he discussed with fellow clergymen a topic that has starkly divided the close-knit, ascetic group: whether or not women will ever be allowed to become gurus, one of the highest callings in their faith. A resolution was supposed to be reached during Carl\u2019s trip to Mayapur in February for the annual meeting of the Governing Body Commission (GBC), which functions like a board of directors with 35 members, two of whom are female. Instead, \u201cthey kicked the can down the road another six months because of pressure from the Indian temples\u201d. Those temple leaders threatened that if women are allowed to become gurus \u201cthey\u2019re going to separate from the organization\u201d. The role of women in Iskcon (about half of devotees) has been a bone of contention since its founding. \u201cMany of our sisters grew up feeling like they have to be in the back, like they couldn\u2019t be public speakers,\u201d Carl says. \u201cMy honest opinion is it\u2019s latent misogyny. It reflects some sort of hostility to women in general.\u201d In the last two decades, women\u2019s voices have grown more conspicuous. Opinions are evenly split between the east and west, with disciples in India representing the conservative arm of Iskcon and those in the western temples having a liberal bent. \u201cAll the early disciples and leaders of the movement were primarily Americans,\u201d Carl says. Now that they\u2019re either retiring or dying, \u201cthe Indians feel like they\u2019re coming of age and need to reformat the movement without all that American influence\u201d. Controversy and infighting are nothing new for the Hare Krishnas; rather, they\u2019re a common denominator for most guru-worship circles exported from India in the last century, such as the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and Swami Muktananada, to varying degrees. In the early 90s, the sordid tale of an Iskcon community called New Vrindaban in West Virginia, formerly the largest in North America, threw the entire religion into crisis after news broke of the temple leader\u2019s involvement in racketeering, sexual abuse and a strongman murder plot. After New Vrindaban more allegations surfaced, and Iskcon elected to internally investigate and disclose its findings of systematic child abuse at various boarding schools across the globe. The organization nearly folded. Members went to jail or declared bankruptcy; others lost their faith. But Iskcon remains the most successful of the various 20th-century religious movements centered around guru-worship and built upon the disillusionment of well-heeled westerners. With roughly 9 million followers worldwide, and wealthy, powerful donors (including Gainesville resident Ambarish Das \u2013 born Alfred Ford \u2013 the heir to the Ford Motor Company) opulent temple sites are still being erected in India today, such as the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium, currently under construction in Mayapur, that was funded in part by Ford\u2019s $35m donation. Alachua, once the site of mass lynching during Reconstruction, is much like any pastoral southern town, with verdant pine forests, rolling glades, and Baptist spires prodding a temperamental sky. But there\u2019s also the mystical side, the less kitschy Cassadaga, with multiple \u201chealing\u201d centers, the Hare Krishna Temple, and the Temple of the Universe, run by bestselling self-help guru (and friend of Oprah) Mickey Singer. The town is filled with seekers. Locals will say one major draw is the convergence of artesian springs, which carries the 10,000-year-old artifacts of Paleo-Indians and some of the purest water on earth. I\u2019d come to speak with one of Iskcon\u2019s venerated female elders. Visakha Dasi, an early disciple of Prabhupada\u2019s \u2013 tall and willowy, with streaky gray hair pulled back tight \u2013 lives with her family in a jungly neighborhood five minutes from the Alachua Temple. In 2017, she published a memoir about giving up her career in New York as a photojournalist, meeting Prabhupada in India, and joining the movement. She is thought of by fellow devotees as one of the first to be nominated for the guru position should it be permitted. But she quickly dispels this: \u201cI don\u2019t want to appear like I\u2019m self-serving,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are many qualified women, let me speak on their behalf.\u201d The official position of Iskcon on female gurus was put forth by Anuttama Dasa, global minister of communications and GBC member. \u201cThe role of guru is very sacred,\u201d he says, \u201cand trying to balance a religious tradition with modernity is complicated. The GBC is still trying to come to a consensus, but hasn\u2019t yet.\u201d For now, Anuttama says, there are scarcely any women who openly seek the role, in part because the religion abhors self-serving individualism. But there are plenty of advocates, and younger disciples fighting for women to be their guru. In response to those who claim Visakha is motivated by her own self-interest, Anuttama says: \u201cThat\u2019s nonsense.\u201d In his nigh 50-year career, \u201cI\u2019ve rarely, if ever, seen a woman who was motivated by power or position. I think they\u2019re motivated by the fidelity of the tradition and their concern for future generations of women.\u201d He adds there is parity between men and women in every country where Iskcon operates besides India, which happens to be the spiritual and administrative axis of the religion. Visakha has been arguing for female gurus for 20 years, and has endured all manner of rebuff, constantly parrying the criticism that she\u2019s a sell-out, a heretic, or, worst of all, a feminist \u2013 a term deeply maligned in the religion. \u201cIf a woman is qualified to lead, then she leads. It\u2019s not very complex,\u201d she tells me. \u201cHowever, there\u2019s all sorts of pushback, very complex pushback.\u201d A main point she makes is the existence of female gurus throughout Indian culture, contemporary and historical. But their presence is often construed as provisional, supplementary, or licentious. One of her most outspoken critics, an American living in Mumbai called Krishna-kirti Dasa, claims that the advanced role of women in Vaishnavi culture corresponded with the sex cults of the 17th and 18th century. He worries that allowing the influence of women to grow will result in similar sexual indulgences. \u201cIf you do allow the unrestricted mixing of men and women, then this is what happens,\u201d he told me. \u201cThis\u201d meaning deviant sex, gender parity and \u201call sorts of abominable things in the name of religion\u201d. Visakha has compiled an arsenal of passages and quotes over the years from Prabhupada\u2019s writings and lectures, which includes his now infamous response to an inquiry about female gurus in 1976: \u201cShe can become guru.\u201d But for every quote that Visakha offers, her critics have a counteracting one, either from Vedic scripture or Prabhupada himself. Prabhupada repeatedly emphasized the importance of gender roles, and the notion that young women needed to be protected in ways that young men didn\u2019t. In 1972, Prabhupada wrote to a female disciple: \u201cYou are married and your husband is striving to become a devotee of KRSNA, so you become his devotee, that is the position of husband and wife \u2026 the wife will take benefit and advance in spiritual life by serving her husband.\u201d Krishna-kirti Dasa recently published a book-length essay full of various other examples. He argues that the meaning of Prabhupada\u2019s words are lost on Visakha, that a woman might be able to become a guru, but she must be an order of magnitude greater than the rest of mankind in order for that to occur. \u201cIt\u2019s that rare,\u201d he says. Kira Janock, now 25, joined Iskcon and moved into the Krishna House three years ago, after eating lunch on the University of Florida campus and sharing a few encounters with devotees, which she describes as her awakening. She is more optimistic than her fellow disciple Shyamala Engelhart, 33, about the guru impasse. \u201cThere\u2019s people in the movement who want women to become gurus,\u201d she says, \u201cthis actually sounded hopeful.\u201d It\u2019s possible that Engelhart, who was born into Iskcon, shared that optimism in the past, but she has since developed a coolness towards the subject that can\u2019t be helped. \u201cEver since I was young I would notice the ways in which men and women are treated differently in Iskcon,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the world I knew. The fact that we\u2019re still so behind on this issue, that there\u2019s so much opposition to it, disturbs me.\u201d In 2016, Engelhart moved out of the Krishna House and went back to school to pursue a master\u2019s degree in women\u2019s studies. Her thesis is about how women lose social value as they age. \u201cGrowing up in this movement contributed to my interest in the subject,\u201d she says. For Engelhart, the most difficult part is watching the first generation of female disciples age, and potentially never get the chance to lead in the way that she thinks they\u2019re qualified to. These women inspire younger devotees, who would want to be initiated by them if they were allowed. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t get resolved soon,\u201d she says, \u201cthat would be kind of tragic.\u201d Admittedly, the role of women in her religion is not one of Visakha\u2019s favorite subjects to discuss. Everyone is fatigued by this minute bickering over hermeneutics. Threats of defection come from both sides of the argument. Carl says that in 47 years of devotion to Iskcon, this is the first issue that\u2019s given him pause, which says a lot, considering the organization\u2019s recent history. To think that a religious order \u2013 believed to be eons in the making, and which at its core preaches that all physical distinctions are illusory \u2013 could splinter on the altar of women\u2019s liberation is nothing if not richly ironic. Early in Visakha\u2019s book she quotes Prabhupada, one of the first times she encountered him. He says: \u201cSimply by arguing and reasoning you cannot make spiritual advancement \u2026 you cannot understand the absolute truth by argument, by material dealings.\u201d But consensus eludes them, and now they resort to arguing and reasoning. With this passage one also gleans the inner conflict: how isolating and difficult it must be for Visakha and the others to uphold these spiritual principles yet also fight for cultural progress. In other words, to nourish the soul, while at the same time litigate for the body.",

      "body": "<p>Retirement used to be thought of as a soft slide into a more peaceful life. After a lifetime of hard grind, the daydream went, retirees would gratefully swap the office for a potting shed, a suit for slippers and commuting for a cruise.</p> <p>But the face of protest has changed. From environmental issues to this week\u2019s protests against Donald Trump, older people are often at the forefront, not just taking to the streets but taking direct, radical action.</p> <p>It makes perfect sense: many older people are concerned about leaving a better world for their grandchildren. Others feel liberated from fears that their career and CVs could be damaged by political action. Older activists can say what they want and take risks they wouldn\u2019t have dared to when a family, a mortgage and a career relied on them keeping their nose clean.</p> <p>But the baby boomers, who helped remake society in the 1960s and 70s \u2013 through feminism, anti-discrimination battles, the rights of disabled people, equal pay, the climate crisis and the rights of the LGBT community \u2013 were always likely to be more passionate about politics and protests than their parents\u2019 generation. Equipped with unprecedented amounts of time, money and motivation \u2013 and with longer and healthier lifespans \u2013 this new generation of retirees are leading the way.</p> <h2><strong>Moyra Samuels, 62</strong><strong>, London</strong></h2> <p>When I woke up at 1.30am on 14 June 2017 and ran over to Grenfell Tower, I had never seen such a horrific and scary thing in my life. I come from South Africa. Apartheid bred violence, and I had seen people stabbed, shot and killed. But this was far, far worse. I stood there and cried and cried and cried.</p> <p>I\u2019m the project manager for Justice4Grenfell. My job is to build relationships with the trade unions and I work endlessly to get not just the unions to affiliate with us, but other groups, too. I have a lot of anger in my work. Anger can be destructive but I channel mine. I focus it and, when appropriate, I broker peace so that we can move forward to our goals. These are seeing those responsible for Grenfell prosecuted and creating a legacy for the next generation so they won\u2019t be subject to the same regulations, attitudes to housing, racism and anti-immigration feelings.</p> <p>I came to the UK when I was 23. I was a teacher but, eight years later, in 1987, I joined the Socialist Workers\u2019 party and, since then, have campaigned on all the big issues and local ones, too. Getting older has had a big impact on my campaigning. As an older woman, you lose all that self-consciousness about being seen, about wanting to please people and about fearing authority. That means you can be far more radical, speak truth to power. It also gives you a much more steely determination.</p> <p>Ageing also means that, as an activist, I have lots of life experience to pull on. I have a broader picture and a more thoughtful approach. But I\u2019m less idealistic. When I was younger, I would probably have refused to talk to, say, a Tory councillor. Now, I know I have to engage.</p> <p>I\u2019m never shocked \u2013 which means I can focus on the fight. I lived through the racism of the 70s and 80s, so I can say that one reason the Grenfell survivors and campaigners are not being listened to is because of racism: it\u2019s because we\u2019re not white. I\u2019m confident to say that because I\u2019ve lived it. I can call it, and I do.</p> <h2><strong>Oliver Baines, 68, St Austell, Cornwall</strong></h2> <p>I took part in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/17/thousands-gather-to-block-london-bridges-in-climate-rebellion\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a>\u2019s occupation in Blackfriars last November. It was my first experience of direct action, but I had decided I had to do something dramatic because the environment is in a state of such crisis. When the bridges protest didn\u2019t make any headlines, a few of us decided we needed to do something more attention-grabbing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/01/semi-naked-climate-protesters-disrupt-brexit-debate\" title=\"\">I was one of those who </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/01/semi-naked-climate-protesters-disrupt-brexit-debate\" title=\"\">stripped naked</a> at the door of the public gallery at the House of Commons to delay the police reaching the protesters gluing themselves to the gallery. The police had to escort me out, giving the glue time to dry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f948f89fad03e87c14dac341e5a5c42813df6ec0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f948f89fad03e87c14dac341e5a5c42813df6ec0/0_332_6438_3863/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Extinction Rebellion activist Oliver Baines in Truro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Extinction Rebellion activist Oliver Baines in Truro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I would not have done this when I was younger. I deferred to authority too much. But it\u2019s easy for me now: I have nothing to lose. If they want to put me in jail, they can put me in jail. Because of my age, I feel responsible for being part of a system that has got us to this place of environmental crisis. I also know what a short time there is to do anything about this because I measure it against my own life. Being older helps the protest, too. I think it helps the public empathise when they see mature faces at the front of the protest. We\u2019re harder to dismiss than students.</p> <h2><strong>Harry Schindler, 97, Porto d\u2019Ascoli</strong></h2> <p><em>Retiring from his job as a trade unionist in London in 1982, Schindler moved to Italy, the country he landed in as a soldier in the British army</em><em> in 1944</em><em>. His subsequent effort</em><em> to identify, for their families, the places where fellow servicemen perished in battle won him an MBE and was made into a film.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"128ec9ac44c8da7ee5e61122c34711499931a8f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/128ec9ac44c8da7ee5e61122c34711499931a8f4/185_279_2767_1661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Shindler at his MBE award ceremony in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Shindler at his MBE award ceremony in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: British Embassy Rome</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been fighting since before the EU referendum result for justice because the vote was discriminatory and illegal. I, and more than 1 million other British expatriates, were denied a vote because of the 15-year time limit on British expats being able to register as overseas voters.</p> <p>My age gives me a big advantage: I\u2019ve been up this road before. The fact that I was around in 1933 as Hitler and Germany rose to power means that I can see the analogy between then and now: between this division, between all the political powers and what happened then in Germany.</p> <p>My age has not had the slightest impact on my brain power. When we get a new government in Britain, I\u2019m going to send my letter again to demand that the promise to give expats a vote made by David Cameron, the Queen and included in the Tory manifesto is finally fulfilled. I\u2019m not giving up on this. There\u2019s no chance of that.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Wanda Garner, 67, </strong><strong>Llanfair PG, Wales</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"83a4c5cdace24e31cdc0b86b45820c553388a820\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83a4c5cdace24e31cdc0b86b45820c553388a820/0_245_2400_3000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Wanda Garner.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wanda Garner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Garner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was an art teacher and had always been politically aware, but as a teacher you just don\u2019t have any spare time. When Jo Cox was murdered three years ago, that was the starting point. I just thought we should be doing more to bring people together and, by sheer fluke, somebody I knew through my regular choir said they were going to start up a street choir to sing at political gatherings.</p> <p>It\u2019s called Canwyr Stryd Bangor Street Singers. A group went to London to join the climate crisis demonstration and we did something for the youth climate strike on Bangor High Street at the end of May. Peace is the common thread. I wish I\u2019d done it before, but I\u2019m glad I\u2019m able to do it now. As long as I\u2019ve got breath I\u2019m going to be saying something, to change people\u2019s minds, hopefully.</p> <p>We don\u2019t want to be strident, but sometimes you need to be. On Monday, a core group of 10 to 20 of us will be singing loud and clear against Trump in Bangor, for about an hour. I think he represents all the worst aspects of our society so I think it\u2019s important to protest against him. We\u2019ll be handing out song sheets so people can join in and sing with us. My husband, David, says he\u2019d rather poke his eyes out than sing, but he\u2019ll come along and hold banners. And he\u2019s good at shouting.</p> <h2><strong>Maxie Hayes, 75, Birmingham</strong></h2> <p>I officially retired 10 years ago, but my phone never stops ringing. My age has made me more effective and focused. I\u2019m also keener to collaborate and look back rather than just running around and looking forward. That means I plan better: I\u2019m not just reactive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77bca9a251ac277e9c6f5fedda61b43cded04136\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77bca9a251ac277e9c6f5fedda61b43cded04136/385_209_4473_2684/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maxie Hayes, campaigner and coordinator of Labour\u2019s BAME group in Birmingham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maxie Hayes, campaigner and coordinator of Labour\u2019s BAME group in Birmingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Fox/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m the Birmingham coordinator of the BAME group of the Labour party and I\u2019m chairing their Windrush day of action on 22 June. I\u2019m chair of the Momentum black committee, a member of the Birmingham foster carers association, the Justin Webster campaign, and the Black Activists Rising Against Cuts group. I\u2019m heavily involved in my church and my community. I also help anyone who is in trouble and can\u2019t afford legal fees.</p> <p>These days I\u2019m less headstrong and I think about my legacy in terms of acting strategically to develop young people. Because my head is not so hot now, I can talk to young people in a lighter way that\u2019s more productive than when I was more radical and just wanted people to do what I wanted them to do. Now I\u2019m more holistic: if I can teach younger people what I know now, they can apply it as they want to as they go through life. I intend to carry on as long as I possibly can \u2013 for as long as I see injustice and see how I can help young people.</p> <h2><strong>Elaine Hague</strong><strong>, 6</strong><strong>1, Stoke on Trent</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m just an ordinary working-class woman. My husband, Terry, and I planned to retire together in 2017 when I was 60 and Terry was 67.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f3d8112f56454572c103cfe3450d43554334296\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f3d8112f56454572c103cfe3450d43554334296/160_356_5266_3159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elaine Hague and her husband, Terry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elaine Hague and her husband, Terry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Cherry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That was the star in the sky for us. Then, when I was 58, a woman at work said I wouldn\u2019t be able to collect my pension until I was 66. I didn\u2019t think it could be true: I\u2019d received no letter or notification. Terry and I were horrified to discover she was right. I worked on for a bit but the arthritis was making it harder all the time. Then I found the BackTo60 campaign on the computer and realised I wasn\u2019t alone.</p> <p>I knew nothing of social media. I thought Twitter was for the birds and tablets were what you took for high blood pressure. Now I\u2019m on it all the time, rallying the group, arranging and organising. I write to my MP, I ring radio stations, Terry and I regularly go to London for the rallies. In October 2017, Terry had a heart attack. He\u2019s never been ill a day in his life: it\u2019s the stress of this struggle that caused it. I retired when he got ill but I\u2019m constantly fighting. I should be kicking back and relaxing but instead, I\u2019m ageing and raging.</p> <p>I wake up angry and I go to bed angry. The government has stolen \u00a350,000 from me in these six years. This fight is being waged by widows, by women with sick husbands and by women with their own failing health. These should be our golden years but we\u2019re having to waste them by fighting for what is rightfully ours.</p> <h2><strong>Rosemary Blenkinsop</strong><strong>, 68, Wirksworth, Derbyshire</strong></h2> <p>I experienced my first arrest at an Extinction Rebellion protest at Easter.

I\u2019ve done non-violent direct action (NVDA) training, funerals for the future, \u201cdie-ins\u201d in city centres, leafletting outside banks and stalls in my local marketplace to spread information.</p> <p>Preparing for the mass rebellion in London in April was nerve-racking.

      "bodyText": "Retirement used to be thought of as a soft slide into a more peaceful life. After a lifetime of hard grind, the daydream went, retirees would gratefully swap the office for a potting shed, a suit for slippers and commuting for a cruise. But the face of protest has changed. From environmental issues to this week\u2019s protests against Donald Trump, older people are often at the forefront, not just taking to the streets but taking direct, radical action. It makes perfect sense: many older people are concerned about leaving a better world for their grandchildren. Others feel liberated from fears that their career and CVs could be damaged by political action. Older activists can say what they want and take risks they wouldn\u2019t have dared to when a family, a mortgage and a career relied on them keeping their nose clean. But the baby boomers, who helped remake society in the 1960s and 70s \u2013 through feminism, anti-discrimination battles, the rights of disabled people, equal pay, the climate crisis and the rights of the LGBT community \u2013 were always likely to be more passionate about politics and protests than their parents\u2019 generation. Equipped with unprecedented amounts of time, money and motivation \u2013 and with longer and healthier lifespans \u2013 this new generation of retirees are leading the way. Moyra Samuels, 62, London When I woke up at 1.30am on 14 June 2017 and ran over to Grenfell Tower, I had never seen such a horrific and scary thing in my life. I come from South Africa. Apartheid bred violence, and I had seen people stabbed, shot and killed. But this was far, far worse. I stood there and cried and cried and cried. I\u2019m the project manager for Justice4Grenfell. My job is to build relationships with the trade unions and I work endlessly to get not just the unions to affiliate with us, but other groups, too. I have a lot of anger in my work. Anger can be destructive but I channel mine. I focus it and, when appropriate, I broker peace so that we can move forward to our goals. These are seeing those responsible for Grenfell prosecuted and creating a legacy for the next generation so they won\u2019t be subject to the same regulations, attitudes to housing, racism and anti-immigration feelings. I came to the UK when I was 23. I was a teacher but, eight years later, in 1987, I joined the Socialist Workers\u2019 party and, since then, have campaigned on all the big issues and local ones, too. Getting older has had a big impact on my campaigning. As an older woman, you lose all that self-consciousness about being seen, about wanting to please people and about fearing authority. That means you can be far more radical, speak truth to power. It also gives you a much more steely determination. Ageing also means that, as an activist, I have lots of life experience to pull on. I have a broader picture and a more thoughtful approach. But I\u2019m less idealistic. When I was younger, I would probably have refused to talk to, say, a Tory councillor. Now, I know I have to engage. I\u2019m never shocked \u2013 which means I can focus on the fight. I lived through the racism of the 70s and 80s, so I can say that one reason the Grenfell survivors and campaigners are not being listened to is because of racism: it\u2019s because we\u2019re not white. I\u2019m confident to say that because I\u2019ve lived it. I can call it, and I do. Oliver Baines, 68, St Austell, Cornwall I took part in Extinction Rebellion\u2019s occupation in Blackfriars last November. It was my first experience of direct action, but I had decided I had to do something dramatic because the environment is in a state of such crisis. When the bridges protest didn\u2019t make any headlines, a few of us decided we needed to do something more attention-grabbing. I was one of those who stripped naked at the door of the public gallery at the House of Commons to delay the police reaching the protesters gluing themselves to the gallery. The police had to escort me out, giving the glue time to dry. I would not have done this when I was younger. I deferred to authority too much. But it\u2019s easy for me now: I have nothing to lose. If they want to put me in jail, they can put me in jail. Because of my age, I feel responsible for being part of a system that has got us to this place of environmental crisis. I also know what a short time there is to do anything about this because I measure it against my own life. Being older helps the protest, too. I think it helps the public empathise when they see mature faces at the front of the protest. We\u2019re harder to dismiss than students. Harry Schindler, 97, Porto d\u2019Ascoli Retiring from his job as a trade unionist in London in 1982, Schindler moved to Italy, the country he landed in as a soldier in the British army in 1944. His subsequent effort to identify, for their families, the places where fellow servicemen perished in battle won him an MBE and was made into a film. I\u2019ve been fighting since before the EU referendum result for justice because the vote was discriminatory and illegal. I, and more than 1 million other British expatriates, were denied a vote because of the 15-year time limit on British expats being able to register as overseas voters. My age gives me a big advantage: I\u2019ve been up this road before. The fact that I was around in 1933 as Hitler and Germany rose to power means that I can see the analogy between then and now: between this division, between all the political powers and what happened then in Germany. My age has not had the slightest impact on my brain power. When we get a new government in Britain, I\u2019m going to send my letter again to demand that the promise to give expats a vote made by David Cameron, the Queen and included in the Tory manifesto is finally fulfilled. I\u2019m not giving up on this. There\u2019s no chance of that.\u201d Wanda Garner, 67, Llanfair PG, Wales I was an art teacher and had always been politically aware, but as a teacher you just don\u2019t have any spare time. When Jo Cox was murdered three years ago, that was the starting point. I just thought we should be doing more to bring people together and, by sheer fluke, somebody I knew through my regular choir said they were going to start up a street choir to sing at political gatherings. It\u2019s called Canwyr Stryd Bangor Street Singers. A group went to London to join the climate crisis demonstration and we did something for the youth climate strike on Bangor High Street at the end of May. Peace is the common thread. I wish I\u2019d done it before, but I\u2019m glad I\u2019m able to do it now. As long as I\u2019ve got breath I\u2019m going to be saying something, to change people\u2019s minds, hopefully. We don\u2019t want to be strident, but sometimes you need to be. On Monday, a core group of 10 to 20 of us will be singing loud and clear against Trump in Bangor, for about an hour. I think he represents all the worst aspects of our society so I think it\u2019s important to protest against him. We\u2019ll be handing out song sheets so people can join in and sing with us. My husband, David, says he\u2019d rather poke his eyes out than sing, but he\u2019ll come along and hold banners. And he\u2019s good at shouting. Maxie Hayes, 75, Birmingham I officially retired 10 years ago, but my phone never stops ringing. My age has made me more effective and focused. I\u2019m also keener to collaborate and look back rather than just running around and looking forward. That means I plan better: I\u2019m not just reactive. I\u2019m the Birmingham coordinator of the BAME group of the Labour party and I\u2019m chairing their Windrush day of action on 22 June. I\u2019m chair of the Momentum black committee, a member of the Birmingham foster carers association, the Justin Webster campaign, and the Black Activists Rising Against Cuts group. I\u2019m heavily involved in my church and my community. I also help anyone who is in trouble and can\u2019t afford legal fees. These days I\u2019m less headstrong and I think about my legacy in terms of acting strategically to develop young people. Because my head is not so hot now, I can talk to young people in a lighter way that\u2019s more productive than when I was more radical and just wanted people to do what I wanted them to do. Now I\u2019m more holistic: if I can teach younger people what I know now, they can apply it as they want to as they go through life. I intend to carry on as long as I possibly can \u2013 for as long as I see injustice and see how I can help young people. Elaine Hague, 61, Stoke on Trent I\u2019m just an ordinary working-class woman. My husband, Terry, and I planned to retire together in 2017 when I was 60 and Terry was 67. That was the star in the sky for us. Then, when I was 58, a woman at work said I wouldn\u2019t be able to collect my pension until I was 66. I didn\u2019t think it could be true: I\u2019d received no letter or notification. Terry and I were horrified to discover she was right. I worked on for a bit but the arthritis was making it harder all the time. Then I found the BackTo60 campaign on the computer and realised I wasn\u2019t alone. I knew nothing of social media. I thought Twitter was for the birds and tablets were what you took for high blood pressure. Now I\u2019m on it all the time, rallying the group, arranging and organising. I write to my MP, I ring radio stations, Terry and I regularly go to London for the rallies. In October 2017, Terry had a heart attack. He\u2019s never been ill a day in his life: it\u2019s the stress of this struggle that caused it. I retired when he got ill but I\u2019m constantly fighting. I should be kicking back and relaxing but instead, I\u2019m ageing and raging. I wake up angry and I go to bed angry. The government has stolen \u00a350,000 from me in these six years. This fight is being waged by widows, by women with sick husbands and by women with their own failing health. These should be our golden years but we\u2019re having to waste them by fighting for what is rightfully ours. Rosemary Blenkinsop, 68, Wirksworth, Derbyshire I experienced my first arrest at an Extinction Rebellion protest at Easter. I was a psychotherapist but now, as an older person with pensions, I am able to support all sorts of excellent innovative environmental projects. I\u2019ve become highly politicised in my retirement. I\u2019ve done non-violent direct action (NVDA) training, funerals for the future, \u201cdie-ins\u201d in city centres, leafletting outside banks and stalls in my local marketplace to spread information. Preparing for the mass rebellion in London in April was nerve-racking. We set up an affinity group and met in my home to prepare for how the police would behave: would we be kettled, would they bring horses to trample us, would enough other rebels turn out? But, in fact, all went wonderfully well. I had made the decision at my NVDA training to be an \u201carrestable\u201d, and three of our group were indeed arrested. I was treated well by the remarkably youthful police constables sent to arrest us. My arresting constable showed me pictures of his baby daughter and we shook hands warmly when he left me in my cell: we had come to respect each other. I am sure being older helped, although my ageing bones found the bench very hard and I was continually worried about my bad back. I am very happy to carry on putting my liberty on the line for such a great cause. Additional reporting by Leo Benedictus.",

Rasmussen\u2019s Liberal party and the Social Democrats have both backed widely criticised measures on immigration, arguing they are needed to protect Denmark\u2019s generous \u2013 if increasingly creaking \u2013 welfare system and to integrate migrants and refugees already in the country. But discrimination cases are up and the number of racially or religiously motivated hate crimes registered by Danish police \u2013 which is likely to be lower than the actual figure because not all incidents are reported \u2013 surged to 365 in 2017 from 228 the year before.

The Social Democrats have also won support by promising to increase public spending due to widespread anger in Denmark at what many voters see as the gradual erosion of the welfare state. Cuts to healthcare services have led to the closure of one-quarter of state hospitals in the past decade, and one recent survey showed more than half of Danes did not believe the public health service offered the right treatments, prompting more than one-third to take out private health insurance, compared with 4% in 2003. Other cuts over the past 10 years have led to the closure of about one-fifth of state schools, while spending per person on services such as care homes, cleaning and rehabilitation after illness for the over-65s has fallen by one-quarter.

      "bodyText": "The Australian federal police have raided the home of News Corp Australia journalist Annika Smethurst investigating the publication of a leaked plan to allow government spying on Australians. On Tuesday police executed a warrant investigating the \u201calleged publishing of information classified as an official secret\u201d which they said had the potential to undermine Australia\u2019s national security. The warrant from an ACT magistrate gave police authority to search the home, computer and mobile phone of the News Corp Sunday titles\u2019 political editor. The raid prompted outrage from News Corp Australia, which labelled it a \u201cdangerous act of intimidation\u201d targeted at public interest reporting. In April 2018 Smethurst reported that the heads of the defence and home affairs ministries had discussed draconian new powers to allow the Australian Signals Directorate to spy on Australian citizens for the first time. Under the mooted plan, spies would be allowed to secretly access emails, bank accounts and text messages with approval from the defence and home affairs ministers. Under current laws the Australian federal police and domestic spy agency Asio have the power to investigate Australians with a warrant and seek technical advice from ASD, which is not permitted to produce intelligence on Australians. In a statement the AFP confirmed it had executed a search warrant at a residence in an ACT suburb on Tuesday. \u201cThe matter relates to an investigation into the alleged unauthorised disclosure of national security information that was referred to the AFP,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cThis warrant relates to the alleged publishing of information classified as an official secret, which is an extremely serious matter that has the potential to undermine Australia\u2019s national security. \u201cNo arrests are expected today as a result of this activity.\u201d In a statement News Corp Australia described the raid as \u201coutrageous and heavy-handed\u201d. \u201cThe Australian public\u2019s right to know information about government laws that could impact their lives is of fundamental importance in our society,\u201d it said. \u201cThis raid demonstrates a dangerous act of intimidation towards those committed to telling uncomfortable truths.\u201d News Corp Australia said it had \u201cexpressed the most serious concerns\u201d about erosion of the Australian public\u2019s right to know about government decisions that \u201ccan and will impact ordinary Australian citizens\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s gone on this morning sends clear and dangerous signals to journalists and newsrooms across Australia. This will chill public interest reporting.\u201d Digital Rights Watch chairman, Tim Singleton Norton, said it was \u201cincredibly worrying\u201d to see a raid investigating a public interest issue of \u201cpotential massive expansion of domestic capacity in Australian spy agencies\u201d. \u201cWe fear that the powers given to the AFP to seize and search Annika Smethurst\u2019s digital footprint represent a considerable risk to bold Australians who choose to expose wrongdoing in the public services,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a gross abuse of national security powers \u2013 using them to reinforce a culture of secrecy and lack of accountability in our law enforcement apparatus.\u201d Australian law prohibits unauthorised disclosure of information by commonwealth officers, an offence which gives police powers to investigate leaks informing public interest journalism. Australia also has offences which make it unlawful for non-commonwealth officers to communicate or deal with information that has a security classification of secret or top secret or \u201cdamages the security or defence of Australia\u201d. Journalists have a defence of dealing with protected information where they \u201creasonably believe\u201d it is in the public interest to do so, but the media union has warned the law still effectively criminalises journalism. Police have conducted raids investigating leaks about the national broadband network, Peter Dutton\u2019s ministerial intervention in the case of two foreign au pairs, and foreign targets of Australia\u2019s spying.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian National University is in damage control after discovering a major data breach a fortnight ago in which a \u201csignificant\u201d amount of staff and student information was accessed by a \u201csophisticated operator\u201d. The university has confirmed an estimated 200,000 people have been affected by the hack, based on student numbers each year and staff turnover. In a message to staff and students, vice-chancellor Brian Schmidt said someone illegally accessed the university\u2019s systems in late 2018. \u201cWe believe there was unauthorised access to significant amounts of personal staff, student and visitor data extending back 19 years,\u201d Schmidt said. Information accessed in the data breach includes: names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, personal email addresses, emergency contact details, tax file numbers, payroll information, bank account details, passport details and student academic records. The university said stored credit card details, travel information, medical records, police checks, workers\u2019 compensation, vehicle registration numbers and some performance records have not been affected. \u201cWe have no evidence that research work has been affected,\u201d Schmidt said. ANU is working closely with Australian government security agencies and industry security partners to investigate the attack further, he added. Last July, Australia\u2019s top-ranked university said it had spent several months fighting off a threat to its computer systems, with reports hackers were traced to China. \u201cFollowing the incident reported last year, we undertook a range of upgrades to our systems to better protect our data. Had it not been for those upgrades, we would not have detected this incident,\u201d Schmidt said. Cyber security expert Greg Austin from the University of New South Wales said universities in Australia are a prime target. He characterised the scale of this attack in the middle to top end. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say states, major powers with cyber espionage capabilities do target universities \u2026 because the elites of various countries attend those universities,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. The academic said some foreign students studying in Australia would be the sons and daughters of overseas power-brokers or future leaders themselves. Austin said corporations under cyber attack often become quite disorientated by the experience and are unsure whether to double or triple their investment in cyber security. \u201cOne can\u2019t necessarily blame ANU in a sense, these sort of attacks, if they\u2019re a sophisticated foreign government, they will get this sort of information that\u2019s been stolen by hook or by crook,\u201d he said. The Australian Cyber Security Centre confirmed it is working with ANU to secure the networks, protect users and investigate the full extent of the compromise. \u201cThis compromise is a salient reminder that the cyber threat is real and that the methods used by malicious actors are constantly evolving,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cUnfortunately, a malicious actor with sufficient capability, time and resources will almost always be able to compromise an internet-connected computer network,\u201d the spokesman said. Australian Signals Directorate advised that it does appear to be the work of a sophisticated actor. The university has set up a hotline for staff and students concerned about the breach: 1800 275 268.",

      "bodyText": "The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, will hold high-level meetings in Sri Lanka on Tuesday, with people smuggling at the top of the agenda. But Labor\u2019s new home affairs spokeswoman, Kristina Keneally, has questioned why the Coalition halted aerial patrols of Australia\u2019s borders, before resuming them in February. Dutton is due to meet Sri Lanka\u2019s president Maithripala Sirisena, prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his ministerial counterpart in Colombo on Tuesday. \u201cThe purpose of the visit is to prosecute Operation Sovereign Borders\u2019 interests and to engage Sri Lankan authorities on counter-terrorism matters,\u201d Dutton\u2019s spokeswoman told News Corp Australia. \u201cWe greatly value the ongoing cooperation on regional maritime security.\u201d Last week a boat carrying 20 Sri Lankan asylum seekers was intercepted off Australia. Dutton has said the boat left in early May and claimed the voyage was a test of \u201cwhat people thought was going to be a Labor administration\u201d. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has rejected the claim, noting that 10 asylum seekers boats had come from Sri Lanka on the Coalition\u2019s watch and suggesting the terrorist attacks at Easter may have prompted the boat. The asylum seekers were returned by plane to Sri Lanka via Christmas Island, although Dutton has denied they were detained there. On Tuesday Keneally seized on a report in the Australian which suggested Border Force had resumed aerial surveillance after a \u201clengthy hiatus\u201d. \u201cMr Dutton needs to explain why he stopped these crucial border patrols,\u201d Keneally wrote on Twitter. Dutton, who arrived in Sri Lanka on Monday for a two-day visit, laid a wreath at the altar of St Sebastian\u2019s church, one of the three churches and three hotels hit in the Easter Sunday suicide bombings on 21 April. The attacks left 257 dead, 113 of them at St Sebastian\u2019s. Dutton said Australia would also help Sri Lanka rebuild after the attacks. \u201cWe\u2019re here to continue to provide support as Sri Lanka rebuilds, particularly its tourism market, but the economy otherwise off the back of these horrific attacks,\u201d he said. Dutton said Australia and Sri Lanka shared \u201ca very special bond\u201d and passed on condolences for the attacks on behalf of the Australian government. \u201cAll of us condemn any act of violence, regardless of the perpetrators\u2019 religions, regardless of their background. \u201cTo commit an evil act, particularly in a place of worship \u2013 that has a special level of indecency about it.\u201d",

Earlier on Monday, US tech stocks dropped after reports that US antitrust officials were preparing to investigate companies such as Apple, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet. Under an agreement with the US justice department, officials from the Federal Trade Commission are reportedly preparing to investigate any practices at Facebook that may harm competition in the digital market. Separately, Reuters reported that the justice department had taken jurisdiction for a potential investigation of Apple, as part of a broader review of whether technology giants use their size to act in an anti-competitive manner. And last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Department of Justice was looking into opening an anti-trust investigation into practices at Google. The power and control over the market that these tech companies hold has become a hot-button issue , with presidential hopefuls weighing in on the question of whether it is time to break up these companies in the way that the US government once broke up the railroad, oil and steel monopolies. The Democratic senator and presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren has long argued the tech companies should face more scrutiny. \u201cToday\u2019s big tech companies have too much power \u2013 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\u201d Warren said in a blogpost. \u201cThey\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.

      "bodyText": "Kim Jong-un\u2019s influential younger sister has appeared in public for the first time in more than 50 days, attending the \u201cMass Games\u201d propaganda displays that the North Korean leader later criticised for their \u201cwrong spirit\u201d. Kim Yo-jong, who was by Kim\u2019s side throughout both of his meetings with the US president, was shown seated next to her brother at the event in Pyongyang on Monday evening. Reports suggested that he had ordered her to keep a low profile after the failure of his recent nuclear summit with Donald Trump. Kim was also accompanied by his wife, Ri Sol-ju, and senior North Korean officials at the 150,000-seat May Day Stadium to watch thousands of performers on the opening night of the event. Despite his sister\u2019s apparent appreciation for the gymnasts and dancers\u2019 efforts, the North Korean leader was unhappy with the performance. The state news agency KCNA said Kim had \u201ccalled creators of the performance and seriously criticised them for their wrong spirit of creation and irresponsible work attitude, pointing to the contents and forms of works\u201d. Noting that artists \u201chave a very important duty in socialist cultural construction,\u201d Kim \u201cset forth important tasks for correctly implementing the revolutionary policy of our Party on literature and art,\u201d KCNA added. Following rehearsals over several months, vast numbers of people in colourful costumes took part in the precision synchronised performance, portraying moments from Korean history and modern life. North Korean artistic performances are closely watched by observers for clues as to the authorities\u2019 priorities, such as whether they are highlighting economic achievements or military progress. The senior government officials present at the games included Kim Yong-chol, the North\u2019s counterpart to US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in nuclear talks. South Korea\u2019s Chosun Ilbo newspaper had mistakenly reported that Kim Yong-chol had been sent to a labour camp after a second summit between Kim Jong-un and US president Donald Trump broke up without agreement in Hanoi in February. Unmentioned in the KCNA story was Kim Hyok-chol, North Korea\u2019s special envoy to the US who \u2013 according to the Chosun Ilbo newspaper \u2013 was executed by firing squad for \u201cbetraying the supreme leader\u201d after he was \u201cwon over to the US\u201d during pre-summit negotiations. On Tuesday, CNN, claimed that Kim was alive but in custody and under investigation for his role in the failed summit. Citing one of several unnamed sources, CNN said his fate had not been decided, but that he could still face \u201cheavy punishment\u201d. Kim Yo-jong had not appeared in public since April, when she attended supreme people\u2019s assembly, according to South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency. Speculation that she had been disciplined after Kim and Trump failed to reach an agreement at their February meeting in Hanoi rose after she was absent from Kim\u2019s entourage when he traveled to Vladivostok in April to meet Vladimir Putin, Yonhap added. The show, known in the North as a Grand Mass Gymnastics and Artistic Performance, is titled The Land of the People and is expected to run for five months, into October. Traditionally, the scenes on the arena floor take place against an ever-changing backdrop, made up of thousands of children turning the coloured pages of books in sequence to create giant images rippling across one side of the stadium.",

This has been a hot-button question for all 2020 Democratic candidates - whether they\u2019d consider breaking up these tech giants - and now it appears the House is launching a bipartisan effort to make that determination. </p> <p>From <strong>House judiciary chair Jerry Nadler</strong>: </p> <p>\u201cThe open internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment, and new pathways for education online,\u201d Nadler <a href=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/press-release/judiciary-committee-launches-investigation-competition-digital-markets\">said in a statement</a>. \u201c<strong>But there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content, and communications.</strong> The Committee has a rich tradition of conducting studies and investigations to assess the threat of monopoly power in the US economy. Given the growing tide of concentration and consolidation across our economy, it is vital that we investigate the current state of competition in digital markets and the health of the antitrust laws.\u201d</p> <p>According to a press release from <strong>House antitrust subcommittee</strong><strong> chair David Cicilline</strong>, the Committee\u2019s investigation will focus on three main areas:</p> <ul> <li>Documenting competition problems in digital markets;</li> <li>Examining whether dominant firms are engaging in anti-competitive conduct; and</li> <li>Assessing whether existing antitrust laws, competition policies, and current enforcement levels are adequate to address these issues.</li> </ul> <p>\u201cThe growth of monopoly power across our economy is one of the most pressing economic and political challenges we face today. Market power in digital markets presents a whole new set of dangers,\u201d Cicilline said. \u201cAfter four decades of weak antitrust enforcement and judicial hostility to antitrust cases, it is critical that Congress step in to determine whether existing laws are adequate to tackle abusive conduct by platform gatekeepers or whether we need new legislation to respond to this challenge.\u201d </p> <p><strong>Congressman Ro Khanna</strong>, who represents Silicon Valley, issued a tempered statement advocating for both \u201cstrong antitrust enforcement\u201d and the promotion of \u201cinnovation and growth.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RepRoKhanna/status/1135663145618423809\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The House Judiciary Committee should hold tech accountable to strong antitrust enforcement.

      "bodyText": "The House judiciary committee launched a bipartisan investigation into the tech industry, looking into tech giants like Google, Facebook and Amazon for \u201canti-competitive conduct\u201d and \u201ccompetition problems\u201d. A US judge appointed by President Trump ruled today that one chamber of Congress cannot sue the executive branch. This has to do with the lawsuit the House of Representatives filed against the Trump administration for the border wall emergency declaration. House Democrats will vote on 11 June on whether to hold attorney general William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt. The House passed the $19.1bn disaster relief aid package. President Trump is expected to sign off on it, even though it does not include funding for a border wall as the White House had requested. President Trump sounds off from across the pond on the disaster relief bill: The long-awaited $19.1bn disaster relief aid package now heads to President Trump, who is expected to sign off on it even though it does not include the funding for the border that the White House had requested. Quick recap: this will be provide aid for a series of recent disasters to hit the US, including Hurricane Harvey and the California wildfires. The bill stalled for weeks in the Senate because of setbacks including the president\u2019s reluctance to provide aid money to Puerto Rico, which had been hit hard by Hurricane Maria. Looks like it\u2019s going to be a twofer on 11 June: Mark your calendars. It\u2019s looking like the contempt proceedings for attorney general William Barr, who skipped out on his House judiciary committee hearing last month after a barnburner of a Senate judiciary committee hearing, are set to begin next week. If you\u2019ll rewind to April, you\u2019ll remember that the House sued members of the Trump administration over President Trump\u2019s emergency declaration that bypassed Congress in order to force funding for a border wall. Today, US Judge Trevor McFadden, who was appointed by Trump, ruled that one chamber of Congress cannot sue the president: \u201cWhile the Constitution bestows upon Members of the House many powers, it does not grant them standing to hale the Executive Branch into court claiming a dilution of Congress\u2019s legislative authority,\u201d he wrote. President Trump tweeted today a suggestion that a consumer boycott of AT&amp;T could force \u201cbig changes\u201d at CNN, the news organization he has long perceived as his foe (AT&amp;T owns CNN). But the Washington Post is reporting that today\u2019s tweet is just the latest in the president\u2019s long-running crusade to punish CNN: When AT&amp;T sought to acquire Time Warner -- then the parent company of CNN -- Trump repeatedly complained about the deal, publicly and privately. He instructed aides such as Gary Cohn and Rob Porter to call the Department of Justice to block the deal, according to people familiar with the matter. No call was made to DOJ, one of the officials familiar with the matter said, and Trump was told that the decision had to be free of political interference from the White House. People who heard the comments said it was sometimes unclear if he was giving an official order or just venting. The Justice Department, however, did seek to block the $85 million merger over allegations that the deal violated federal antitrust laws before losing in court to AT&amp;T. Department officials denied that their decisions were influenced by the White House, but Trump continued to bring up the subject repeatedly and bragged to aides that his attacks on CNN had driven down their ratings. Here\u2019s a little more about the wide-ranging antitrust investigation looking into companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. This has been a hot-button question for all 2020 Democratic candidates - whether they\u2019d consider breaking up these tech giants - and now it appears the House is launching a bipartisan effort to make that determination. From House judiciary chair Jerry Nadler: \u201cThe open internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment, and new pathways for education online,\u201d Nadler said in a statement. \u201cBut there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content, and communications. The Committee has a rich tradition of conducting studies and investigations to assess the threat of monopoly power in the US economy. Given the growing tide of concentration and consolidation across our economy, it is vital that we investigate the current state of competition in digital markets and the health of the antitrust laws.\u201d According to a press release from House antitrust subcommittee chair David Cicilline, the Committee\u2019s investigation will focus on three main areas: Documenting competition problems in digital markets; Examining whether dominant firms are engaging in anti-competitive conduct; and Assessing whether existing antitrust laws, competition policies, and current enforcement levels are adequate to address these issues. \u201cThe growth of monopoly power across our economy is one of the most pressing economic and political challenges we face today. Market power in digital markets presents a whole new set of dangers,\u201d Cicilline said. \u201cAfter four decades of weak antitrust enforcement and judicial hostility to antitrust cases, it is critical that Congress step in to determine whether existing laws are adequate to tackle abusive conduct by platform gatekeepers or whether we need new legislation to respond to this challenge.\u201d Congressman Ro Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley, issued a tempered statement advocating for both \u201cstrong antitrust enforcement\u201d and the promotion of \u201cinnovation and growth.\u201d Hey all, Vivian Ho taking over for Jamiles Lartey. Hope everyone is having a nice Monday. That\u2019s it for me today, here are a couple of highlights from US politics today as I hand over to my colleague Vivian Ho. Trump is in the UK for a state visit, having just spoken at a banquet in Buckingham Palace. Congress will soon be holding a vote hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt. Jared Kushner defended the president from charges of racism in an interview with Axios but awkwardly dodged questions about his father-in-law\u2019s birtherism. A New York Times investigation revealed \u201calarmingly inappropriate\u201d behavior from transportation secretary Elaine Chao. Axios is reporting that former US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, will call out pro-choice activists who \u201cdemand conformity\u201d as being \u201canti-women\u201d in a keynote address at Susan B. Anthony List\u2019s 12th annual Campaign for Life Gala Monday evening. Her prepared remarks reportedly include the following: \u201cUnfortunately, many on the left use the abortion debate to divide women and demand conformity. They do this in the name of feminism. But that is not real feminism... \u201cThe idea that women must adhere to a particular set of values is one of the most anti-women ideas in today\u2019s culture. It is a rejection of the ideas of equality and tolerance that the women\u2019s movement is supposed to be about. \u201cAs a pro-life, female governor, I was blessed with a unique platform, and I made every effort to use it appropriately. Not to lob attacks at people who disagreed with me, not to diminish the other side, but to reframe the debate. To explain that being pro-life is not about being for or against women. It is about being for a baby\u2019s right to live \u2014 the most basic right there is.\u201d The remarks come as anti-choice activists have pushed through a wave of restrictive legislation in multiple states aimed at ultimately challenging the abortion rights guaranteed by Roe v Wade. Donald Trump offered some remarks at the state banquet in the Buckingham Palace ballroom just moments ago. He told the Queen: Your Majesty, Melania and I are profoundly honoured to be your guests for this historic state visit. Thank you for your warm welcome, for this beautiful weather, your gracious hospitality, and Your Majesty\u2019s nearly seven decades of treasured friendship with the United States of America. This week, we commemorate a mighty endeavour of righteous nations and one of the greatest undertakings in all of history. Seventy-five years ago, more than 150,000 allied troops were preparing on this island to parachute into France, storm the beaches of Normandy, and win back our civilisation. As Her Majesty remembers, the British people had hoped and prayed and fought for this day for nearly five years. You can follow all the details of Trump\u2019s UK state visit on our liveblog here: The house will be voting to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt over their failure to comply with subpoenas in an ongoing probe into the Trump Administration\u2019s plan to ask a citizenship question in the 2020 census. Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings said in a letter Monday announcing the move: The Trump Administration has been engaged in one of the most unprecedented cover-ups since Watergate, extending from the White House to multiple federal agencies and departments of the government and across numerous investigations. The tactics of this cover-up are now clear. The Administration has been challenging Congress\u2019 core authority to conduct oversight under the Constitution, questioning the legislative bases for congressional inquiries, objecting to committee rules and precedents that have been in place for decades under both Republican and Democratic leadership, and making baseless legal arguments to avoid producing documents and testimony. This cover-up is being directed from the top. The Washington Post is reporting that A key witness in former Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation of Russian election interference has been indicted by federal officials on child pornography charges. George Nader, who had a previous criminal record on such charges, was charged in federal court in Virginia, and is expected to make an initial court appearance in New York. Nader played an unusual role as a kind of liaison between Trump supporters, Middle East leaders, and Russians interested in making contact with the incoming administration in early 2017. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee announced today that next Monday it will hold a hearing entitled \u201cLessons from the Mueller Report: Presidential Obstruction and Other Crimes.\u201d The hearings appear to be an attempt by judiciary chairman Jarrold Nadler to get on with the committee\u2019s sprawling oversight investigation into the Trump administration post-Mueller Report, which has largely been stymied by the Trump administration\u2019s unprecedented, blanket non-compliance with congressional subpoenas. \u201cWhile the White House continues to cover up and stonewall, and to prevent the American people from knowing the truth, we will continue to move forward with our investigation,\u201d said Nadler in a statement. \u201cThese hearings will allow us to examine the findings laid out in Mueller\u2019s report so that we can work to protect the rule of law and protect future elections through consideration of legislative and other remedies.\u201d Donald Trump maintains he has not seen any protests while on his state visit to the UK. As my colleague Simon Murphy shares, he really must not be looking: About 100 demonstrators are outside the gates of Buckingham Palace as his helicopter lands. They are protesting against the US president being handed \u201cthe red-carpet treatment\u201d. Waving banners emblazoned with messages declaring the president was \u201cevil\u201d, scores of protesters blowing whistles and horns massed on a green outside the palace. Demonstrators, many of who were clutching signs urging people to \u201cjust say no\u201d to the special relationship, chanted: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s not welcome here.\u201d The demonstration, labelled \u201cProtest at the Palace: Spoil Trump\u2019s banquet\u201d by Facebook organisers, called on attendees to \u201cBring pots and pans, vuvuzelas, musical instruments etc and make some noise\u201d. Weyman Bennett, 54, the co-convenor of Stand up to Racism who helped organise the protest, told the Guardian the state visit represented \u201can insult to people\u2019s basic decent values\u201d and should have been cancelled. It will be cucumber sandwiches over champagne. It doesn\u2019t matter how boorish he is or what ridiculous things he says, I think very few people will challenge him. That\u2019s not to our credit. Sometimes you have to say to a bully they\u2019re wrong and stand up for basic rights. He\u2019s threatened nuclear war, he\u2019s behaved like a boorish idiot, he doesn\u2019t even respect basic diplomatic values. Theresa May had hoped to bolster her position by inviting Trump, he said, but it had \u201ccompletely backfired\u201d, adding: \u201cHis visit should have been cancelled until he accepts basic human rights.\u201d Bernard Kiernan, a 70-year-old retired IT consultant who volunteers at a hospital, said he had joined the protest in \u201csolidarity\u201d with friends living in America. He branded Trump a \u201cbully\u201d and a \u201cmisogynist\u201d, adding: \u201cHe should not have the right to visit our country. He\u2019s not fit to be president.\u201d Margaret Sanchez, 65, a retired nurse from north west London, described the multi-million pound visit as a \u201cwaste of public funds\u201d. She added: He\u2019s a business man, he\u2019s not a politician. He doesn\u2019t know how to talk to people. If it doesn\u2019t suit him, he calls it fake news. Neighbours Roshan Pedder, 72, and Paul Gossage, 66, from Surrey, travelled to London to voice their opposition to the visit. Gossage, a retired ambulance technician, carried a sign declaring: \u201cTRUMP IS A MENACE.\u201d He said: I think it\u2019s important that ordinary people from the UK life myself show we don\u2019t want him here. At one stage during the protest, a scuffle broke out when a demonstrator tried to wrestle a \u201cmake America great again\u201d red hat from a Trump supporter who had turned up. According to The Hill reporter Cristina Marcos, House Majority leader Stenny Hoyer says lawmakers may take up the Dream Act this week. The long-stalled bill would clarify the legal status of non-citizens \u201cDreamers\u201d who arrived in the US as children. It passed the house judiciary committee last week but faces a difficult road to becoming law, as it must get past a Republican-controlled Senate and the possibility of a Trump veto. In related news Monday, the Supreme court rejected the Trump administration\u2019s request to fast track a decision on whether it will hear a case over the administration\u2019s dismantling of the Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program. Daca was created by the Obama Administration as a stopgap measure until legislators could agree on a law that would address the status of Dreamers. The Trump administration rescinded it in 2017 but has had that decision reversed in federal court. Only the Supreme Court can reinstate Trump\u2019s rescission now. The latest Hill-HarrisX poll of the Democratic field shows former Vice President Joe Biden enjoying a robust 19-point advantage over the next comer - Bernie Sanders. Biden won 35 percent support from Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent registered voters in the June 1-2 survey, compared to 16 percent for Sanders. Rounding out the top three, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg was a distant third with 8 percent. The next tier has Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Haris, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Cory Booker all pulling 3-5% The rest of the field registered support from 1% or fewer of survey participants. Seventeen percent of respondents said they were unsure about their preference. Even if they all broke for any one candidate not named Biden, it still wouldn\u2019t be enough to catch up. UK activists are trolling Donald Trump hard so far during his state visit. NBC News says there are 58 members of the House of Representatives who favor starting an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. That includes 57 Democrats (and 12 of the 24 Democrats who serve on the House Judiciary Committee) and one Republican- Michigan\u2019s Justin Amash. In NBC\u2019s next update there should be at least 59. Speaking to Tour\u00e9 for his podcast about impeachment, New York congressman Hakeem Jeffries, the No 4 House Democrat said that he\u2019s \u201cof the view that those hearings should commence immediately.\u201d The Judiciary Committee, on which I sit, should have hearings on three things: obstruction of justice, abuse of power and the culture of corruption that appears to exist at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Jeffries added that Democrats should not be weighing any potential 2020 backlash (or tailwind) in considering the matter. \u201cIt would be dangerous for us to make a decision about impeachment anchored in politics either way. To either decide that we\u2019re not going to impeach because it would be bad politically or that we\u2019ll dive into impeachment because it\u2019ll help politically.\u201d The podcast will be released Wednesday. The advance look comes courtesy of Politco\u2019s PM Playbook. In an hour-long town hall in Dubuque, Iowa, Democratic hopeful Kirsten Gillibrand was offered a made-for-internet moment from Fox News moderator Chris Wallace Sunday night. Wallace asked Gillibrand to explain her tweet from December 2018, when she said the future was \u201cfemale\u201d and \u201cintersectional\u201d. Gillibrand responded: \u201cWe want women to have a seat at the table,\u201d To which, as if on cue, Wallace interjected: \u201cWhat about men?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re already there \u2014 do you not know?\u201d Gillibrand said, greeted by one of the biggest rounds of applause of the night. \u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be exclusionary, it\u2019s meant to be inclusionary,\u201d she said. Gillibrand also took a page from Pete Buttigieg\u2019s book, using her appearance on the conservative station to be critical of its coverage. In another segment, Gillibrand pushed past Wallace\u2019s objections to accuse the network of spreading of a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d on abortion rights. The New York Senator has struggled to gather any serious momentum for her campaign, failing to gather either the poll numbers or campaign figures required to get a spot on the primary debate stage thus far. Trump Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao asked federal officials to organize travel arrangements for at least one family member and include other relatives in high-level meetings with Chinese government officials during her first visit to China as a Trump cabinet member, The New York Times reported on Sunday. \u201cShe had these relatives who were fairly wealthy and connected to the shipping industry,\u201d said a State Department official. \u201cTheir business interests were potentially affected by meetings.\u201d The trip was reportedly canceled by Chao after ethics concerns were raised with the State and Transportation Departments. This was \u201calarmingly inappropriate,\u201d according to David H. Rank, a State Department official who previously served as deputy chief of mission in Beijing. Chao, who is married to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, is a member of a wealthy and powerful family in China with respect to their ownership of an American shipping company. The reported arrangements were revealed as part of a Times investigation into close business ties between China and the Chao family\u2019s business. Chao herself has no formal role at the company, by McConnell has received millions of dollars in gifts from Chao\u2019s father, James, who ran the company until last year. Remember a few months back when- at that time - rising Democratic star Beto O\u2019Rourke and Donald Trump held dueling rallies in El Paso? Well, the bills to both campaigns from the city are now due, and according to ABC News, only one has paid it. \u201cEl Paso billed Donald J. Trump for President Inc. for his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rally -- for nearly half a million dollars. The invoice was sent to the campaign\u2019s Fifth Avenue offices in New York on March 27. It was due April 26, and El Paso has yet to see a dime,\u201d ABC reported. The exact number is $470,417.05, broken down by reimbursements owed to six city departments. The report continues: \u201cIf El Paso doesn\u2019t receive payment from the Trump campaign, that money would come out of municipal revenue and the city\u2019s contingency budget -- funds used for unexpected and emergency situations, like natural disasters. Just last June, historic and deadly flooding ravaged southern Texas. Now, as tornado alley wakes up, and hurricane season looms -- that\u2019s a financial life vest no city wants to do without. Donald J. Trump for President Inc.\u2019s outstanding $470,417.05 is about 63% of the city\u2019s contingency budget for the year.\u201d Federal workers, who recently had their income disrupted by the longest government shutdown in US history, could be getting a raise next year. The Hill reports that House Democrats are proposing a 3.1 percent pay hike for federal workers in 2020. The raise was included in the draft appropriations bill covering financial services and general government, which is expected to advance through a subcommittee hearing on Monday and advance to the House floor later in the month. President Trump blocked a scheduled 2.1 percent increase in pay to federal workers last year, in an order that froze federal pay. Donald Trump arrived in the UK for a state visit just about an hour ago, and set a combative tone by criticizing the London mayor as his plane landed. After Air Force One touched down at Stansted, the US president and his wife, Melania, were greeted by the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, one of the contenders in the Conservative leadership race to replace Prime Minister Theresa May. Trump was seen chatting with Hunt for a minute and occasionally patting him on the back. Before landing, Trump described Sadiq Khan as \u201ca stone cold loser\u201d after the London mayor compared him to a 20th-century fascist. Khan\u2019s spokesman said \u201cchildish insults\u201d should be \u201cbeneath the president of the United States\u201d. You can follow Trump\u2019s state visit on its own liveblog here. Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson said yesterday on MSNBC that impeachment proceedings are \u201cabsolutely\u201d inevitable, and rejects the idea that backlash over impeachment could cost Democrats control of Congress in 2020. \u201cI think we risk losing majority if we don\u2019t bring impeachment proceedings. It will be hard pressed for a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives not to go forward with an impeachment operation.\u201d Good morning. Let\u2019s start off the week with a masterclass in deflection. For that we turn to first son-in-law and trusted Trump advisor Jared Kushner in an interview with Axios released Sunday. Asked about the president\u2019s racism, Kushner said confidently that Trump was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d a racist, and that Democrats who call the president a racist are doing \u201ca disservice to everyone who suffers from real racism in this country.\u201d Interviewer Jonathan Swan interjected by pointing to birtherism - Trump\u2019s first foray into US party politics as an agent of the disproven idea that Barack Obama wasn\u2019t born in the US. You may be forgiven if what followed gives you the sensation of being stuck in a time loop. Swan: \u201cWas birtherism racist?\u201d Kushner: \u201cI wasn\u2019t really involved in that.\u201d Swan: \u201cI know you weren\u2019t. Was it racist?\u201d Kushner: \u201cLike I said, I wasn\u2019t involved in that.\u201d Swan: \u201cI know you weren\u2019t. Was it racist? Kushner: \u201cI know who the president is and I have not seen anything in him that is racist.\u201d In the interview Kushner, who has been broadly tasked with facilitating peace in the Middle East also cast doubt on Palestinians ability to self-govern. Asked whether he understood why the Palestinians might not trust him, Kushner said: \u201cI\u2019m not here to be trusted.\u201d Kushner also sidestepped questions about the US policy over the death of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist murdered by a Saudi government hit squad in Turkey. Asked if he joined Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee in calling on the Saudi government to release his body (or identify where they put the body parts) so his family might bury him, Kushner said: \u201cLook, it\u2019s a horrific thing that happened. Once we have all the facts, then we\u2019ll make a policy determination, but that would be up to the secretary of state to push on our policy.\u201d",

Separately, Reuters reported that the US justice department had taken jurisdiction for a potential investigation of Apple, as part of a broader review of whether technology giants use their size to act in an anti-competitive manner. That inquiry comes after the streaming music leader Spotify and others complained to EU antitrust regulators that Apple charges a 30% fee for content-based service providers to use Apple\u2019s in-app purchase system. The company has previously defended its fee structure, arguing that \u201cour users trust Apple \u2013 and that trust is critical to how we operate a fair, competitive store for developer app distribution\u201d.
