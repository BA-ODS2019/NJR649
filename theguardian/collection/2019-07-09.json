Former vice president Joe Biden joined calls Alexander Acosta\u2019s resignation, following the controversy over the labor secretary\u2019s role in cutting a plea deal with financier Jeffrey Epstein in 2008; as a reminder, Epstein has been charged with operating a sex trafficking ring involving underage girls. Donald Trump is so far sticking by Acosta, who as a US attorney helped Epstein avoid a public trial and lengthy prison sentence more than a decade ago. A federal judge blocked the Trump Justice Department\u2019s attempt to change the lawyers on its legal team in a lawsuit over the Trump administration\u2019s effort to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, a move that civil rights activists say would have a chilling effect on the effort to accurately count all Americans, including immigrants. The Trump administration is planning to speed up its screening of asylum-seekers at the US-Mexico border, Buzzfeed News reported. Immigration advocates said the move would give asylum-seekers, largely fleeing violence and poverty in Central America, less time to prepare for interviews and recover from the treacherous journey. Donald Trump\u2019s 4 July \u2018Salute to America\u2019 cost the Pentagon $1.2m; the figure did not reflect the cost to US taxpayers. Trump has said he will repeat the controversial event next year. The entrance of billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer into the 2020 Democratic presidential primary was met with some skepticism and frustration from the left. West Virginia senator Joe Manchin unveiled a bill that would withhold \u201cany and all\u201d federal funding for the 2026 World Cup, which the US will host, until the US Soccer federation to pay its men\u2019s and women\u2019s team equally; the US women\u2019s national team earned their fourth World Cup title last week. Early today, billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer formally launched his campaign for president. The reaction from some progressives has not been positive. New York Times opinion columnist Jamelle Bouie, who has written frequently about voter suppression, argued that Steyer\u2019s money would be better sent on registering and turning out voters. More than 300,000 people have signed a petition asking McDonald\u2019s and Burger King to stop giving plastic toys to children, The Hill reports. The Change.org petition, written in the names of two British children, argues that: \u201cchildren only play with the plastic toys they give us for a few minutes before they get thrown away and harm animals and pollute the sea.\u201d \u201cBig, rich companies shouldn\u2019t be making toys out of plastic at all,\u201d the petition notes. The Guardian\u2019s Susie Cagle reported recently on the overwhelming problem of plastic waste. Country rock band Confederate Railroad has been barred from performing at an state fair in Illinois because of its use of the Confederate flag, the Associated Press reports. Illinois\u2019 governor cancelled the band last week. \u201cThis administration\u2019s guiding principle is that the state of Illinois will not use state resources to promote symbols of racism,\u201d a spokeswoman for Gov. J.B. Pritzker said. Some Republicans in Illinois have pushed back, with one arguing that other state fair musical acts were equally worthy of censorship. One Republican pointed to Snoop Dog, who recently released an album whose cover features the rapper standing over a corpse toe-tagged with Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s name. Another band scheduled to play at the state fair released a statement in solidarity with Confederate Railroad: \u201cThis \u2018political correctness\u2019 has to stop. It\u2019s tearing our country apart.\u201d The spokesman for the House Intelligence Committee has offered a rare comment about a witness interview. Felix Sater, the Moscow-born businessman at the center of the Trump Tower Moscow project, \u201chas not fully cooperated with the committee,\u201d the spokesman said, per Politico\u2019s Andrew Desiderio. Activists who have been pushing for Congress to declare a climate emergency are rallying at the Capitol to support the resolution introduced today by senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, and representatives Earl Blumenauer and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The group Extinction Rebellion in a press release said it plans to \u201ccelebrate the initiative of these select Congress people and to reiterate our demand that the rest of Congress acknowledge the severity of the climate crisis by quickly codifying the resolution into law.\u201d Protester Dominic Serino called the resolution, which would not require specific action, \u201can important first step if it were to pass.\u201d \u201cI think our Congress and other leaders habitually lie to us about the gravity of the climate crisis,\u201d Serino said. After the Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration\u2019s first attempt to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 United States census, the Justice Department announced this weekend that it was appointing a new team of lawyers to take over census-related cases. The Justice Department offered no rationale for the change in its legal team. Some observers, including election law expert Rick Hasen, called this a troubling move, one that suggested that the Justice Department\u2019s career attorneys might not be willing to go forward with the Trump administration\u2019s plans for the next step of continuing to fight to add a citizenship question to the Census, as the president had said he wanted to do, despite the first Supreme Court ruling. Civil rights groups have argued that asking about citizenship status may discourage immigrants from participating in the census, producing an undercount of immigrants, particularly immigrants of color, in official tallies. An undercount of immigrants could result in lower funding numbers for government funding and program allocations, and could also have electoral benefits for the Republican Party. But tonight, a federal judge in New York blocked the Justice Department\u2019s move to change its legal team. The 2020 census tallies will be used in the once-a-decade process of redrawing and updating America\u2019s electoral districts, which are supposed to guarantee that all voters have equal representation in the political system-- \u201cone person, one vote.\u201d Undercounting immigrants in the census could dilute their political power for the next decade. Lois Beckett here taking over our live politics coverage from The Guardian\u2019s West Coast bureau. There are moments in American politics these days when it\u2019s hard to process the contrast between the actual news that\u2019s happening, and the business-as-usual, feed-the-news-cycle approach of some political figures. One of these moments came this evening. Earlier, Kellyanne Conway, one of President Trump\u2019s most prominent counselors and surrogates, referred to a disagreement between five Democratic congresswomen as a \u201chuge catfight\u201d on Fox News. What Conway called a \u201cmajor \u2018meow moment\u2019\u201d was the public disagreement between four freshman progressive Democrats and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over whether Congressional Democrats were doing enough to protect migrants at the border, particularly migrant children, from mistreatment and abuse by the US government. \u201cKeep my name out of your lying mouth,\u201d one of the freshman congresswomen, Ayanna Pressley, responded. \u201cRemember that time your boss tore babies from their mothers\u2019 arms and threw them in cages?\u201d she tweeted. Last month, a US federal watchdog recommended that Trump fire Conway for repeatedly violating a law that limits political activity by government workers. Ok folks, that\u2019s it from me (Sabrina) for today. A big thanks to my colleague Lauren Gambino for also briefly taking the reins of the blog -- you can credit her for bringing you the latest on Joe Biden! Before I hand the blog over to my colleague Lois Beckett on the West Coast, allow me to summarize the past few hours: Former vice president Joe Biden joined calls Alexander Acosta\u2019s resignation, following the controversy over the labor secretary\u2019s role in cutting a plea deal with financier Jeffrey Epstein in 2008; as a reminder, Epstein has been charged with operating a sex trafficking ring involving underage girls. Donald Trump is so far sticking by Acosta, who as a US attorney helped Epstein avoid a public trial and lengthy prison sentence more than a decade ago. The Trump administration is planning to speed up its screening of asylum-seekers at the US-Mexico border, Buzzfeed News reported. Immigration advocates said the move would give asylum-seekers, largely fleeing violence and poverty in Central America, less time to prepare for interviews and recover from the treacherous journey. Donald Trump\u2019s 4 July \u2018Salute to America\u2019 cost the Pentagon $1.2m; the figure did not reflect the cost to US taxpayers. Trump has said he will repeat the controversial event next year. West Virginia senator Joe Manchin unveiled a bill that would withhold \u201cany and all\u201d federal funding for the 2026 World Cup, which the US will host, until the US Soccer federation to pay its men\u2019s and women\u2019s team equally; the US women\u2019s national team earned their fourth World Cup title last week. Lois will take you through the rest of the day, so stay tuned ... and until next time from Sabrina! Donald Trump\u2019s 4 July \u201cSalute to America\u201d cost the US military $1.2m, the Pentagon said Tuesday. The event sparked controversy for its use of taxpayer dollars and putting the president at the center of the holiday celebrating American independence. The Pentagon figure did not reflect the cost to American taxpayers. It instead detailed the amount of money spent on the transportation of military equipment and flying hours. Trump touted the strength of the US military at the event and issued a rare plea for unity. Despite the criticism he faced by some for \u2018hijacking\u2019 the 4 July holiday, the president announced plans on Monday to repeat the military salute next year. \u201cIt was a wonderful day for all Americans,\u201d Trump said at the White House. \u201cBased on its tremendous success, we\u2019re just making the decision and I think we can say we\u2019ve made the decision to do it again next year, and maybe we can say, for the foreseeable future.\u201d Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat of West Virginia, has a plan to force the US Soccer federation to pay its men\u2019s and women\u2019s team equally: hit \u2018em where it hurts. The West Virginia senator introduced a bill on Tuesday that would withhold \u201cany and all\u201d federal funding for the 2026 World Cup, which the US will host, until the organization agrees to pay the teams equally, according to the HuffPost. That would include includes \u201cfunds that go to host cities, participating local and state organizations, US Soccer, the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football, and the international soccer governing body FIFA,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe clear [equitable pay between the US men and women\u2019s soccer teams is unacceptable and I\u2019m glad the US Women\u2019s Soccer Team latest victory is causing public outcry,\u201d Manchin said in a statement to the news website. \u201cI\u2019m encouraging everyone to call their Senator and Representatives to help us get this bill passed and finally pay the equitable pay they deserve.\u201d Last weekend, the US women\u2019s national team clinched their fourth World Cup title while raising awareness about the pay disparities between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams. Before the tournament, 28 members of the team sued the US Soccer Federation for gender discrimination in violation of the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act. The team\u2019s co-captain Megan Rapinoe, who was awarded the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball, has said she would not accept an invitation to the White House and encouraged her teammates to follow suit. On Tuesday, the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer announced that Rapinoe had accepted an invitation to raise the issue on a tour of the US Senate. Congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley have also invited the team to tour the House. \u201cWorking class\u201d Joe reported earning $15.6m in the two years after he left office, according to tax returns his campaign released on Tuesday And $2.8m of that came from speaking and writing engagement. Former Vice President Joe Biden has joined several of the 2020 candidates in calling on Labor Secretary Alex Acosta to resign. Donald Trump\u2019s administration is looking to speed up initial screenings of immigrants seeking asylum, according to a report in Buzzfeed News. The move, immigration advocates said, would give immigrants less time to prepare for their interviews and recover from the grueling journey to the US-Mexico border. The Trump administration has taken several steps to limit the number of asylum-seekers in the US. More from Buzzfeed: Asylum officers have had to wait at least 48 hours after an immigrant has been detained for crossing into the US to interview them and hear their case. However, under a new directive implemented by US Citizenship and Immigration Services Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli, that window has been reduced to one calendar day, according to a policy change released to staffers on Monday and obtained by BuzzFeed News.\u201d It\u2019s been quite a heavy day, so here\u2019s a small dose of fun: Public Policy Polling, a Democratic polling firm, tested how Donald Trump would fare against US soccer star Megan Rapinoe in a 2020 matchup. As it turns out, Rapinoe leads Trump by 1%. According to the survey, which was conducted \u2018by popular demand\u2019, Rapinoe received 42% of the vote to Trump\u2019s 41%. As we saw with Tom Steyer, it\u2019s not too late to jump into the race. Just sayin... Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law is once again in jeopardy, as a federal appeals court on Tuesday hears arguments on its validity. The case, which could once again place the fate of the Affordable Care Act before the supreme court, was brought by a group of Republican governors and attorneys general. The healthcare law was struck down by a federal judge in Texas in December. Three judges on the New Orleans-based 5th US circuit court of appeals will now determine if that ruling was correct. The case has significant implications for millions of Americans who have gained health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law by Obama in 2010. The supreme court upheld the core of the law, commonly referred to as \u2018Obamacare\u2019, in 2012. Republicans have nonetheless carried on with their efforts to dismantle the law. As part of Donald Trump\u2019s tax overhaul in 2017, the Republican-led Congress did away with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate -- which required most Americans to either purchase health insurance or incur a tax penalty. Republicans have argued that removing the penalty effectively did away with the legal rationale the supreme court relied upon when upholding the Affordable Care Act in 2012. The appeals court weighing the fresh challenge of the law is known as one of the most conservative appellate courts in the country, which means the case will almost certainly wind up back before the supreme court. It\u2019s been quite a day, and we\u2019re no where near done yet...! So here is a summary to help bring you up to speed on what you\u2019ve missed if you\u2019re just tuning in: Donald Trump is standing by his embattled labor secretary Alexander Acosta amid calls for the latter\u2019s resignation; Acosta has come under heightened scrutiny for striking a lenient plea deal in 2008 with financier Jeffrey Epstein, who has been charged with operating a sex trafficking ring that involved underage girls. Acosta broke his silence on the subject as Democrats called for him to step down; the labor secretary said Epstein\u2019s crimes were \u201chorrific\u201d and suggested the evidence before prosecutors today was far more expansive than the case he oversaw as Miami\u2019s top federal prosecutor in 2008. Trump is still fuming over leaked memos in which Sir Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to the US, described the president as \u201cinept\u201d and characterized his administration as \u201cdysfunctional\u201d; Trump said Darroch was \u201ca very stupid guy\u201d in a Tuesday morning tweetstorm, in which he also took aim at British prime minister Theresa May and her handling of Brexit. Two-time presidential candidate Ross Perot has died at age 89 following a five-month battle with leukemia. The Texan billionaire and philanthropist emerged as one of the most successful third-party candidates in modern US history in the 1992 presidential elections, earning nearly 19% of the popular vote. Tom Steyer formally launched his campaign for president, adding his name to the crowded field of 2020 Democratic contenders. Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist, has been a leading proponent of impeaching Trump and poured millions of dollars into the fight against climate change. A federal appeals court ruled that Trump cannot block his critics on Twitter, upholding an earlier decision which found the president in violation of the US constitution for doing so; the case was brought by seven individuals who in 2017 were blocked by Trump for tweeting critical comments at the president. Keep watching this space for more developments! 2020 presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand has released a new television ad attacking Donald Trump for failing to make good on his promises to save jobs and improve the lives of average Americans. The spot is titled \u201cI Promise\u201d and will air in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, the so-called \u201cRust Belt\u201d states that helped propel Trump to victory. Gillibrand, a senator from New York, is poised to embark on a two-day swing through those battleground states this week. Her campaign said the ad will target former Barack Obama voters who cast their ballots for Trump in 2016. It opens with footage of promises Trump made as a candidate in the last election cycle, such as improving US infrastructure, lowering prescription drug prices and restoring manufacturing jobs. But those promises were left unkept, the ad states. Gillibrand has struggled to gain traction in the crowded Democratic field. She has nonetheless continued to expand her staff in the crucial early voting states Iowa and New Hampshire. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has appeared to rule out Congress investigating or impeaching Alexander Acosta. Shortly after Donald Trump stood by his labor secretary, Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill: It\u2019s up to the president, it\u2019s his cabinet. We have a great deal of work to do here for the good of the American people and we have to focus on that.\u201d Here is the full transcript of what Donald Trump said of his labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, amid the controversy over the latter\u2019s 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein: I can tell you that for two and a half years he has been just an excellent secretary of labor. He\u2019s done just a fantastic job. Now part of it is our economy is so good, our unemployment numbers are at record lows. So many good things are happening. But the fact is he has been a very good secretary of labor. What happened 12 or 15 years ago with respect to when he was a US attorney, I think in Miami ... If you go back and look at everybody else\u2019s decisions, whether it\u2019s a US attorney or an assistant US attorney, or a judge, if you go back 12 or 15 years ago or 20 years ago and look at their past decisions, I would think you would probably find that they would wish they had maybe did it a different way. I do know that there were a lot of people involved in that decision, not just him. And I can only say this from what I know, and what I do know is that he has been a great -- a really great secretary of labor. The rest of it we\u2019ll have to look at, we\u2019ll have to look at it very carefully. But we\u2019re talking about a long time ago and again it was a decision made I think not by him but by a lot of people. So we\u2019re going to look at it very carefully, we\u2019ll be looking at that very carefully.\u201d Speaking of Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator does not seem particularly enthused by Tom Steyer\u2019s foray into the 2020 presidential race. Asked about the launch of Steyers campaign on Tuesday, Sanders told MSNBC: I am a bit tired of seeing billionaires trying to buy political power. So I like Tom, he\u2019s a good guy. He\u2019s a friend of mine, but I\u2019m not a great fan of billionaires getting involved in the political process.\u201d Steyer\u2019s announcement focused on removing the influence of corporate interests from US politics. Senator Bernie Sanders said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d will outline a blueprint for how he would fight the climate crisis if elected president but did not elaborate on what it would include or when it would be published. On a call with reporters about a resolution he is cosponsoring to declare a climate emergency, he said \u201cwhat is imperative to understand is it\u2019s not just the plan.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of very, very good plans out there. I think we\u2019ll have the strongest plan,\u201d Sanders said. In addition to transforming the US energy system, he said he would prioritize taking on the \u201cgreed and dishonesty of the fossil fuel industry,\u201d and would also \u201creach out to countries all over the world\u201d to tackle the global problem. Some other Democrats vying for the White House have specified how they would eliminate US carbon dioxide emissions heating the planet. Sanders has previously advocated for a carbon tax with revenues returned to taxpayers. More recently, he has endorsed the Green New Deal. Asked twice what specific measures he would pursue, Sanders did not elaborate beyond \u201cmassive\u201d investments in sustainable energy and energy efficiency and a transformation of the transportation. \u201cThe issue here is not that we cannot address this problem, I think we can. I think we know exactly what has to be done,\u201d Sanders said. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman who is signing on to the climate emergency resolution written by Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), said she supports climate liability lawsuits against oil companies, which she called a \u201cfascinating tool.\u201d She also touted the possibility of public banks compete with fossil fuel-invested Wall Street. Donald Trump has defended his embattled labor secretary Alexander Acosta amid growing calls for his resignation. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said Acosta had done an \u2018excellent\u2019 job as labor secretary following fresh scrutiny toward Acosta\u2019s role in securing a lenient 2008 plea deal for financier Jeffrey Epstein. Trump said he felt \u201cvery badly\u201d for Acosta, while adding he would look at his role in Epstein\u2019s plea deal \u201cvery carefully\u201d. Trump also sought to distance himself from Epstein, a onetime friend he previously called a \u201cterrific guy\u201d, stating: \u201cHe was a fixture in Palm Beach, I had a falling out with him many years ago. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve spoken to him in 15 years.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments came as Acosta broke his silence on Epstein, who was charged with running a sex trafficking ring that involved underage girls. \u201cThe crimes committed by Epstein are horrific, and I am pleased that NY prosecutors are moving forward with a case based on new evidence,\u201d Acosta tweeted on Tuesday. As Miami\u2019s top federal prosecutor in 2008, Acosta struck a plea deal with Epstein that enabled the billionaire to avoid a public trial and a heavy prison sentence. Acosta sought to draw distance between the evidence available 11 years ago and that contained in the recently unsealed indictment against Epstein. \u201cWith the evidence available more than a decade ago, federal prosecutors insisted that Epstein go to jail, register as a sex offender and put the world on notice that he was a sexual predator,\u201d Acosta wrote. \u201cNow that new evidence and additional testimony is available, the NY prosecution offers an important opportunity to more fully bring him to justice.\u201d A slew of Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, have called for Acosta to step down as labor secretary amid the renewed scrutiny over his 2008 agreement with Epstein. Donald Trump cannot block his critics on Twitter, the social media platform he has used as a central form of communication, a federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday. The decision upheld a previous ruling that Trump violated the first amendment of the US constitution by blocking those who criticized the president on Twitter. In a unanimous decision by the New York-based appeals court, Judge Barrington D. Parker wrote: The First Amendment does not permit a public official who utilizes a social media account for all manner of official purposes to exclude persons from an otherwise open online dialogue because they expressed views with which the official disagrees.\u201d The case was brought by several people who had been blocked by Trump in 2017 after tweeting critical comments directed at him. The ruling is expected to set a more clear precedent for elected officials as they navigate the social media landscape that has emerged as a key means of connecting with the American public. The Justice Department argued in court that @realdonaldtrump is a personal account, as opposed to the White House\u2019s official Twitter handle. But Trump primarily uses his personal account to communicate, with the vast majority of his official statements and announcements being disseminated through his own handle. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer joined calls for labor secretary Alexander Acosta\u2019s resignation on Tuesday over his role in securing a lenient 2008 plea deal for Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire financier charged with operating a sex trafficking ring involving underage girls. \u201cIt is now impossible for anyone to have confidence in Secretary Acosta\u2019s ability to lead the department of labor. If he refuses to resign, President Trump should fire him,\u201d Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor. Schumer was the latest prominent Democrat to push for Acosta\u2019s departure amid fresh scrunity over the \u2018sweetheart deal\u2019 he cut with Epstein while serving as Miami\u2019s top federal prosecutor more than a decade ago. In a tweet late Monday, House speaker Nancy Pelosi said Acosta \u201cmust step down\u201d, while dubbing his agreement with Epstein as \u201cunconscionable\u201d. Epstein pleaded not guilty on Monday in a New York court to one count of sex trafficking conspiracy and a second of sex trafficking underage females. Some of the victims were as young as 14, according to the unsealed indictment. My colleague Ed Pilkington has a report on the growing brigade of Democrats seeking Acosta\u2019s resignation, as well as the details of the deal he struck with Epstein that enabled the financier to avoid a public trial and heavy jail sentence: As the federal prosecutor leading the case in 2008, Acosta oversaw a plea deal in which Epstein was granted a highly unusual non-prosecution agreement that shielded him from all federal criminal charges relating to his more than 30 incidents of potential abuse of young girls. Under the deal, the FBI investigation that had already culminated in a 53-page draft indictment was shut down in favor of Epstein pleading guilty to two lesser state charges that controversially labelled his victims as prostitutes. Immunity was also granted to Epstein\u2019s \u201cpotential co-conspirators\u201d, though it did not identify individuals. Epstein ended up serving just 13 months in jail with the ability to leave the prison every day to attend his luxury business premises. 2020 presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar also called on Acosta to resign on Tuesday. \u201cSince when do underage girl sex ring traffickers get to go to their office every day while they serve their time? The victims should have had a say. That\u2019s what the law says,\u201d Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota who opposed Acosta\u2019s nomination for labor secretary, said in a written statement. \u201cI didn\u2019t vote for former Florida U.S. Attorney Acosta to begin with and he should step down.\u201d Amy McGrath, a retired Marine fighter pilot, will run against Senate majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the 2020 election. McGrath rose to prominence in the 2018 midterms despite narrowly losing a bid for the House of Representatives. In an announcement video released on Tuesday, McGrath recalled writing a letter to McConnell as a 13-year-old girl detailing her wish to fly combat jets for the US. \u201cHe never wrote back,\u201d McGrath said. \u201cI\u2019m Amy McGrath, and I\u2019ve often wondered, how many other people did Mitch McConnell never take the time to write back or even think about?\u201d McGrath\u2019s entry into the Kentucky Senate race ended months of speculation over her plans. She was actively recruited by Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, according to reports. McConnell\u2019s campaign swiftly responded to McGrath\u2019s announcement by releasing a video casting her as too liberal for the state of Kentucky. Ross Perot, the two-time independent candidate for president, has died after a battle with leukemia, Dallas News reported. Perot was diagnosed with leukemia in February. He was 89. A family spokesperson confirmed Perot\u2019s death to the Associated Press. A self-made billionaire from Texas, Perot emerged as one of the most successful third-party candidates in modern history during the 1992 presidential election. Although he did not win any electoral college votes, Perot received nearly 19% of the popular vote -- marking the most impressive showing for an independent candidate since Theodore Roosevelt 80 years prior. Perot\u2019s second third-party run in 1996 was less successful. He was famously impersonated by Dana Carvey on Saturday Night Live during the 1990s. Following his second bid for president, Perot largely stayed out of politics. Perot is survived by his wife, Margot, and five children. Donald Trump may have disinvited Sir Kim Darroch from a dinner for the Amir of Qatar in Washington on Monday, but billionaire businessman Robert Kraft still had a seat at the table. Yes, the same Kraft who owns the New England Patriots who was charged as part of a prostitution investigation in south Florida. A photo from the dinner showed Kraft seated at Trump\u2019s table next to Christine Lagarde, the incoming president of the European Central Bank. The dinner was hosted by treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin inside the department\u2019s Cash Room in honor of Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. Trump is poised to meet with al-Thani at the White House on Tuesday. Earlier this year, Trump said he was \u201cvery surprised\u201d to see Kraft at the center of the prostitution scandal even as he defended the Patriots owner as having proclaimed his innocence. Billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer has formally launched his campaign for president, framing himself as \u201can outsider\u201d who has \u201cled grassroots efforts that have taken on big corporations and won results for people\u201d. Steyer made his bid official in an announcement video released on Tuesday, which calls for eradicating the influence of corporations on US politics. \u201cAmericans are deeply disappointed and hurt by the way they\u2019re treated by what they think is the power elite in Washington DC,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cAnd that goes across party lines and it goes across geography.\u201d Steyer is a former hedge fund investor who in recent years has been the Democratic Party\u2019s largest donor. He has spent the past year as the face of the movement to impeach Donald Trump and also poured millions of dollars into the fight against climate change. The topic of impeachment is nonetheless absent from Steyer\u2019s video, which avoids mentioning the president all together. Steyer is poised to spend $100m of his own fortune to fund his campaign. Read my full report on Steyer\u2019s 2020 launch here, in which my colleague Sam Levin and I break down the challenges he might face by entering a crowded Democratic field that has already held its first primary debates. Donald Trump has lashed out at Sir Kim Darroch as \u201ca very stupid guy\u201d in another Twitter tirade against the British ambassador to Washington that also took aim at Theresa May as \u201cfoolish\u201d. In a fresh pair of tweets on Tuesday, the president continued to react to leaked memos in which Kim described him as \u201cinept\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional\u201d. \u201cThe wacky Ambassador that the U.K. foisted upon the United States is not someone we are thrilled with, a very stupid guy,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cHe should speak to his country, and Prime Minister May, about their failed Brexit negotiation, and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was... handled.\u201d Trump\u2019s tweets came one day after he declared he would no longer deal with Darroch and claimed the British ambassador was \u201cnot liked or well thought of within the U.S.\u201d. Darroch was also uninvited from a dinner Trump hosted for the Emir of Qatar on Monday. May has meanwhile stood by Darroch amid the controversy, even as she rejected his assessment of Trump. In a written statement, Downing Street said Darroch \u201ccontinues to have the prime minister\u2019s full support\u201d, while adding: \u201cWe have made clear to the US how unfortunate this leak is.\u201d \u201cThe selective extracts leaked do not reflect the closeness of, and the esteem in which we hold, the relationship,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAt the same time, we have also underlined the importance of Ambassadors being able to provide honest, unvarnished assessments of the politics in their country. Liam Fox, Britain\u2019s international trade secretary, was set to meet on Tuesday with Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior adviser, in a bid to smooth over tensions. Good morning everyone! Sabrina Siddiqui here, ready to give you the latest in Washington and beyond. Donald Trump is already tweeting and continues to have some choice words for Theresa May and British ambassador Kim Darroch (more on that in just a moment). The president is poised to welcome the Emir of Qatar at the White House today, but clearly his mind does travel... I\u2019ll also bring you the latest on the 2020 election, where the Democratic field has seen yet another entry with Tom Steyer. Because that\u2019s just what the party needs \u2013 more candidates. All eyes are on the billionaire environmental activist, who launched his campaign today. So buckle up and stay tuned for more!",

      "bodyText": "About a quarter of the world\u2019s highest-emitting, publicly listed companies fail to report their greenhouse gas emissions and nearly half do not properly consider the risks from the climate crisis in decision-making, new research has found. The findings show the distance even the world\u2019s biggest companies still have to cover to meet the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change, according to the group of investors coordinating the report. The research covered a sample of 274 of the world\u2019s highest emitting companies which are publicly listed, and therefore must make official disclosures of key financial data. It was carried out by the Grantham Research Institute on climate change at the London School of Economics and commissioned by the Transition Pathway Initiative, a group of investors supportive of the Paris agreement, with about $14tn (\u00a311tn) in funds under management. Of a smaller sample of 160 of the biggest emitters, only one in eight \u2013 20 companies \u2013 globally were found to be reducing their emissions at the rate necessary to meet the Paris goal of holding temperature rises to within 2C of pre-industrial levels. Simon Dietz, co-director of the Grantham Institute, said: \u201cIt\u2019s over three years since the Paris agreement was signed, and this research shows the corporate sector is improving its climate planning and performance, but not fast enough. Cutting through the noise, we can see that barely 12% of companies plan to reduce emissions at the rate required to keep global warming below 2C.\u201d The researchers examined companies in key sectors including oil and gas, steel and aluminium, utilities, car manufacturing and air transport, which combined account for more than 40% of emissions from public companies around the world. New rules have been introduced in the UK that require big companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions. In many countries they are not required to do so but are encouraged by many stock exchanges and investor groups. The Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosure, backed by the Bank of England, has said such reporting is essential to allow investors to make properly informed decisions about their portfolios. Faith Ward, co-chair of the Transition Pathway Initiative, said investors would be taking note: \u201cThis research shows clear leaders and laggards emerging within sectors from airlines to aluminium, and that gives investors an investment-relevant decision to make today. \u201cAs the effects of climate change accelerate, we can expect to see more capital flow away from those companies that bury their head in the sand, and towards those companies aligning with a 2C pathway.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "This time last year the Financial Reporting Council tried to read the riot act to the auditing industry. Standards, which were already too low, had fallen, the regulator\u2019s inspectors reported. The Big Four firms were told to \u201cact swiftly to reverse the decline\u201d. KMPG (famous audit: Carillion) was the worst of the bunch and was put in the equivalent of special measures. After such public shaming, and with the Competition and Markets Authority on the prowl, you would expect the well-paid partners at all the professional firms to put their houses in order, right? Wrong. The FRC\u2019s latest report has landed and it describes more of the same. One in four audits across the industry was below standard, so performance was not even close to the watchdog\u2019s acceptability target of 90%. None of the firms reached that par score. PwC (famous audit: BHS) has replaced KMPG as the laggard within the Big Four with only 65% of its audits deemed acceptable. PwC scored 90% as recently as two years ago. The news is worse for anyone who fondly believes salvation lies in empowering the next tier of auditors to disrupt the comfortable lives of the big firms. The worst performer was Grant Thornton (famous audit: Patisserie Valerie) where four out of eight inspected audits were not up to scratch, which goes some way to explaining why the firm itself has volunteered not to pitch for auditing work at FTSE 350 companies.

Year after year, though, the FRC\u2019s study points to the same deep cultural failure: auditors\u2019 inability to deploy professional scepticism and to challenge management\u2019s assumptions. Familiarity, the regulator suggests, is a factor. An auditor can come to see the company, rather than the investors, as \u201cthe client\u201d.

It said promises to spend the payoff in border and security infrastructure at the Channel Tunnel was \u201cwindow dressing\u201d and that Eurotunnel would have invested at least that amount of money, irrespective of the settlement.</p> <p>The transport secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/chrisgrayling\">Chris Grayling</a>, has faced widespread calls for his resignation over the ferry fiasco, which included the award of contracts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/03/brexit-freight-ferry-firm-appears-all-geared-up-to-deliver-pizzas\">Seaborne Freight</a>, a company with no ships, and led to yet further legal action from P&amp;O, which objected to the money paid to its competitor Eurotunnel. Two contracts to ensure ferry space for essential supplies in the event of holdups at Dover after Brexit were signed with DFDS and Brittany Ferries, and scrapped in May without the services having been used.</p> <p>While the Conservative contenders to succeed Theresa May as prime minister have signalled they would be prepared to lead Britain out of Europe without a deal, the MPs warned that momentum was slowing in Whitehall, adding: \u201cWe remain concerned that departments\u2019 preparations are being left too late.

      "bodyText": "The rushed, botched procurement of ferry services for a no-deal Brexit which cost the taxpayer nearly \u00a385m could be repeated unless Whitehall urgently steps up contingency preparations for a 31 October withdrawal, MPs have warned. A critical report from the public accounts committee said the Department for Transport took \u201cexcessive risks\u201d, resulting in a \u00a333m payment to Eurotunnel to settle legal action, on top of the \u00a351.4m paid to cancel its ferry contracts when the Brexit deadline was extended. The committee also dismissed DfT claims that the payment to Eurotunnel, which sued after being excluded from the procurement process, would secure any public value. It said promises to spend the payoff in border and security infrastructure at the Channel Tunnel was \u201cwindow dressing\u201d and that Eurotunnel would have invested at least that amount of money, irrespective of the settlement. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has faced widespread calls for his resignation over the ferry fiasco, which included the award of contracts to Seaborne Freight, a company with no ships, and led to yet further legal action from P&amp;O, which objected to the money paid to its competitor Eurotunnel. Two contracts to ensure ferry space for essential supplies in the event of holdups at Dover after Brexit were signed with DFDS and Brittany Ferries, and scrapped in May without the services having been used. While the Conservative contenders to succeed Theresa May as prime minister have signalled they would be prepared to lead Britain out of Europe without a deal, the MPs warned that momentum was slowing in Whitehall, adding: \u201cWe remain concerned that departments\u2019 preparations are being left too late. The window for decision-making for any departure on 31 October is short and key deadlines for decisions are passing every day.\u201d The committee called on the government to ensure that departments urgently stepped up their preparations on the assumption the UK would leave the EU on deadline. It said that, according to the Cabinet Office, a fresh decision on ferry procurement was needed imminently. But the MPs warned: \u201cThere is a real risk that the short time left will force [the DfT] into further high-risk procurements.\u201d Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the committee, said: \u201cIn just four months\u2019 time, the UK is expected to leave the EU yet momentum appears to have slowed in Whitehall. Departments must urgently step up their preparations and ensure that the country is ready. \u201cThe taxpayer has been landed with a \u00a385m bill with very little to show for it following the rushed procurement of ferry freight capacity. \u201cPublic benefits from the settlement with Eurotunnel amount to little more than window dressing. The department needs to keep a close eye and ensure that Eurotunnel deliver what is promised.\u201d",

One is the great scene where a penitent Peter seeks to comfort his dying mother on her passage to the next world: this is beautifully played by a tearful McArdle and a stoic Ann Louise Ross determining which recording of Strauss\u2019s Four Last Songs she wants at her funeral. The other big moment is the returning Peter\u2019s encounter with the Button Moulder whom Oliver Ford Davies invests with a transfixing stillness as he stresses the difference between self-discovery and self-improvement.</p> <p>McArdle, on stage for most of the play\u2019s three-and-a-half hours, impressively captures not just Peter\u2019s progress from youth to age but also his tragic awareness of his own emptiness. In a large cast, there is striking support from Anya Chalotra as the faithful Sabine and Jonathan Coy as a square-snouted troll-king. Jonathan Kent\u2019s production and Richard Hudson\u2019s design virtuosically meet the demands of a text that transports us from Dunoon to a Trump-style golf-course, a Riyadh hotel, the sands near Giza and a storm-lashed ship. I\u2019ve always thought there is something inordinate about Ibsen\u2019s original play in which, fine though it is, the means feel disproportionate to the ends.</p> <p>But Hare has fashioned from this unruly epic an intriguing new work that exposes the madness of a modern world where truth is subjective and everything is viewed through the narrow prism of self.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/peter-gynt\">the Olivier, National Theatre, London</a>, until 8 October.At the <a href=\"https://www.eif.co.uk/whats-on/2019/petergynt?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpsaf1uep4wIVypPtCh0ZAw50EAAYAiAAEgJwcfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Festival theatre, Edinburgh</a>, as part of the Edinburgh international festival, 1 - 10 August.</p>",

While Hare\u2019s writing is full of wit and ingenuity, it is fascinating to see how at two precise moments the power of Ibsen\u2019s play reasserts itself. One is the great scene where a penitent Peter seeks to comfort his dying mother on her passage to the next world: this is beautifully played by a tearful McArdle and a stoic Ann Louise Ross determining which recording of Strauss\u2019s Four Last Songs she wants at her funeral. The other big moment is the returning Peter\u2019s encounter with the Button Moulder whom Oliver Ford Davies invests with a transfixing stillness as he stresses the difference between self-discovery and self-improvement. McArdle, on stage for most of the play\u2019s three-and-a-half hours, impressively captures not just Peter\u2019s progress from youth to age but also his tragic awareness of his own emptiness. In a large cast, there is striking support from Anya Chalotra as the faithful Sabine and Jonathan Coy as a square-snouted troll-king. Jonathan Kent\u2019s production and Richard Hudson\u2019s design virtuosically meet the demands of a text that transports us from Dunoon to a Trump-style golf-course, a Riyadh hotel, the sands near Giza and a storm-lashed ship. I\u2019ve always thought there is something inordinate about Ibsen\u2019s original play in which, fine though it is, the means feel disproportionate to the ends. But Hare has fashioned from this unruly epic an intriguing new work that exposes the madness of a modern world where truth is subjective and everything is viewed through the narrow prism of self. \u2022 At the Olivier, National Theatre, London, until 8 October.At the Festival theatre, Edinburgh, as part of the Edinburgh international festival, 1 - 10 August.",

The industry has got to take stock, because how do you keep doing what we\u2019re doing and nothing changes?\u201d</p> <p>Guardian Australia is aware of a recent incident at a large Queensland coalmine, where labour hire workers were instructed to operate bulldozers near a body of water, in similar circumstances to a fatal accident that occurred at a separate mine site in December.</p> <p>The experienced mineworker was killed when his bulldozer rolled about 20m into a body of mud and water on 31 December. Subsequently, the Queensland government made <a href=\"https://www.dnrme.qld.gov.au/business/mining/safety-and-health/alerts-and-bulletins/mines-safety/fatal-incident-as-bulldozer-overturns-into-pit-update\">non-binding recommendations to prevent a similar incident</a>.</p> <p>The most recent fatality occurred on Sunday. A 27-year-old mineworker, Jack Gerdes, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/07/man-27-fourth-to-die-in-queensland-coalmines-in-six-months\">crushed and killed while trying to get into an excavator</a> at the Baralaba North mine in the Bowen Basin.</p> <p>On the same day another man, aged 57, was seriously injured after falling about 10m from a platform at a coalmine at Collinsville.</p> <p>David Cliff, a leading health and safety expert, says modern safety standards meant all mine workplace accidents should be preventable.</p> <p>\u201cTo get one or two may be an aberration,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cTo get six is not an aberration.\u201d</p> <p>Cliff, from the Minerals Industry Safety and Health Centre, said high degrees of automation and larger machinery had resulted in fewer workers on mine sites, and workers who were required to perform more diverse tasks.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to be eternally vigilant. The key to fixing things is to predict the precursor events or situations before they become an accident.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to get a really good reporting culture with no fear of blame. If someone does something wrong, we don\u2019t want them not reporting it because they\u2019re afraid to lose their job.\u201d</p> <p>The Queensland Resources Council, in a statement on Monday, said that \u201cno death on a mine site is acceptable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIndustry is working on measures for a safety reset to refocus on safety in light of the recent tragedies,\u201d the statement said.</p> <h2><strong>Real issue in workplaces</strong></h2> <p>On Tuesday the Queensland mines minister, Anthony Lynham, went public to confirm that an advisory committee on mining safety had not met for four months, because it had been unable to meet state-mandated gender quotas.</p> <p>While the committee\u2019s inaction has stirred some minor political and media outrage, most in the sector acknowledge the real issues are occurring at the coalface, not in a committee room.</p> <p>Cliff said it was \u201cdrawing a very long bow\u201d to suggest the incidents were in any way linked to the committee. Smyth said issues with the committee were \u201ca smokescreen\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way a committee would stop someone being killed.

They\u2019re the real issues.</p> <p>\u201cIf I have an accident on the highway, I can be charged and go to jail. What happens with a multinational? They hire someone else and get back to business.

      "bodyText": "Contract and casual mineworkers in Queensland are fearful of \u201cretribution\u201d if they complain about questionable safety practices, their union says, as the sector grapples with a sixth workplace death in the past year. The recent cluster of accidents and deaths, the worst on record in Queensland for 22 years, has prompted the state government to commission two independent reviews into mine safety. In the meantime, safety experts and the mineworkers\u2019 union have raised concern about the \u201creporting culture\u201d at mine sites, where most workers are now employed on a casual basis by labour-hire companies, rather than working directly for the multinational mine operators. \u201cMorale is absolutely the lowest I\u2019ve ever seen it,\u201d the CFMEU Queensland mining and energy division president, Stephen Smyth, told Guardian Australia. Major mining operations are increasingly staffed by workers without the security of a permanent job. About 60% are contractors working for labour hire firms. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think they can speak up. People think: how am I going to put food on the table if I can\u2019t get regular work? The workplace practices mean that workers, for fear of reprisals, won\u2019t stand up and speak out. \u201cSomething drastic has to happen. We\u2019re calling for a reset. The industry has got to take stock, because how do you keep doing what we\u2019re doing and nothing changes?\u201d Guardian Australia is aware of a recent incident at a large Queensland coalmine, where labour hire workers were instructed to operate bulldozers near a body of water, in similar circumstances to a fatal accident that occurred at a separate mine site in December. The experienced mineworker was killed when his bulldozer rolled about 20m into a body of mud and water on 31 December. Subsequently, the Queensland government made non-binding recommendations to prevent a similar incident. The most recent fatality occurred on Sunday. A 27-year-old mineworker, Jack Gerdes, was crushed and killed while trying to get into an excavator at the Baralaba North mine in the Bowen Basin. On the same day another man, aged 57, was seriously injured after falling about 10m from a platform at a coalmine at Collinsville. David Cliff, a leading health and safety expert, says modern safety standards meant all mine workplace accidents should be preventable. \u201cTo get one or two may be an aberration,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cTo get six is not an aberration.\u201d Cliff, from the Minerals Industry Safety and Health Centre, said high degrees of automation and larger machinery had resulted in fewer workers on mine sites, and workers who were required to perform more diverse tasks. \u201cYou need to be eternally vigilant. The key to fixing things is to predict the precursor events or situations before they become an accident. \u201cWe need to get a really good reporting culture with no fear of blame. If someone does something wrong, we don\u2019t want them not reporting it because they\u2019re afraid to lose their job.\u201d The Queensland Resources Council, in a statement on Monday, said that \u201cno death on a mine site is acceptable\u201d. \u201cIndustry is working on measures for a safety reset to refocus on safety in light of the recent tragedies,\u201d the statement said. Real issue in workplaces On Tuesday the Queensland mines minister, Anthony Lynham, went public to confirm that an advisory committee on mining safety had not met for four months, because it had been unable to meet state-mandated gender quotas. While the committee\u2019s inaction has stirred some minor political and media outrage, most in the sector acknowledge the real issues are occurring at the coalface, not in a committee room. Cliff said it was \u201cdrawing a very long bow\u201d to suggest the incidents were in any way linked to the committee. Smyth said issues with the committee were \u201ca smokescreen\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cThere\u2019s no way a committee would stop someone being killed. It\u2019s a beat up, they\u2019re missing the point,\u201d Smyth said. \u201cThe lack of experience, the lack of supervision, the push for production, the influx of labour hire. They\u2019re the real issues. \u201cIf I have an accident on the highway, I can be charged and go to jail. What happens with a multinational? They hire someone else and get back to business. The next CEO will get up and say safety is paramount. But they\u2019re all full of shit. It\u2019s a big machine and they just want production at any cost. \u201cNothing is going to really change until we change the work practices.\u201d On Sunday, as news filtered through of the most recent fatality and another accident, residents of the Bowen Basin\u2019s mining towns experienced a familiar panic. Most mines don\u2019t allow workers to carry mobile phones on shift. People could not reach their loved ones. \u201cIt flows on to their partners in the communities,\u201d Smyth said. \u201cWhen one person dies in the mining industry it has a ripple effect that runs through the communities. There\u2019s the mental stress of it all. It\u2019s just like one big pot. \u201cI was an underground coal miner, I get what they\u2019re going through. But I haven\u2019t seen morale as bad.\u201d with agencies",

He was told he had lost a sale due to a negative review from a person called Ashley T. The comment, made a year ago, claimed the point-of-sale software was buggy and the company did not communicate well in response to complaints. \u201cI would STRONGLY recommend not buying this product,\u201d the review said. Tower\u2019s story is far from uncommon, as the impact of negative reviews is hotly debated among customers, businesses and Google, which has found itself increasingly embroiled in court actions. Fletcher replied, saying the business had tried several times to contact the customer and left them a message. But more anonymous negative reviews began rolling in, bringing down the company\u2019s rating. Fletcher says it was difficult to get Google to do anything about it. \u201cWe filled in Google forms, complaining about false and misleading reviews and anonymous reviews and have heard nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cGoogle makes it easy for people to complain about businesses but almost impossible to deal with misleading claims. \u201cThe power Google has is extraordinary.\u201d Fletcher even started paying for Google Ads, thinking it would help get a response from the tech giant, to no avail. \u201cAbsolute silence from Google,\u201d he says. The negative reviews and lower star rating on Google began costing the company business leads, Fletcher says. He says he was forced to ask customers to leave positive reviews to fix the rating. The average is now up to 3.8 out of 5. \u201cI hate doing that. I want reviews to be natural,\u201d he says. Online reviews such as those on Google, Facebook or Yelp can make or break a business. Some businesses and customers swear by them, others curse their existence. Some people told Guardian Australia a good Google review rating was a useful way to find small businesses that didn\u2019t have a website. Jillian Harrison, who manages social media for Republic Bar in Hobart, says users who saw reviews for the bar come up in search were often prompted to leave similar reviews. \u201cGoogle reviewers tend to be a bit more specifically analytical in their comments \u2013 less of the broadsided swipes or praises,\u201d she says. \u201cThey tend to say why they like or dislike something, which is definitely useful.\u201d Others say leaving a negative review is a good way to get a company\u2019s attention when it is otherwise unresponsive. Rory Gallagher, the Australian managing director of the Behavioural Insights Team, says review systems are more likely to have an impact on smaller businesses than generic chains. \u201cConsumers might already know what to expect from a burger at McDonald\u2019s, but know less about an independent burger restaurant, so may be much more influenced by the ratings of others,\u201d he says. Much of the contention around online reviews comes down to verification, whether people can review anonymously, and what power businesses have to pull down fake or inaccurate reviews. Some review websites require verification for users. Google does not. Gallagher suggests one change that could help weed out fake reviews would be for feedback to be displayed on a profile only once a certain number of reviews have been posted. A review of the Australian Consumer Law in 2017 found that some businesses have gone as far as getting customers to sign nondisclosure agreements in settling consumer law disputes to prevent customers speaking publicly about bad experiences. Several companies have been set up promising to get bad online reviews removed, but increasingly businesses are turning to the courts, with a growing number of defamation cases aimed at either the reviewer or Google itself. This week Google faces contempt of court charges in the New South Wales supreme court after it failed to immediately follow a court order to take down damaging reviews about an unnamed Sydney businessman. In late June, the NSW supreme court ordered a woman to pay $530,000 in damages to a cosmetic surgeon over a review she left about her nose and cheek surgery. The review was online for three weeks until the doctor took her to court. He reported a 23.61% drop in visitors to his website a week after the first negative review was posted. Google has complied with court orders to remove reviews, but has argued that defamation cases can work against consumer rights, and damage freedom of speech. In a submission in April to the NSW review of defamation reform, the company highlighted that the Australian competition watchdog had recently taken legal action against a car hire company called Australian 4WD Hire for allegedly unfair contract terms. Google pointed out that the same company had won interim orders in the federal court against Google just 18 months earlier for negative reviews, forcing it to pull them down. \u201cThis is a classic example of defamation laws leading to the suppression of information that would have prevented consumers suffering from unfair business practices,\u201d Google said. Google has argued the fight should be between the person who left the allegedly defamatory review and the business itself. At the same time, the company said it did not want to have to remove alleged defamatory content without a court order, arguing it should not be the arbiter of what is or is not defamatory. \u201cGoogle submits that takedown procedures should only be implemented following a court order.

One experiment had indicated they could <a href=\"https://www.wideopenpets.com/goats-can-tell-their-friends-in-the-herd-by-the-sounds-they-make/\">distinguish the calls of goat \u201cfriends\u201d</a> from strangers\u2019 calls, raising the question of whether they could also tell how their companions were feeling.</p> <p>\u201cExpressing emotions using vocalisations and being able to detect and share the emotional state of another animal from the same species may facilitate coordination among the individuals in a group and strengthen social bonds and group cohesion,\u201d said Elodie Briefer, a co-author of the study, who was based at ETH Zurich during the research and is now at the University of Copenhagen.</p> <p>The researchers recorded goat calls when the animals were being given food pellets or being reunited with other goats from the herd &#xa0;(happy) and when they were watching another goat eating food pellets without having access to the food themselves (sad).</p> <p>They then played these sounds to other animals and recorded their reaction. They found the goats could distinguish between the different types of calls. They also had different physiological responses depending on the emotion they heard. When listening to positive emotions, the goats\u2019 heart rate became more erratic.</p> <p>\u201cThey potentially can perceive the emotional content and be affected by the emotions of the calls they hear,\u201d said Livio Favaro. \u201cThere might be the first suggestion of emotional contagion through vocalisations.\u201d</p> <p>The findings, published in the journal Frontiers in Zoology, could have implications for the way livestock are housed.</p> <p>Frans de Waal, a primatologist and expert in animal cognition at Emory University, said: \u201cGoats being sensitive to the emotions of others is a form of empathy. Empathy is a mammalian trait, so this makes sense.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel Sparkes, a goat keeper and spokeswoman for the British Goat Society, said the findings were in line with her experience. \u201cI find goats to be much more sensitive to change than other livestock, so it would make sense that they notice emotional changes in the calls from other goats,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI have found over the years that goats are excellent listeners. They seem able to read human emotions well and if I\u2019m having a bad day the goats will always cheer me up. They know when you\u2019re upset or happy or stressed.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "They are known for gobbling socks from washing lines and for their fearsome headbutting capabilities but the rich emotional life of goats may have been underestimated. Scientists have found that goats are able to distinguish emotions from each other\u2019s calls and also respond to the feelings of their peers, a phenomenon known as emotional contagion. \u201cDespite its evolutionary importance, social communication of emotions in non-human animals is still not well understood,\u201d said Luigi Baciadonna, the lead author of the study from Queen Mary University of London. Baciadonna and colleagues selected goats as a promising candidate for having emotional intelligence as previous research had revealed them to be surprisingly clever and to have complex social lives. One experiment had indicated they could distinguish the calls of goat \u201cfriends\u201d from strangers\u2019 calls, raising the question of whether they could also tell how their companions were feeling. \u201cExpressing emotions using vocalisations and being able to detect and share the emotional state of another animal from the same species may facilitate coordination among the individuals in a group and strengthen social bonds and group cohesion,\u201d said Elodie Briefer, a co-author of the study, who was based at ETH Zurich during the research and is now at the University of Copenhagen. The researchers recorded goat calls when the animals were being given food pellets or being reunited with other goats from the herd (happy) and when they were watching another goat eating food pellets without having access to the food themselves (sad). They then played these sounds to other animals and recorded their reaction. They found the goats could distinguish between the different types of calls. They also had different physiological responses depending on the emotion they heard. When listening to positive emotions, the goats\u2019 heart rate became more erratic. \u201cThey potentially can perceive the emotional content and be affected by the emotions of the calls they hear,\u201d said Livio Favaro. \u201cThere might be the first suggestion of emotional contagion through vocalisations.\u201d The findings, published in the journal Frontiers in Zoology, could have implications for the way livestock are housed. Frans de Waal, a primatologist and expert in animal cognition at Emory University, said: \u201cGoats being sensitive to the emotions of others is a form of empathy. Empathy is a mammalian trait, so this makes sense.\u201d Rachel Sparkes, a goat keeper and spokeswoman for the British Goat Society, said the findings were in line with her experience. \u201cI find goats to be much more sensitive to change than other livestock, so it would make sense that they notice emotional changes in the calls from other goats,\u201d she said. \u201cI have found over the years that goats are excellent listeners. They seem able to read human emotions well and if I\u2019m having a bad day the goats will always cheer me up. They know when you\u2019re upset or happy or stressed.\u201d",

The calculation was that Gove would be more brutal in debate. After tonight, that\u2019s not looking such a good judgment because Hunt was more assertive than we\u2019ve seen him before, challenging Johnson repeatedly on specifics. Judged on these skirmishes, Hunt won the debate handsomely. He came over as better briefed and more forensic, and there were several moments in the debate where Johnson found bluster and bonhomie a poor substitute for arguments.</p> \n  <p>That said, given what all the polling is telling us about the Conservative membership, it would have taken a Titanic disaster for Johnson start throwing away large numbers of votes amongst the (possibly few) Tory members who have not already returned the ballot papers that went out by post last week. Johnson sounded glib and cavalier, but it would be impossible to have been involved in Conservative politics and not to have noticed that he\u2019s like that already. Also, Johnson did better in the second half than in the first half - fighting Hunt to a draw on tax, to my ears, and deflating Hunt a bit by making him admit that his \u201ckeep Kim Darroch\u201d pledge only lasted until Christmas. </p> \n  <p>The debate exposed two big faultlines between the two men. Johnson is determined to play down the risk of a no-deal Brexit, while Hunt isn\u2019t. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/09/theresa-may-stands-by-uk-ambassador-in-wake-of-trump-criticism-politics-live?page=with:block-5d24e7db8f0845f89e309dec#block-5d24e7db8f0845f89e309dec\">8.18pm.)</a> And, while Hunt is willing to be at least moderately critical of President Trump, tonight Johnson refused point blank. Mainstream UK opinion, and certainly Guardian opinion, would be with Hunt on both this issues. But most Tory members are Brexiters, and there is a lot of polling evidence to suggest that leave voters believe the risks of a no-deal Brexit have been exaggerated. And, on Trump, Johnson was effectively endorsing his claim that May\u2019s Brexit strategy has been a disaster - an assessment shared by many grassroots Conservatives. Johnson acquitted himself poorly this evening but, ideologically, he is probably in the right place for someone this electorate.</p> \n  <p>And one more point; it is important to remember that debates almost never have as much impact on elections as the media assume. </p> \n  <p>So, overall, it was a clear, technical victory for Hunt - but probably a superficial one too.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dab4b8fa6a2e5e6f241d59a36aec1cfe9a5a78b\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dab4b8fa6a2e5e6f241d59a36aec1cfe9a5a78b/0_111_5485_3290/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson (left) and Jeremy Hunt in the debate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson (left) and Jeremy Hunt in the debate.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Han Yan/Xinhua/Barcroft Media</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-10T09:46:58.780Z\">at 10.46am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d24f0f38f08d0b6ca52d578\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-09T19:56:46.874Z\">8.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Closing statements</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>They are now making closing statements.</p> \n  <p>Hunt says he wants to make this amazing country.

This represents a tiny minority, but one antisemite is one too many, and we will continue to act against this repugnant form of racism.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d24b6c48f0845f89e309b9d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-09T15:49:41.341Z\">4.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>These are from <strong>Ian Blackford</strong>, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, explaining why SNPs MPs will be voting on the amendments to allow same-sex marriage and abortion in Northern Ireland even though the party normally abstains on devolved matters.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanBlackfordMP/status/1148534042192744448\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For those asking, I strongly support equal marriage, and women\u2019s right to choose on abortion.</p>\u2014 Ian Blackford (@IanBlackfordMP) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IanBlackfordMP/status/1148534042192744448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 9, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanBlackfordMP/status/1148534292227723264\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I'm very proud that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theSNP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@theSNP</a> government introduced the UK\u2019s most progressive equal marriage law, and that Scotland is the only part of the UK where couples from Northern Ireland can convert their civil partnership to a same-sex marriage</p>\u2014 Ian Blackford (@IanBlackfordMP) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IanBlackfordMP/status/1148534292227723264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 9, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanBlackfordMP/status/1148534639520358400\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">While <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theSNP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@theSNP</a> will always defend the principle of devolution, there are a specific set of circumstances in Northern Ireland where there has been no functioning Assembly for an extended period.</p>\u2014 Ian Blackford (@IanBlackfordMP) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IanBlackfordMP/status/1148534639520358400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 9, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanBlackfordMP/status/1148535515773362177\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In these circumstances, we believe it is right to give MPs a vote on these important human rights issues.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt escalated the blue-on-blue warfare in Tuesday night\u2019s televised debate, trading blows on which potential prime minister could see through a no-deal Brexit, as Hunt repeatedly emphasised his rival\u2019s refusal to answer questions. As Jessica Elgot reports, the bitter back-and-forth, which will raise questions over whether Hunt could serve in a Johnson government after the aspersions he cast on his rival, saw the foreign secretary accuse Johnson of putting personal ambition above the welfare of the country. In the hour-long ITV broadcast, Johnson swerved questions repeatedly on whether he would resign if he failed to deliver Brexit by 31 October and declined to condemn Donald Trump for his attacks on the British ambassador. Johnson also gave equivocal answers on issues including HS2, Heathrow\u2019s third runway, and abortion and LGBT rights in Northern Ireland. MPs have voted resoundingly to extend same-sex marriage and access to abortion to Northern Ireland, bringing the region into line with the rest of the UK on the two significant social issues. Transatlantic tensions over the British ambassador\u2019s leaked criticisms of Donald Trump have grown into a diplomatic crisis after the US president attacked Sir Kim Darroch as \u201ca pompous fool\u201d and his commerce secretary postponed planned trade talks with Liam Fox. Jeremy Corbyn has sought to draw a line under Labour\u2019s Brexit travails by announcing a \u201csettled\u201d policy of backing remain in any referendum called on a Conservative deal. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Here is my colleague Rowena Mason on who did best. The ITV debate started just as MPs were voting on Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment 17. (See 8.02pm.) It was defeated by 293 votes to 289 - a majority of 4. So, two of Grieve\u2019s amendments were defeated, but one was passed. (See 7.41pm.) This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the debate on Twitter. Generally, the view seems to be that Jeremy Hunt did well, but not well enough to make a difference. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From ITV\u2019s Tom Bradby From my colleague Jennifer Rankin From the Sunday Times\u2019 Tim Shipman From the FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne From the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire And here\u2019s an extract from Maguire\u2019s article. The foreign secretary gave a spirited, combative performance, and Johnson spent much of the hour on the ropes and visibly rattled as a result. But does it stand any chance of translating into a shock victory? For the answer, look to Johnson\u2019s reply to the final question of the debate: what qualities did the candidates most admire in their opponent? The frontrunner responded with mockery of Hunt\u2019s ability to change his mind on Brexit. Add that to his willingness to commit what many Tory members believe to be the unforgivable heresy of entertaining EU membership beyond 31 October and it is plain to see why, despite his far from watertight platform, Johnson remains in pole position. From the BBC\u2019s Susana Mendonca From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole From ITV\u2019s Piers Morgan From the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley From ITV\u2019s Susanna Reid From the Telegraph\u2019s Tim Stanley In the early stages of the Tory leadership contest the Boris Johnson camp concluded that Michael Gove would pose more of a threat than Jeremy Hunt in the final stage of the contest, and it is widely assumed at Westminster that this assessment resulted in Team Johnson lending Hunt the votes he need to beat Gove by just two in the MPs\u2019 ballot. The calculation was that Gove would be more brutal in debate. After tonight, that\u2019s not looking such a good judgment because Hunt was more assertive than we\u2019ve seen him before, challenging Johnson repeatedly on specifics. Judged on these skirmishes, Hunt won the debate handsomely. He came over as better briefed and more forensic, and there were several moments in the debate where Johnson found bluster and bonhomie a poor substitute for arguments. That said, given what all the polling is telling us about the Conservative membership, it would have taken a Titanic disaster for Johnson start throwing away large numbers of votes amongst the (possibly few) Tory members who have not already returned the ballot papers that went out by post last week. Johnson sounded glib and cavalier, but it would be impossible to have been involved in Conservative politics and not to have noticed that he\u2019s like that already. Also, Johnson did better in the second half than in the first half - fighting Hunt to a draw on tax, to my ears, and deflating Hunt a bit by making him admit that his \u201ckeep Kim Darroch\u201d pledge only lasted until Christmas. The debate exposed two big faultlines between the two men. Johnson is determined to play down the risk of a no-deal Brexit, while Hunt isn\u2019t. (See 8.18pm.) And, while Hunt is willing to be at least moderately critical of President Trump, tonight Johnson refused point blank. Mainstream UK opinion, and certainly Guardian opinion, would be with Hunt on both this issues. But most Tory members are Brexiters, and there is a lot of polling evidence to suggest that leave voters believe the risks of a no-deal Brexit have been exaggerated. And, on Trump, Johnson was effectively endorsing his claim that May\u2019s Brexit strategy has been a disaster - an assessment shared by many grassroots Conservatives. Johnson acquitted himself poorly this evening but, ideologically, he is probably in the right place for someone this electorate. And one more point; it is important to remember that debates almost never have as much impact on elections as the media assume. So, overall, it was a clear, technical victory for Hunt - but probably a superficial one too. They are now making closing statements. Hunt says he wants to make this amazing country. He only makes promises he can keep. Our country deserves no less, he says. Johnson says the only way to get this country off \u201cthe hamster wheel of doom\u201d is by getting Brexit done. This is an amazing country. Now is the time to show we believe in Britain, he says. And that\u2019s it. The debate is over. Reaction, analysis and a summary coming up soon. Q: What do you admire about each other? Johnson says he admires Hunt\u2019s ability to change his mind - as he did over Brexit. Hunt says he admires Johnson\u2019s ability to not answer the question. Johnson cracks a joke, and you forget the question. It\u2019s a good trait in a politician. Q: Should HS2 be abandoned? Johnson says it should be reviewed, but he won\u2019t commit to abandoning it. Hunt says it should be backed to the hilt. Q: Will you publish a plan for social care this year? Yes, says Hunt. Yes, says Johnson. Q: Will you stop Heathrow\u2019s third runway going ahead? Johnson says he has the gravest reservations about this. Hunt says Johnson should be able to answer this. Q: Would you scrap universal credit? No, says Hunt. He says it has teething problems, but it is right in principle. Johnson also says he would keep it. Q: Do you support extending abortion rights and same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland? Yes, says Hunt. Johnson says these are matters for the Northern Ireland assembly. Q: Why was your first plan tax cuts for the rich? Johnson says it was part of a package. Hunt butts in. He says it was a mistake. He says he has spent his life telling people that the Tories are not just a party for the rich. Johnson asks Hunt if he is in favour of people on modest incomes having to pay higher rates of tax. Johnson is refusing to let Hunt answer. He claims Hunt won\u2019t reply, but he has not let him reply. Hunt says Johnson never answers the question. He says his priority for tax cuts would be people on low incomes. He says he has spent his life saying the Tories are not the party of the rich, but a party for everyone. Q: I am struggling to manage. Why are you prioritising tax cuts for the rich or for business, instead of for people like me? Hunt says he has prioritised corporation tax cuts. But that is because he wants to boost the economy. President Trump cut business taxes, and the US economy is now growing twice as fast as the UK\u2019s. He says he wants to grow the size of the cake. \u201cAbsolutely right,\u201d says Johnson. He says he would focus on the hardest pressed. He says as mayor of London he expanded the living wage. He wants to help the low paid by taking them out of national insurance. But he also thinks too many people are being dragged into the higher rate of tax. Q: Can someone trust a remain voter to deliver Brexit? Yes, says Hunt. He says he voted remain, but he delivered the extra \u00a3350m week promised for the NHS. Q: Why did you get your facts wrong on Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? Johnson says the Iranians are to blame for what happened to her. They are back. Q: Tell us about your character, your qualities? Johnson says he can get surprise results in difficult circumstances, as he did when he was London mayor. Hunt says he is prepared to deliver tough messages, as he did to President Trump today. Q: What is your response? Johnson says it is very important to have a good relationship with the White House. He says Trump was dragged into a political debate. That is sometimes not the right thing to do. On Kim Darroch, Johnson says it is vital that advice given to ministers should not be leaked by ministers. Johnson refuses to criticise President Trump for what he said about Theresa May. Q: Will Kim Darroch stay in office? Hunt says who chooses our ambassador is a matter for the UK government. If he is PM, Darroch stays. Johnson repeats his point about the need for ministers not to leak. Johnson implies that a minister was to blame for the Kim Darroch leak. Q: Will you keep him? Johnson refuses to say. Hunt says he will keep Darroch until he is due to retire. Johnson refuses to say that. But he says he, and he alone, will decide who takes politically important jobs like this one. Johnson refuses to commit to keeping Kim Darroch as ambassador to Washington. Section 1 - Snap verdict: There was talk this morning about Hunt needing to summon up a degree of fight not seen before to have any chance tonight, but so far, he is managing that. In strict debating terms, he is getting the better of Johnson time and time again. His challenge to Johnson about being willing to resign if he did not deliver Brexit by 31 October worked (Johnson\u2019s reply sounded evasive), and his line about getting facts wrong being okay for a columnist, but not for a PM, was the zinger of the opening section. Julia Etchingham asks people to raise their hands if they think the UK will leave the EU by 31 October. Hunt raises his hands. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit\u201d, says Johnson. He says he thought Hunt thought it could not be done. And the first third of the programme is over. Q: Would you do a deal with the Brexit party? Johnson says he does not believe in doing deals with any party? Q: What would your alternative to an election be? Hunt says he is the best person to get a deal, so the UK avoids this choice. He says he is a negotiator by backround. But if we take a hardline approach, the EU will to. Getting Brexit right is not about \u201cblind optimism\u201d, he says. Johnson says he resigned over the withdrawal agreement. Hunt points out that he voted for it too. Q: Would you be willing to prorogue parliament to get no-deal through? Hunt says the last time this was tried, we had a civil war. So he will say no. Johnson says it would be mistake to take anything off the table. He says Hunt has not set any timetable for coming out. He accuses Hunt of \u201cescalating the fears\u201d of a no-deal Brexit. He says the UK must come out, so the government can get back to the issues people want to talk about. Q: Parliament will not vote for no-deal. So isn\u2019t a general election inevitable? Hunt says this is why he is not setting 31 October as an absolute deadline. He does not want go back to the electorate until he has delivered Brexit. Johnson says it is \u201ctotally defeatist\u201d not to set 31 October. He says parliament has just voted against ruling out no-deal. (It is not clear what he is referring to - that is not how most people would describe tonight\u2019s votes.) Hunt accuses Johnson of \u201cpeddling optimism\u201d. He says it is important to be honest about the challenges ahead. Who said blood, sweat, toil and tears? Johnson corrects Hunt\u2019s Churchill quote. Hunt claims, if the UK prepares, it can get through this. But we should not pretend it will be a \u201cwalk in the park\u201d, he says. Hunt says in their last debate Johnson said Gatt 24 would allow the UK to avoid tariffs. But Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, says that is wrong. He says getting facts wrong is okay for a newspaper columnist, but not for someone doing this job. Johnson pushes back, claiming he never said the UK could use this unilaterally, but Hunt says that is not what he said. And Hunt says Johnson\u2019s claim the risk of a no-deal Brexit is a million to one is not correct, and irresponsible. Q: My business would suffer under no-deal. What will you do to avoid one? Johnson says he does not think there is much risk of no-deal. Hunt says he has run his business. He knows what it is like to face threats like this. He mentions visiting a steel business that would be harmed by tariffs. He has a 10-point plan. Q: Do you accept there is a cost to no-deal? Johnson says, badly handled, no-deal could be costly. He says it is \u201cvanishingly inexpensive\u201d if you prepare. Johnson says a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cvanishingly inexpensive\u201d if the UK prepares. Q: What is your plan for the backstop? Hunt says his plan is based on the Alternative Arrangements Commission report? Q: How long will it take? Hunt says it will take some time to set up. Q: Your plan? Johnson says there are a range of options, much as set out in the Alternative Arrangements Commission paper. Q: The EU has said it has looked the world over for a solution, and not found one. Johnson says they did not say that. He says solutions are available. Johnson says if the UK is willing to delay, the EU will not take it seriously. Hunt ask Johnson if he will resign if he fails to take the UK out by 31 October. Johnson at first dodges the question. Hunt presses him, and Johnson says it is important not to hold out any prospect of not coming out by 31 October. He says making that promise could encourage the EU to delay. Johnson says promising to resign if Brexit is not delivered by 31 October could give the EU an incentive to delay. Hunt says this is not leadership. Q: So how long will you delay? Hunt starts answering. Johnson challenges him repeatedly: Christmas? Hunt implies Johnson has been rude to the EU. He says he has a serious strategy. Julie Etchingham says the audience is made up of people how have voted Tory, or might do so in the future. Q: I used to vote Tory, but now I back the Brexit party, and I want to see Nigel Farage in Number 10. Can you guarantee we will leave the EU by 31 October? Hunt says he is as keen as anyone to deliver Brexit by 31 October. But there has been a breach of trust, and MPs should only make promises they can keep. Johnson says it is absolutely vital to leave by 31 October. Jeremy Hunt goes next. \u201cAs a tough negotiator, I will deliver Brexit,\u201d he says. But he will do so much more. He is an entrepreneur, he will reform services as he did with the NHS, and he knows how to get young people to vote Tory, he says. He says he won a marginal seat. And polls show he has most appeal to the public at large, he says. Boris Johnson goes first. He says we can carry on as now, or change, and put the country on the path to success. The way to do that is to deliver Brexit, propose plans for better infrastructure, and beat Jeremy Corbyn. The ITV debate is starting. MPs are now voting on Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment 17. Following the decision of the Speaker not to call his new clause 14, this is the Grieve amendment being voted on tonight with the most bite. It would require the progress reports that MPs have just voted to have fortnightly (see 7.41pm) to be debated. As the Hansard Society\u2019s Brigid Fowler explained, under the amendment MPs would debate an amendable motion - which means they could be used to trigger further Brexit votes. MPs have voted down Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment 16 - by 292 to 289. MPs are now voting on Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment 16. Here is the full text of it. Clause 3, page 2, line 16, leave out \u201cthe report\u201d and insert \u201cany report under this section\u201d In his explanatory statement Grieve describes this simply as \u201ca consequential amendment\u201d, meaning that now the bill has been amended to require fortnightly reports (see 7.21pm), the singular noun in this clause is no longer appropriate. Dominic Grieve has won - by a single vote. MPs voted for his amendment (see 7.18pm and 7.21pm) by 294 votes to 293. Here is Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, commenting ahead of tonight\u2019s ITV debate. From Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti, who is in Salford for the ITV debate This is what Lord Turnberg told Newsnight about why he was resigning the Labour whip. (See 3.43pm.) I am very saddened to have had to resign the Labour whip not least because my differences lie with the party leadership and machine and not with my very supportive colleagues in the Lords who share my values. It is not just the policies on foreign affairs- pro Russia, pro Venezuela, anti- America - and not just Brexit vacillation and bypassing parliamentary opinion, but the overt antisemitism that permeates the party machine that is no longer possible for me to tolerate. I fear for the future of this party to which I have devoted myself for so any years. Here is the full text of Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment 15. Clause 3, page 2, line 15, at end insert\u2014 \u201c(1A) The secretary of state shall make a further report under subsection 1 on or before 9 October 2019 at least every fourteen calendar days thereafter until either an Executive is formed or until 18 December 2019, whichever is the sooner.\u201d And here is Grieve\u2019s explanatory note. This amendment would require fortnightly reports to be made after the conference recess until an executive was formed, or until the December recess. In the Commons MPs are now voting on Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment 15. It is one that is intended to stop a new PM being able to prorogue parliament in the autumn, although whether in practice it will have that effect is a matter of debate. (See 2.07pm and 2.46pm.) Grieve thinks that, as long as this amendment does get passed, it will get beefed up in the Lords to make it more effective. (See 5.55pm.) This will probably be the closest vote of the night. Here is Boris Johnson arriving for the ITV Tory leadership debate in Salford. It starts at 8pm, and of course we will be covering it live. And here is Jeremy Hunt, who is going for the tieless look. The Julian Lewis amendment has been passed by 308 votes to 228 - a majority of 80. Here is the explanatory note from Lewis saying what his amendment will do. The subsection would include placing a duty on the secretary of state to report on the options available to ensure that veterans of the Troubles would be able to assist in a truth recovery process, for the benefit of bereaved families, without fear of prosecution. The Hansard Society\u2019s Brigid Fowler has posted a detailed Twitter thread explaining what the Grieve amendments being voted on tonight actually do. It starts here. But, sadly, the key issue is left unresolved. MPs are now voting on an amendment tabled by the Tory MP Julian Lewis that would oblige the government to investigate how military veterans of the Troubles could contribute to the truth recovery process without fear of prosecution. In the Commons John Penrose, the Northern Ireland minister, has just said that the government will accept one of Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendments \u2013 an innocuous one, amendment 14 \u2013 bringing forward the date when a progress report must be presented to parliament. But he said the government will oppose the other ones due to be vote on tonight. These are amendments saying that the government should make fortnightly reports on progress towards getting the power-sharing executive restored in Northern Ireland in the autumn, and that these reports should be debated. Grieve believes that, in practice, these would stop a new PM proroguing parliament, because if parliament were prorogued, these conditions could not be met. Penrose did not address this point, but he said they would introduce an excessive and unnecessary level of procedure into the bill. This is from Franki Appleton from Marie Stopes UK, which provides abortion services, on the Commons vote. This is a historic day for women\u2019s rights. As an organisation that has supported the push for abortion access in Northern Ireland, we are delighted that MPs have taken this opportunity to demand law reform and give every woman in the UK access to safe, legal abortion. For too long, women in Northern Ireland have been treated as second-class citizens, forcing them to give birth to babies they know will not survive outside of the womb, forcing rape victims to travel overseas to end their pregnancy and prosecuting mothers for protecting their daughters by procuring the same pills available on the NHS in England, Wales and Scotland. From the landslide referendum in the Republic of Ireland to today\u2019s momentous vote in Westminster, grievous rights are beginning to be righted and we join all the wonderful people who have campaigned for this in celebrating this much longed for progress. Lord Triesman has given an interview to Newsnight\u2019s Emily Maitlis about his decision to resign the Labour whip in the House of Lords today over antisemitism. (See 3.18pm.) This is what Triesman said about the decision. It\u2019s been building for a long time, with incident after incident. It\u2019s like a mad psychodrama. You pick up the morning\u2019s papers, and there\u2019s another issue. And quite aside from the issues that are in the public domain, the stream of invective that you get on social media is absolutely unbelievable \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anybody. So I think we have got to the point now where it is just unsustainable to continue. You have to take a decision about what your own ethics are. And this is what he said when asked to justify the claim he made in his resignation letter that Jeremy Corbyn is personally antisemitic. Asked for evidence of this, Triesman replied: If you look at event after event after event, and there is now a huge list of events. And you ask yourself the question, in relation to any one has he made the right call on it? And the answer is not once, never. And in those circumstances, it\u2019s hard not to come to the conclusion that he either is indifferent to the problem or he is part of the problem. And here is a statement from Sinn Fein on the two votes. It\u2019s from the Sinn Fein MP Elisha McCallion. Marriage equality, like Irish language rights, victims and women\u2019s rights should be addressed by the Assembly. They have not been because rights have been repeatedly vetoed by the DUP, enabled by the British government. It was inevitable that the British government\u2019s failure to defend basic rights available everywhere else on these islands would be confronted. This was the message coming out of Westminster today. Rights delayed are rights denied and the obvious political imperative now is to ensure that all citizens are afforded rights and equality, regardless of where they live on these islands. Here is Tony Lloyd, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, on tonight\u2019s two Commons votes. Today parliament has voted to ensure that love no longer has borders and women are not treated as second class citizens. The government must now act to bring forward legislation on marriage equality and abortion reform if the Northern Ireland assembly and Executive are not returned before 21 October. Labour has long called on the government to take action on these issues and will work with the government to see it implemented. The size of the majority pays tribute to the campaigning of many in Northern Ireland and the determination of Labour MP\u2019s Conor McGinn, Diana Johnson and Stella Creasy amongst others. This is from Sky News. And here is the full list of 332 MPs who voted for the Stella Creasy amendment on liberalising the abortion law in Northern Ireland. And here is the full list of the 99 MPs who voted against - 84 Tories, eight DUP, five Labour, two SNP and one independent. The other two DUP MPs were tellers. Back in the Commons Dominic Grieve, the Conservative pro-European, is now speaking about his various amendments intended to stop the next prime minster proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit in the autumn. Steve Brine, a fellow Tory, asks if the amendments would prevent prorogation without new clause 14 being passed. NC14 is the one that is not being put to a vote. (See 2.07pm and 2.46pm.) Grieve says with NC14 his amendments would definitely stop prorogation in the autumn. But even without it, the others are worth having, he says. Sir Oliver Letwin, a fellow Conservative, asks Grieve if he agrees that the other amendments (saying MPs would have to make fortnightly reports to parliament and allow those reports to be debated - see 2.46pm) would allow someone to take a case to the supreme court if the PM did try to prorogue parliament. Grieve does accept that. He also said that, if peers decide to include a version of NC14 when the bill is in the Lords, then MPs will get the chance to debate it when the bill comes back to the Commons. Letwin intervenes again. He says the Speaker probably decided not to allow a vote on NC14 because he considered it outside the \u201cscope\u201d of the bill (a technical parliamentary term). But he says that in the Lords peers apply a wider definition of scope. Here is the full list of the 383 MPs who voted in favour of Conor McGinn\u2019s same-sex marriage amendment. And here is the full list of the 73 MPs who voted against \u2013 65 Tories and eight from the DUP. The other two DUP were acting as tellers. Today\u2019s majority of 310 in favour of same-sex marriage compares with the 225 majority in favour six years ago when MPs voted in favour of same-sex marriage for England and Wales. The Scottish parliament voted for same-sex marriage in 2014. MPs have passed the Creasy amendment to liberalise the abortion law in Northern Irelnd (see 5.30pm) by 332 votes to 99 \u2013 a majority of 233. Back in the Commons MPs are now voting on Stella Creasy\u2019s new clause 10 (NC10) on abortion. It says: Clause 1, page 1, line 3, at end insert\u2014 \u201c(2) This section comes into force on the day after the secretary of state has laid before both Houses of Parliament regulations to enable the effective application in Northern Ireland of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in order to guarantee the rights of all women in Northern Ireland.\u201d And here is Creasy\u2019s explanatory statement. The report of the inquiry concerning the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland under article 8 of the optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women called on the UK government to take all measures necessary to ensure the effective application of the convention to guarantee the rights of all women in Northern Ireland, in the absence of a functioning government in Northern Ireland since January 2017. Jeremy Hunt, the underdog in the Tory leadership contest, has told President Trump on Twitter his comments about Theresa May \u201cdisrespectful and wrong\u201d. Hunt says he would keep Sir Kim Darroch as UK ambassador to the US, despite President Trump saying he won\u2019t deal with him. Hunt\u2019s comments contrast with the approach taken by Boris Johnson, the clear favourite in the leadership contest, who did not criticise President Trump when asked about this earlier and instead boasted about his \u201cgood relationship\u201d with Trump\u2019s White House. (See 3pm.) MPs have voted to introduce same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, unless the power-sharing executive is revived by 21 October, by 383 votes to 73 - a majority of 310. From my colleague Peter Walker Here is John Simpson, the BBC\u2019s former world affairs editor, on President Trump\u2019s outburst and the UK\u2019s response. Here are some quotes from the debate. From Labour\u2019s Conor McGinn At the minute the executive and the assembly exists in the ether or as a concept, not a reality. So if they can\u2019t make this [same-sex marriage] law, we will make it here because - as I have said often - rights delayed are rights denied. We will make the law here and then when the Assembly is back up and running the power remains for them to change it. From Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy I am a passionate defender of women\u2019s rights, I believe powerfully that if women are not able to have equal control over their bodies as men are then we will never have true freedom. If we say to women we will force you to continue an unwanted pregnancy, they will always be second class citizens to male counterparts ... I ask the House, how much longer are the women of Northern Ireland expected to wait? How much more are they expected to suffer until we speak up for the best of what this place does as human rights defenders, not human rights deniers? From Karin Smyth, the shadow Northern Ireland minister We heard [on the day of Lyra McKee\u2019s funeral] was that Lyra was making arrangements for her own marriage to her partner. It really struck me sitting in the cathedral of the huge sadness, the huge irony, when we rightly praised this remarkable young woman for being a child of the peace process, for being so openly happy with her own sexuality, with having touched every part of Northern Ireland society with her optimism. That she was making those plans for her own marriage to the woman that she loved but what her own society was saying to her was essentially \u2018away you go to Donegal, you can\u2019t do that here\u2019. What a great testament it would be to her memory and the thousands of people across Northern Ireland who simply want to express their love that we would make progress on this issue. From the DUP\u2019s Ian Paisley There is no right under the international treaties to terminate an unborn life, that is the fact of the matter, and we have got to make sure that that right, the right to life, is upheld. And this is what McGinn\u2019s NC1 actually says. Marriage of same-sex couples in Northern Ireland (1) The secretary of state must make regulations to change the law relating to marriage in Northern Ireland to provide that marriage between same-sex couples is lawful. (2) Regulations under this section must be in force no later than 21 October 2019, subject to subsections (3) and (4). (3) A statutory instrument containing regulations under subsection (1) \u2014 (a) must be laid before both Houses of Parliament; (b) is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament. (4) If a Northern Ireland executive is formed before the regulations under this section come into force, any regulations made under this section and any extant obligations arising under subsection (1) shall cease to have effect. And here is the McGinn\u2019s explanatory statement saying that this actually means in practice. This new clause would require UK secondary legislation to extend same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland unless a Northern Ireland executive is formed by 21 October 2019. In the Commons MPs are now voting on Conor McGinn\u2019s new clause 1 (NC1) amendment on same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. The Labour party has issued this response to the claims about the party being antisemitic made by Lord Triesman in his letter resigning the party whip in the Lords. (See 3.18pm.) A party spokesperson said: We completely reject these false and offensive claims. The Labour party at all levels is implacably opposed to antisemitism and is determined to root out this social cancer from our movement and society. Labour is taking decisive action against antisemitism, doubling the number of staff dedicated to dealing with complaints and cases. And since Jennie Formby became general secretary, the rate at which antisemitism cases have been dealt with has increased four-fold. Our records show that antisemitism cases that have gone through the stages of our disciplinary procedures since September 2015 account for about 0.06% of the party\u2019s membership. This represents a tiny minority, but one antisemite is one too many, and we will continue to act against this repugnant form of racism. These are from Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, explaining why SNPs MPs will be voting on the amendments to allow same-sex marriage and abortion in Northern Ireland even though the party normally abstains on devolved matters. Labour is now committed to campaigning for remain in any referendum on a Tory Brexit deal, or on a no-deal Brexit. But what remains unresolved is what Labour would propose if there were a general election before Brexit took place. In an interview with the BBC, when asked what Labour\u2019s position would be in an election if the UK were still in the EU, Jeremy Corbyn replied: Well the next election will come when it comes, it could be this October, it could be next year, if could be in 2022. I don\u2019t know anymore than you do. What you\u2019ve probably gathered from this discussion is that we have a very large party, a very large membership and many parts to our party and our movement. We have a democratic process, we will decide very quickly at the start of that campaign exactly what our position will be. But Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, told the World at One that he did not think Labour could win an election unless it was opposed to Brexit. He said: As I understand it no decision has been taken yet on [Labour\u2019s election position on Brexit]. But, look, if we do end up at an election we are going to have to be absolutely clear. And my position is this: If Labour goes into that election saying we\u2019re going to try and deliver Brexit then I think we\u2019d find it very, very hard indeed to win that general election. Here is Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, on President Trump\u2019s latest outburst. Sky\u2019s Deborah Haynes has found an entrepreneur (not Jeremy Hunt). Sir Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to the US who has now been declared persona non grata by President Trump, will not be accompanying Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, to the White House for a meeting with Ivanka Trump, journalists were told at the Downing Street afternoon lobby briefing. And here is some comment from Jon Sopel, the BBC\u2019s North America editor. The Irish government has said it has \u201cno easy answers\u201d to avoid checks on the Irish border in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU with no deal. After a special cabinet meeting heard of the \u201cdire\u201d consequences, it released a 117-page report (pdf) outlining the country\u2019s contingency plans for no deal warning of \u201cprofound\u201d effects for Northern Ireland and Ireland. It warns the \u201cconsequences of a no-deal Brexit for the political process in Northern Ireland could be very damaging\u201d and that a \u201cno-deal Brexit risks significantly undermining wider community relations and political stability in Northern Ireland with potential related security concerns.\u201d The report said the government\u2019s assessment was that there was now \u201ca significant risk of a no deal Brexit on 31 October\u201d and preparation for such an event was now a priority. No deal would be \u201chighly disruptive and will have profound political, economic and legal implications, first and foremost for the UK, including most significantly Northern Ireland, as well as having significant impacts on Ireland and the rest of the EU\u201d It warned of a potential \u00a36bn cost to the Irish economy and \u201csignificant short term risks\u201d with an estimated increase in unemployment of 50-55,000 \u201cafter the UK leaves the EU\u201d. A third peer, Lord Turnberg, is resigning the Labour whip, according to the BBC\u2019s Mathew Harris. Turnberg is another eminent doctor. He was made a Labour peer in the 1990s. According to BBC Newsnight, Ara Darzi, a surgeon who was made a peer and a health minister by Gordon Brown, is also resigning the Labour whip. Lord Triesman, who was Labour\u2019s general secretary under Tony Blair and who subsequently served as a minister under Blair and Gordon Brown, has announced today that he is resigning the Labour whip. In a letter to Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, he says some of the party\u2019s policy positions (primarily on Brexit, Russia and defence) are \u201cimpossible to take seriously\u201d, but mostly he focuses on antisemitism, saying Labour is no longer a safe political environment for Jewish people. He says: My sad conclusion is that the Labour party is very plainly institutionally antisemitic, and its leader and his circle are antisemitic, having never once made the right judgment call about an issue reflecting deep prejudice. The number of examples is shocking. It is no longer a safe political environment for Jewish people or other opponents of antisemitism. It it time to recognise the reality. I always said it was worth hanging on to fight so long as there was a prospect of winning. I now don\u2019t believe with this leadership there is. During a visit to Manchester airport, Boris Johnson, the favourite in the Tory leadership contest, said he was not embarrassed to say he had good relations with the Trump White House. He said: I have got a good relationship with the White House and I have no embarrassment in saying that. I think it\u2019s very important that we have a strong relationship with our most important ally. The United States is, has been, will be and for the foreseeable future our number one political military friend. Asked whether the president was right to criticise Theresa May and the way Brexit talks have been handled, Johnson replied: Myself, I have said some pretty critical things about the Brexit negotiations so far and that\u2019s one of the reasons I am standing tonight and one of the reasons I am putting myself forward. I think there is a chance to do things differently, a chance to break away from the failed old can-kicking approaching. Now is the time to really get a grip on this. Stop being so defeatist in our approach to the EU negotiations and maybe be a lot more positive about our country and what it can do. From the Press Association report, it is not clear whether Johnson was aware of President Trump\u2019s latest criticism of May (she was \u201cfoolish\u201d and her policy a \u201cdisaster\u201d - see 1.47pm) when he was speaking, or whether Johnson was just commenting in relation to what Trump said about May yesterday (she made a \u201cmess\u201d of it). According to Bloomberg\u2019s Robert Hutton, the Tory MP Dominic Grieve is relaxed about his main amendment not being called (see 2.07pm) because he thinks his other amendments which are due to be put to a vote would stop a new PM proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. The other Grieve amendments (14, 15 and 17) would require ministers to make fortnightly reports to parliament about progress towards restoring the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland (and subject of the bill) and for those reports to be debated. It is questionable whether these amendments would stop a new PM proroguing parliament in the autumn. But Bloomberg argue that they could provide legal grounds for someone to challenge a decision to prorogue parliament in court. The first set of votes this afternoon, including on the amendments on same-sex marriage and abortion, will take place at around 5pm. Nick Boles, the former Tory who now sits as an independent, says that when the second stage of the debate starts after those votes, he intends to raise President Trump\u2019s latest comments (see 1.47pm) on a point of order. In the Northern Ireland debate the Labour MP Stella Creasy is speaking now about her amendment, which would extend the right to abortion in Northern Ireland by saying the government would have to comply with the UN convention for the elimination of discrimination against women. She says women in Northern Ireland risk prison for procuring abortion pills. She says the UK cannot tell other countries to enforce human rights standards when it is denying basic rights to women in Northern Ireland. More on the Dominic Grieve amendments. (See 12.37pm.) Although new clause 14 (NC14), the central Grieve amendment intended to stop a new prime minister proroguing parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit, has not been called, other Grieve amendments have been called. But, as Nikki da Costa, a former director of legislative affairs in Downing Street explains, the other Grieve amendments would not necessarily stop a new PM proroguing parliament. She explains why in these tweets. You can read the text of all the amendments to the bill here (pdf). Theresa May faces a full-blown diplomatic standoff with the US after Donald Trump condemned Britain\u2019s \u201cstupid\u201d ambassador to Washington over leaked memos critical of the White House, as Downing Street insisted Sir Kim Darroch had its full support, my colleague Peter Walker reports. The escalating crisis began after a Sunday newspaper printed extracts of confidential memos in which Darroch labelled Trump\u2019s administration \u201cinept\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional\u201d. The US president announced on Monday that he would no longer deal with the ambassador. In a fresh volley of tweets on Tuesday morning, Trump again condemned Darroch, and renewed his criticism of the prime minister over her Brexit negotiations, which he had praised on his state visit to the UK just over a month ago. Here is Peter\u2019s story. And here are the Trump tweets. Ireland will not be providing options for dealing with animals and agrifood as they cross the Irish border in its no-deal contingency plans to be published later today. It will say, instead, that more talks are needed on the issue with the European Commission. The last time the UK was on the precipice of a no-deal Brexit, sources told the Guardian that checks on animals and agrifood would be mandatory from day one, meaning overnight disruption for trade of milk and lamb from Northern Ireland into the republic. At a special cabinet meeting this morning, Irish ministers were briefed by the deputy prime minister Simon Coveney on the \u201cdire consequences\u201d of no-deal for Ireland the all-island economy. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, is expected to be questioned by opposition MPs in the Dail at 2pm, with Coveney giving a briefing to the media at 4pm on the updated no deal plans. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, is speaking in the debate now. He says it is wrong that this bill, which is about allowing the suspension of the Northern Ireland assembly to continue, has been hijacked for other purposes. He says, under the McGinn amendment, if it is passed, there would be no further vote in the Commons before the law was changed to allow same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland (assuming the powers-sharing executive is not restored by 21 October). The DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson says MPs have repeatedly complained about the use of Henry VIII powers. But he says the amendment would allow a Henry VIII power to be used to impose same-sex marriage on Northern Ireland. Dodds agrees that this is not an appropriate way to decide this matter for Northern Ireland. Maria Miller, the Conservative chair of the women and equalities committee, is speaking in the debate now. She says she was equalities minister when same-sex marriage was introduced. She says the law was not extended to Northern Ireland because the government wanted to respect the devolution settlement. She says she will not decide how she is going to vote tonight until she has heard the government make its case. She says her heart is telling her to vote for the McGinn amendment. But her head needs to be convinced, because of the concerns about the need to respect the principle of devolution. In the Commons Conor McGinn says the House of Commons failed people in Northern Ireland by not decriminalising homosexuality in Northern Ireland when it was decriminalised in England. And he says it has failed them by not extending same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland. He ends his speech by saying tonight MPs must no longer let it down. We have already posted reaction to today\u2019s announcement from Jeremy Corbyn about Labour\u2019s latest shift on Brexit from the Liberal Democrats (see 12.03pm). Here is some more reaction. From Labour MP Phil Wilson, in a statement released by the People\u2019s Vote campaign, which is campaigning for a second referendum Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s public insistence that the next Conservative prime minister put any Brexit proposal to a final say referendum, where we will all have the chance to stay in the EU, is a positive step forward for Labour. It is an outrage that Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt believe this decision can be confined to the 0.25% of the population who are Conservative members. It must be for the people to decide our future and give their explicit consent for a specific form of Brexit in a people\u2019s vote. But one email to Labour members and a press release do not make a campaign. Labour has the chance to speak up for its values and to channel the growing anger in the country about the negation of democracy that is being imposed on us all. Our voters and our members will not tolerate further confusion or foot-dragging. Instead, we now need to join together with all those from across the political spectrum who have long since been demanding that the people get the final say on Brexit. From Chris Leslie, the former Labour MP who now represents the Independent Group for Change Corbyn has confirmed that if you vote Labour, you\u2019ll get Brexit. His commitment to campaign against Brexit only if the Conservatives are in government simply isn\u2019t good enough. Brexit - whether a Labour Brexit or a Conservative Brexit - will cost people\u2019s jobs, put businesses in jeopardy, and diminish Britain in the eyes of our neighbours. Corbyn\u2019s refusal to be honest about that fact is a deep betrayal of the people Labour used to represent. From Naomi Smith, CEO of the the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain This is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, but Labour can\u2019t believe that both their own deal and remaining are best for Britain. It\u2019s decision time for the Labour leadership. If they don\u2019t settle on campaigning to stop Brexit then they will be letting down the vast majority of their membership, voters and the country. From Michael Chessum from Another Europe is Possible, a leftwing group campaigning for remain Today\u2019s move is significant and a big victory for the grassroots of the Labour party. We now need Labour to throw its huge weight behind the campaign to stop Brexit. Only a radical politics which promises fundamental change, more equality and public investment can beat Brexit - not status quo centrism. Good though today\u2019s news is, Labour still needs to clearly commit to opposing Brexit, and to unequivocally defending free movement and transforming Europe. Ultimately, policy must be made by members, not in backrooms. We will continue to campaign from the grassroots up, and we are mobilising another huge wave of motions for conference in September. MPs are now starting their debate on the Northern Ireland bill. The Labour MP Conor McGinn starts. His amendment, new clause 1 (NC1), says, if the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland is not restored by 21 October, the UK parliament should legislate to allow same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. If the power-sharing executive is restored before that, it would be up to them, he says. And if the executive is revived after Westminster has changed the law, it will have the power to change the law back, he suggests. The DUP MP Ian Paisley says, if this amendment passes, it could give one party in Northern Ireland an incentive not to revive the executive. McGinn says Paisley is referring to Sinn Fein. He says he has spoken to Sinn Fein, and he knows Sinn Fein wants the devolved assembly to make this decision. John Bercow, the Speaker, is now making a statement about the Northern Ireland bill. He says last night his office received a call from a \u201ctabloid scribbler\u201d who had heard the Speaker would not be chairing the proceedings this afternoon. He says kindness and generosity of spirit prevent him from naming the individual. But he says it is a long-established convention that the Speaker does not chair proceedings for a committee of the whole house (ie, when the committee stage of a bill is being considered by all MPs, not just a committee of about 20 of them - as is happening this afternoon.). He says this is a rule going back to the 17th century. He says he hopes the \u201cchappie has now got the point\u201d. Good Afternoon. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Sarah Marsh, who has been writing the blog this morning. Quite soon MPs will start the second and final day\u2019s debate on the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill. As Seth Jacobson reports, the Tory pro-European Dominic Grieve tabled an amendment intended to ensure that the next prime minister could not prorogue parliament in September and October to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. But it has just emerged that John Bercow, the Speaker, is not calling the amendment, which means it will not be put to a vote. Bercow blocks vote on amendment intended to stop next PM proroguing parliament for no-deal. The Guardian\u2019s Gaby Hinsliff has written about Corbyn\u2019s backing of a second referendum. She writes: Is Labour really the party of remain, or leave? The official answer for a good three years has been both, which increasingly means in the eyes of many voters it is neither convincingly. The paradox of this week\u2019s otherwise seismic shift in Labour Brexit positioning is that once the dust settles, essentially that\u2019s still true. Jeremy Corbyn does seem finally to have been cornered into a second referendum on Brexit, with trade union leaders unanimously agreeing this week that if a Conservative government brings any sort of deal (or a firm date for leaving with no deal) before parliament, Labour should demand a referendum on it and campaign to remain. Here is Gaby\u2019s article in full. The Liberal Democrats who, to Labour\u2019s cost, made so many gains in the European elections in May, say Labour\u2019s new position on a second referendum does not make it a remain party. The Lib Dem Brexit spokesperson Tom Brake said: Labour are still a party of Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn can pretend all he likes that the Labour party are finally moving towards backing the Liberal Democrat policy of a People\u2019s Vote, but it is clear it is still his intention to negotiate a damaging Brexit deal if he gets the keys to number ten. Labour must start being transparent with the British people. Any Brexit deal, whoever it is negotiated by, will damage our country. It will mean job losses, problems for our NHS, and more time wasted on not tackling the biggest issues facing the UK. The Liberal Democrats have been unequivocal in our fight to stop Brexit and Corbyn should join us. The only real route out of this mess is a People\u2019s Vote, with the option to stay in the EU. Protests have taken place outside Labour headquarters as a disputes panel of the party\u2019s national executive meets on Tuesday to discuss whether to reinstate Chris Williamson. Williamson, the MP for Derby North, had been suspended for suggesting the party was \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about antisemitism complaints. But he was last week let back into the party with a reprimand by a three-person disciplinary panel, prompting a fierce reaction. Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson joined MPs and peers to demand he lose the whip, while nearly 70 Labour staff members wrote to express their outrage. He was put back under suspension after Keith Vaz, one of the members of the disputes panel who had argued for him to be readmitted, said the decision should be reviewed. The disputes panel will meet this morning to discuss whether to refer him up to a further disciplinary sub-committee of the National Executive Committee, which may decide to send the case for further investigation or allow him to be readmitted. If he is let back in, Williamson is likely to face a selection battle in his own constituency after a bitter row with the trade union Unite. The Guardian\u2019s political editor Heather Stewart reports on party\u2019s decision to campaign to stay in EU rather than back no deal or Tory deal in people\u2019s vote. Labour have announced their Brexit position in a letter from Jeremy Corbyn to party members. He says: Dear member, I am proud to lead the Labour Party \u2013 the greatest political party and social movement in this country. We all recognise that the issue of Brexit has been divisive in our communities and sometimes in our party too. As democrats, Labour accepted the result of the 2016 referendum. In our 2017 manifesto, Labour also committed to oppose a No Deal Brexit and the Tories\u2019 Brexit plans \u2013 which threatened jobs, living standards, and the open multicultural society that we as internationalists value so much. I want to pay tribute to Keir Starmer and the shadow Brexit team for holding the Government to account during this process. That helped secure a meaningful vote on their deal \u2013 which we then defeated three times \u2013 including inflicting the largest ever defeat on any Government. And following their refusal to publish their legal advice, this Government became the first to be held in contempt of Parliament. Labour set out a compromise plan to try to bring the country together based around a customs union, a strong single market relationship and protection of environmental regulations and rights at work. We continue to believe this is a sensible alternative that could bring the country together. But the Prime Minister refused to compromise and was unable to deliver, so we ended cross-party talks. Now both Tory leadership candidates are threatening a No Deal Brexit - or at best a race to the bottom and a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump: that runs down industry, opens up our NHS and other public services to yet more privatisation, and shreds environmental protections, rights at work and consumer standards. I have spent the past few weeks consulting with the shadow cabinet, MPs, affiliated unions and the NEC. I have also had feedback from members via the National Policy Forum consultation on Brexit. Whoever becomes the new Prime Minister should have the confidence to put their deal, or No Deal, back to the people in a public vote. In those circumstances, I want to make it clear that Labour would campaign for Remain against either No Deal or a Tory deal that does not protect the economy and jobs. Labour has a crucial, historic duty to safeguard jobs, rights and living standards. But no Brexit outcome alone can do that. We need a general election. After nine years of austerity, too many people in this country cannot find decent secure well-paid work, and have to rely on public services that have been severely cut back. Our country is ravaged by inequality and rising poverty, huge regional imbalances of investment, and the government is failing to tackle the climate emergency facing us all. That is why we need a Labour government to end austerity and rebuild our country for the many not the few. Yours, Jeremy Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn has said that the next prime minister should put their Brexit deal to a vote, and if that happened the Labour party would campaign for remain. The news has been met with a strong response on social media. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg said: It\u2019s progress of a sort as Corbyn explicit that he\u2019d support staying in the EU in that hypothetical scenario, but he doesn\u2019t sign up to the manifesto demand which would have gone further. Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that the Labour party will campaign for remain in a referendum \u201cagainst no deal or a Tory deal\u201d. On Tuesday morning, the leader of the Labour party, convened a meeting of the party\u2019s shadow cabinet to agree a settled Brexit position. But Heather also notes that the announcement, in a long email to members, does not include anything explaining what Labour\u2019s position would be after a general election. Sir David warned: The problem you\u2019re opening now is a very serious one, if the world climate change goes on it is going to be facing huge problems with immigration. Large parts of Africa are going to be even less inhabitable than they are now, and there will be major upsets in the balance between our national boundaries. These kind of problems are going to grow inexorably and we are going to have to decide what we do about it, that\u2019s going to happen. He said industry should be encouraged to invest in new technologies for generating, storing and transporting energy, such as batteries, and that he thought progress was being made. Channel 4\u2019s chief executive Alex Mahon has said that the broadcaster does not make reality TV or observational programmes merely because they are cheap and \u201cfill schedules\u201d. Speaking before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee inquiry into reality TV, Mahon said there is a \u201chuge public appetite\u201d for programmes that show \u201cdifferent groups of people doing things in society\u201d. Damian Collins, chairman of the DCMS, suggested that such programmes involving members of the public are \u201cquite cheap to make\u201d and that they take up more space in the TV schedule than they did 20 years ago. Mahon said: \u201cIt is important that as public service broadcasters we tell challenging stories about life in Britain today and give insight into that, yes, it\u2019s not necessarily cheaper to do than doing other things. \u201cThere are some genres of non-scripted programming that are cheap, sometimes quizzes if you make them in bulk, and there are some genres that are very expensive, which are in the multiple hundreds of thousands of pounds per episode to make because they are very complex to construct. \u201cIf you take a programme like One Born Every Minute... a life-affirming show and incredibly entertaining for audiences. It\u2019s certainly not cheap to make because of the way we make it, construct it, the way we film it and work with contributors on it. \u201cSo I would refute the suggestion that we are doing that to fill schedules with \u2018cheap things\u2019; we are doing those programmes often to create insight into society.\u201d Sir David Attenborough said the UK\u2019s record on tackling climate change \u201cis pretty good\u201d. But he added: \u201cWho started the problem? This country. It was the industrial revolution which started here, and what was the industrial revolution, it was based on burning coal. As it was us who started the problems, and if we are now taking a lead in solving the problem that only the right and responsible thing to do.\u201d On the 2050 target he said: \u201cMy only hope is we don\u2019t backslide. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough target. It\u2019s not an easy statement to have made, it\u2019s going to cost money. \u201cIt\u2019s not just piety, anybody can express pious views, its a practical commitment, and I hope to goodness we can achieve that.\u201d The broadcaster also said that the cost of air travel would have to increase to reduce emissions. \u201cI certainly worry that the job I do involves me travelling, I have travelled by air only too frequently in the last few months to make programmes, some of them about this very subject we are talking about,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThe long-term solution is we work out a way of powering aeroplanes electrically.\u201d Sir David said the voices of \u201cdisbelief\u201d on climate change should not be stamped out and it was important that they should be heard in public. But he said: I\u2019m sorry there are people who are in power internationally, notably of course the US, but also Australia, which is extraordinary because Australia is having to deal with some of the most extreme manifestations of climate change, and these voices are already heard ... One hopes the electorate will respond to that. And he said public attitudes towards the environment had been \u201ctransformed\u201d \u2013 drawing a parallel to changing attitudes to slavery in the 19th century. Jeremy Hunt\u2019s campaign says it can \u201crun up a big win\u201d in Scotland after the foreign secretary\u2019s strong performance at last Friday\u2019s hustings in Perth and a snap poll of Scottish councillors suggesting that two-thirds were backing him against Boris Johnson. The Guardian has reported previously on fears amongst Scottish Conservatives that a Johnson premiership could boost support for independence: now Hunt\u2019s campaign has released snapshot figures showing that, out of a survey of more than 100 Tory councillors, 60 were backing Hunt as opposed to 36 supporting Johnson. A campaign source said: \u201cThe vast majority of Scottish Conservative MSPs are backing Jeremy and it looks like the same picture across the wider party. We are hopeful of running up a big win for Jeremy north of the border.\u201d Hunt certainly came across as more definitive on the union at Friday\u2019s event. He said he would not give Holyrood permission to hold a second independence referendum, but warned that the party must \u201cprepare\u201d for another poll given the possibility of a Corbyn government allowing one in exchange for SNP support at Westminster. Johnson underlined his passion for the union but refused to answer definitely on the question of a s30 order. But it\u2019s worth remembering that the Scottish government has made ample capital out of the fact that Scotland voted one way on the EU referendum while the rest of the Britain voted another. If Hunt does benefit from a Scottish surge, and wins in Scotland whilst Johnson triumphs in England, one can only wonder how that may be similarly weaponised in months to come. Quizzed on whether the UK\u2019s new legal \u201cnet zero\u201d target for 2050 was sufficient or whether calls from campaigners for a 2025 goal was realistic, Sir David said: \u201cyou can\u2019t be radical enough in deal with issues at the moment.\u201d \u201cThe question is what is practically possible, and how can we take the electorate with us in dealing with these problems. \u201cDealing with problems means we\u2019ve got to change our lifestyle.\u201d \u201cThe electorate of tomorrow are already making their voices very clear, that\u2019s a source of great comfort.\u201d And he said: \u201cI\u2019m OK for the next decade, all of us are OK, we won\u2019t face the problems that are coming. \u201cThe problems of the next 20 to 30 years are great problems that are going to cause great social unrest and cause great changes in what we eat and how we live.\u201d On the issue of plastic, Sir David said: \u201cI\u2019ve been going on about plastics for 20 years. Anybody who swims know that, or anyone who travels can see, the horrors of what plastic pollution can do. \u201cI\u2019ve been putting it in programmes for years, and nobody took any notice\u201d. Then a two-minute clip in his programme Blue Planet II \u201crang a bell with people\u201d, he added. Sir David Attenborough is in parliament talking about climate change. He said the most vivid example he has seen of the changing climate was revisiting the Great Barrier Reef and seeing how it had bleached because of rising temperatures. He told Parliament\u2019s Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee that when visiting the Australian landmark in the 1950s he had \u201cthe extraordinary experience of diving on the reef and suddenly seeing this multitude of fantastic beautiful forms of life.\u201d But of returning 10 years ago, he said: \u201cInstead of multitudes of wonderful forms of life I was struck by how it was bleached white because of the rising temperatures and increasing acidity of the seas\u201d. When he started out in natural history, Sir David did not talk about climate change, because \u201cwe didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t believe we could change the climate, or worse the changes we were going to inflict were irreversible, which they are if we go on as we are.\u201d And he said: \u201cI\u2019m not by nature a propagandist\u201d, but added \u201cif you become aware of what is happening you don\u2019t have any alternative\u201d. Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney is to warn the Irish cabinet this morning over the \u201cdire\u201d consequences of no deal in Ireland and for the all-Ireland economy. On Tuesday, he will deliver three reports to a special cabinet meeting with the principle paper running to more than 100 pages. It is understood that checks on goods crossing the border from Northern Ireland could be conducted elsewhere in relation to customs and VAT but the unsolved challenge is mandatory checks on animals and agrifood including the one third of Northern Ireland milk that goes south for cheese, butter and dried milk products for exported infant formula and confectionary. One option being considered by the EU agriculture department is to disrupt the all-Ireland economy. At present, this involves one third of milk from Northern Ireland being processed south of the border and more than 400,000 sheep being slaughtered annually in abattoirs hundreds of miles away in the republic. Environment secretary Michael Gove has said that Britain cannot \u201coffshore\u201d responsibilities for food standards in any future trade deals including agreement with the US which chlorinates its chicken before sale. He said animal welfare standards of British farming had to be \u201cprotected\u201d to guarantee consumer trust in what they eat. \u201cWhat we cannot have is an approach towards trade that tries to offshore our responsibilities and undermine high standards that British farmers produce,\u201d he told the National Farmers\u2019 Union summer party in Westminster on Monday evening. His front bench future is in the balance and his consistent advocacy for continuing animal welfare standards has not been shared by everyone around the cabinet table. Gove said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that the problems that exist with chlorinated chicken are a direct result of lower animal welfare standards in some parts of the United States than here and we have to maintain and protect the high animal welfare standards that are number one in British agriculture.\u201d He added: \u201cOne of the things that underpins agriculture is high agriculture standards and the provenance of that which we sell. That needs to be protected ... Protection is not a dirty word when it comes to ensure that we have standards in which consumers can trust. \u201c NFU president Minette Batters said she was \u201cmassively concerned\u201d that Gove\u2019s pledges would be reneged on in a future cabinet. \u201cIt\u2019s not opposition to leaving, it\u2019s about a managed deal that can enshrine our values\u201d William Hague has urged Boris Johnson to rule out suspending parliament in a no-deal Brexit scenario. The former Conservative party leader said Johnson must avoid suspending Parliament in order to try to get a no-deal Brexit through if he becomes prime minister. Lord Hague said the frontrunner in the battle for Downing Street should use a head-to-head TV debate with rival Jeremy Hunt on Tuesday to make clear he would not use a parliamentary \u201cmanoeuvre\u201d in this way. The call came as former attorney general Dominic Grieve has tabled an amendment to the Northern Ireland Bill - intended to keep government in the province running in the absence of the devolved institutions - requiring Parliament to come back to the issue in October. The move is designed to try to ensure the next prime minister cannot push through a no deal on October 31, the current EU deadline for agreeing on a deal, simply by suspending - or \u201cproroguing\u201d - Parliament. Commons Speaker John Bercow is expected to announce on Tuesday whether he has selected the amendment for debate, giving MPs the chance to vote on it. Johnson, who has said he will take Britain out of the EU by the end of October \u201cdo or die\u201d, warned such tactics risked playing into the hands of Jeremy Corbyn and Labour. Lord Hague, who backs Mr Hunt in the Tory leadership race, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt is very important that Parliament is able to give its opinion.\u201d Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson will appear on a live ITV debate at 8pm on Tuesday to battle to be the next Tory party leader. Johnson will hope to use the occasion to seal his position as the clear frontrunner, with polls giving him an overwhelming lead. Proroguing the House of Commons to achieve a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cthe end of parliamentary democracy\u201d in the UK, Dominic Grieve has said in defending his move to seek to remove the option. Grieve\u2019s amendment, which has cross-party support including from a handful of fellow Conservative MPs, is to the Northern Ireland bill going through the Commons, and would require fortnightly reports on that country\u2019s formation of an executive, which has been vacant since 2017. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Grieve said the amendment calls for \u201cregular motions before parliament in September and particularly October\u201d. If passed, it would prevent the parliamentary session being prorogued, or abruptly ended, in the lead-up to the 31 October departure date. Catch up on the latest Guardian political stories of the day: Whoever is behind the leak of sensitive diplomatic messages was intent on sabotaging the British ambassador to the US in order for them to be replaced by someone \u201cmore congenial\u201d, a person who formerly held the role has claimed. Sir Christopher Meyer said there was a \u201cpossible range of villains\u201d who could be responsible for the leaking of memos in which Sir Kim Darroch described the US administration under Donald Trump as \u201cinept\u201d. Sir Christopher told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cHere there is a possible range of villains who come into the frame. But it was clearly somebody who set out, deliberately, to sabotage Sir Kim\u2019s ambassadorship, to make his position untenable, and to have him replaced by somebody more congenial to the leaker.\u201d There has been fierce criticism of the mystery leaker from government ministers. The person or people behind it should \u201cregret the moment for the rest of their life\u201d, Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said, while defence minister Tobias Ellwood suggested the leaker put \u201cself-interest above country\u201d. A formal leak investigation has been launched by the Foreign Office, and in the Commons there were calls for a police investigation amid widespread anger at the diplomatic fall-out. Foreign Secretary and Conservative Party leadership contender Jeremy Hunt said \u201call avenues of inquiry\u201d would be explored to find out how it happened. Hunt told The Sun: \u201cOf course it would be massively concerning if it was the act of a foreign, hostile state. \u201cI\u2019ve seen no evidence that that\u2019s the case, but we\u2019ll look at the leak inquiry very carefully.\u201d William Hague, the former leader of the Conservative party, has said that leadership hopefuls Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson should rule out dissolving parliament to get through a no-deal Brexit. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Hague said: \u201cHe should rule it out. For a Conservative government to go ahead with a no-deal Brexit, in defiance of the pleas of business and farming organisations, and increasing the risks to the union of the United Kingdom, and defying any attempts to have a vote in Parliament, would be an extraordinary combination of things to do, so yes I do think Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt should rule that out.\u201d He supported former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, bringing the amendment against prorogation:\u201cI think it\u2019s very important that parliament is able to give its opinion. It ought to be unthinkable that we could leave the EU by a manoeuvre, by a procedural ruse of some kind.\u201d He added: \u201cWhile I don\u2019t agree with everything Dominic has said or tried to do, I sympathise with attempts to ensure that Parliament can have its say.\u201d Trump has criticised the UK ambassador, following a leak in which he described the US president as \u201cinept\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional\u201d. But this morning, people have come out in defence of Sir Kim Darroch, the UK\u2019s ambassador to Washington. Tory former foreign secretary Lord William Hague told the BBC: \u201cYou can\u2019t change an ambassador at the demand of a host country. \u201cIt is their job to give an honest assessment of what is happening in that country.\u201d A former British ambassador to the US , Sir Christopher Meyer, branded Trump \u201cinsecure\u201d. He said: \u201cIt just shows President Trump\u2019s sensitivity. The House of Commons sits from 11.30am with an hour of justice questions. It could be one of the last times the secretary of state for Justice, David Gauke, appears in this role, after the Tory MP said he will quit the cabinet if Johnson becomes prime minister. He made this announcement as he would want to fight a no-deal Brexit. If he was to leave by the end of the month it would mean that the government would need to appoint their seventh justice secretary in just seven years. Elsewhere, Parliament will host broadcasting legend David Attenborough today. He will be giving evidence on climate change to the Commons business committee at 10 am. On Tuesday, student climate network activists will also meet political leaders including Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable and SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford. From 10.30am, the department for culture, media and sport committee will question senior Channel 4 executives. The health secretary Matt Hancock is giving evidence to the Commons Health and Social Care Committee from 2.30pm. Outside of Westminster, in Brussels, the Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will meet Michel Barnier this afternoon. A Labour group is campaigning to abolish Eton, and other elite private schools in England. Activists are aiming to capitalise on Boris Johnson\u2019s likely election as Conservative leader and are circulating a motion for the party\u2019s conference in September that would commit a Labour government to stripping fee-paying schools of their privileges and integrating them into the state system. The group, Labour Against Private Schools, launched the campaign on Tuesday using the @AbolishEtonTwitter handle. It is backed by a number of Labour MPs including the former party leader Ed Miliband. MPs prepare to vote on the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Bill at 7pm this evening. Much attention is on the speaker John Bercow who will announce at mid-morning which amendments have been selected for votes, and there are three which could have a seismic impact. Labour MP Conor McGinn\u2019s \u201cnew clause 1\u201d, which would legalize gay marriage in Northern Ireland. Labour colleague Diana Johnson\u2019s \u201cnew clause 9\u201d which would force ministers to review abortion rights in the province. Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment to prevent the next prime minister from proroguing parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit. A former British ambassador to the US has branded president Donald Trump \u201cinsecure\u201d over the diplomatic war of words raging between London and Washington DC. Referring to Trump\u2019s declaration he would no longer deal with the UK\u2019s ambassador Sir Kim Darroch, previous occupant of the post Sir Christopher Meyer told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt just shows President Trump\u2019s sensitivity. \u201cHis insecurity, which Sir Kim himself bore witness to.\u201d Referring to whoever leaked diplomatic cables from Sir Kim, Sir Christopher said: \u201cHere there is a possible range of villains who come into the frame. \u201cBut, it was clearly somebody who set out, deliberately, to sabotage Sir Kim\u2019s ambassadorship, to make his position untenable, and to have him replaced by somebody more congenial to the leaker.\u201d Exactly a year ago today Boris Johnson quit as foreign secretary in protest at Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan. One year on, and the former mayor is making a play to be prime minister. The final two Tory leadership hopefuls \u2013 Jeremy Hunt and Johnson \u2013 will go head to head on a live TV debate this evening. Millions of viewers will tune in to ITV1 at 8 pm as they battle it out before a live audience in Salford, Greater Manchester. The discussion will be hosted by TV newsreader and journalist ,Julie Etchingham, who will moderate the hour-long debate, with audience members asking questions pre-vetted by ITV. Welcome to the live blog, where we will be running through the political news of the day. On Tuesday, the main story is US president Donald Trump\u2019s scathing attack on Theresa May and the British ambassador to Washington, Kim Darroch. The diplomat\u2019s frank assessments of Trump as \u201cinept\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional\u201d were leaked to the Mail on Sunday, prompting the president to launch a tirade against Darroch. He said: \u201cI do not know the ambassador, but he is not liked or well thought of within the US. We will no longer deal with him. The good news for the wonderful United Kingdom is that they will soon have a new prime minister. While I thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent state visit last month, it was the Queen who I was most impressed with!\u201d May last night vowed to stand by Darroch. In a statement issued at 10.19 p.m, a UK government spokesman said Darroch maintains the prime minister\u2019s \u201cfull support\u201d. The US president also took aim against May and her representatives, saying they had made a \u201cmess\u201d over Brexit, contrary to his advice. Just weeks ago, he praised the prime minister in person on his state visit to the UK, saying she had done a \u201cvery good job\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>There was a brief frisson of excitement when someone said that Jason McCartney was in the spin room for the ITV leadership debate in Manchester. No one knew the former North Melbourne Aussie rules footballer and current list manager at the Greater Western Sydney Giants was in town. Then the excitement died a little. It was a different Jason McCartney. Jason McCartney, the former Tory MP who lost his seat at the 2017 general election and was now delegated to be cheerleader in chief for Team Boris. Point man to explain to a room full of hacks why his man had won the debate. Even if he hadn\u2019t. Understandably McCartney looked slightly overawed by the responsibility.</p> <p>Over on the other side of the room rooting for Team Hunt was another former MP, Rob Wilson. Him and me neither. It hadn\u2019t been meant to be like this. The spin room had been billed to be full of ambitious Tory MPs, slavering for top jobs when their man became prime minister. Except it turned out that the Conservative whips hadn\u2019t quite trusted their Labour counterparts to pair their absentee MPs and had ordered them all back to Westminster for the crucial vote on the Dominic Grieve amendment to force parliament to report fortnightly throughout October. Even then it hadn\u2019t been enough as the government was defeated by a single vote. A sign of things to come.</p> <p>The debate proper began with both men appearing on stage like two contestants in a dodgy 1980s game show. Boris Johnson stared at the floor. A man-boy dressed in an ill-fitting suit. Don\u2019t mess this up, he told himself. All he needed to do was get through the next hour and he would end up as prime minister. \u201cPifflepafflewifflewaffle,\u201d he babbled.

      "bodyText": "There was a brief frisson of excitement when someone said that Jason McCartney was in the spin room for the ITV leadership debate in Manchester. No one knew the former North Melbourne Aussie rules footballer and current list manager at the Greater Western Sydney Giants was in town. Then the excitement died a little. It was a different Jason McCartney. Jason McCartney, the former Tory MP who lost his seat at the 2017 general election and was now delegated to be cheerleader in chief for Team Boris. Point man to explain to a room full of hacks why his man had won the debate. Even if he hadn\u2019t. Understandably McCartney looked slightly overawed by the responsibility. Over on the other side of the room rooting for Team Hunt was another former MP, Rob Wilson. Him and me neither. It hadn\u2019t been meant to be like this. The spin room had been billed to be full of ambitious Tory MPs, slavering for top jobs when their man became prime minister. Except it turned out that the Conservative whips hadn\u2019t quite trusted their Labour counterparts to pair their absentee MPs and had ordered them all back to Westminster for the crucial vote on the Dominic Grieve amendment to force parliament to report fortnightly throughout October. Even then it hadn\u2019t been enough as the government was defeated by a single vote. A sign of things to come. The debate proper began with both men appearing on stage like two contestants in a dodgy 1980s game show. Boris Johnson stared at the floor. A man-boy dressed in an ill-fitting suit. Don\u2019t mess this up, he told himself. All he needed to do was get through the next hour and he would end up as prime minister. \u201cPifflepafflewifflewaffle,\u201d he babbled.

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 10 July. This morning\u2019s email was not send due to a technical issue. Sorry for the inconvenience, we hope to back in business tomorrow. </p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>The home affairs department is keeping a multimillion-dollar strategic review into Peter Dutton\u2019s super portfolio secret from the public. </strong>The review was ordered after the creation of the home affairs department in late 2017, which saw the former department of immigration and border protection expanded with agencies and responsibilities from within the attorney general\u2019s department, as well as elements of regional development, social services and prime minister and cabinet. It was to be finalised by May this year. A spokeswoman for the department said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/10/peter-duttons-home-affairs-department-keeping-strategic-review-secret-from-public\">the review was completed but the report was not publicly released</a>. Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally said: \u201cGiven the department and Mr Dutton\u2019s record of waste, mismanagement and maladministration, the release of the report is especially important.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The Department of Human Services has spent more than $1bn on external labour hire since the 2016 election,</strong> prompting claims from Labor that the Coalition\u2019s outsourcing agenda <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/10/coalitions-1bn-welfare-outsourcing-accused-of-hurting-vulnerable-australians\">has gone \u201ctoo far\u201d</a>. Figures from AusTender show that since the government embarked on a Centrelink outsourcing push in 2017, which coincided with the trouble-plagued robodebt program, the amount spent on labour hire firms by DHS has skyrocketed. The largest contract awarded since the 2016 election is a $230m deal with Adecco Australia to employ 1,000 staff for Centrelink compliance activities. More than $400m has been spent in the past year on privatising call centres. And tender documents show the department has contracted external labour through more than 350 individual contracts, bringing the total cost to $1.03bn in just three years.</p> <p><strong>Australian gulls are carrying superbugs resistant to antibiotics,</strong> raising fears that disease-causing bacteria <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/10/australian-gulls-found-to-carry-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs\">may spread from the birds to humans, livestock and pets</a>. A team of scientists led by researchers at Perth\u2019s Murdoch University found more than 20% of silver gulls nationwide were carrying pathogenic bacteria, such as <em>E coli</em>, that are resistant to drugs. <em>E coli</em> can cause urinary tract infections, life-threatening sepsis and meningitis. Dr Sam Abraham, a lecturer in veterinary and medical infectious diseases at the university, said the \u201ceye-opening\u201d study should be a wake-up call for Australian governments.</p> <h2>World</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"575f7915ed620a0e2603d0cd24724bdf731cb8ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/575f7915ed620a0e2603d0cd24724bdf731cb8ac/0_0_4256_2553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pro-choice supporters stage a demonstration in Parliament Square to campaign for women\u2019s reproductive rights, legalisation of abortion in Northern Ireland and it\u2019s decriminalisation in the UK in May 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pro-choice supporters stage a demonstration in Northern Ireland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>MPs have voted resoundingly to extend both same-sex marriage and access to abortion to Northern Ireland,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/09/mps-vote-to-extend-same-sex-marriage-to-northern-ireland\">bringing the region into line with the rest of the UK</a> on the two significant social issues. </p> <p><strong>The UK foreign secretary</strong> <strong>Jeremy Hunt has publicly taken Donald Trump to task for \u201cdisrespectful and wrong\u201d insults levelled at the UK\u2019s ambassador to Washington,</strong> whose leaked memos criticising the president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/09/donald-trump-calls-theresa-may-foolish-as-diplomatic-row-escalates\"> caused a diplomatic crisis</a>. </p> <p><strong>Alex Acosta, the US labor secretary, is facing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/08/alexander-acosta-jeffrey-epstein-plea-deal-resignation\">renewed calls for his resignation</a> over the lenient 2008 plea deal he cut with Jeffrey Epstein</strong>, the billionaire financier who on Monday was charged with operating a sex-trafficking ring involving girls as young as 14.</p> <p><strong>Antarctica faces a tipping point where glacial melting will accelerate and become irreversible even if global heating eases,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/09/glacial-melting-in-antarctica-may-become-irreversible\">research suggests</a>.

Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally said: \u201cGiven the department and Mr Dutton\u2019s record of waste, mismanagement and maladministration, the release of the report is especially important.\u201d The Department of Human Services has spent more than $1bn on external labour hire since the 2016 election, prompting claims from Labor that the Coalition\u2019s outsourcing agenda has gone \u201ctoo far\u201d. Figures from AusTender show that since the government embarked on a Centrelink outsourcing push in 2017, which coincided with the trouble-plagued robodebt program, the amount spent on labour hire firms by DHS has skyrocketed. The largest contract awarded since the 2016 election is a $230m deal with Adecco Australia to employ 1,000 staff for Centrelink compliance activities. More than $400m has been spent in the past year on privatising call centres. And tender documents show the department has contracted external labour through more than 350 individual contracts, bringing the total cost to $1.03bn in just three years. Australian gulls are carrying superbugs resistant to antibiotics, raising fears that disease-causing bacteria may spread from the birds to humans, livestock and pets. A team of scientists led by researchers at Perth\u2019s Murdoch University found more than 20% of silver gulls nationwide were carrying pathogenic bacteria, such as E coli, that are resistant to drugs. E coli can cause urinary tract infections, life-threatening sepsis and meningitis. Dr Sam Abraham, a lecturer in veterinary and medical infectious diseases at the university, said the \u201ceye-opening\u201d study should be a wake-up call for Australian governments. World MPs have voted resoundingly to extend both same-sex marriage and access to abortion to Northern Ireland, bringing the region into line with the rest of the UK on the two significant social issues. The UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has publicly taken Donald Trump to task for \u201cdisrespectful and wrong\u201d insults levelled at the UK\u2019s ambassador to Washington, whose leaked memos criticising the president caused a diplomatic crisis. Alex Acosta, the US labor secretary, is facing renewed calls for his resignation over the lenient 2008 plea deal he cut with Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire financier who on Monday was charged with operating a sex-trafficking ring involving girls as young as 14. Antarctica faces a tipping point where glacial melting will accelerate and become irreversible even if global heating eases, research suggests. The Thwaites glacier, part of the West Antarctic ice sheet, is believed to pose the greatest risk for rapid future sea level rise, considered likely to thaw and trigger a 50cm sea level rise. Alek Sigley, the Australian student who was detained by North Korea for a little over a week before being released, has broken his silence to reject the regime\u2019s accusation that he was a spy, and to lament that he \u201cmay never again walk the streets of Pyongyang, a city that holds a very special place in my heart\u201d. Opinion and analysis It took 40 years before Tom Hawking realised he might have ADHD. When a psychologist first suggested it, he laughed the idea off. \u201cBut the more I thought about it, the more I wondered if she might be right,\u201d he writes. \u201cSubtract the hyperactivity bit, and the rest of the symptoms fit like a glove. Hadn\u2019t I always had trouble getting started on things? Hadn\u2019t I always had even more trouble finishing things, once the initial \u2018I have an idea!\u2019 rush wore off? Hadn\u2019t I always been hopelessly disorganised, acted without thought of consequences, and had a hard time waiting in queues?\u201d Labor shouldn\u2019t be tempted by a small-target strategy \u2013 it needs to sell hope, writes McKell Institute chief executive Sam Crosby. \u201cFederal Labor has never won from opposition by simply offering relief from unpopular government. The only way Labor wins is by connecting a suite of progressive policy proposals to a unifying vision that makes politically disengaged voters feel two things: hope and ambition. That\u2019s what Whitlam, Hawke and Rudd all did. It\u2019s is a tough path, but it\u2019s the only one that leads to victory. Conservative parties, especially those in government, have an easier option: fear. Conservatives can win by convincing voters to feel defensive and worried \u2026 Labor needs to paint a picture of the future vivid enough that people can see themselves and their kids in it.\u201d Sport Just after USA sealed their fourth Women\u2019s World Cup on Sunday, a chant broke out around the Stade de Lyon: \u201cEqual pay! Equal pay!\u201d Along with their World Cup trophy on Sunday, the US won something just as valuable for their lawsuit against US Soccer: public goodwill, writes Caitlin Murray. \u201cWhen Andy Murray and Serena Williams are out there competing all that matters is winning, and they were professionalism personified as they reached the third round of the mixed doubles with a polished 7-5, 6-3 victory over Fabrice Martin and Raquel Atawo,\u201d writes Jacob Steinberg. The Netball World Cup starting on Friday is the most anticipated ever. Here are 10 things to watch out for. Thinking time: The murder of social media star Qandeel Baloch At 11.25am on 16 July 2016, Adil Nizami, a 25-year-old rookie reporter from Multan, a city a little over 500km from the capital, Islamabad, broke the biggest story of his career. \u201cFamous model Qandeel Baloch has been killed,\u201d he blurted out in a live call that interrupted 24 News\u2019s regular morning bulletin. As he stood in the lane outside Qandeel\u2019s house, the words that had been on the tip of his tongue for more than an hour now rushed out. \u201cSome are saying that she was shot dead. The police have just reached her house here in Multan. We should find out shortly how she was murdered. Her brothers, the murderers, were angry with her because of her behaviour and all the scandals on TV. Her family was angry with her. And we have found out this morning that her brothers have either strangled her or shot her \u2026 there\u2019s conflicting information about how they killed her.\u201d Pakistan\u2019s first celebrity-by-social media, Qandeel Baloch, was known for the videos and photographs she posted on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Her videos were a mixed bag \u2013 she had a headache, she was bored, she had a song stuck in her head \u2013 and for a few seconds every day, thousands watched her coo or feign annoyance or try on a new dress. The videos were mostly made at night, when Qandeel said she couldn\u2019t sleep. And then, they became more risque \u2013 by Pakistan\u2019s standards, at least. Media roundup Coming up The 2019 State of Origin series will be decided tonight in Sydney when NSW \u2013 the favourites to win \u2013 and Queensland go head-to-head for a third and final time this year. Follow our the action at ANZ Stadium with our liveblog from 7.15pm AEST.

Rapinoe, 34, capped an outstanding World Cup on Sunday, scoring a penalty as the USA beat the Netherlands 2-0 in Lyon to win their fourth title. The outspoken USA co-captain said earlier in the tournament she would not visit the White House if her team won the title and Trump extended an invitation.

PPP also said voters who were undecided between Trump and Rapinoe had backed Hillary Clinton against Trump in 2016, thereby suggesting the soccer star had room to improve her result. PPP also made a point pertinent to debate among Democrats over how best to beat Trump next year. Though \u201cRapinoe may be an unlikely presidential candidate\u201d, PPP said, her numbers \u201cstill speak to a broader truth about Trump\u2019s standing \u2013 the fact that he polls in the low 40s against any Democrat \u2026 shows that electability concerns are overrated\u201d.

But world cricket\u2019s governing body said: \u201cEssentially the venues are responsible for the pitch preparation which is done with oversight and guidance from the ICC and our independent pitch consultant. \u201cThe guidance we give any host of an ICC event is to prepare the best possible pitches for the conditions in that country \u2013 so in this case the best possible ODI pitch for typical English conditions and we would also look for even bounce and good carry. The ICC does not instruct groundsmen to prepare pitches in a certain way to advantage, or disadvantage, any team.\u201d The surface for this semi-final sparked heavy criticism from the former England batsman Mark Butcher, who tweeted: \u201cSorry, but pitches have been garbage this tournament. Uneven, two-paced, shit heaps MIGHT give you an exciting 5 overs at the end of a run chase, but you\u2019ve scared everybody off in the previous 95. Crap.\u201d England\u2019s Jonny Bairstow has previously questioned why World Cup pitches have been so different from those normally seen in England. \u201cThe pitches we\u2019ve been playing on the last two years are surely the pitches we would be playing on in a World Cup? I don\u2019t know why they\u2019ve changed,\u201d Bairstow said.",

An open letter to the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has about 80 signatories including the son of the murdered anti-corruption reporter Daphne Caruana Galizia and journalists from the Guardian, Times and BBC. They say the government\u2019s approach to a new register of beneficiaries of obscure financial structures risks undermining previous efforts to combat illicit financial flows. The register is being updated as a result of the passage of the fifth anti-money laundering directive (5MLD), passed by the EU after the Panama Papers revelations, which were reported by an international collaboration of news organisations including the Guardian.

The letter\u2019s signatories have argued that by submitting evidence to Revenue &amp; Customs to determine whether access to the register should be granted, it is possible that HMRC could trigger an investigation, which can often take many years, during which time it is unlikely that any journalism or research could be published.

It appears designed to frustrate journalists and researchers from accessing and ultimately reporting on vital information about the beneficiaries of the opaque system of financial trusts that have tax liabilities in the UK.\u201d The letter adds: \u201cThe UK government\u2019s proposal for transposing this directive into national law restricts this legitimate interest to see and report on this information by requiring journalists and researchers to present evidence of wrongdoing before accessing the register, completely undermining the objectives of 5MLD.\u201d The coalition of NGOs and journalists said it was also concerned by the negative connotations that the UK government attached to journalists and researchers using the transparency created by the legislation to make \u201cspeculative enquiries\u201d. The Panama Papers comprised 11.5m files leaked from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca. The documents were leaked to the German daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, which shared them with the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the Guardian, the BBC and other media organisations. Among revelations reported in the Guardian was a network of secret offshore deals and vast loans worth $2bn (\u00a31.4bn) that lay a trail to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin. The papers also exposed the financial affairs of the former Icelandic prime minister Sigmundur Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Gunnlaugsson, who stepped down after the papers were published. They showed he co-owned a company set up in 2007 in the British Virgin Islands to hold investments with his wealthy partner and later wife, Anna Sigurlaug P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir. And they revealed that the then British prime minister David Cameron\u2019s late father, Ian, ran an offshore fund, Blairmore Holdings Inc, which avoided paying tax in Britain by hiring a small army of Bahamas residents to sign its paperwork.",

She trails 0-30 but battles back with a lovely dampened forehand volley and then relies on Konta to make two errors, the second a wated backhand that drifts well out at the back. Match point! Konta goes long with her 34th unforced error. What a moment for the 33-year-old Czech! And what gut-wrenching disappointment for Konta. Strycova will never play better (she made only nine unforced errors!) but Konta lost the run of herself. Her shots were wild.

Konta tries a drop shot from the back of the court, but Strycova chases it down like a playful puppy and puts it away.

I\u2019ll do my best not to use the nickname \u201cMurena\u201d too, because it\u2019s daft.</p> <p>As for the women\u2019s quarter-finals, it\u2019s hard to see Riske upsetting the odds for a second day in a row when she faces Serena Williams, although she appears to be relishing the impending battle. \u201cI\u2019m ready for a war,\u201d she roared after her victory over Barty. \u201c[Serena is] the greatest athlete I think that\u2019s ever been on the women\u2019s side.

You\u2019d expect her to beat the world No 54 Strycova but it\u2019s not always easy to predict how the British No 1 will play. The last time these two players met, in the last 16 of the Pan Pacific Open in 2017, Konta lost in straight sets. Both players had to battle for over two hours to get to the quarter-finals so their energy levels should be similar, though having the roar of Centre Court fully behind her, and the prospect of taking on the greatest women\u2019s player of them all in a Wimbledon semi-final, must surely give the No 19 seed the edge.

      "bodyText": "Right I\u2019m going to wrap this up now, but it sounds like Konta had a fierce interrogation after her defeat by Barbora Strycova earlier. This is an extract from Kevin Mitchell\u2019s updated report. Here, however, after attributing the result to the excellence of her opponent, she snapped at the suggestion she was not facing up to the scale of her shortcomings when approaching the concluding weekend of a slam. In a heated exchange with one inquisitor who pointed out she had made 34 unforced errors in an hour and 37 minutes, Konta said: \u201cIs that in your professional tennis opinion?\u201d before adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think you need to pick on me in a harsh way. I think I\u2019m very open with you guys. I say how I feel out there. If you don\u2019t want to accept that answer or you don\u2019t agree with it, that\u2019s fine. I still believe in the tennis that I play. I still believe in the way I competed.\u201d Konta\u2019s devotion to her \u201cprocess\u201d and \u201cacceptance\u201d does not allow for negativity \u2013 and there was plenty of that coming her way in an unusually tough press conference. The exchange slithered to an ugly finish when the normally ultra-polite Konta said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t patronise me.\u201d You can read the full report here: And be sure to check back in for the report on Murray and Williams\u2019s march towards the business end of the mixed doubles competition here shortly. Murray and Williams speak. \u201cWe\u2019re getting in the groove of things. We\u2019re starting to feel the rhythm,\u201d beams Serena Williams. \u201cI\u2019m having a blast. It\u2019s a great atmosphere playing out there with Andy.\u201d Murray is understandably full of praise for his brilliant partner: \u201cShe returned brilliantly, clean winners a lot of the time, making my job easy but I was missing on the break points. If she keeps returning like that we\u2019ll have a good chance. Doubles is good for the reflexes and movement. Once we\u2019re finished here, hopefully on Sunday, I\u2019ll get back to singles and see how that goes.\u201d He finishes by saying: \u201cShe\u2019s the boss.\u201d She certainly is. What a player. Second set: *Murray/Williams 7-5, 6-3 Martin/Atawo (*denotes server) Murray and Williams advance to the third round, where they\u2019ll face the No 1 seeds! What a lot of fun. Murray double-faults at 30-0 up and needs a word from Serena to put him right. He also needs Serena to bring up match point with some wonderful reaction volleys at the net. He doesn\u2019t let his partner down thereafter, mind, hammering an ace home to win the match. Murray was good but Serena was sensational. Second set: Murray/Williams 7-5, 5-3 Martin/Atawo*(*denotes server) Serena jumps on Atawo\u2019s serve with her umpteenth fizzed return to set the tone in this game. And there\u2019s then a ludicrously entertaining doubles rally in which arms whiz around in the cartoon style before Atawo sends Serena scuttling across court in vain. A couple of fine returns from, Serena and then Murray, bring up deuce. Some to-ing and fro-ing ensues before Martin buries two volleys at the net to leave it up to Murray to serve for the match. Second set: *Murray/Williams 7-5, 5-2 Martin/Atawo (*denotes server) Serena holds to love thanks to a couple of fierce kick serves to prevent Martin and Otawo getting a sniff on her second serve. Serena\u2019s looked a cut above everybody else, Murray included but she is deep into a singles tournament now and is completely in the zone. Murray understandably looks a little rusty. Second set: Murray/Williams 7-5, 4-2 Martin/Atawo* (*denotes server) There\u2019s some discussion about whether Murray and Williams are the best returners of serve the doubles game has ver seen. Serena has been on fire against Martin. Murray has not got into his groove just yet but there have been glimpses that his fast hands could get going soon. It\u2019s a comfortable hold to 15 for the doubles specialists, though. Serena was a bit wild with her returns there. Second set: *Murray/Williams 7-5, 4-1 Martin/Atawo (*denotes server) Murray holds to love. It\u2019s his most comfortable service game of the match. He sees it out with a booming ace down the middle and is given a fist-bump by Serena for his efforts. Second set: Murray/Williams 7-5, 3-1 Martin/Atawo* (*denotes server) After a battling singles performance this afternoon where she didn\u2019t look her best, I think Serena is enjoying being able to cut loose a bit in this match. She\u2019s going for everything. The specialists hold, though, with a breakdown in communication from Murray and Serena allowing Atawo a free shot between the two of them to win the game. Second set: *Murray/Williams 7-5, 3-0 Martin/Atawo (*denotes server) Murray\u2019s a little slow getting back to an Atawo lob and quickly adjusts so that Serena can hammer a forehand behind him. But she\u2019s a little distracted by Murray and goes wide. They trail 0-30 but get back into it quickly thanks to a couple of Williams aces, though. She\u2019s been ace herself in this match. When Murray gets going they\u2019ll be even more of a daunting duo. Murray wins the game with a delicious feather-fingered backhand drop-shot at the net. They may wrap this match up reasonably quickly. Second set: Murray/Williams 7-5, 2-0 Martin/Atawo* (*denotes server) Serena\u2019s definitely doing the best work, timing her returns perfectly to help bring up two break points. She\u2019s putting every ounce of sweat into this match. Steady on Serena, you\u2019ve got a singles semi-final coming up. The specialists save both break points and a huge looping forehand from Martin helps brings up game point, but Serena is putting on a show here. She whips another backhand across court at an implausible angle and then jumps all over a Martin second serve with a vicious winner down the line. That was gold plated. Martin gets the specialists out of jail with a lovely open-faced volley that leaves Serena stretching in vain. Murray ups his game with a fizzing return and then Atawo makes a mistake, hitting a backhand that was going out into mid-court where Murray gobbles it up. It\u2019s Serena again who brings up yet another break point with some more brilliance \u2013 and this time Martin errs to bring up an early break fro the dream duo. Second set: *Murray/Williams 7-5, 1-0 Martin/Atawo (*denotes server) Murray and Serena are immediately put on the back foot in the opening game of the second set. They\u2019re made to save two break points on their way to a battling hold, which Murray seals with a fierce first serve that goes straight through Atawo. First set: Murray/Williams 7-5 Martin/Atawo* (*denotes server) This time they do get the break! 0-15, 15-15, 15-30 thanks to a rare error at the net from Martin. The big man makes up for it in the next point, levelling the game at 30-30 but Serena roars as she brings up set point with a fierce return off an undercooked Atawo first serve. But it\u2019s Murray who lets the dream duo down, hitting a woeful backhand low into the net. Serena goes after the next point and brings up another set point \u2013 and finishes it off with a wonderful whipped forehand to send Centre Court into raptures. She won that for Murray there. What a competitor! First set: *Murray/Williams 6-5 Martin/Atawo (*denotes server) Martin and Atawo had a bye in the first round so this is their opening match. They don\u2019t look particularly rusty. Serena has an up and down game on her serve, dumping a shot into the net but for the most part serving powerfully and accurately and forcing errors from her opponents. It\u2019s a hold to 30. Can the dream duo get over the line and break in the next game? They\u2019ve got close in the last two. First set: Murray/Williams 5-5 Martin/Atawo* (*denotes server) A classic Murray backhand down the line and then a vintage Serena return from a Martin first serve give the dream duo a sniff at 15-30. Atawo\u2019s overhead leaves Serena fumbling at her feet, though, and it\u2019s 30-30. Serena gets her shot-choice wrong on the next point, finding the net as she tries to go across court. And then Murray pounces at the net to get it back to deuce. Martin rams a 138mph serve at Serena, which she gobbles up! Incredible. It\u2019s set point, but Murray can\u2019t capitalise at the net. Serena wanders over and appears to give her younger partner a bit of advice. The game then swings both ways and the specialists hang in the game thanks to a back of the court smash from Martin, who sends Atawo running for cover in front of him. First set: *Murray/Williams 5-4 Martin/Atawo (*denotes server) There\u2019s a bit of pressure on Murray\u2019s serve at 15-30 after a bit of a mix-up when Murray tries to lob from the back of the court when Serena was better placed at the net to fire a forehand down. A good serve and and a strong volley at the net by Serena get them to game point and then Serena sees it out, holding to 30. The specialists will have to serve to stay in the set. First set: Murray/Williams 4-4 Martin/Atawo* (*denotes server) What an entertaining game this is. Murray pounces on an Atawo second serve at 15-0 to bring the score back to 15-15. It was a fierce drive that Martin could not get near. And then Atawo wobbles a little, double-faulting, before Murray reads Martin\u2019s movement and passes him on the inside and down the line. That was like sending a goalkeeper the wrong way on a penalty. Two break points. Both saved, the second with a classic backhand volley from Martin at the net after a strong first serve from Atawo. And then Martin shows incredible control with a backhand volley at the net after Serena clattered a ball in at him. His wrists must still be vibrating after that! Serena roars as she jumps on a second serve to bring up another break, and then Murray tries to lob Atawo but he\u2019s millimetres wide. It\u2019s deuce again. Murray has success on Atawo\u2019s second serve and then Serena attacks it but Martin is looming again, blocking off the angles. The specialists hold on after being given a stern examination. First set: *Murray/Williams 4-3 Martin/Atawo (*denotes server) Serena\u2019s service game is strong but the experience of the doubles specialists is coming to the fore. Atawo\u2019s awareness of the greater width of the court helps them to bring the game back to 30-30. They\u2019re the 14th seeds, after all. But Murray is deft at the net and the singles greats hold to 30. First set: *Murray/Williams 3-3 Martin/Atawo* (*denotes server) Serena\u2019s eyes light up as Martin hits a poor second serve, which Serena whips over the net at Atawo\u2019s despairing racket. Murray mishits a return and apologises to Serena and then Atawo fires a difficult overhead volley at Serena\u2019s feet to take a 401-5 lead. There\u2019s then a wonderful rally, with Murray having no right to get a Martin smash back before Serena showed deft hands to go toe to toe with Atawo, coming off second best after some rapid ping-pong hither and thither at the net. The specialists hold to 15. First set: *Murray/Williams 3-2 Martin/Atawo (*denotes server) Murray double-faults at 30-0. Oh Andy! It like pre-grand slam-winning Murray all over again. There are no alarms and no surprises after that, mind. It\u2019s an easy hold to 15, with the understanding between the two starting to improve. First set: Murray/Williams 2-2 Martin/Atawo* (*denotes server) When Martin is at the net he seems to cover the whole of it. He\u2019s huge! With Atawo serving, he blocks off all the angles and helps bring about an easy hold to love. Atawo\u2019s service game was solid there. She comes off better out of a ping-pong rally at the net with Murray too, which Martin finishes off with an overhead that Serena can\u2019t dig out. First set: *Murray/Williams 2-1 Martin/Atawo (*denotes server) It\u2019s Serena\u2019s turn to serve. She punches a couple of accurate serves into the body of first Martin, and then Atawo. 30-0. Martin catches Murray out to bring the game back to 30-15 but a hefty first serve by Serena forces an error and then Murray pounces at the net to give Willliams/Murray the lead. Serena is looking remarkably fresh considering she had a gruelling two-hour match a couple of hours ago. She\u2019s 37, too. First set: Murray/Williams 1-1 Martin/Atawo* (*denotes server) It\u2019s an easy hold to 15 for Martin/Atawo, who has some success out wide. First set: *Murray/Williams 1-0 Martin/Atawo (*denotes server) Well, that sandwich will take some time to digest. It was gone in 60 seconds! Anyway, to the tennis. It looks like it\u2019s going to be an easy-as-you-like hold for the power-partners of singles tennis against the doubles specialists but the specialists bring it back to 40-30 before Serena blasts a ball at the body of the 6ft 7in Martin to win the game. She apologises. But there\u2019s no need. It\u2019s part of the game isn\u2019t it? The players are out, Gregg has wolfed down a sandwich, he\u2019s back. Enjoy the match! Remember this is Serena\u2019s second match of the day. She\u2019s already played three sets today, coming through a tough quarter-final against Alison Riske. That finished less than three hours ago, here\u2019s how Serena spent her downtime, with her daughter Olympia. Hi everyone, Michael Butler here, just as Gregg catches his breath. As one Brit departs from Centre Court, another one arrives: Andy Murray walks out with his mixed doubles partner Serena Williams. They are up against Raquel Atawo and Fabrice Martin in the second round. I\u2019m just going to grab a drink before Andy Murray and Serena Williams steal the show on Centre Court. Back shortly. What a fascinating sport tennis is. The way momentum can swing so quickly and so dramatically is captivating. Konta was strolling at 4-1 up in the first set. And then at the first sign of resistance she crumbled. Psychologically, she never got it back. Anyway, here\u2019s the moment Strycova sealed her place in the Wimbledon semi-final against Serena Williams. Strycova, who is rumoured to be retiring at the end of the season, speaks: It sounds crazy. I can\u2019t really believe it. I\u2019m extremely happy. My voice is still shaking. I still have doubles so I have to go and play! I tried to mix it a little bit and then tried to get into the match and then I grew in confidence. This is one of the best matches I have played before. It\u2019s a great to play her [Serena]. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d She seemed dazzled in the aftermath of that match. Understandable I suppose. She was quite brilliant and she now gets a shot at a Wimbledon final against the greatest female player of them all. Second set: *Strycova 7-6 (5), 5-1 Konta (*denotes server) Strycova is in her first-ever grand slam semi-final! She begins the game looking very nervy. Her first-ever grand slam semi-final is within her grasp. Butterflies are understandable. She trails 0-30 but battles back with a lovely dampened forehand volley and then relies on Konta to make two errors, the second a wated backhand that drifts well out at the back. Match point! Konta goes long with her 34th unforced error. What a moment for the 33-year-old Czech! And what gut-wrenching disappointment for Konta. Strycova will never play better (she made only nine unforced errors!) but Konta lost the run of herself. Her shots were wild. What a sickener. Second set: Strycova 7-6 (5), 5-1 Konta* (*denotes server) Strycova breaks! Konta looks like she\u2019s going to hold comfortably as she races to 40-0 before letting Strycova back in with two mistimes forehands in a row and then a lax approach from the back of the court, which lets Strycova smash an overhead winner away to get the game back to deuce. Konta tries a drop shot from the back of the court, but Strycova chases it down like a playful puppy and puts it away. Konta survives one beak point with a sublime backhand volley but disappointment is creased across her face as she gives away another break away, this time with a double-fault. To add insult to injury, Konta slashes an easy swing volley long. Strycovic will serve for the match. Second set: *Strycova 7-6 (5), 4-1 Konta (*denotes server) Strycovic\u2019s net-craft has been supreme. A drop shot lures Konta to the net, where she can\u2019t pass Strycovic, who lobs the bamboozled Brit with a backhand volley. Konta battles back into the game, though, leaving Strycova on the turf with a disguised forehand but the Czech sees it out thanks to a fortunate net cord at 40-30. Second set: Strycova 7-6 (5), 3-1 Konta* (*denotes server) Konta holds to 15 with a much stronger service game. She\u2019s got a lowly 58% first-serve percentage in this match compared to Strycovic\u2019s 72%. She finishes on an ace. She needed that. Second set: *Strycova 7-6 (5), 3-0 Konta (*denotes server) Well, this performance by Strycova makes it clear why Konta had such trouble against her when they met and she lost in straight sets in the Pan Pacific Open in 2017. Her mobility and low returns are causing Konta all manner of problems. It\u2019s a hold to 15 for the 33-year-old Czech who looks like she is having the time of her life. Second set: Strycova 7-6 (5), 2-0 Konta* (*denotes server) 0-15, 0-30, 0-40. Oh dear. Konta looks rattled. A double backhand down the line saves one break point but an overhit cross-court backhand leaves hr staring into the middle distance. Strycova breaks. Is she staring at a defeat? Second set: *Strycova 7-6 (5), 1-0 Konta (*denotes server) Konta puts pressure on the Czech\u2019s serve, profiting from a couple of handy returns, but the Czech is proving very aggressive, scurrying into the net and using her doubles skills to her advantage. One such visit to the net leaves Konta static after the Brit had tried a drop shot to no avail. She holds serve to 30. Strycova takes the tie break 7-5 \u2013 and the set! Strycova wins a wonderful point while 5-4 down in the tie-break, ghosting into the net to land a backhand drop shot just when it appeared Konta was getting on top. And then Konta adds to her tally of unforced errors (now up at 22!) and Strycova takes the set. Konta will be furious with herself. She was cruising at 4-1 up in the set and then got careless. Strycova has grown in confidence as a result. The eighth seed will face the seventh seed, Halep, in the semi-final. Muchova\u2019s exertions yesterday really did catch up with her. First set tie-break: Strycova 3-3 Konta Konta loses the mini-break immediately and then comes unstuck further as she misses an easy forehand volley at the net. But she battles back with a solid forehand. There are five mini-breaks in the first six points. Nerves? You bet. The players switch ends. Which way will this go? First set: *Strycova 6-6 Konta (*denotes server) Both players spray wild forehands wide in a messy opening to the game but Strycova booms a serve right down the middle that Konta can only get the frame of her racket too. A delicious forehand drop-shot leaves Konta scrambling forlornly befiore Konta goes long again (her 20th unforced error) to give her opponent the game. Tie-break! First set: Strycova 5-6 Konta* (*denotes server) Konta is really struggling with the Strycova forehand return, partly because she\u2019s not getting her first serve in enough and is allowing the Czech to take control of rallies. It\u2019s a battling hold to 15 for the British N0 1, though. A much-needed one. Strycova will again serve to stay in the set. First set: *Strycova 5-5 Konta (*denotes server) Strycova is enjoying this. She does the double-backhand drop-shot trick again to go 30-0 up and then bangs down a big serve to bring up 40-0. She holds to love with little fuss. Over to you, Jo. First set: Strycova 4-5 Konta* (*denotes server) This is an important win for Konta. She needs a strong service game but doesn\u2019t have one. She struggles to deal with a Strycova return that lands at her feet and forces her to dump into the net at 30-15. And then Strycova turns the game her way with an outrageous double-handed backhand drop-shot from the back of the court to bring the game to 30-30. Another unforced error from Konta gives Strycova a break point, but the British No 1 shows nice touch herself, making Strycova scramble and go long before winning a long rally to give her a vital game. Strycova will have to serve to stay in the set. First set: *Strycova 4-4 Konta (*denotes server) Konta\u2019s return of serve is still proving to be a good weapon, though. It helps set up a forehand smash at 15-15. Strycova then has a wobble, double-faulting and giving Konta a scent of blood at 15-30. But three more unforced errors from Konta let the Czech get away with it and we\u2019re all square. Over on No 1 Court it\u2019s 2-2 and on serve in the second set between Svitolina and Muchova. First set: Strycova 3-4 Konta* (*denotes server) Strycova breaks Konta! Despite making Strycova do all the running with some intelligent shot selection, one point of concern is that Konta has tried to be too accurate when landing her winners. She misses two in a row at 30-15 and Strycova has a break point at 30-40. Konta goes long and we\u2019re back on serve. Well, it was looking too comfortable. We now have a match on our hands. First set: *Strycova 2-4 Konta (*denotes server) Konta is using the sliced backhand well to slow down rallies and give herself a chance to find position after the Strycova serve. She puts pressure on the Strycova serve at 30-30 with this tactic but the Czech finds an ace and a serve-volley winner to take the game. First set: Strycova 1-4 Konta* (*denotes server) Konta varies her serve, going down the middle and then out wide. She hammers a mid-court forehand away to take a 30-0 lead. Strycova gets back into it at 30-15 but Konta smashes another big serve in that sets up another easy winner. She takes it to 40-15 and then sees it out from the back of the court. Konta has been the underdog in her last two matches but she\u2019s the favourite here and living up to her billing with assured maturity. First set: *Strycova 1-3 Konta (*denotes server) It\u2019s a comfortable hold to love for the Czech, who settles her nerves and gets on the board. First set: Strycova 0-3 Konta* (*denotes server) Well, this is the perfect start for the British No 1. She looks absolutely in the zone as she holds to 30 before bounding away to her chair. Muchova looked to be running away with the first set but the eighth seed has finally got her tactics right and worked her battling opponent out. She\u2019s taken the set in 48 tough minutes. First set: *Strycova 0-2 Konta (*denotes server) There\u2019s nothing nervy about Konta\u2019s return of serve. She zips a couple of returns back at Strycova\u2019s feet and puts pressure on her serve immediately. Strycova battles back to 30-30 but a double-fault gives Konta a break point. She can\u2019t take it, overhitting a forehand from mid-court that she really should have made. Konta whips a vicious return back at Strycova to give herself another break point, which she takes, with another big return that Strycova can\u2019t handle. First set: Strycova 0-1 Konta* (*denotes server) It\u2019s a nervy start by Konta. She comes into the net to take the first point of the match with a lovely little dampened forehand volley winner. She then outlasts her opponent in a baseline rally but then three overhit forehands in a row give Strycova a break point. Konta stays mentally strong and fires a backhand-winner across court. Deuce. Strycova goes long and then Konta gets the game on the board as Strycova dumps a shot into the net. That was an important first game for the British No 1. Here\u2019s more on history being made, fittingly on Court No 12. Tok! Tok! Tok! Jo Konta and Barbara Strycova are out on Centre Court and knocking up. We\u2019ll have action soon. With Muchova 5-3 up and serving for the first set, Svitolina ups her game and breaks back. It\u2019s back on serve at 4-5. Muchova and Pliskova went close yesterday but we now have our first 12-12 tie-break at Wimbledon. Kontinen and Peers have won it, by the way. So they\u2019re into the fourth round. Perhaps Muchova is not feeling the after-effects of yesterday\u2019s exertions. The Czech is the first to break. She then holds to love to take a commanding 4-1 lead in the first set. If she can get this done nice and early she can put her feet up for a day and a half. Muchova is the lowest-ranked player left in the tournament (world No 68). Her run to the last eight has been rather lost among the remarkable story that was Coco Gauff\u2019s journey to the last 16. \u201cHere\u2019s a moniker for Serena Williams and Andy Murray,\u201d writes Samantha Rajasingham. \u201cThe Andy Williams Show! Though, I\u2019m not sure either would be happy or understand that. So old timey \u2026 \u201d Moon River anyone? Here\u2019s our report on Serena Williams\u2019s battling win over Alison Riske: Jo Konta will be on Centre Court in around 20 minutes\u2019 time as she bids to set up a semi-final against Serena Williams. She faces the unseeded Barbora Strycova, who beat Konta the last time they met in 2017. Over on No 1 Court Svitolina and Muchova have just got under way. It\u2019s 1-1 and on serve. Muchova, of course, had a mammoth match against Karolina Pliskova yesterday, winning 4-6, 7-5, 13-11. She may have a little more lactic acid in her legs as she runs around this afternoon. It\u2019s taken exactly two hours but Serena Williams is a Wimbledon semi-finalist again! She does it with a thumping ace down the middle. Riske played her part brilliantly. She said she was \u201cready for war\u201d and she battled as though her life depended on it. She\u2019s given a huge ovation as she leaves Centre Court - and quite rightly too. What a warrior. She never gave up and pushed her illustrious opponent to the limit. But Serena\u2019s class and winning mentality shone through in the end. More tennis like that please. Serena breaks Riske! What a match this is! The 23-times grand slam winner raises her game and fires home a fizzing return followed by a ferocious cross-court forehand to bring up two break points. Riske saves the first with a huge first serve that Serena can only dump into the net, then she does it again \u2013 but this time on her second serve. What pluck! That\u2019s nine beak points she has saved this match. She\u2019s soon facing a 10th \u2013 and she saves it again! Deuce. Serena falls awkwardly as she is sent racing side to side but recovers to show lovely hands at the net, with a sliced forehand drop shot that sets up an easy winner. And then she repeats the trick to bring up another break point. And this time Riske goes for her second serve and is not rewarded for her risky approach (sorry). Serena leads 5-3 and will serve for the match. Serena holds to love. It\u2019s 4-3 and on serve. Over to you Riske. Serena Williams has made 26 unforced errors \u2013 that\u2019s poor. But she\u2019s also rattled down 39 winners, which is pretty impressive. And a couple of those winners \u2013 one, a cross-court backhand with sparkle-dust on it \u2013 puts pressure on Riske\u2019s service game. But the stubborn unseeded American will not be moved despite being taken to deuce. She takes the game with a delightful back-hand winner down the line, her 24th winner of the match. It\u2019s 3-3. Riske is not going away! She breaks back and it\u2019s 2-3 with Riske to serve. Serena is shouting \u201ccome on!\u201d after every point \u2013 she knows she\u2019s not at her best and is trying to gee herself up at every opportunity. Riske is finding the back of the court with unerring accuracy and causing Serena a problem. Riske steams in on a mid-court shot by Serena and whips it across court to get back on serve. The Centre Court crowd roar \u2013 they\u2019re loving this. What a match! Serena Williams breaks again! A double-fault at 0-15 gives Serena a scent of blood. She tries to rush her forehands, though, and lets Riske back into it at 30-30. They trade points and we\u2019re up at deuce. Serena\u2019s timing is off, though. She wallops a forehand into the net from mid-court, catching it too soon. Then it\u2019s Riske\u2019s turn to wobble, putting too much juice on a forehand down the line and then finding the net tape to give Serena another break point. Riske double-faults by going for it! Oh dear. That could be costly. Riske took a risk and there was no reward. Sorry. Serena Williams leads 3-1 and is a break up. Serena holds to 15 with a huge 119mph ace! Have that Alison! It\u2019s 2-1 and now it\u2019s over to Riske to respond. This is a big game for her. Serena Williams breaks back immediately! A waft of her forehand sends a forehand fizzing past Riske and on to the boards at the back of Centre Court. The thumping sound it makes is menacing. Perhaps Serena has found the fire in her belly that she will need to battle past her feisty opponent and into the semi-finals. It\u2019s 1-1 in the decider. Zhang burned brightly but it was too early in the match. The Romanian had to battle so hard to win the first set \u2013 but winning it appeared to break her Chinese opponent, who faded like a tired firefly in the second set. Riske breaks Serena in the first game of the deciding set! She couldn\u2019t could she? Riske is reaching everything and making Serena look static. Williams needs to wake up, fast! Halep is 5-1 up against Zhang over on No 1 Court. I would never have guessed the Riske-Serena match would have lasted longer. Tennis, huh? Riske holds to love. We\u2019ll have a deciding set. The unseeded American has raised her game and done what she has done so well this year: come back from a set down. Can she cause a huge upset and see the match out? We\u2019ll soon see. Riske has only gone and broken Serena! She pounces on a fiercely struck second serve and then rushes into the net, picking up a lovely half-volley and tickling it over the net. She roars at the crowd. And why not? She leads 5-4 and will serve for the second set. And now Halep does turn the screw, making Zhang hit long with a deep forehand and then piling the pressure on to break her. It\u2019s 3-1 with Halep to serve in the second set. That was a big break. Riske holds to 15 and must now put everything into this next game to try and break Serena. She knows she\u2019s running out of chances to do something special. Serena is made to battle to hold against Riske, who takes the game to deuce. It\u2019s 4-3 and on serve in the second set. Has Halep rattled Zhang? Not yet, although at moments in the second game of the second set it looks that way. The Romanian holds serve and senses there is an opportunity to hurry her opponent, who slashes a couple of forehands wide. But, showing great composure, the Chinese world No 50, cleverly chooses to stay in rallies until the opportunity to win them is there. She takes the second game and it\u2019s 1-1. Serena holds and Riske follows suit. It\u2019s 3-3 and the unseeded American varied her game a little there, winning a point with a deliciously impudent drop shot. It\u2019s not a bad tactic. The Romanian was 4-1 down in that first set but she has battled back brilliantly and found a way to win it. She had to snoop around in her locker for it, but she found some extra zip in her step when it mattered and piled the pressure on Zhang\u2019s serve, winning the set with a mid-court cross-court forehand that was too hot for Zhang to handle (and she\u2019s handled most things in this match so far). Riske wins a 13-shot rally after arrowing a backhand down the line that Serena can\u2019t get a full racket head to. It brings up game point and Riske holds to 15. It\u2019s 2-2. It\u2019s 4-3 and on serve in the first set tie-break between Halep and Zhang, who has just whipped a delicious forehand over the net to get a mini-break back against the Romanian. Williams roars \u201ccome on!\u201d after booming an ace down to lead 2-1 in the second set on Centre Court. Riske took the game to deuce by again showing quick hands to adjust and send Serena\u2019s serves straight back down her throat. She won\u2019t go quietly. Zhang has the chance to bring up a break point put hurries a forehand and misses wildly to the right. Halep holds and it\u2019s a tie-break on No 1 Court. It\u2019s hard to predict how it will go. Both are matching each others\u2019 court craft and playing some lovely stuff. After a slow start, Halep has done well to finally read her opponent. Riske goes toe-to-toe with Serena and holds to 30 on Centre Court. The crowd are really taking to the unseeded American, who is making a fine match out of what could have been a walkover. It\u2019s 1-1. Halep holds her serve to make it 5-5 but then Zhang races through her service game and heap the pressure on Halep once more. It\u2019s 6-5 to Zhang, who will have a spring in her step as she attempts to take this first set. Riske continues to be a pesky menace, making Serena scramble around in her first service game of the second set and dump a couple of shots into the net. Serena finds a couple of big serves to convert deuce into a 1-0 second-set lead, though. Halep and Zhang are having some wonderful rallies over on No 1 Court. The Romanian\u2019s creative juices are beginning to flow now, though, and she\u2019s got her opponent on the back foot at last. Zhang holds to lead 5-4, meaning Halep has to serve to stay in the set. Well, Serena was broken twice in that set and was far from her best but still showed impeccable timing to raise her game and fire some fierce returns of serve back at Riske when it really mattered. She clenches her fist and punches the air. She knows she was tested there. And she came through it. Serena holds to love and Riske is now serving to stay in the set. She\u2019ll have to stay composed here. It\u2019s moments like these when elite players find that 10% more to turn a match in their favour. Halep breaks Zhang! For the first time in this match the Romanian is back on serve and looks like she may finally have worked out her opponent. It\u2019s 4-3 to Zhang with Halep to serve. Serena gives out a huge roar as she watches Riske stretch and overhit a backhand. The reason for such emotion is that she\u2019s broken back. It\u2019s 4-4 and what a ding-dong battle this is. Riske said she was \u201cready for war\u201d today. Perhaps Serena wasn\u2019t. Well, not until now, anyway. Halep saves four break points to hold serve against Zhang and take the score to 4-2. The seventh seed is really struggling to find a way past Zhang, who is chasing every shot down like it\u2019s match point. Riske breaks Serena Williams again! She\u2019s having a wonderful time out there, using the power of the Serena serve quite magnificently to return fire and get her nose in front once more. That\u2019s 4-3! Serena breaks back! She looks like she\u2019s had enough of being shown up. She jumps on Riske\u2019s serve and comes to the net to put a volley away to get her nose in front. A fizzing forehand brings up a break point but Riske battles her way back to deuce. Serena finds a little extra zip in her step and sends Riske scurrying one way then the other before benefitting from a net cord and stretching to seal the game with a delicate volley into open court. It\u2019s 3-3! Riske looks every inch like she\u2019s revelling in this rare appearance under the spotlight. She holds her serve without giving Serena a sniff. She\u2019s not going to a brush over. Serena reasserts her authority in her next service game, though. It\u2019s 3-2 but Riske is still a break up. Over on No1 Court, Zhang is playing quite brilliantly and giving Halep the runaround. She holds her serve to bring the score up to 3-0 and then makes her opponent battle through deuce to win her first game. Halep has a fight on her hands, here. Zhang is a break up and 3-1 to the good. And now Riske breaks Williams! Having battled gamely with Serena, using the power of her opponent\u2019s groundstrokes to counter-punch intelligently, she takes the game to deuce and an overhit forehand by Serena brings up a break point. Riske jumps on the opportunity, scrambling back a return that lands at Serena\u2019s feet before she can adjust them. The result is a weak backhand that is dumped into the net. It\u2019s 2-1 to Riske! Maybe we could have a few surprises this afternoon, after all. It\u2019s not been the best start for the No 7 seed Halep. She\u2019s been broken by Zhang in her first service game and trails 2-0. Riske\u2019s serve is pounced on by Williams, who takes a couple of points off her. This causes the unseeded American to switch tactics and curl a serve into Serena\u2019s body and then a sliding one out wide. Both are successful and catch Serena out somewhat. Riske wins her first service game. 1-1. Serena Williams serves first against Riske. It\u2019s not the most comfortable hold in the world but a booming forehand giving Riske a taste of the power she\u2019ll have to resist this afternoon and she gets there, holding to 30. Meanwhile, on No 1 Court, Zhang holds serve to get a game on the board and a little confidence. The players are out on court and ready to warm up. Serena Williams has been talking before her match. She says she has been inspired by the USA women\u2019s football team\u2019s World Cup win and finds them an inspiring group of sportswomen. She also says her daughter is doing nothing but play football at the moment and has taken no interest in tennis. Oh dear! There\u2019s still time, Serena, but football\u2019s a fine sport too. Alison Riske has won 14 of her 15 matches on grass in 2019. That\u2019s some record. She\u2019s also come back from a set down to win on seven occasions, too. She\u2019ll need to start quickly against Serena Williams, though. There\u2019s no easing into a match against a 23-times grand slam winner, though. Dan wants some surprises this afternoon. Will we get them? I\u2019m not so sure. Weatherwatch! It\u2019s going to be comforting 21c for most of the day at SW19 but it is a bit cloudy and there\u2019s a hint of rain in the air. Hopefully it won\u2019t materialise and we\u2019ll have unhindered tennis, but there is a chance of a shower or two. It\u2019s women\u2019s quarter-finals day \u2013 and the order of play looks like this: Centre Court (1pm BST start) Alison Riske (USA) v Serena Williams (USA) 11 Barbora Strycova (CZE) v Jo Konta (GBR) 19 No 1 Court (1pm BST start) Simona Halep (ROU) 7 v Shuai Zhang (CHN) Elina Svitolina (UKR) 8 v Karolina Muchova (CZE) I will also stick around for Andy Murray and Serena Williams v Fabrice Martin 14 and Raquel Atawo 14 in the second round of the mixed doubles too. They\u2019re scheduled to be on Centre Court once the quarter-finals are done and dusted. I\u2019ll do my best not to use the nickname \u201cMurena\u201d too, because it\u2019s daft. As for the women\u2019s quarter-finals, it\u2019s hard to see Riske upsetting the odds for a second day in a row when she faces Serena Williams, although she appears to be relishing the impending battle. \u201cI\u2019m ready for a war,\u201d she roared after her victory over Barty. \u201c[Serena is] the greatest athlete I think that\u2019s ever been on the women\u2019s side. It\u2019s going to be a huge challenge but I\u2019m really looking forward to it.\u201d I expect Halep to have too much court-craft for Zhang when they get under way on No 1 Court and Svitolina will surely be too fresh for Karolina Muchova, who came through an epic match against the No 3 seed, Karolina Pliskova, winning 4-6, 7-5, 13-11! in three hours 17 minutes yesterday. And what of Konta? You\u2019d expect her to beat the world No 54 Strycova but it\u2019s not always easy to predict how the British No 1 will play. The last time these two players met, in the last 16 of the Pan Pacific Open in 2017, Konta lost in straight sets. Both players had to battle for over two hours to get to the quarter-finals so their energy levels should be similar, though having the roar of Centre Court fully behind her, and the prospect of taking on the greatest women\u2019s player of them all in a Wimbledon semi-final, must surely give the No 19 seed the edge. I\u2019ll be back shortly. Catch up on Konta\u2019s battle with Kvitova here while you wait:",

He is one of those blokes where everyone is ecstatic when he does well, so we are over the moon.\u201d </em></p> <p>And this might be of interest to Glamorgan fans.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GlamCricket/status/1148531955643949056\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NEWS \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f// We are pleased to announce that ex-England and Essex wicket-keeper batsman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesFoster07?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JamesFoster07</a> will be joining our coaching staff for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VitalityBlast?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@VitalityBlast</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoGlam?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GoGlam</a> \ud83d\udca5<br><br>Read more \ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://t.co/ZZQxTDmGgd\">https://t.co/ZZQxTDmGgd</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/iF8wUxbECy\">pic.twitter.com/iF8wUxbECy</a></p>&mdash; Glamorgan Cricket \ud83c\udfcf (@GlamCricket) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GlamCricket/status/1148531955643949056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 9, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d245dc08f08cf92bb76c2f3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-09T09:47:37.553Z\">10.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Start of play scores</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2><strong>D</strong><strong>ivision One</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Final day</strong><br><strong>Ageas Bowl:</strong> Hampshire 539 (Holland 143, Donald 173; Stone 5-93) and 178-8 dec (Donald 52) v Warwickshire 307 (Hain 129 not out) and 31-3 (Abbott 3-18)</p> <p><strong>Day three</strong></p> <p><strong>Chelmsford</strong>: Essex 328 (Westley 81) v <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire\">Yorkshire</a> 208 (Harmer 5-76) and 38-3 (Siddle 2-6)</p> <p><strong>Taunton</strong>: Somerset 326 (Davies 74; Wood 4-85) and 7-1 v Notts 241-9 (Bess 5-59)</p> <p><strong>The Oval:</strong> Surrey 271-9dec (Elgar 63, Foakes 60) v Kent 285-4 (Denly 88)</p> <p><strong>Division Two</strong></p> <p><strong>Grace Road: </strong>Leicestershire 212 (Horton 50, Ackermann 62 not out; Raine 4-49, Rushworth 5-55) v Durham 117 (Wright 5-30) and 191-1 (Bancroft 109)</p> <p><strong>Merchant Taylors\u2019</strong>: Middlesex 172 (Shaw 4-33) and 96-3 (Higgins 3-16) v Gloucestershire 201 (Roland-Jones 7-52)</p> <p><strong>Wantage Road: </strong>Northamptonshire 442 (Bavuma 103; Onions 5-77) v Lancashire 211-4 (Davies 124)</p> <p><strong>Kidderminster: </strong>Worcestershire 113 (Reece 4-30) v Derbyshire 108 (Morris 4-26) and 272-6 (Lace 101)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d244df78f0845f89e309641\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-09T09:47:34.206Z\">10.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning wherever you are</strong> - the hills of the Mendips, the terraces of overcast Manchester or popping in from somewhere more exotic, perhaps between drinks breaks at the New Zealand v India world cup game already underway at Old Trafford.

      "bodyText": "Jack Leach and Jamie Overton bowled Somerset to victory over Nottinghamshire, finishing with four wickets each, on a gripping third day at Taunton, and now perch on a 15-point lead at the top of the Championship. Nottinghamshire, set 255, were dismissed for 122, with only Ravi Ashwin stemming the tide with 41. Earlier Somerset themselves were bowled out for 169, with Azhar Ali (65 not out) the lone resistance. Liam Patterson-White on debut took five wickets, as did Ashwin. Essex had a brief period on top of the table after beating Yorkshire by eight wickets by mid-afternoon. They were set 92 to win, largely thanks to Keshav Maharaj, who walloped five sixes and seven fours in his 85 \u2013 the next highest score on the Yorkshire card was 16. Peter Siddle took four for 31. Essex have won all five of their home fixtures this summer. In an iron-clad rearguard action, Warwickshire held on for a draw by their fingertips against Hampshire thanks to a second century in the match from Sam Hain \u2013 a man who had not made a first-class hundred for three years. He was helped by 70s from Ben Mike and Jeetan Patel. Surrey were in trouble at the Oval, with a lead of just 81 over Kent and only four wickets in hand. In Division Two Middlesex beat Gloucestershire by 78 runs after bowling them out for 137. There were five wickets for Tim Murtagh, and three more for Toby Roland-Jones, who also top-scored in Middlesex\u2019s second innings to complete a pinch-yourself couple of days. A partnership of last resort by Callum Ferguson and Ben Cox frustrated Derbyshire at Kidderminster. The pair put on an unbeaten 108 from the depths of 48 for five. Worcestershire need an unlikely 217 more to win. A collapse of five for 25 against the new ball by Lancashire\u2019s tail did not help their position at Wantage Road. Northamptonshire then extracted themselves from 14 for three and a rampaging Graham Onions, to finish with a lead of 341. Durham found themselves in the unusual position of declaring with over 400 on the board against Leicestershire, with 90s from Alex Lees and nightwatchman Nathan Rimmington. What a day! Thanks so much for your company everyone and see you tomorrow for the remaining four games. Somerset inching closer... Goodnight! Well done Warwicks! Leach 4-42, Jamie Overton 4-24. Somerset hop back to the top! Warwickshire are nearly there, they\u2019ve nearly done it! Brookes and Patel hanging on - 319-8. I must write up now - keep watching for me. Make that 102 for seven. Jamie Overton gets in on the act. Poor Ben Duckett after walking out at No.7, hitting a four and a six, is gone for 13. And a fourth - Ravi Ashwin for 41. Notts now entering the UP section of the Notts-up - 102/6. A third for Jack Leach! Samit Patel caught at slip for one. Notts 85 for five. Shaun Clapperton: I agree. And the poor girl will not be able to put this chapter behind her so easily. I hope if one good thing comes from this case it is a jolt to sportsmen everywhere not to believe their own hype and to treat women as human beings. However humans are capable of changing. I hope he grows up fast, learns, and turns it around. Yorkshire endure their second loss of the year. Essex leap to the top of the Division One table, seven points in front of Somerset - whose game is still underway. Notts rebuilding with Ravi Ashwin (24) and Mr Fix-it Steven Mullaney (9). I can\u2019t remember if I wrote this yesterday but just realised that Joe Clarke has been dropped for this game. Seems the right thing to do for him to get his head right. This is his statement from the disciplinary hearing last week: \u201cWith the CDC proceedings completed I would like to apologise to everyone concerned for my involvement in the WhatsApp group,\u201d he said. \u201cI acknowledge that what I did fell well below the standards expected of a professional sportsman. I am relieved I can now put this chapter behind me. I am extremely grateful for the guidance and support I have received from the PCA, Phoenix Management and Nottinghamshire CCC during this difficult time. \u201cI have learned a great deal over the past two years and I am thankful that I can now move forward and focus wholly on the rest of the season. I hope I can end the year on a positive note with Notts.\u201d Leicestershire need 393 to win. Twenty overs left tonight. I really don\u2019t want to say I told you so. TRJ takes another . Four overs two for three. And a second for Helm. Gloucestershire falling apart at the seams, zip and buttons. 46-7. A triple Murtagh at Merchant Taylors: Dent for 0, Hammond for 16, Bracey for 15. Helm gets Roderick. And TRJ has bowled three overs for three runs. It\u2019s in the air, we know it\u2019s in the air. And there it is ! Howell bowled for one! Gloucs 40-5 and Middx on their way. Ah for shame, the Warwicks defence is crumbling with the end in sight. Hain gone, his second hundred of the match under his belt before being bowled by Felix Organ*. Ben Mike dismissed too, but not before gathering his first first-class half century. Warwicks 233-8 and a session to go. * Here\u2019s Vic chatting away in Taunton. Notts have a way to go at 36 for 3. Leach and Jamie Overton with the ball. In answer to the question BTL, about Saqib Mahmood, the only thing I\u2019ve been able to glean is that he did not take the field after lunch. Will update when I know more. Abhijato Sensarma hurls a hand grenade into my email box: There\u2019s is no fair way to justify your answer to this question, but I\u2019ve got to enquire nonetheless: is Ravi Ashwin currently the best first-class cricketer in the world? Over to you. Division One Final day Ageas Bowl: Hampshire 539 (Holland 143, Donald 173; Stone 5-93) and 178-8 dec (Donald 52) v Warwickshire 307 (Hain 129 not out) and 223-6 (Hain 102 not out; Abbott 5-46). Warwicks need 171 to win. Day three Chelmsford: Essex 328 (Westley 81) and 34-1 v Yorkshire 208 (Harmer 5-76) and 211 (Siddle 4-32, Harmer 3-72). Essex need 58 to win. Taunton: Somerset 326 (Davies 74; Wood 4-85) and 169 (Azhar 36 not out; Ashwin 4-39) v Notts 241-9 (Bess 5-59) and 36-3. Notts need 219 to win The Oval: Surrey 271-9dec (Elgar 63, Foakes 60) and 90-1 v Kent 369 (Denly 88) Division Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 212 (Horton 50, Ackermann 62 not out; Raine 4-49, Rushworth 5-55) v Durham 117 (Wright 5-30) and 423-6 (Bancroft 109, Lees 93). Durham lead by 328 runs. Merchant Taylors\u2019: Middlesex 172 (Shaw 4-33) and 171-7 (Higgins 4-20) v Gloucestershire 201 (Roland-Jones 7-52)and 35-3. Gloucs need 181 to win. Wantage Road: Northamptonshire 442 (Bavuma 103; Onions 5-77) and 95-3 v Lancashire 315 (Davies 147; Sanderson 4-62). Northants lead by 222. Kidderminster: Worcestershire 113 (Reece 4-30) and 65-5 v Derbyshire 108 (Morris 4-26) and 377 (Lace 132 not out; Barnard 4-48). Derby lead by 372. I\u2019m tip-toeing around this so please don\u2019t shout but Hain and Mike have put on a hundred now. And Hain is just six runs away from his second you know what in the match. Jack Leach readjusts his specs and Slater prods at him, straight to short leg. Notts 21/2 Tim Murtagh takes a wicket first ball! Chris Dent for 0. Some Jack Leach bowling somewhere sunny. Not quite sure what Worcestershire are doing at 41-3, needing another 332 to win. I won\u2019t be sent to New Road unless they get into the promotion chase. So selfish. Yorkshire are all out! Essex need 92 to win. At Taunton Jack Leach and Lewis Gregory share the new ball. Leach adjusts his specs and with his first ball has Libby lbw for a duck. A golden duck. That\u2019s the Libby who was top scorer in Nottinghamshire\u2019s first innings. Strange times. Presumably Durham will bat all day if they can? Clark and Trevaskis in now - 374-5. Goodness! Ro-Jo! An unbeaten fifty to go with yesterday\u2019s best bowling. Top scorer for Middlesex, who now have a lead of 212 with one wicket in hand. Maharaj falls. Siddle has four. Yorkshire are 208-9. The air leaks out from the party balloon A sensational partnership of 71 at the Rose Bowl - Sam Hain on 74 not out, Ben Mike 50 not out. They\u2019ve inched Warwicks to within 230 of Hampshire - and under two sessions till the final close. Ignore what I said about the rain - it is steadily sloughing down now out of my window. . So. Notts need 225 to win. They\u2019ve got a chance - haven\u2019t they? Ravi Ashwin 5-59; Patterson-White 5-73. Azhar Ali celebrates his (170 ball) fifty at Taunton, a scoresheet which contains seven single-figures scores. Maharaj has now hit five sixes and seven fours in his 77 not out. Duanne, Ben, Keshav - what can you work with - 100? Yorks lead currently 56. Oh dear. Northants 22 for 3. First-innings centurion Bavuma out for a duck. What is it with the pitches or the batsmen this round? Feast or famine. Double cone with flake, or Mr Man lolly from the back of the freezer. Jamie Overton mullers a six that almost clears the river; as Maharaj does the same to Simon Harmer. And for those interested, I live about two miles from Old Trafford and the rain has stopped. No!!! Nightwatchman Nathan Rimmington becomes the second Durham batsman to fall in the nineties. The lead is laughably big now though - 255 with seven wickets remaining. And a lazy afternoon\u2019s peace at Wantage Road is ruined by Graham Onions, who has both Levi and Vasconcelos lbw in the same over. Northants 13/2. Yorkshire are sinking. Patterson caught by Cook off Porter. 145 for 8, a lead of 25. Liam Patterson-White stretches, rubs his tummy with a satisfied gleam in his eye, and snatches a fourth wicket. Somerset 118/8 lead by 203. Azhar still there on 40. Division One Final day Ageas Bowl: Hampshire 539 (Holland 143, Donald 173; Stone 5-93) and 178-8 dec (Donald 52) v Warwickshire 307 (Hain 129 not out) and 119-6 (Hain 61 not out; Abbott 5-35). Warwicks need 285 to win. Day three Chelmsford: Essex 328 (Westley 81) v Yorkshire 208 (Harmer 5-76) and 116-7 (Siddle 3-17, Harmer 3-29). Yorkshire trail by four runs. Taunton: Somerset 326 (Davies 74; Wood 4-85) and 108-6 (Azhar 36 not out; Ashwin 4-39) v Notts 241-9 (Bess 5-59). Somerset lead by 193. The Oval: Surrey 271-9dec (Elgar 63, Foakes 60) and 4-0 v Kent 369 (Denly 88) Division Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 212 (Horton 50, Ackermann 62 not out; Raine 4-49, Rushworth 5-55) v Durham 117 (Wright 5-30) and 309-2 (Bancroft 109, Lees 93). Durham lead by 214 runs. Merchant Taylors\u2019: Middlesex 172 (Shaw 4-33) and 171-7 (Higgins 4-20) v Gloucestershire 201 (Roland-Jones 7-52) Wantage Road: Northamptonshire 442 (Bavuma 103; Onions 5-77) v Lancashire 315 (Davies 147; Sanderson 4-62). Northants lead by 127. Kidderminster: Worcestershire 113 (Reece 4-30) v Derbyshire 108 (Morris 4-26) and 377 (Lace 132 not out; Barnard 4-48). Derby lead by 372. New Zealand taking their time against India - but Williamson is still there. Time for marmite on toast and half an hour in the company of Rob Smyth. Lunch scores to follow. Warwickshire and Yorkshire are mapping each other\u2019s progress today. Warwickshire 106 for six, in the hopeless chase of another 298. Yorkshire 110 for seven, still trail Essex by ten. Kent are all out! With a lead of 98. Three wickets each for Rikki Clarke and Sam Curran. Five sessions left...um, ah, perhaps they can make a game of this. Here\u2019s the live stream from Taunton: And a big belated hand for Al Davies, bowled for 147 and Croft for 78, as Keogh and Sanderson continue to divide the wickets between them. The wickets they are a-tumbling at Taunton. three for Ashwin and two for Patterson-White. Somerset 80 for five, with only Azhar on 29 left of the top five batsmen. A lead of 167 doesn\u2019t seem quite enough. So...the Leeds Superchargers will now be known as the Northern Superchargers, so as not to irritate Durham.But they will wear blue and yellow to craftily show their Leeds heritage without any Durham supporters guessing. Which is a little bit like Boris Johnson loudly pointing that we have to pretend to prepare for No Deal so those clueless bureaucrats in Brussels will be fooled. Read more here. A wicket at Taunton! A second for Ashwin - Abell for 24. Somerset are 56-2, a lead of 141. Tattersall and Fisher have put on 18 as Yorkshire look towards the sunny uplands of three figures - 78-5. Abbott collects a five-fer as Warwickshire rather crumble. Will they make it till lunch? There is a certain weariness to their batting - 68-5. Sam Hain starting where he left off in the first innings - 31 not out. Lancashire laughing in the face of yesterday\u2019s 2/2: Davies 136 and Croft 60. George Scott follows Malan back to matron for school dinners. Now 117 for five, a lead of not very much, but possibly nearly enough in a game where the top score is 201. And Durham bat on, and on, and on. 221 for 1 - a lead of 126. Do any Durham fans have feedback on Bancroft\u2019s captaincy or how he\u2019s settled in? He\u2019s certainly found his batting mojo in the last few games. Sorry about the delay, note to self, charge computer before starting work and/or ensure you know where the plug is. In the meantime, Bumrah is being Bumrah at OT; Abbott has grabbed a fourth at against Hampshire (52-4). And Yorkshire are on the slide at Chelmsford. Adam Lyth\u2019s 104-minute vigil for 8 finished by Jamie Porter, and Harry Brook a wicket for Siddle. Sam Curran has taken two wickets in two over at The Oval - Stewart and Kuhn, Kent - 301 for six a lead of 30. An early wicket for Ed Barnard at Kidderminster, and now one for Joe Leach. Derby lose a couple straight away - 277-8, but Tom Lace is still there. And Dawid Malan gone too, for 8, as Middlesex slump to 97-4. I wonder how Toby Roland-Jones is feeling this morning. Hope he\u2019s walking on pink fluffy air. This is what Nick Pothas said last night: \u201cPeople look at the wickets and presume Toby has found his mojo. That actually started happening in Derby last week where in the second innings that zip was back. Toby has had a lot of catches dropped off him, but he has stayed so positive and is such a level individual. He is one of those blokes where everyone is ecstatic when he does well, so we are over the moon.\u201d And this might be of interest to Glamorgan fans. Division One Final day Ageas Bowl: Hampshire 539 (Holland 143, Donald 173; Stone 5-93) and 178-8 dec (Donald 52) v Warwickshire 307 (Hain 129 not out) and 31-3 (Abbott 3-18) Day three Chelmsford: Essex 328 (Westley 81) v Yorkshire 208 (Harmer 5-76) and 38-3 (Siddle 2-6) Taunton: Somerset 326 (Davies 74; Wood 4-85) and 7-1 v Notts 241-9 (Bess 5-59) The Oval: Surrey 271-9dec (Elgar 63, Foakes 60) v Kent 285-4 (Denly 88) Division Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 212 (Horton 50, Ackermann 62 not out; Raine 4-49, Rushworth 5-55) v Durham 117 (Wright 5-30) and 191-1 (Bancroft 109) Merchant Taylors\u2019: Middlesex 172 (Shaw 4-33) and 96-3 (Higgins 3-16) v Gloucestershire 201 (Roland-Jones 7-52) Wantage Road: Northamptonshire 442 (Bavuma 103; Onions 5-77) v Lancashire 211-4 (Davies 124) Kidderminster: Worcestershire 113 (Reece 4-30) v Derbyshire 108 (Morris 4-26) and 272-6 (Lace 101) Good morning wherever you are - the hills of the Mendips, the terraces of overcast Manchester or popping in from somewhere more exotic, perhaps between drinks breaks at the New Zealand v India world cup game already underway at Old Trafford. New Zealand have won the toss and are batting - as I write this they haven\u2019t lost a wicket...Rob Smyth will talk you through every over, brilliantly, here. Back in CCLive!, there is much to look forward to - I\u2019m particularly intrigued by early goings on at Taunton, the Rose Bowl and Chelmsford. Two bits of overnight news: Mike Yardy will leave his position as Sussex Cricket\u2019s 2nd XI &amp; batting coach at the end of July to join New South Wales Blues as batting coach. And Samit Patel has come in as a batting replacement for Chris Nash, knocked on the head by Jamie Overton yesterday. Get well soon!",

No one can have confidence that the process is fair, independent of the leadership or, most importantly of all, that it reflects the values of the party. Today we saw three Labour peers quit over the handling of antisemitism cases. A disciplinary process that regards antisemitism as an appalling evil that has to be rooted out could not have concluded that the correct way to deal with Chris Williamson was let him back into the party with a reprimand \u2013 and without referring the case to a full disciplinary hearing \u2013 despite his claims that Labour had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about antisemitism in the party.

Campbell\u2019s expulsion is not an issue of antisemitism \u2013 but seeing how swiftly the party acted there shows what could have been done in the antisemitism cases if the will and determination were there. My horror that Labour was not dealing with antisemitism properly led me in recent months to seek to make the party\u2019s disciplinary process work fairly, independently of the leadership and in a way which reflected our values.

It hasn\u2019t been \u201cnon-contact\u201d for years. It\u2019s inevitable the way such strength is adjudicated by neutral umpires, who aren\u2019t used to the brute force displayed in the big leagues, will become a talking point. If players accustomed to a high level of physicality don\u2019t adjust in Liverpool, they\u2019ll give up too many penalties \u2013 which may tip the balance in a tight contest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/06/eboni-usoro-brown-netball-world-cup-england-undergog-favourites\">Eboni Usoro-Brown: \u2018We go into the World Cup as underdog favourites\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>2) Roses in a pressure cooker</h2> <p>As reigning Commonwealth champions, hosts England have never been under so much pressure. The former England international and UK Superleague coach Tamsin Greenway says the English public expect the Roses to win. \u201cThe team is coming into this tournament confidently,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they think they\u2019re better than everybody, but they\u2019re favourites and they should be.\u201d How the squad, captained by 90-Test veteran Serena Guthrie, handles that pressure will define it for years to come.</p> <h2>3) Beware the wounded Kiwi</h2> <p>While many expect a Diamonds v Roses final, the Silver Ferns shouldn\u2019t be discounted. Noeline Taurua has picked one of the most experienced New Zealand sides to contest a World Cup. Her team boasts 781 Tests of experience: a staggering 443 more international games than Australia. With more than 100 caps each, Maria Folau, Casey Kopua, Laura Langman and Katrina Rore will need to step up if the four-times world champions are to redeem their embarrassing Commonwealth Games performance, where they missed a medal for the first time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5e057fce27a8f443ab3dab735148351b326e3ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5e057fce27a8f443ab3dab735148351b326e3ac/0_75_3216_1930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Serena Guthrie will captain hosts England in Liverpool\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Serena Guthrie will captain hosts England in Liverpool</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel French/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) Blowtorch on Bassett</h2> <p>To say Caitlin Bassett carries pressure into Liverpool is a gargantuan understatement.

      "bodyText": "1) The role physicality will play \u2026 or not In the world\u2019s top leagues \u2013 in Australia, New Zealand and England \u2013 netball has reached a new level of power and physicality. It hasn\u2019t been \u201cnon-contact\u201d for years. It\u2019s inevitable the way such strength is adjudicated by neutral umpires, who aren\u2019t used to the brute force displayed in the big leagues, will become a talking point. If players accustomed to a high level of physicality don\u2019t adjust in Liverpool, they\u2019ll give up too many penalties \u2013 which may tip the balance in a tight contest. 2) Roses in a pressure cooker As reigning Commonwealth champions, hosts England have never been under so much pressure. The former England international and UK Superleague coach Tamsin Greenway says the English public expect the Roses to win. \u201cThe team is coming into this tournament confidently,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they think they\u2019re better than everybody, but they\u2019re favourites and they should be.\u201d How the squad, captained by 90-Test veteran Serena Guthrie, handles that pressure will define it for years to come. 3) Beware the wounded Kiwi While many expect a Diamonds v Roses final, the Silver Ferns shouldn\u2019t be discounted. Noeline Taurua has picked one of the most experienced New Zealand sides to contest a World Cup. Her team boasts 781 Tests of experience: a staggering 443 more international games than Australia. With more than 100 caps each, Maria Folau, Casey Kopua, Laura Langman and Katrina Rore will need to step up if the four-times world champions are to redeem their embarrassing Commonwealth Games performance, where they missed a medal for the first time. 4) Blowtorch on Bassett To say Caitlin Bassett carries pressure into Liverpool is a gargantuan understatement. The 193cm shooter is the most experienced Diamond, captain and the side\u2019s main route to goal. She\u2019s also coming back from an injury \u2013 and isn\u2019t in scintillating form. The 31-year-old fractured her forearm in January and has lacked consistency since. Greenway says the Diamonds team heaps expectation on Bassett. \u201cShe\u2019ll be feeling that. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how she responds.\u201d 5) Jamaica\u2019s depleted shooting stocks Jamaica typically has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to tall shooters, but this year they will have to rely heavily on their 198cm captain, Jhaniele Fowler, to hold down goal shooter. The 29-year-old, who has several niggling injuries, will have limited backup from 198cm Romelda Aiken, who is returning from bone stress to her tibia, while Shimona Nelson is out injured. The young goal attack Shanice Beckford is a genuine star, especially from distance, but there will still be plenty riding on Fowler\u2019s broad shoulders. 6) Gretel\u2019s moment to shine? Netball\u2019s most polarising figure, the Australian shooter Gretel Tippett, might just silence her critics with a breakout performance. Tippett \u2013 who came to the game late after playing high-level basketball as a junior \u2013 tends to elicit a strong response from fans, who call the 26-year-old everything from reckless to arrogant for her unorthodox style, physicality and \u201clay-up\u201d.

The side know it and their coach, Norma Plummer, knows it. Hopes are high because six of the Proteas play in Australia, and others in England and New Zealand. For Plummer, who took the reins before the 2015 World Cup, that means her side can mix it with the finest. While she is \u201cquietly confident\u201d, the captain Bongiwe Msomi is more emphatic: \u201cWe are going for a medal.\u201d 8) A fitting farewell for a Mentor In the dictionary, next to big-game player, there may as well be a picture of the England goalkeeper Geva Mentor, who first represented her country aged 16 in 2001 and was pivotal in the Roses\u2019 Commonwealth glory.

      "bodyText": "Australian gulls are carrying superbugs resistant to antibiotics, raising fears that disease-causing bacteria may spread from the birds to humans, livestock and pets. A team of scientists led by researchers at Perth\u2019s Murdoch University found more than 20% of silver gulls nationwide were carrying pathogenic bacteria, such as E coli, that are resistant to drugs. E coli can cause urinary tract infections, life-threatening sepsis and meningitis. Dr Sam Abraham, a lecturer in veterinary and medical infectious diseases at the university, said the \u201ceye-opening\u201d study should be a wake-up call for Australian governments. \u201cWhat we found was, regardless of the state, the gull population in Australia are carriers of superbugs, or antimicrobial resistant bacteria, that cause infection in humans,\u201d Abraham said. \u201cThese are the ones that are resistant to drugs of importance to human health, that is where our initial concerns are.\u201d Globally, antimicrobial resistance has risen to \u201cdangerously high levels\u201d and it is one of the biggest threats to health and food security, according to the World Health Organisation and the Australian federal government. The bacteria can spread to humans if they accidentally ingest them after touching seagull faeces. A Murdoch University veterinary virologist, Mark O\u2019Dea, said children could be exposed if they touched their mouths or ate after playing on grass or rocks where seagulls had been, but the risk could be eliminated by hand washing, Abraham said: \u201cThe birds are a potential for this to move and we don\u2019t know exactly how it\u2019s going to move.\u201d Some gull faeces in the study contained bugs resistant to last-resort medicines, such as carbapenems, which are used to treat antimicrobial-resistant infections. One bird at Cottesloe Beach in Perth was found to be resistant to the drug colistin, which is the last antibiotic treatment option after all else has failed. A spokesman from the federal health department said gulls were not part of existing antibiotic-resistance monitoring because the risk of transmission from the birds to humans had not been established. \u201cThe department in general is concerned about the spread of bacteria resistant to antimicrobial agents, no matter the mechanism,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cHowever, the specific mechanism of seagulls acting as a reservoir for bacteria resistant to antimicrobial agents after feeding on human household waste is a matter for other government sectors including state, territory and local government authorities. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been found in gulls and other birds in several countries, which in some cases have implicated the link with household waste. In 2010, Portuguese researchers found yellow-legged caspian gulls carrying bugs resistant to the common antibiotic vancomycin. Since then, resistant bacteria have been found in gull species in France, Russia, Greenland, Siberia and Alaska, and in 2016 colistin resistant pathogens were found in pig intestines. Resistance to colistin has never before been seen in Australian wildlife. The Murdoch study, which involved government agriculture scientists and examined the droppings of 562 silver gulls at densely populated coastal areas between 2015 and 2017, was published on Wednesday in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Gulls range as far as 1,600km from their hatchery, and O\u2019Dea said it was feared superbugs might \u201cleapfrog\u201d through other bird species that would then travel to farming regions. \u201cThe other thing that we are worried about and that we want to investigate more is the potential of gulls to spread superbugs to areas where they haven\u2019t previously been,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we wouldn\u2019t like to see happen is these types of bacteria move into food animals or pets. We don\u2019t have any proof that it is being moved into anything else by the gulls, but it is certainly something that needs to be looked at.\u201d Despite typically feeding from the ocean, gulls living in cities were picking up the superbugs as they scavenged at waste treatment plants and through bins and tips filled with soiled nappies and incontinence pads, Abraham said. Australia uses 3.75m disposable nappies every day \u2013 making up a significant proportion of household waste going to landfill. \u201cI think that it is a wake-up call for all government and various agencies, like water treatment and big councils that manage waste, to properly work collaboratively to tackle this issue,\u201d Abraham said. The Local Government Association said the issue of birds and disease was handled according to environmental policy. \u201cManagement plans are in place to minimise these risks ... and can include covering the waste or implementing bird-scaring mechanisms to keep them away,\u201d said the president of the WA Local Government Association, Lynne Craigie.",

      "body": "<p>Many are saying 2019 was Labor\u2019s 1993, the year John Hewson lost the \u201cunloseable\u201d election against Paul Keating. It\u2019s not an unfair comparison. The massive policy agenda the ALP presented did make it a barn door for scare campaign ammunition.</p> <p>The trap to be wary of, however, is thinking Labor can pull off a 1996. A conservative, small-target strategy won\u2019t work for Labor like it worked for John Howard. Yet the temptation to try a 96 strategy will be strong.</p> <p>The Morrison government is a husk. It is completely devoid of ideas, intellect and integrity. Deep tribal faultlines run through it. Now the economic waters have turned choppy.</p> <p>As the government\u2019s popularity inevitably wanes, a small target, tactical approach will look very appealing.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure it looked appealing in 1998 where the prevailing wisdom held that Labor could surf the GST to victory. Or again in 2001 where there was little policy to rely on when the Tampa steamed over the horizon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/07/labor-cant-appear-to-ignore-economic-wellbeing-over-ideological-values\">Labor can't appear to ignore economic wellbeing over ideological values | David Hetherington</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Federal Labor has never won from opposition by simply offering relief from unpopular government. The only way Labor wins is by connecting a suite of progressive policy proposals to a unifying vision that makes politically disengaged voters feel two things: hope and ambition. That\u2019s what Whitlam, Hawke and Rudd all did.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Federal Labor has never won from opposition by simply offering relief from unpopular government</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s is a tough path, but it\u2019s the only one that leads to victory.</p> <p>Conservative parties, especially those in government, have an easier option: fear. Conservatives can win by convincing voters to feel defensive and worried.</p> <p>This year Labor tried to counter that by beating off the scare campaigns with a weighty binder full of policies.</p> <p>It was largely ineffective, because the only really effectively way to counter fear is with clarity of purpose. Labor needs to paint a picture of the future vivid enough that people can see themselves and their kids in it.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean being heroically bold. Indeed, there are serious pragmatic arguments against this approach.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s historic legacy of a dynamic open economy, quality education, a massive middle class, a huge pool of comfortable retirees, universal healthcare and decent industrial protections means the struggling working-class constituency that reliably backed the party for a century just isn\u2019t what it used to be.</p> <p>Revolutions are only popular when people feel they have nothing much to lose. But Australians who have spent the last few decades latching on to the first few rungs of the middle class are wary of broad sweeping calls to \u201cchange the rules\u201d or attacks on the \u201ctop end of town\u201d.</p> <p>They might not be content but they are relatively comfortable. They look at an unpredictable future and feel they have more to lose than they dream to gain. This is why Labor\u2019s campaign theme of inequality may have failed to cut through.</p> <p>Of course, anyone even vaguely across the detail would know Labor was hardly proposing an aggressive program of wealth redistribution. But the top-line messages are what stick. And while most would agree that fighting inequality sounds good for society, the question voters fundamentally ask themselves is: would it be good for me and mine?</p> <p>For those at the upper end of society the equation is a little different.</p> <p>This group are now so used to winning economically, and winning handsomely, that they can afford to be magnanimous and ponder the big picture. Labor\u2019s fair and rational approach is resonating better with this well-educated end of society than ever before.</p> <p>But our brand is losing those in the bottom half, partly to a rabble of nasty populist shysters selling the same basic scapegoating that demagogues have spruiked for centuries.</p> <p>So how does Labor win them back? How can constituencies of blue-collar families be forged without losing the educated, urbanised middle class? If focusing strongly on inequality is not the answer \u2013 what is?</p> <p>Labor doesn\u2019t actually need to look beyond its own legacy. Because the Australian labour movement was built not on equality, but egalitarianism.</p> <p>It\u2019s a subtle, but crucial difference. The \u201cfair go\u201d has always distinguished our progressive tradition by focusing not on pure equality, but equality of opportunity.</p> <p>Social mobility is the key to linking our vision for Australia with individual ambition. It tells everyone that regardless of your postcode, your faith or your parents, Australia will give you a fair shot.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The morality of redistribution itself is not what Labor should hang a lantern on</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is not the lazy laissez-faire model of individualism offered by conservatives. It\u2019s about promoting real options to exercise individual choice, instead of mere statutory rights.</p> <p>That means better education and training, better medical coverage, stronger wages, boosted infrastructure and tougher safety nets.</p> <p>And, yes, progressive tax measures will be necessary to fund these programs. But the morality of redistribution itself is not what Labor should hang a lantern on. The aspect that should be pushed forward is the opportunity.</p> <p>For those on the bottom rungs of society, Labor promises a way up. For those closer to the top there is a promise to elevate the whole ladder. And for business Labor must promise not a race to the bottom on tax rates but a beautifully functioning society so the best talent is drawn to Australia.</p> <p>A strong focus on social mobility gives people the capacity to feel ambitious, and that ambition leads to confidence. None of this requires a backflip in policy terms. It\u2019s a question of how Labor tells its story.</p> <p>And it gives Labor an excuse to display a quality its members sometimes shy away from: patriotism.</p> <p>Real patriotism is not about chanting you\u2019re the best over and over again. It is not about pretending that Australians have some unique claim on mateship, or toughness, or barbecuing. Real patriotism is about aspiring for Australia to actually be the best.</p> <p>We don\u2019t have the best education system in the world, but why shouldn\u2019t we? We don\u2019t have the best early childhood care in the world, but why not? We don\u2019t have the best public health system in the world, but we\u2019re damn close and could get there. We have the some of the best scientists in the world, so why not the best inventions?</p> <p>Paul Keating noted that \u201cwe are the people who dream the big dreams and do the big things\u201d. That\u2019s true. But in order to achieve the latter we need to romance the electorate into dreaming with us.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Sam Crosby is the chief executive of the McKell Institute and the author of <a href=\"https://www.mup.com.au/items/164858\">The Trust Deficit</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Many are saying 2019 was Labor\u2019s 1993, the year John Hewson lost the \u201cunloseable\u201d election against Paul Keating. It\u2019s not an unfair comparison. The massive policy agenda the ALP presented did make it a barn door for scare campaign ammunition. The trap to be wary of, however, is thinking Labor can pull off a 1996. A conservative, small-target strategy won\u2019t work for Labor like it worked for John Howard. Yet the temptation to try a 96 strategy will be strong. The Morrison government is a husk. It is completely devoid of ideas, intellect and integrity. Deep tribal faultlines run through it. Now the economic waters have turned choppy. As the government\u2019s popularity inevitably wanes, a small target, tactical approach will look very appealing. I\u2019m sure it looked appealing in 1998 where the prevailing wisdom held that Labor could surf the GST to victory. Or again in 2001 where there was little policy to rely on when the Tampa steamed over the horizon. Federal Labor has never won from opposition by simply offering relief from unpopular government. The only way Labor wins is by connecting a suite of progressive policy proposals to a unifying vision that makes politically disengaged voters feel two things: hope and ambition. That\u2019s what Whitlam, Hawke and Rudd all did. It\u2019s is a tough path, but it\u2019s the only one that leads to victory. Conservative parties, especially those in government, have an easier option: fear. Conservatives can win by convincing voters to feel defensive and worried. This year Labor tried to counter that by beating off the scare campaigns with a weighty binder full of policies. It was largely ineffective, because the only really effectively way to counter fear is with clarity of purpose. Labor needs to paint a picture of the future vivid enough that people can see themselves and their kids in it. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean being heroically bold. Indeed, there are serious pragmatic arguments against this approach. Labor\u2019s historic legacy of a dynamic open economy, quality education, a massive middle class, a huge pool of comfortable retirees, universal healthcare and decent industrial protections means the struggling working-class constituency that reliably backed the party for a century just isn\u2019t what it used to be. Revolutions are only popular when people feel they have nothing much to lose. But Australians who have spent the last few decades latching on to the first few rungs of the middle class are wary of broad sweeping calls to \u201cchange the rules\u201d or attacks on the \u201ctop end of town\u201d. They might not be content but they are relatively comfortable. They look at an unpredictable future and feel they have more to lose than they dream to gain. This is why Labor\u2019s campaign theme of inequality may have failed to cut through. Of course, anyone even vaguely across the detail would know Labor was hardly proposing an aggressive program of wealth redistribution. But the top-line messages are what stick. And while most would agree that fighting inequality sounds good for society, the question voters fundamentally ask themselves is: would it be good for me and mine? For those at the upper end of society the equation is a little different. This group are now so used to winning economically, and winning handsomely, that they can afford to be magnanimous and ponder the big picture. Labor\u2019s fair and rational approach is resonating better with this well-educated end of society than ever before. But our brand is losing those in the bottom half, partly to a rabble of nasty populist shysters selling the same basic scapegoating that demagogues have spruiked for centuries. So how does Labor win them back? How can constituencies of blue-collar families be forged without losing the educated, urbanised middle class? If focusing strongly on inequality is not the answer \u2013 what is? Labor doesn\u2019t actually need to look beyond its own legacy. Because the Australian labour movement was built not on equality, but egalitarianism. It\u2019s a subtle, but crucial difference. The \u201cfair go\u201d has always distinguished our progressive tradition by focusing not on pure equality, but equality of opportunity. Social mobility is the key to linking our vision for Australia with individual ambition. It tells everyone that regardless of your postcode, your faith or your parents, Australia will give you a fair shot. This is not the lazy laissez-faire model of individualism offered by conservatives. It\u2019s about promoting real options to exercise individual choice, instead of mere statutory rights. That means better education and training, better medical coverage, stronger wages, boosted infrastructure and tougher safety nets. And, yes, progressive tax measures will be necessary to fund these programs. But the morality of redistribution itself is not what Labor should hang a lantern on. The aspect that should be pushed forward is the opportunity. For those on the bottom rungs of society, Labor promises a way up. For those closer to the top there is a promise to elevate the whole ladder. And for business Labor must promise not a race to the bottom on tax rates but a beautifully functioning society so the best talent is drawn to Australia. A strong focus on social mobility gives people the capacity to feel ambitious, and that ambition leads to confidence. None of this requires a backflip in policy terms. It\u2019s a question of how Labor tells its story. And it gives Labor an excuse to display a quality its members sometimes shy away from: patriotism. Real patriotism is not about chanting you\u2019re the best over and over again. It is not about pretending that Australians have some unique claim on mateship, or toughness, or barbecuing. Real patriotism is about aspiring for Australia to actually be the best. We don\u2019t have the best education system in the world, but why shouldn\u2019t we? We don\u2019t have the best early childhood care in the world, but why not? We don\u2019t have the best public health system in the world, but we\u2019re damn close and could get there. We have the some of the best scientists in the world, so why not the best inventions? Paul Keating noted that \u201cwe are the people who dream the big dreams and do the big things\u201d. That\u2019s true. But in order to achieve the latter we need to romance the electorate into dreaming with us. \u2022 Sam Crosby is the chief executive of the McKell Institute and the author of The Trust Deficit",

The largest contract awarded since the 2016 election is a $230m deal with Adecco Australia to employ 1,000 staff for Centrelink compliance activities, followed by a $226m contract to recruitment giant Chandler Macleod. More than $400m has been spent in the past year on the privatising of call centres, with Stellar Asia Pacific the largest beneficiary with a $135m contract, followed by Concentrix Services ($132m), Datacom Connect ($120m) and Serco Citizen Services ($36m). But tender documents show the department has contracted external labour through more than 350 individual contracts, bringing the total cost to $1.03bn in just three years. Labor\u2019s acting shadow minister for government services, Linda Burney, said the level of outsourcing was \u201cextreme, unnecessary and comes at the expense of services for pensioners and vulnerable Australians\u201d. \u201cCuts and outsourcing have impacted services to such an extent that pensioners are now telling me they are being turned away from Centrelink offices by private security guards, instead of being helped,\u201d Burney told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s gone too far. Pensioners and others in the social security system deserve respect and dignity.\u201d According to the Community and Public Sector Union, the surging cost of external labour hire has come about because of a decision made in the 2015- 2016 budget to put in place a cap on public-sector numbers which mandated a staff freeze at 2007 levels or below. The policy only applies to public-sector staff, with private-sector staff engaged externally not counted. The CPSU\u2019s deputy secretary, Melissa Donnelly, suggested the measure had backfired, with the \u201cartificially low\u201d staffing levels now at Centrelink, Medicare and child support leading the department to employ more staff externally. \u201cAt the same time, the sky is the limit when it comes to spending on contractors, consultants, outsourcing and privatisation,\u201d Donnelly said. \u201cIn practice what this means is agencies have no choice but to spend money on labour hire workers as they can\u2019t directly hire the staff they need.\u201d The union says that since late 2017 there has been a \u201csignificant escalation in the use of labour hire\u201d, with workers undertaking work that was previously done by ongoing employees. The union says there are now 2,750 private contract call centre staff working for Centrelink as a result of the privatisation push. Donnelly also raised concern that the labour hire workers who were doing the same work as departmental employees had fewer rights and conditions, and cost the taxpayer more. \u201cThese workers are often on inferior wages and conditions to the people next to them doing the same work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a lose-lose situation. The labour hire companies charge the department a premium to supply employees, so it costs taxpayers more overall and the individual labour hire workers are worse off than if they were properly employed by the department.\u201d The Department of Human Services general manager, Hank Jongen, said the contracts reflected the government\u2019s commitment to \u201cextra resources\u201d, which would make it easier for Australians to access Centrelink services. \u201cOur use of labour hire is nothing new \u2013 for many years, we\u2019ve engaged contractors for specialist services and to support day-to-day operations to help fill our short term needs,\u201d he said. \u201cOperating on such a significant scale requires a blended workforce model, including the use of contractors and outsourced providers, to give us the flexibility needed to respond to changes in service demand and budget priorities. \u201cThese workers complement our staff. They are not a replacement.\u201d He said the labour hire staff received the same training as the core workforce, which together handled more than $173bn in payments and more than 3.3m social security and welfare claims a year. The minister for government services, Stuart Robert, referred questions about the outsourcing to the department.",

For a team with little success in the past four years the decision to make very few changes and bank on experience is interesting. Fortunately they have been blessed with a kind draw, which means they will be unlikely to come up against South Africa. With only Australia and a depleted Malawi to trouble them, they are almost guaranteed a place in the semi-finals. While it is never wise to write off a Noeline Taurua-coached team, they will need to get a lot out of their battle-worn lineup in order to finish with a medal.</p> <p><strong>Key player: </strong>Laura Langman can turn New Zealand\u2019s form around.

After recording a historic win against New Zealand at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, they looked to have the capability to crack the top four.

Despite the loss, the closeness of the margin taught them they are within a whisker of being the world\u2019s best and they will be desperate to prove it. With talent all over the court, including four players who compete in Australia\u2019s Super Netball league, they are a serious threat. But a lack of combinations among their key players may hurt them and they will need to be at their best to have a chance of toppling Australia or England. If they can get quality ball into the shooter Jhaniele Fowler they will be hard to stop.</p> <p><strong>Key player: </strong>Shamera Sterling has been the talk of Australia\u2019s Super Netball and her ability to pull off amazing intercepts will be vital for Jamaica.</p> <p><strong>Prediction:</strong> 3rd.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6babfff03d7b445b8742639970a60b31e6598135\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6babfff03d7b445b8742639970a60b31e6598135/84_59_3376_2026/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Zealand\u2019s Bailey Mes stretches for the ball under pressure from Shamera Sterling of Jamaica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Zealand\u2019s Bailey Mes stretches for the ball under pressure from Shamera Sterling of Jamaica.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Barbour/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>South Africa</h2> <p><strong>World Cup best:</strong> 2nd, 1995.</p> <p><strong>Squad: </strong>Erin Burger, Izette Griesel, Maryka Hotzhausen, Chawane Khanyisa, Phumza Maweni, Bongiwe Msomi (c), Lenize Potgieter, Karla Pretorius, Renske Stolz, Shadine van der Merwe, Ine Mari Venter, Vimbela Zanele.</p> <p><strong>Coach:</strong> Norma Plummer.</p> <p><strong>Form guide:</strong> A deeply unlucky draw puts the Proteas in the tough situation of needing to beat either England or Jamaica to make the semi-finals. Had they found themselves up against New Zealand they would have been more confident, but the other side of the draw doesn\u2019t look so friendly for the South Africans. However, they will take some confidence from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/19/england-south-africa-netball-quad-series-match-report\">win against England</a> in the Quad Series in January and no doubt Norma Plummer has some tricks up her sleeve. The team also benefit from having six players in Australia\u2019s Super Netball this season, including their defensive combination playing together for the Sunshine Coast Lightning.</p> <p><strong>Key player:</strong> Karla Pretorius is quite simply one of the best players in the world at the moment.

However, having done it as underdogs, will they be able to replicate this form when all eyes are on them? Australia\u2019s coach, Lisa Alexander, claimed that the gold for England came a year too early and will put undue pressure on them at home. With a good mix of experience and youth, this looks to be the strongest team on paper. But they will face tough competition from Jamaica and South Africa in the cross-over games and will need to hold their nerve in front of a home crowd that have now learnt to expect gold from their Roses.</p> <p><strong>Key player:</strong> Geva Mentor seems to get better with age and her experience playing on the shooters of all the top five nations will be invaluable.</p> <p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Winners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fb4fbd56fa2648f6d4e5b05ee96d42b1fb71e65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fb4fbd56fa2648f6d4e5b05ee96d42b1fb71e65/0_236_2193_1315/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Geva Mentor\u2019s experience could be vital.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Geva Mentor\u2019s experience could be vital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Peters/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Scotland</h2> <p><strong>World Cup best:</strong> 6th, 1971, 1975, 1983.<br><strong>Squad:</strong> Emma Barrie, Kelly Boyle, Lynsey Gallagher, Ella Gibbons, Bethan Goodwin, Sarah MacPhail, Claire Maxwell (c), Niamh McCall, Nicola McCleery, Hayley Mulheron, Emily Nicholl, Lauren Tait.</p> <p><strong>Coach:</strong> Gail Parata.</p> <p><strong>Form guide: </strong>A tough draw will make this a difficult tournament for Scotland.

      "bodyText": "Group A Australia World Cup best: Winners 1963, 1971, 1975, 1979, 1983, 1991, 1995, 1999, 2007, 2011, 2015. Squad: Caitlin Bassett (c), April Brandley, Kelsey Browne, Courtney Bruce, Paige Hadley, Sarah Klau, Jamie-Lee Price, Caitlin Thwaites, Gretel Tippett, Liz Watson, Jo Weston, Steph Wood. Coach: Lisa Alexander. Form guide: After a disappointing silver medal at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, the Diamonds are desperate for gold. However, they are unlikely to find much competition in the group stages and gaining experience in close games is key for them to perform when it counts. Lisa Alexander has been happy with the fitness of her players, but the form of some \u2013 most notably the captain, Caitlin Bassett \u2013 in the Super Netball competition has been worrying and they do not look like a team with the same edge they had in 2015. With nine players making their World Cup debut, Australia\u2019s squad is the least experienced of the top five nations \u2013 but having all 12 of their players competing in the world\u2019s premier domestic competition is their key advantage. Key player: Liz Watson leads an inexperienced midcourt and her ability to transition the ball down the court will be vital to the Diamonds\u2019 chances. Prediction: Runners-up. Northern Ireland World Cup best: 7th, 1983. Squad: Noleen Armstrong, Niamh Cooper, Shaunagh Craig, Ciara Crosbie, Michelle Drayne, Gemma Lawlor, Emma Magee, Michelle Magee, Lisa McCaffrey, Caroline O\u2019Hanlon (c), Fionnuala Toner, Neamh Woods. Coach: Dan Ryan. Form guide: Much has been made of the former Australian men\u2019s player Dan Ryan being appointed as Northern Ireland\u2019s head coach. Although Ryan\u2019s form with the Adelaide Thunderbirds in Australia was less than stellar, he has had previous success in the UK Superleague coaching Manchester Thunder. Northern Ireland performed solidly at the 2018 Commonwealth Games and will be looking to finish higher than their current eighth-place world ranking. If Ryan uses his tactical nous to target games against teams who are vulnerable because of injury, this group has the ability to cause some upsets. Key player: Fionnuala Toner is a tough and versatile defender who can swing between wing defence and goal defence and be a game changer when it matters. Prediction: 8th. Zimbabwe World Cup best: 2019 debut. Squad: Sharon T Bwanali, Pauline Jani, Rudo Karume, Felisitus Kwangwa, Claris Kwaramba, Ndaizivei Madzikangava, Sharleen Makusha, Patricia Mauladi, Adelaide Muskwe, Ursula Ndlovu, Perpetua Y Siyachitema (c), Joice Takaidza. Coach: Lloyd Makunde. Form guide: It hasn\u2019t been the smoothest start for the African nation who named their final 12 on 3 July \u2013 only nine days before the start of the tournament. Competing in their first World Cup, they are something of an unknown quantity and will look to capitalise on that against higher ranked teams. Key player: Adelaide Muskwe brings some much needed experience to this team \u2013 a speedy defender who plays for Severn Stars in the UK\u2019s Superleague. Prediction: 12th. Sri Lanka World Cup best: 9th, 1963. Squad: Deepika Abeykoon, Dharshika Abeywickrema, Gayanjali Amarawansa, Dulanga Ambeygoda, Gayani Dissanayake, Chathurangi Jayasooriya (c), Hasitha Mendis, Nauchalie Rajapakse, Elilenthinie Sethukavalar, Tharjini Sivalingam, Dulangi Wannithileka, Thilini Waththegedera. Coach: Thilaka Jinadasa Form guide: After winning the 2018 Asian Championships, Sri Lanka will come into the World Cup with confidence but will need to show a great deal of resilience to pick themselves up after the pool stages and the impact of coming up against the world No 1 in Australia. Key player: Chathurangi Jayasooriya\u2019s anticipation in defence will be key to Sri Lanka creating turnovers when the ball is coming at them fast. Prediction: 15th. Group B New Zealand World Cup best: Winners 1967, 1979, 1987, 2003. Squad: Maria Folau, Laura Langman (c), Ameliaranne Ekenasio, Gina Crampton, Bailey Mes, Casey Kopua, Jane Watson, Shannon Saunders, Karin Burger, Phoenix Karaka, Katrina Rore, Te Paea Selby-Rickett. Coach: Noeline Taurua. Form guide: If you\u2019re wondering where you\u2019ve seen this squad list before, it was probably at the 2015 World Cup. For a team with little success in the past four years the decision to make very few changes and bank on experience is interesting. Fortunately they have been blessed with a kind draw, which means they will be unlikely to come up against South Africa. With only Australia and a depleted Malawi to trouble them, they are almost guaranteed a place in the semi-finals. While it is never wise to write off a Noeline Taurua-coached team, they will need to get a lot out of their battle-worn lineup in order to finish with a medal. Key player: Laura Langman can turn New Zealand\u2019s form around. If she has control of the game they stand a chance. Prediction: 4th. Malawi World Cup best: 5th, 2007. Squad: Jane Chimaliro, Thandie Galleta, Joanna Kachilika (c), Alinafe Kamwala, Bridget Kumwenda, Takondwa Lwazi, Caroline Mtukule, Joyce Mvula, Grace Mwafulirwa, Loreen Ngwira, Sindi Simtowe, Towera Vinkhumbo. Coach: Griffin Saenda. Form guide: The loss of Mwai Kumwenda to an ACL injury is big for this Malawi team. Kumwenda was the player of the tournament at the 2015 World Cup and her influence on this team is immense. After recording a historic win against New Zealand at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, they looked to have the capability to crack the top four. Malawi\u2019s unconventional structures and short passing game has the ability to throw off higher ranked teams, but they will need to create plenty of turnovers in defence to compensate for the absence of their strike weapon in the attacking end. Key player: Joyce Mvula will aim to bring her form from her recent Superleague spell with Manchester Thunder and be the target Malawi need in the circle. Prediction: 7th. Barbados World Cup best: 6th, 1987. Squad: Shonette Azore-Bruce, Latonia Blackman, Samantha Browne, Damisha Croney, Brianna Holder, Rieah Holder, Amanda Knight, Rhe-Ann Niles-Mapp (c), Tonisha Rock-Yaw, Shonte Seale, Sheniqua Thomas, Shonica Wharton. Coach: Sandra Bruce-Small. Form guide: Barbados had a tough run at the Commonwealth Games last year, coming away with only one win. They will look to make amends for their heartbreaking two-goal extra-time defeat against Scotland in the ninth-place play-off. They come off a great qualifying tournament and will be confident taking on Singapore in their first match. Key player: Shonette Azore-Bruce is a rock in goal keeper and will be key to Barbados fighting off the hungry attack of the higher ranked teams. Prediction: 10th. Singapore World Cup best: 8th, 1967. Squad: Aqilah Andin, Carmen Jia M Goh, Shuyi Kwok, Pei Shan Lee, Kimberly Lim, Sindhu Nair, Siti Nurshawa Rashid, Charmaine Soh (c), Xinyi Tan, Melody Teo, Joanna Toh, Kai Wei Toh. Coach: Natalie Milicich. Form guide: Ranked 26th in the world, Singapore will not have an easy time of things in this tournament. The team qualified by finishing in second place at the Asian Championship last year and will be hoping to get another shot at their Asian rivals Sri Lanka to try to close the gap between them. Key player: Charmaine Soh was the star of Singapore\u2019s Asian Games campaign, shooting accurately and creating space in the circle. Prediction: 16th. Group C Jamaica World Cup best: 3rd, 1991, 2003, 2007. Squad: Romelda Aiken, Shanice Beckford, Kadie-ann Dehaney, Nicole Dixon, Stacian Facey, Jhaniele Fowler (c), Rebekah Robinson, Shamera Sterling, Adean Thomas, Jodiann Ward, Khadijah Williams, Vangalee Williams. Coaches: Marvette Anderson and Sasher Gaye-Henry. Form guide: Jamaica\u2019s agonising one-goal defeat against the eventual winners, England, at the Commonwealth Games will be fresh in their minds as they approach this tournament. Despite the loss, the closeness of the margin taught them they are within a whisker of being the world\u2019s best and they will be desperate to prove it. With talent all over the court, including four players who compete in Australia\u2019s Super Netball league, they are a serious threat. But a lack of combinations among their key players may hurt them and they will need to be at their best to have a chance of toppling Australia or England. If they can get quality ball into the shooter Jhaniele Fowler they will be hard to stop. Key player: Shamera Sterling has been the talk of Australia\u2019s Super Netball and her ability to pull off amazing intercepts will be vital for Jamaica. Prediction: 3rd. South Africa World Cup best: 2nd, 1995. Squad: Erin Burger, Izette Griesel, Maryka Hotzhausen, Chawane Khanyisa, Phumza Maweni, Bongiwe Msomi (c), Lenize Potgieter, Karla Pretorius, Renske Stolz, Shadine van der Merwe, Ine Mari Venter, Vimbela Zanele. Coach: Norma Plummer. Form guide: A deeply unlucky draw puts the Proteas in the tough situation of needing to beat either England or Jamaica to make the semi-finals. Had they found themselves up against New Zealand they would have been more confident, but the other side of the draw doesn\u2019t look so friendly for the South Africans. However, they will take some confidence from a win against England in the Quad Series in January and no doubt Norma Plummer has some tricks up her sleeve. The team also benefit from having six players in Australia\u2019s Super Netball this season, including their defensive combination playing together for the Sunshine Coast Lightning. Key player: Karla Pretorius is quite simply one of the best players in the world at the moment. She can be the difference for South Africa. Prediction: 5th. Trinidad and Tobago World Cup best: 1st, 1979 (joint winners with Australia and New Zealand). Squad: Aniecia Baptiste, Shaquanda Greene, Candice Guerero, Tahirah Hollingsworth, Onella Jack, Rhonda John-Davis (c), Kalifa McCollin, Jameela McCarthy, Shantel Seemungal, Shernece Seemungal, Daystar Swift, Samantha Wallace. Coach: Wesley Gomes. Form guide: Trinidad and Tobago hold the unlikely honour of being the only team other than Australia and New Zealand to have won the World Cup. After missing out on the Commonwealth Games last year, the team sailed through the Americas qualifying tournament unbeaten and will aim to take this form to Liverpool. Key player: Samantha Wallace has been on fire for Super Netball\u2019s ladder-leading NSW Swifts and won\u2019t let her team down under the post. Prediction: 9th. Fiji World Cup best: 6th 1999. Squad: Adi Vakaoca Bolakoro, Kaitlyn Fisher, Episake Gaunavinaka, Uniaisi Gaunavinaka (c), Ema Mualuvu, Kelera Nawai, Lydia Panapasa, Asilika Sevutia, Aliti Toribau, Matila Vocea, Aliso Wainidroa, Laisani Waqa. Coach: Vicki Wilson. Form guide: Fiji did not have an easy run at the 2018 Commonwealth Games and despite cruising through the Oceania qualifying tournament with only a defeat against Samoa, they will need to improve considerably. Funding from Australia to allow them to engage a performance analyst should see an uptick in their fortunes. Key player: Laisani Waqa can be a shooting machine \u2013 if Fiji can get her the ball, she will deliver for them. Prediction: 14th. Group D England World Cup best: 2nd, 1975. Squad: Jade Clarke, Rachel Dunn, Layla Guscoth, Serena Guthrie (c), Jo Harten, Natalie Haythornthwaite, Helen Housby, Geva Mentor, Natalie Panagarry, Chelsea Pitman, Ebony Usoro-Brown, Francesca Williams. Coach: Tracey Neville. Form guide: England finally proved in 2018 that they can stand up in big games and pull out a win when it counts. However, having done it as underdogs, will they be able to replicate this form when all eyes are on them? Australia\u2019s coach, Lisa Alexander, claimed that the gold for England came a year too early and will put undue pressure on them at home. With a good mix of experience and youth, this looks to be the strongest team on paper. But they will face tough competition from Jamaica and South Africa in the cross-over games and will need to hold their nerve in front of a home crowd that have now learnt to expect gold from their Roses. Key player: Geva Mentor seems to get better with age and her experience playing on the shooters of all the top five nations will be invaluable. Prediction: Winners. Scotland World Cup best: 6th, 1971, 1975, 1983. Squad: Emma Barrie, Kelly Boyle, Lynsey Gallagher, Ella Gibbons, Bethan Goodwin, Sarah MacPhail, Claire Maxwell (c), Niamh McCall, Nicola McCleery, Hayley Mulheron, Emily Nicholl, Lauren Tait. Coach: Gail Parata. Form guide: A tough draw will make this a difficult tournament for Scotland. Despite a significant win against Northern Ireland in the qualifying tournament, they find themselves in the tougher group for the cross-over games, which is likely to leave them fighting it out for the lower placings. There is a lot to like about this team, which features only three World Cup veterans and has an average age of only 23.5 years. Although they have a rough path to tread, they will be all the better for it in the years to come. Key player: The 19-year-old Bethan Goodwin has been dazzling spectators with her strong shooting and is likely to be a fan favourite in Liverpool. Prediction 11th. Uganda World Cup best: 8th, 2015. Squad: Jesca Achan, Lilian Ajio, Mary Nuba Cholock, Betty Kizza, Ruth Meeme, Joan Nampungu, Muhayimina Namuwaya, Stella Nanfuka, Racheal Nanyonga, Sylvia Nanyonga, Stella Oyella, Peace Proscovia (c). Coach: Rashid Mubiru. Form guide: The darlings of the 2018 Commonwealth Games, Uganda will attract plenty of fans at this World Cup. They have the potential to cause upsets early but tend to fall away at the end of tournaments. A likely classification match against South Africa may prove too much for them to snag the top-five finish. Key player: Peace Proscovia is close to unstoppable under the post and will provide an incredible target in attack. Prediction: 6th Samoa World Cup best: 6th, 2003. Squad: Estea Autagavaia, Ariana Luamanu, Lenora Misa, Rachel Rasmussen, Ann Helen Nu\u2019uali\u2019itia, Soli Ropati, Tee Salanoa, Afi Lafaiali\u2019i Sapolu, Gene Solia-Gibb (c), Toa Tanimo, Sanita To\u2019o, Brooke Amber Williams (c). Coach: Frances Solia. Form guide: Samoa come in with confidence after a significant win against Fiji at the Oceania qualifiers. Recent support from Australia has boosted the team with a professional performance analyst and physiotherapist to assist in Liverpool. They will have a tough run early but are likely to win their later games. Key player: Gene Solia-Gibb brings experience and sporting nous to the defensive end and will be crucial to her team\u2019s chances. Prediction: 13th.",

A speedier departure, caving to White House tantrums, would only encourage Mr Trump\u2019s bullying, and \u2013 one assumes \u2013 reward the leaker of these documents. The next prime minister might be tempted to announce the name of the next ambassador early, as an easier way of drawing a line under the affair. But that would make Sir Kim a lame duck. It is not for the president of the US to determine who has served the UK well and who should be its next ambassador to Washington \u2013 any more than it is appropriate for the president of the US to denigrate his British counterpart as he has done Mrs May.</p> <p>Yet if this episode highlights many of the things that are wrong with the US administration, Britain does not come out of it looking entirely healthy and functional either. Though the source is unknown, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/07/leak-of-uk-ambassadors-us-telegrams-plays-into-wider-power-struggle\" title=\"\">Brexit-friendly conduit</a> and the way Nigel Farage leapt on the opportunity to put the boot into the civil service and demand a pro-Brexit political appointee have certainly raised suspicions. The fear is that Boris Johnson, the likely next prime minister, who boasts of good relations with the White House, might acquiesce. That too would be a mistake. </p> <p>It is striking that people who insist that Britain must leave the European Union no matter what the cost, to \u201ctake back control\u201d, see no problem with being browbeaten by the US. Perhaps the sole positive in this row is that it has exposed the cheapness of talk of the special relationship, and the attendant claims of a glorious US trade bonanza waiting for Britain once Brexit is complete. This attack on Britain\u2019s leader and its ambassador might be considered a warning.</p>",

The next prime minister might be tempted to announce the name of the next ambassador early, as an easier way of drawing a line under the affair. But that would make Sir Kim a lame duck. It is not for the president of the US to determine who has served the UK well and who should be its next ambassador to Washington \u2013 any more than it is appropriate for the president of the US to denigrate his British counterpart as he has done Mrs May. Yet if this episode highlights many of the things that are wrong with the US administration, Britain does not come out of it looking entirely healthy and functional either. Though the source is unknown, the Brexit-friendly conduit and the way Nigel Farage leapt on the opportunity to put the boot into the civil service and demand a pro-Brexit political appointee have certainly raised suspicions. The fear is that Boris Johnson, the likely next prime minister, who boasts of good relations with the White House, might acquiesce. That too would be a mistake. It is striking that people who insist that Britain must leave the European Union no matter what the cost, to \u201ctake back control\u201d, see no problem with being browbeaten by the US. Perhaps the sole positive in this row is that it has exposed the cheapness of talk of the special relationship, and the attendant claims of a glorious US trade bonanza waiting for Britain once Brexit is complete. This attack on Britain\u2019s leader and its ambassador might be considered a warning.",

It is little more than a weak attempt to get the party leadership out of the Brexit hole it finds itself in, without having to change their core pro-Brexit convictions.</p> <p>Their attempt to clarify the Labour party\u2019s position by appearing to support remain does not work. The bottom line is that if there is no general election then little changes \u2013 Labour votes against any Tory deal, while the Tories ignore them and deliver Brexit anyway. If there is a general election, the party will campaign for its own Brexit proposals, in the full knowledge that any kind of Brexit deal will leave the working people of this country worse off than they are now.</p> <p>So, let\u2019s be clear and ensure there is no ambiguity about how remain Labour supporters feel. I am a party member and have been a Labour supporter since I was old enough to vote \u2013 I am now 65. In a general election I, and many like me, will be voting for a remain party. There are no \u201cifs and buts\u201d. We will vote unambiguously for a party that supports remaining in the EU.

Those circumstances are not specified clearly enough, nor is it explained how the country would be better off.</p> <p>The basic question then is still the same: is there some way, acceptable to the other countries of the EU, for Britain to leave and for people\u2019s lives to be improved as a result? If there is, parliament would be justified in looking at that possibility. If there is not, there is no good reason to pursue Brexit.<br><strong>Michael Bulley</strong><br><em>Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, France</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your editorial (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/07/the-guardian-view-on-jeremy-corbyn-new-deeds-and-words-needed\" title=\"\">Labour cannot hope to win with old arguments in a new political climate</a>, 8 July) asserts that the Brexit choice is likely to be between Boris Johnson\u2019s no deal and a second referendum, which is clearly aimed by its supporters (possibly overoptimistically) at overturning the result of the people\u2019s vote in 2016.</p> <p>That polarised choice is indeed what obstructive MPs on the no-deal and remainer extremes are contriving \u2013 in many cases defying their election commitments \u2013 but the majority vote for leaving the EU accompanied by a large minority voting to remain suggests that the centre of gravity in the country is close to the deal which is actually on the table, negotiated by Theresa May with the EU, though preferably with permanent membership of the customs union as Labour desires.</p> <p>As for your complaint that \u201cLabour has not moved on from its 2017 manifesto\u201d, the undertaking to respect the result of the referendum is the basis on which Labour MPs obtained the support of voters. It was not simply a ruse to obtain leaver votes, to be torn up once the polls had been closed and the electorate returned to impotent spectators for the next five years, as you apparently prefer.<br><strong>Christopher Clayton</strong><br><em>Waverton, Cheshire </em></p> <p>\u2022 The lawyers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/05/a-peoples-vote-remains-the-best-way-to-get-through-brexit-impasse\" title=\"\">whose letter</a> was published on 6 July assert that a confirmatory vote would be \u201ca continuation of the democratic process that began with the 2016 referendum\u201d. That would be the case if any referendum question were to be confined to what \u201cleave\u201d option voters prefer. However, the lawyers also want a \u201cremain in the EU\u201d option on the ballot paper. This would not be \u201ca continuum\u201d of the democratic process, but rather asking a question already posed and answered by the electorate in 2016. <br><strong>Anthony Fincham </strong><br><em>Leyton, London</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "The latest union-agreed stance on how Labour should in future campaign on the issue of Brexit is yet another \u201cifs and buts\u201d policy (Labour should back remain in referendum on Tory Brexit \u2013 unions, 9 July). It is little more than a weak attempt to get the party leadership out of the Brexit hole it finds itself in, without having to change their core pro-Brexit convictions. Their attempt to clarify the Labour party\u2019s position by appearing to support remain does not work. The bottom line is that if there is no general election then little changes \u2013 Labour votes against any Tory deal, while the Tories ignore them and deliver Brexit anyway. If there is a general election, the party will campaign for its own Brexit proposals, in the full knowledge that any kind of Brexit deal will leave the working people of this country worse off than they are now. So, let\u2019s be clear and ensure there is no ambiguity about how remain Labour supporters feel. I am a party member and have been a Labour supporter since I was old enough to vote \u2013 I am now 65. In a general election I, and many like me, will be voting for a remain party. There are no \u201cifs and buts\u201d. We will vote unambiguously for a party that supports remaining in the EU. It is up to the Labour leadership to decide whether they want our votes or not. Shaun Soper Midhurst, West Sussex \u2022 I have just received Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s email setting out the Labour party\u2019s current stance on Brexit (Corbyn says Labour would back remain in Brexit referendum, theguardian.com, 9 July). It goes some way to clarifying things, but there is still the implication that Labour would be in favour of leaving the EU under certain circumstances. Those circumstances are not specified clearly enough, nor is it explained how the country would be better off. The basic question then is still the same: is there some way, acceptable to the other countries of the EU, for Britain to leave and for people\u2019s lives to be improved as a result? If there is, parliament would be justified in looking at that possibility. If there is not, there is no good reason to pursue Brexit. Michael Bulley Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, France \u2022 Your editorial (Labour cannot hope to win with old arguments in a new political climate, 8 July) asserts that the Brexit choice is likely to be between Boris Johnson\u2019s no deal and a second referendum, which is clearly aimed by its supporters (possibly overoptimistically) at overturning the result of the people\u2019s vote in 2016. That polarised choice is indeed what obstructive MPs on the no-deal and remainer extremes are contriving \u2013 in many cases defying their election commitments \u2013 but the majority vote for leaving the EU accompanied by a large minority voting to remain suggests that the centre of gravity in the country is close to the deal which is actually on the table, negotiated by Theresa May with the EU, though preferably with permanent membership of the customs union as Labour desires. As for your complaint that \u201cLabour has not moved on from its 2017 manifesto\u201d, the undertaking to respect the result of the referendum is the basis on which Labour MPs obtained the support of voters. It was not simply a ruse to obtain leaver votes, to be torn up once the polls had been closed and the electorate returned to impotent spectators for the next five years, as you apparently prefer. Christopher Clayton Waverton, Cheshire \u2022 The lawyers whose letter was published on 6 July assert that a confirmatory vote would be \u201ca continuation of the democratic process that began with the 2016 referendum\u201d. That would be the case if any referendum question were to be confined to what \u201cleave\u201d option voters prefer. However, the lawyers also want a \u201cremain in the EU\u201d option on the ballot paper. This would not be \u201ca continuum\u201d of the democratic process, but rather asking a question already posed and answered by the electorate in 2016.

The report also reveals that additional garda\u00ed have been deployed to border areas in recent months, and that more will be sent immediately in the event of no deal. But \u201cthere should be no illusion\u201d over the impact of Brexit on the island, with 11 risks identified including the undermining of community relations and political stability in Northern Ireland. The report also put paid to Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt\u2019s hopes that the EU will accept technology-based \u201calternative arrangements\u201d for the Irish border. It says it has been working with the European commission on this issue this year but \u201cno one has yet come up with any alternatives that meet the same objectives as the withdrawal agreement\u201d. The report says the government\u2019s assessment is that there is now \u201ca significant risk of a no-deal on 31 October\u201d and preparation for such an event is a priority. It warns of a potential \u00a36bn cost to the Irish economy and an estimated increase in unemployment of 50,000-55,000. \u201cPreventing the emergence of a hard border on the island of Ireland remains of the highest priority,\u201d says the report, but despite preparations \u201cwithout the withdrawal agreement and the backstop, there are no easy answers\u201d. The biggest challenge will be how to continue cross-border trade involving animals and agricultural products. In a no-deal scenario, all food and animals from Northern Ireland will be treated as sourced from a third country and not eligible to enter the EU without checks on traceability and disease. As expected, the report does not say how these would be accommodated and says further talks with the European commission are needed. The report warns of \u201cdisruption in north-south trade and the all-island economy due to tariffs and the imposition of various regulatory requirements\u201d, and to cooperation in areas such as energy, road and rail connectivity.

This is a deeply shocking report. For many of us working in education, this confirms our own experiences in recent years. It also shows how little has really changed in the two decades that have passed since the publication of the Macpherson report.</p> <p>The University and College Union (UCU) has been campaigning with Stand Up to Racism to try to break the wall of silence about racism on campus. That is why a second campus tour is planned for this autumn to support staff and students fighting back against racism on campus and continuing to document institutional racism.</p> <p>Higher education is the gift that every generation bequeaths to the next. Our black and ethnic minority students and staff have as much right to that gift as everyone else. When we talk about access, when we talk about participation, the fact that universities are refusing to even consider that racism might exist in their own practices is an outrage.<br><strong>Nita Sanghera </strong><em>UCU president-elect</em><br><strong>Dave Muritu </strong><em>UCU past chair of black members standing committee</em><br><strong>Jo McNeill </strong><em>UCU national executive committee </em><br><strong>Mesar Hameed </strong><em>Bath University council</em><br><strong>Sue Abbott </strong><em>UCU chair of national equalities committee</em><br><strong>Julia Roberts </strong><em>UCU NEC</em><br><strong>Naina Kent</strong><em> UCU black members standing committee</em><br><strong>Vida Greaux </strong><em>UCU NEC</em><br><strong>Rhiannon Lockley </strong><em>UCU women members standing committee</em><br><strong>Sean Wallis </strong><em>UCU NEC</em><br><strong>Cecily Blyther </strong><em>UCU NEC</em><br><strong>Linda Cronin </strong><em>Roehampton University UCU equality officer</em><br><strong>Pura Ariza </strong><em>UCU NEC</em><br><strong>Mandy Brown </strong><em>UCU London regional secretary</em><br><strong>Abdullah Yusuf </strong><em>Dundee University UCU equality officer</em><br><strong>Anne Alexander </strong><em>Cambridge University UCU</em><br><strong>Christina Paine </strong><em>UCU NEC</em><br><strong>Tom Pike, Roddy Slorach, Vijay Tymms, Dave Mooney, Chris Jackson, Colin Cotter, Dan Nucinkis, Anita Hill, Peter Woodward, Janette Shiel, Fay Dowker, Jo Chaffin </strong><em>Imperial College UCU</em><br><strong>Grant Buttars </strong><em>Edinburgh University UCU president</em><br><strong>Umit Yidiz </strong><em>Edge Hill University UCU</em><br><strong>Mike Orr </strong><em>Edinburgh University UCU</em><br><strong>Bruce Heil </strong><em>Open University UCU</em><br><strong>Anne Marie Piso </strong><em>Leeds Beckett University UCU joint branch secretary</em><br><strong>Bernadette Driscoll </strong><em>College of North West London UCU</em><br><strong>Megan Povey, Lesley McGorrigan </strong><em>Leeds University UCU</em><br><strong>Stacy Gillis, David Stewart, Geoff Abbott </strong><em>Newcastle University UCU</em><br><strong>Peter Dwyer, Lee Humber, Des McDermott, Ed Rooksby, Monica Mottin, Gerard Ward, </strong><em>Ruskin College UCU</em><br><strong>Richard Bradbury </strong><em>Open University UCU vice-president</em><br><strong>Michael </strong><strong>Szpakowski</strong><strong> </strong><em>Writtle University College UCU branch chair</em><br><strong>Sara Weiner </strong><em>UCU NEC</em><br><strong>Julie Hearn </strong><em>UCU NEC</em><br><strong>Sunil Banga, Nils Markusson, Shuruq Naguib </strong><em>Lancaster University UCU</em><br><strong>Mark Abel </strong><em>UCU NEC</em><br><strong>Carlo Morelli </strong><em>UCU NEC and UCU Scotland NEC</em><br><strong>Ioanna Ioannou </strong><em>UCU NEC</em><br><strong>Margot Hill </strong><em>UCU NEC</em><br><strong>Allister Mactaggart </strong><em>Chesterfield College UCU branch chair</em><br><strong>Tony Sullivan </strong><em>London College of Fashion UCU branch secretary</em><br><strong>Jo\u00e3o Nunes de Almeida </strong><em>Lancaster University UCU anti-casualisation officer</em><br><strong>James Cussens </strong><em>York University UCU branch executive</em><br><strong>Annie Jones </strong><em>Sheffield Hallam University UCU</em><br><strong>Craig Brandist </strong><em>Sheffield University UCU senior vice-president</em></p> <p>\u2022 The second letter in this package was amended on 11 July 2019 to correct the spelling of the last name of Michael Szpakowski and to note the correct name of his college.</p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email <a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">guardian.letters@theguardian.com</a></strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\">gu.com/letters</a></strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\">Click here</a> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</strong></em></p>",

We are hopeful of a resolution soon, while aware that we cannot expect a small group of protesters to represent all BME perspectives. Your coverage is a wake-up call for universities to listen to the full breadth of BME voices if we are to live up to the sector\u2019s identity as a space for liberal and critical reflection \u2013 discourse that typically precedes change in wider society. Professor Elisabeth Hill Acting warden, Goldsmiths, University of London \u2022 Thank you for your expos\u00e9 of racism experienced by staff and students in universities. This is a deeply shocking report. For many of us working in education, this confirms our own experiences in recent years. It also shows how little has really changed in the two decades that have passed since the publication of the Macpherson report. The University and College Union (UCU) has been campaigning with Stand Up to Racism to try to break the wall of silence about racism on campus. That is why a second campus tour is planned for this autumn to support staff and students fighting back against racism on campus and continuing to document institutional racism. Higher education is the gift that every generation bequeaths to the next. Our black and ethnic minority students and staff have as much right to that gift as everyone else. When we talk about access, when we talk about participation, the fact that universities are refusing to even consider that racism might exist in their own practices is an outrage.

The Cricket World Cup is the tournament that always leaves the audience wanting less. The group stages are a tough mudder for supporters \u2013 a draining test of endurance, nerve, commitment, caffeine levels and ability to understand how net run-rate works. They must be quite hard to play in as well.</p> <p>The group stages were good to middling, saved by Sri Lanka\u2019s win over England. But now, after 40 days and 41 matches, we\u2019ve reached the really good bit: the knockout stages. India play New Zealand in the first semi-final at Old Trafford today. Then, on Thursday at Edgbaston, Australia and England will compare testosterone levels. The draw for the final will take place on Friday, with the two teams meeting at Lord\u2019s on Sunday.</p> <p>We will either have a familiar winner of the tournament (Australia for the sixth time, India for the third) or a new one. New Zealand and England have never won the World Cup, as you may have have heard one of two million times in the last six weeks. </p> <p>New Zealand are at least the world champions of consistency. They are the only team to reach the semi-finals at the last four World Cups, and if they win today they will reach their second final in a row. We\u2019re all friends, so let\u2019s speak frankly: nobody really gives New Zealand a prayer today. That, I suspect, is more down to form than the predilection to underestimate a team who have spent decades showing the folly of underestimating them.</p> <p>New Zealand lost their last three games in the league stage, and a number of their players have had poor tournament. Their hope comes in the form of Kane Williamson, Trent Boult and Lockie Ferguson, all potential matchwinners, and the fact <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19134/scorecard/1173348/india-vs-new-zealand-world-cup-warm-up-2019\">they hammered India in a warm-up match at the end of May</a>. The league match between the two sides was rained off, so there are no clues there.</p> <p>India managed to finish top of the league without being quite at their best. Jasprit Bumrah and Rohit Sharma were immense, but Virat Kohli didn\u2019t score a century (he\u2019s still averaging 63 in the tournament) and they have yet to settle on their preferred XI.</p> <p>Maybe they never will. Time is running out, but in a good way. India \u2013 and the other three semi-finalists \u2013 are only two games away from <em>winning the World Cup</em>.</p> <p><strong>Today\u2019s match starts at 10.30am local time</strong>, 3pm in Mumbai, 9.30pm in Wellington.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-09T08:25:25.190Z\">at 9.25am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "We go again \u2026 Play will resume at 10.30am tomorrow morning. Resume? I realise I\u2019m using the language of the Test match, simply because I\u2019m not familiar with the vocabulary of the two-day ODI. Play will recommence at 10.30am tomorrow morning? Restart? Perk up? Stop hassling me, I don\u2019t know! Tomorrow morning it is. Same time, same place, same taking the pace off back of a length. Thanks for your company and emails; please join Simon in the morning. Bye! Oh well, they did their best. New Zealand will resume in the morning on 211 for five from 46.1 overs. The forecast is better, at least until 10.30am around 2pm. DLS could still be the matchwinners. There\u2019s a lot of water on the outfield. I\u2019ll be very surprised if this isn\u2019t abandoned in the next few minutes. No news yet on the 6.10 inspection. But as soon as somebody else reports what has happened, we\u2019ll recycle the information like the crack second-hand news hounds we are. If play is abandoned for the day, New Zealand will resume their innings. If it resumes tonight, India will start a 20-over runchase. Confused? Splendid. Now all I need is your sort code and the three digits on the back of the card. It\u2019s raining again. The covers are going back on, and it looks like the match will resume in the morning. There will be another inspection at 6.10pm. India won the 2013 Champions Trophy in a rain-affected T20 match, beating England in the final, but this is a little bit important. And there was no reserve day then, from memory. Thanks Simon. Who knew a rain delay could be so intriguing? The consensus is that New Zealand would take their chances in a 20-over lottery tonight, whereas India will be desperate to come back for a full game tonight. We\u2019ll soon find out which it is to be. I\u2019m overcome with excitement and going to step away for a short while. Rob Smyth is back in the interim. Bye for a bit! It has stopped raining and the covers are coming off! There are large puddles in the outfield, though, and quite a bit of mopping up to do. Still, promising/disappointing signs, depending on your outlook. \u201cIf matches continue to get rained off at such regularity, the future of England\u2019s ability to host premier ICC tournaments will be called into question,\u201d writes Mukundhan. \u201cDon\u2019t you think the commercial interests at play will arm-twist the ICC to hold such high-profile tournaments in countries with predictable weather patterns?\u201d I think in England everyone accepts that rain happens in summer, and that any summer sport that can\u2019t be played when it\u2019s raining will just have to deal with it. Those \u2013 and there are quite a few of them \u2013 saying that England shouldn\u2019t be hosting the World Cup because it isn\u2019t always dry are essentially ignoring centuries of sporting history, which strongly suggests that it is possible to play cricket here. Besides, the very great majority of games in this tournament have been entirely unaffected by inclement weather There will, I\u2019m told, be a pitch inspection at 6pm BST. If the umpires still need umbrellas at that point, it\u2019s surely all over. Sky say the ground staff will need a full hour to remove the covers and mop up the outfield. So if my maths is correct, rain must cease in the next 25 minutes or we\u2019ll be back for more tomorrow. However Sky add that David Boon might be able to magic a little extra time from somewhere if the weather improves soon after that point. An update from New Zealand\u2019s official account confirms that play must resume in the next 90 minutes if this game is to end today. It\u2019s still raining pretty hard. \u201cIf this reduces to a 20-over chase by India, this batting line up would definitely fancy their chances to get 148,\u201d writes Rohit Singh. \u201cOf course a full 50 overs to each side would have been the best possible scenario, unfortunately the rain Gods decided to intervene.\u201d That\u2019s what I like to see, a bit of positivity! Of course, the first reaction to seeing those amended targets was of course that they look a bit toppish. But however unfair it seems, this India side would surely back themselves to score seven an over for 20 overs against these opponents. Latest from Manchester: it\u2019s still raining, and it\u2019s got harder. \u201cWhat happens if rain stops play altogether for the day?\u201d asks Mark O\u2019Brien. \u201cHighest run rate, previous games played against etc? Topical debate in bar in Thailand at the moment.\u201d So if there\u2019s no more play today, the game will resume tomorrow with (assuming there\u2019s no rain in the morning) New Zealand completing their innings, before India bat their full 50 overs. If no play were possible tomorrow, India would go through to the final because they finished in a higher position in the group stage. \u201cRegarding the Commercial Considerations, the ICC might have its own agenda, but surely ensuring a fair game has to be a higher priority for the Match Referee?\u201d writes Rohan. \u201cOr does he consider anything dictated by DLS a \u2018fair game\u2019? Something to ponder for Mr. Boon!\u201d David Boon is, for clarity, today\u2019s match referee. I\u2019m not sure which team will go through from here, but I\u2019m pessimistic about the prospect of sport being the winner. Martin Sinclair, writing from south Manchester, says he has witnessed the sun. \u201cFeel very sorry for India - their run chase feels unfairly difficult,\u201d he adds. \u201cI wonder if New Zealand choosing to bat first then playing within themselves to preserve wickets will prove to be master captaincy from Kane Williamson.\u201d It\u2019s starting to look either very clever or very lucky. It\u2019s still drizzling. My rain radar says it\u2019ll continue to do so for perhaps another hour, and thus further play is unlikely until about 6pm BST. After that, though, it looks like there should be enough dry weather for a game to be completed. Albeit one that might make a lot of people quite angry. \u201cSurely there\u2019s no greater Commercial Consideration than ensuring India reached the World Cup Final?\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. It\u2019s nearly not raining! With just a light drizzle now falling, a mop-up operation has begun (though the covers remain very much in place). Rain stopped play at 2.01pm, and only when more than two hours have been lost to rain are overs taken out of the game. As of five minutes ago, that threshold has been reached. Karan Singh Dogra is unhappy. \u201cIndia bowled well and stopped scores,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is not fair that India should score 148 in 20 overs. Same overs same runs should be applied. Play the game with the spirit of game.\u201d Clearly that would be the most sporting outcome, and it strikes me that it would be immeasurably better for India to bat 50 overs tomorrow than 20 overs today. However, there will I\u2019m sure be the dreaded Commercial Considerations to take into account. This just in from Andy Bull, our man at Old Trafford. It looks to me like good news for New Zealand, who stand to benefit from any resumption today: \u201cThe ICC are very keen to get this game done today if they can. Play can go on as late as 10pm tonight, because they\u2019ve added a two-hour extension to the playing hours for the semi-finals. They need to start play by 8ish, but he rain is supposed to stop around 6 or 7 so I think we\u2019ll get a game in. If India\u2019s innings is reduced to 20 overs, they\u2019ll need to chase 148. The target\u2019s high, because New Zealand kept so many wickets in hand.\u201d \u201cAs a NZ fan, this drawn-out defeat is tortuous - can we not just throw the towel in now? Won\u2019t someone please think of the children?\u201d pleads Giles. No Giles, no they will not. And no you can\u2019t. You\u2019re just going to have to live through it like the rest of us. \u201cIs there potential for this rain to totally \u2018SouthAfrica\u2019 India?\u201d wonders Si Begley. \u201cIndia are set 148 off 20 today, go for it, reach 140/7 after 15, heavens open, they have to come back tomorrow to chase 237? Would seem massively unfair. And incredibly funny.\u201d There is no potential for such lunacy, happily/sadly. As soon as a ball is bowled after an over reduction, those conditions are set and unchangeable. So if they try to play 20 overs today but play is stopped after two deliveries, they will play only 19.4 overs tomorrow. They can if necessary play until 8pm today, but 10.30am tomorrow is starting to look an increasingly likely resumption time. Weather update: it is pouring in Manchester. \u201cThis is insane,\u201d wails Sreekanth Nandakumar. \u201cSo India have to score 6 runs or more if the match is reduced to 35 overs or less on a slow pitch? How is it fair?\u201d Certainly the rain has come at a good time for New Zealand, though they only benefit if play resumes today with a reduced over count. Reporters on the scene have turned a bit pessimistic about the prospects of more play today: Here\u2019s a more complete run-down of potential India targets: Assuming New Zealand\u2019s innings ends here, India\u2019s target in 46 overs would be 237. In 20 overs, which is the shortest it could be to qualify as a completed innings, their target would be 148. This is just over twice the total New Zealand had after 20 overs (which was 73-2). World Cup regulations state that \u201cevery effort will be made to complete the match on the scheduled day with any necessary reduction in overs taking place and only if the minimum number of overs necessary to constitute a match cannot be bowled on the scheduled day will the match be completed on the reserve day\u201d. From which we learn that the ICC are not big fans of punctuation. Hello everyone! Well, this is just great, is it not? The rain radar I\u2019ve been looking at suggests that the weather is unlikely to significantly improve for at least a couple of hours, with around 6pm being a vaguely realistic amateur not-quite-total guess of a potential restart time. So settle in, we\u2019re here for the long haul. There won\u2019t be any play for a while, so I\u2019m going to take an unscheduled lunch break. Simon Burnton is waiting to watch the weather on your behalf. See you soon. Don\u2019t make any plans for tomorrow. The forecast for the rest of the day is imperfect. \u201cNZ may have the game in the bag,\u201d says Siraj Khan, \u201cif they are able to play their entire 50 overs and hit 240.\u201d That would be a very useful total. I think India will make the new ball count, though, and control the chase after that. If they get off to a slow start \u2013 27 for one off 10, say \u2013 it\u2019ll be very tight. There is scope for a reserve day, but the umpires will try to finish the game today if they can. So India could end up chasing a DLS target in a reduced game - 21 from 20 overs, something like that. You can read more about the reserve days here. 46.1 overs: New Zealand 211-5 (Taylor 65, Latham 5) A misfield from Chahal gives Latham a bonus run. That\u2019s the last ball of the innings, for now at least. The rain is getting heavier and the umpires have decided to take the players off. 46th over: New Zealand 209-5 (Taylor 65, Latham 3) Latham gets two overthrows from the same delivery, one at each end. Virat Kohli\u2019s face is a picture, and that picture will hurt you if you don\u2019t stop looking at it. Seven from Bumrah\u2019s antepenultimate over - five singles plus those two overthrows. 45th over: New Zealand 202-5 (Taylor 60, Latham 1) Despite everything, all the dot balls and mistimed strokes , New Zealand are inching towards a reasonable score. Kumar ends a dangerous little partnership by dismissing Colin de Grandhomme. He produced a slower short ball which followed de Grandhomme, who tried to glide it to third man and got a little edge through to MS Dhoni. de Grandhomme made a useful 16 from 10 balls, adding 38 in 3.4 overs with Taylor. Ross Taylor has an LBW decision overturned on review! He missed a premeditated sweep at a full ball from Kumar and was given out by Richard Kettleborough. It looked plumb, and I suspect Taylor reviewed in hope rather than expectation, but replays showed it hit him outside the line. 44th over: New Zealand 197-4 (Taylor 56, de Grandhomme 16) Good afternoon Mr Taylor, we\u2019ve been expecting you. After struggling for so long, Ross Taylor comes alive and, with a little help from de Grandhomme, smashes 18 from Chahal\u2019s final over. A vicious slog-sweep for six brings up a laboured, 73-ball fifty, and two balls later he crunches a drive for four. de Grandhomme cuts another boundary to complete a superb over. Chahal ends with figures of 10-0-63-1. \u201cSorry to be the bearer of bad news,\u201d says John Norris, \u201cbut I live 25 miles to the west of Old Trafford and it\u2019s raining steadily here so seems unlikely to miss the cricket today which could have severe implications for NZ after their lethargic run rate...\u201d 43rd over: New Zealand 179-4 (Taylor 44, de Grandhomme 12) The groundstaff are poised for action, which suggests rain is imminent. Pandya drops short to de Grandhomme, who steers the ball deftly to third man for four. Nine from the over, and the wounded Pandya finishes with figures of 10-0-55-1. 42nd over: New Zealand 170-4 (Taylor 42, de Grandhomme 5) It\u2019ll be interesting to see what the new batsman, the big-hitting Colin de Grandhomme, makes of this pitch. He has a swipe at Chahal, inside-edging past leg stump for two, during a decent over for New Zealand. They\u2019d accept 220 now, and they\u2019d thank Mother Cricket for it. 41st over: New Zealand 162-4 (Taylor 40) Pandya must be a doubt for the final, should India get there. He\u2019ll bowl his 10 overs and bat if necessary, but he\u2019s still not right. Andrew Hurley has a simple thought: \u201cI miss Pakistan.\u201d Seriously, though, imagine them today. You\u2019d get two games for the price of one: India v Pakistan, and Pakistan v Pakistan. Pandya strikes! Neesham tried to go over the leg side and mistimed the ball miles in the air towards long on, where Karthik took a comfortable catch. There have been many mistimed strokes in this innings, and every time somebody tries to go up a gear they get out. 40th over: New Zealand 155-3 (Taylor 38, Neesham 7) Taylor survives a possible run-our chance, with Kohli\u2019s throw missing the stumps for the second time today. We haven\u2019t seen a replay so I\u2019ve no idea whether he would have been out with a direct hit. Four singles from Bumrah\u2019s over, and here\u2019s more from Butch. 39th over: New Zealand 151-3 (Taylor 36, Neesham 5) I don\u2019t think New Zealand are out of this. But they will have to do exceedingly good business with the new ball and then squeeze the hopes and dreams out of India. In other news, after six weeks of mutual backslapping about the pitches in this World Cup, Butch has gone rogue! (He\u2019s right, though.) 38th over: New Zealand 145-3 (Taylor 31, Neesham 4) Neesham is dropped by Rohit at midwicket. It was a one-handed, slightly half-arsed effort after Neesham was duped by Pandya\u2019s slower short ball. Rohit stretched to his left but it went through his fingers. New Zealand are struggling to middle anything at the back end of the innings. On reflection, perhaps they should have gone harder against the new ball. I appreciate this is easier said than done. 37th over: New Zealand 140-3 (Taylor 29, Neesham 2) Taylor is beaten, swatting at a slower bouncer from the new bowler Kumar. His increasing frustration manifests itself in a loose shot that loops high over cover point for a couple. He got away with that. 36th over: New Zealand 136-3 (Taylor 26, Neesham 1) Jimmy Neesham, who can give it some humpty, has been promoted above Tom Latham. New Zealand probably need a run a ball from the last 14 overs to have a realistic chance of victory. The Spin (part two) Williamson was frantic after the drinks break, and now he\u2019s gone. He flashed outside off stump at Chahal but could only slice a drive straight to Jadeja at short third man. Williamson shakes his head at something, possibly the pitch, before walking off the field. He made 67 from 95 balls. It was an accomplished innings; I\u2019ll let you know at the end of the game how good it was. That should be the match for India! 35th over: New Zealand 133-2 (Williamson 67, Taylor 24) Williamson drives Jadeja inside out over extra cover, with Pant acrobatically saving a run on the boundary. He slog-sweeps four more later in the over, which suggests he has decided to get a wriggle on, before surviving a precautionary stumping referral. An eventful over concludes when Williamson misses an unbecoming hack at a ball that just bounces over the stumps. \u201cZZZZZ!!\u201d says John Atwill. \u201cOne bored Kiwi here.\u201d It\u2019s that or suffering. (NB: Clip contains adult language.) 34th over: New Zealand 125-2 (Williamson 60, Taylor 23) Bumrah continues after the drinks break. New Zealand have struggled to score anything off him apart from low-risk singles, and there are three more in that over. \u201cANNOUNCEMENT,\u201d writes Mac Millings. \u201cIf McMahon is corresponding in the third person now, it surely can\u2019t be long before the Millingses are writing in the third person plural, about how they wish they had a shed, it\u2019s all right for some isn\u2019t it, but they only have a sort of plastic hut and they can\u2019t even get into that because of all the rusty unused tools and venomous snakes.\u201d 33rd over: New Zealand 122-2 (Williamson 58, Taylor 22) Pandya off, Jadeja on. New Zealand are trying to up the rate, Taylor in particular, but the pitch looks increasingly awkward for strokeplay. I think the pitches have been disappointing in this tournament - not because of the balance between bat and ball, which has been good, but because of their sluggishness. The Old Trafford pitch for Australia v South Africa was a beauty. \u201cYou won\u2019t know this as you weren\u2019t around at the time,\u201d begins Garry Sharp, \u201cbut Hip Flexor (20th over) were an early 70s one hit wonder with their disco dance floor sensation Rotate Me Baby (let me strike). There was a massive debate back then about whether the title referred to industrial unrest or Geoff Boycott\u2019s batting.\u201d 32nd over: New Zealand 121-2 (Williamson 57, Taylor 22) Jasprit Bumrah replaces Chahal - and Taylor is dropped by Dhoni! It was a very difficult low chance, which got to him almost on the half-volley. It was also a superb leg-cutter from Bumrah, who seems to be getting better with every game. He\u2019s truly, madly, deeply unhittable. \u201cForget all this white-ball nonsense,\u201d writes Robert Darby. \u201cThere is a pwoper cricket match going on at Chelmsford where Yorkshire have had five players reach double figures, although none has surpassed the ever-reliable \u2018Extras\u2019.\u201d And you can follow it all with the marvellous Tanya Aldred. 31st over: New Zealand 120-2 (Williamson 57, Taylor 22) Williamson top-edges a pull from Pandya straight over the keeper\u2019s head for four. Pandya seems to have a deceptively sharp bouncer to go with his slower one. Taylor also gets away with a top-edged pull later in the over, and the resulting single brings up the fifty partnership. 30th over: New Zealand 113-2 (Williamson 50, Taylor 21) Williamson drives Chahal for a single to reach a soothing half-century from 79 balls. Too soothing, in the opinion of some. \u201cThis Williamson false shot percentage should be viewed the other way,\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cHis is so low as he\u2019s taking so few risks and his team are as a result on the way out...\u201d Taylor then sweeps hard behind square for four, which might be the start of his glory charge. He has 21 from 36 balls. 29th over: New Zealand 105-2 (Williamson 48, Taylor 16) Pandya is driven crisply through extra cover for a couple by the remarkably consistent Williamson. His only sub-40 score in this competition was against England, when he was freakishly run out. \u201cSTOP PRESS,\u201d writes Simon McMahon. \u201cIt was announced this morning that Simon McMahon and the garage have parted company by mutual consent. McMahon will join the shed on a 12-month rolling contract at the end of the cricket World Cup, and has also negotiated a release clause for this summer\u2019s Ashes series. \u2018It became clear that the garage and I had different ideas about how to take things to the next level going forward. The offer of a four-year deal from the attic was tempting, but not right for me at this time\u2019, said McMahon. \u2018I\u2019m extremely excited to have joined the shed, and can\u2019t wait to get started (eventually)\u2019.\u201d 28th over: New Zealand 99-2 (Williamson 44, Taylor 15) It feels like New Zealand are ambling towards certain defeat, whistling a happy tune, stopping to say hello to Mrs Dineen and ask how her pet rabbit, Greatbatch, is getting on. But we were all burned by Angelo Mathews\u2019 \u201cmatch-losing\u201d innings against England, so I\u2019m loath to jump to conclusions. Sourav Ganguly, who knows more about batting, says it\u2019s \u201cinexplicable batting as they say\u201d. Who are they? Williamson gets the first boundary in 14 overs, dragging Chahal through midwicket, and then Taylor gets his first with an edge past slip. 27th over: New Zealand 89-2 (Williamson 39, Taylor 10) Pandya returns to the attack in place of Jadeja. He seems to be okay, and almost dismisses Williamson with a slower ball that is inside edged past leg stump. Four singles from the over. 26th over: New Zealand 85-2 (Williamson 37, Taylor 8) Taylor survives a big LBW appeal after playing outside a lovely delivery from Chahal that skids on to hit the pad. That looked very close, and I suspect India would have reviewed if they could. No matter - it would have been umpire\u2019s call. It feels like the net is closing around New Zealand. Williamson survives a run-out chance later in the over, with Kohli\u2019s underarm throw from close range missing the stumps. He would been out with a direct hit. 25th over: New Zealand 83-2 (Williamson 36, Taylor 7) New Zealand haven\u2019t played an attacking stroke since the wicket of Nicholls. Another quiet over from Jadeja means India have conceded 14 from the last overs. Taylor will surely go into one-day mode soon. 24th over: New Zealand 82-2 (Williamson 36, Taylor 6) There have been only five fours in this innings, and there are just three singles from Chahal\u2019s fourth over. It\u2019s intriguing stuff, slightly reminiscent of the Waugh/Bevan partnership in the 1999 semi-final. At one stage they scored six runs in 8.4 overs, but they caught up later and put together a match-tieing partnership. \u201cNo cricket-related productivity issues here in the Portuguese mountains,\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cIt was only necessary to let the morning mist clear before starting, though unfortunately it\u2019s since been too hot for comfort so I\u2019ll wait for it to cool a little - should be around 6 or shortly thereafter.\u201d 23rd over: New Zealand 79-2 (Williamson 35, Taylor 4) Taylor is taking his time to get used to the conditions, which is understandable in the circumstances. But once you promise, you have to pay. 22nd over: New Zealand 77-2 (Williamson 34, Taylor 3) Williamson survives an LBW appeal after pushing outside the line at Chahal. It looked like it was sliding down. This is a difficult spell for New Zealand, with the ball turning more than expected for India\u2019s spinners. \u201cForget a national holiday,\u201d says Kate Andrews-Day, \u201cI\u2019d settle for it actually being watchable in Canada. Right now I\u2019m hacking into my parents-in-law\u2019s cable to see if they have the premium sports package and even then, well. Wish me luck. In other news, Nova Scotia\u2019s cricket team won the Maritimes Cup the other day!\u201d Luck! 21st over: New Zealand 74-2 (Williamson 33, Taylor 2) Jadeja is putting the squeeze on New Zealand. He has conceded only nine runs from his last four overs, a spell that includes the wicket of Nicholls. New Zealand will have to start taking risks pretty soon, ideally once Taylor has his eye in. 20th over: New Zealand 73-2 (Williamson 32, Taylor 2) A gorgeous, drifting legbreak from Chahal beats Williamson\u2019s forward defensive. There\u2019s plenty in this pitch for the spinners. Pandya is back on the field, although he doesn\u2019t look entirely comfortable. The problem is apparently with the hip flexor, not his groin. \u201cI suspect Williamson needs to aim higher than you suggest,\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cIf he chucks it away on 150, I can\u2019t see NZ having much chance.\u201d 19th over: New Zealand 70-2 (Williamson 31, Taylor 1) The new batsman is Ross Taylor, who until now has had a frustratingly modest tournament. I thought Nicholls was bowled through the gate, but replays suggest the ball deflected off his body and onto the stumps. The ball is starting to turn for Jadeja, who gets some more sharp spin to beat Williamson off the last delivery of the over. \u201cThose ICC reserve day rules (09:32) seem quite harsh regarding refunds,\u201d says Smylers. \u201cIf there\u2019s a reserve day and you can\u2019t attend, you simply lose your money; you aren\u2019t even allowed to sell your ticket to somebody who can go. Also, no refund for any game if at least 30 overs bowled, even though 40 are needed for any kind of result. Sometimes it seems like the ICC aren\u2019t even trying to make us like them.\u201d That seems unnecessarily harsh, doesn\u2019t it. That was such a good ball. Jadeja, bowling around the wicket to the left-hander, got one to turn back sharply through the gate to bowl Nicholls as he pushed forward defensively. It was a slightly lazy stroke from Nicholls, I suppose, but it was a lovely bit of bowling. Henry Nicholls is bowled by a jaffa from Ravindra Jadeja! 18th over: New Zealand 69-1 (Nicholls 28, Williamson 31) Yuzvendra Chahal replaces Hardik Pandya. His first ball spins down the leg side for four wides, but it\u2019s a tight over thereafter. \u201cBig call not to play Shami!\u201d says Aditya Anchuri. \u201cI know Bhuvi is steady and better at the death, and probably a better bat, but India need Shami\u2019s firepower. It\u2019s overcast conditions and I do not want us to chase anything over 200.\u201d Yes, I\u2019m sure death bowling is the reason. I\u2019d have been tempted to play both and only one spinner (or two spinners with Jadeja at No7 in place of Karthik). I like Shami a lot but he was mauled by England at the death. 17th over: New Zealand 61-1 (Nicholls 26, Williamson 30) Williamson threads Jadeja through extra cover for three. If Pandya is unable to bowl, India will have to find six overs from their batsmen, probably Virat Kohli. Maybe he\u2019ll get that century after all! \u201cHere in India, my tuition teacher is mysteriously stuck in college and can\u2019t come to teach me,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cMy father\u2019s colleagues (and he himself) are mysteriously sick and can\u2019t go to office today; also, the taxi drivers are mysteriously on an extended lunch break, hence they can\u2019t be on the road... While everyone is formally accepting the aforementioned reasons, one simply knows where everyone is - in front of the telly. Considering this stunning start from India, the Kiwis\u2019 determination to play out the overs safely till lunch, and the comfort of my sofa, I reckon the nation isn\u2019t going to be all that productive today...\u201d I still haven\u2019t forgiven myself for failing to finish my GCSE coursework by 24 March 1992, the day before the deadline, as this would have allowed me to suffer a particularly debilitating migraine on the morning of the World Cup final. 16th over: New Zealand 57-1 (Nicholls 25, Williamson 27) Pandya starts his over with consecutive wides, both on height. He is giving the middle of the pitch a thorough medical. But he might need some treatment himself - he is struggling with what looks like a groin problem, and at the end of the over he leaves the field to receive treatment. India don\u2019t have a sixth bowler today. 15th over: New Zealand 55-1 (Nicholls 25, Williamson 27) Three singles from Jadeja\u2019s third over. He\u2019s a pragmatic inclusion, but I can understand it as he\u2019s a three-dimensional brawler. He\u2019s less likely to take five-for than Kuldeep; he\u2019s also less likely to be pumped repeatedly for six on a bad day. \u201cGiven that I am finding such a difficulty in focussing on my work due to cricket, should they announce a national holiday to improve the viewership of cricket?\u201d asks Balaji Mannu. \u201cOf course I am concerned in increasing the cricket take-up in this country and no sneaky selfishness.\u201d From your email, it doesn\u2019t sound the viewership of cricket is suffering from the lack of a national holiday\u2026 14th over: New Zealand 52-1 (Nicholls 23, Williamson 26) Nicholls is beaten, trying to hook Pandya, and then Williamson gets four with the aid of a misfield from Chahal. India are on top but New Zealand will probably be happier, because it looked like they might be out of the game before drinks. Talking of which, that\u2019s drinks. \u201cI think Kane Williamson has a John McClane look on his face today,\u201d writes Emma John. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a grim hard-set expression I haven\u2019t seen before. Probably from one of the sequels \u2013 one of those \u2018oh god, I\u2019ve got to save everyone all on my own AGAIN\u2019 moments.\u201d Ha, yes. Die Hard 6: Any Chance Somebody Else Could Do It? 13th over: New Zealand 43-1 (Nicholls 19, Williamson 21) Six from Jadeja\u2019s over, all run. Not in one go, obviously: 2x2, 2x1. \u201cMorning, Rob,\u201d says Smylers. \u201cI see you\u2019ve already referenced Neville Oliver and Neville Cardus, so am wondering whom you\u2019re going to quote next. Neville Chamberlain? Neville Neville? Neville Longbottom?\u201d I think we all know where this road leads. 12th over: New Zealand 38-1 (Nicholls 15, Williamson 20) Williamson scolds himself after being beaten by a lifter from Pandya. I was going to say he\u2019s being a bit harsh on himself, as it looked like a fine delivery, until I grudgingly acknowledged that Kane Williamson\u2019s knows a little more about his game, and batsmanship generally, than I do. After three dot balls to start the over, Williamson drags a pull through midwicket for four. This looks a really good surface for batting. 11th over: New Zealand 34-1 (Nicholls 15, Williamson 16) Jadeja replaces Kumar, who bowled a fine opening spell of 5-1-13-0. Nicholls survives a pretty big LBW appeal - it was umpire\u2019s call, and India have lost their review anyway - and then sweeps firmly round the corner for four. It almost hit the leg slip Rohit Sharma in the face. New Zealand have scored 24 from the last four overs; not exactly an orgy of runs, but it\u2019s a start. 10th over: New Zealand 27-1 (Nicholls 10, Williamson 14) Hardik Pandya replaces Bumrah (4-1-10-1). He has been pretty good with the ball in this tournament, although his best work has been with the old ball. New Zealand might target him in this spell. Williamson steals a second off his first delivery - he was almost one short - but that\u2019s the summit of New Zealand\u2019s ambition in Pandya\u2019s first over. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cHaving been strangely motivated yesterday and even this morning, I came in from my summer project - \u2018clearing out and painting the garage\u2019 - at 10.30 for a tea break, and as yet, for some reason, I\u2019ve not been able to motivate myself to resume. In fact, I\u2019m now thinking that the garage does not share my ambitions. Maybe, like Rafa or Jos\u00e9, I need a new \u2018project\u2019..?\u201d I suspect the attic could match your ambitions. In fact there are rumours it wants to tie you down on a four-year contract. 9th over: New Zealand 23-1 (Nicholls 10, Williamson 12) Now Williamson gets his first boundary, timing a push down the ground off boundary. That was a very pleasant stroke. After a very slow start, New Zealand will feel they are up and running It hasn\u2019t been difficult for the batsmen to survive, with only a few deliveries moving off the pitch or in the air, but so far India\u2019s bowlers have given them little to work with. \u201cIt\u2019s all about Kane, isn\u2019t it, Rob?\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cIsn\u2019t it always? Imagine actually knowing the man.... India are a formidable cricket machine, but for every neutral out there (ok, Kiwi fan) I desperately want this to be a competitive game. The fact it\u2019s 15 minutes\u2019 walk from my office and I\u2019m sat at my desk is utter torture.\u201d 8th over: New Zealand 18-1 (Nicholls 10, Williamson 7) Nicholls cloths a pull stroke off Bumrah that just clears square leg. Batting is all about calculating risk; trouble is there are times when every attacking stroke off Bumrah feels too risky for comfort. The penultimate ball of Bumrah\u2019s fourth over, bowled from around the wicket, snaps dramatically off the seam to beat Nicholls. His response is impressive, a beautifully timed drive through extra cover for four. That\u2019s the first boundary of the match. \u201cDear Rob,\u201d says Dave Seare. \u201cToday might have been the day to put the opposition in. The pitch at Old Trafford has remained more consistent than other grounds for chasing a total and the New Zealand seamers could have used the opportunity to get to India\u2019s middle order before too much damage was done at the top.\u201d Yes, I think I\u2019d have bowled first. That said, there was plenty of logic in Williamson\u2019s decision. 7th over: New Zealand 10-1 (Nicholls 3, Williamson 6) The accuracy of India\u2019s new-ball bowlers has been beyond reproach, and Kumar concedes only two from his seventh over. It\u2019s been a near-perfect start. In other news, Tanya Aldred is in charge of our county blog. 6th over: New Zealand 8-1 (Nicholls 3, Williamson 4) Kane Williamson has only one job: to score 150 not out. Although he would have liked to spend a bit longer in the dressing-room, his presence in the middle has given the New Zealand a strong dose of diazepam. The run-rate is still less than ideal, but I think they will settle for seeing off this first spell from Bumrah. His figures are 3-1-2-1. \u201cIf anyone wants the perfect potted analysis of New Zealand at this World Cup, can I recommend Simon Doull on our latest Spin podcast?\u201d writes the all-Spinning, all-dancing Emma John. \u201cHe absolutely nails their batting in 30 seconds. There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s my favourite Kiwi analyst! Skip to 31.24 to hear him\u2026 Or you could, y\u2019know, listen to the whole thing and enjoy Andy Bull being very funny about his own World Cup predictions, and Raf Nicholson explaining why England Women have been so awful against Australia.\u201d 5th over: New Zealand 7-1 (Nicholls 3, Williamson 3) Nicholls gets off the mark from his tenth delivery. I wonder if Kane Williamson regrets batting first. It was the safe option, certainly, and I\u2019m not sure that suits New Zealand given their current mental state. Here\u2019s a statgasm to blow away the morning cobwebs. New Zealand are seven for one after five overs. At the same stage of the 2015 semi-final, they were 71 for none. \u201cGood afternoon from India, mate,\u201d says Amod Paranjape. \u201cWhile me and the other oldies are calling for restraint in India, the new generation is behaving as if India is already in the final. This is nuts.\u201d \u2018Lads, it\u2019s New Zealand. No, lads, it\u2019s New Zealand.\u2019 4th over: New Zealand 2-1 (Nicholls 0, Williamson 1) The new batsman is the New Zealand opener Kane Williamson. He is beaten outside off stump by his first delivery., which prompts Kohli to bring in an extra catcher. \u201cWhat\u2019s the longest time in an ODI without a run being scored?\u201d asks Danielle Tolson. \u201cNZ on tenterhooks by the way...\u201d It\u2019s a lot more than 17 balls, I wouldn\u2019t worry. If you think this is a slow start, get a load of England in their de facto quarter-final 12 years ago. It was a brilliant catch from Virat Kohli at second slip. Guptill fished at a sharp lifter that flew off the edge towards second slip, where Kohli took a very smart catch in front of his face. He almost moved too far across, towards first slip, and had to reach in the opposite direction to grab it with both hands. He enjoyed that. Jasprit Bumrah puts Martin Guptill out of his misery - certainly today, possibly in the tournament. 3rd over: New Zealand 1-0 (Guptill 1, Nicholls 0) Guptill has had a weird World Cup, with all kinds of unusual dismissals. But even though he is in dreadful form, India will fear him because he has the capacity to go huge. Getting off the mark would be a start - and he does, eventually, by scoring New Zealand\u2019s first run off the 17th ball of the match. \u201cSixteen out of last 20 wins for side batting first certainly sounds impressive, statistically speaking,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cBut what about all the games in the tournament, and how often was the team batting first favourite to win anyway? I\u2019d really love to do the research, but laptop and tablet are currently otherwise engaged in monthly timesheet activity for my Excel-dilettante cricket coaching son.\u201d I\u2019ll have a dissertation to you by 1pm. 2nd over: New Zealand 0-0 (Guptill 0, Nicholls 0) The extraordinary Jasprit Bumrah beats Henry Nicholls with his second delivery. His line and length are immaculate, right from the start, and he also starts with a maiden. It wasn\u2019t the worst toss for India to lose, and they have started splendidly. \u201cI think it\u2019s been a good tournament,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves, \u201cbut that might be my bias towards Eoin Morgan, whom I think is massively admirable for attitude, leadership skills and leg-side blamming, and what I think might be the most exciting, balanced, \u2018nice bunch of fellas\u2019 England team for a while. Shine on Harvest Moon.\u201d 1st over: New Zealand 0-0 (Guptill 0, Nicholls 0) The consensus is that this is an excellent batting pitch. There\u2019s some swing for Kumar, however, and Guptill is beaten later in the over when he gropes at a wider outswinger. A maiden to start. In fact it was missing leg stump, so Guptill survives and India lose their review. That would have been his third golden duck of the tournament. Quite a start, this. Guptill pushed around his front pad at Bhuvneshwar Kumar and survived a huge LBW shout. Virat Kohli reviewed with three seconds remaining. It was close, perilously close, but I reckon this will umpire\u2019s call at best for India. The anthems are done, the India players are in their pre-match huddle. In the words of Neville Cardus, let\u2019s get ready to rumble. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Nick Parish. \u201cI present three of your own comments for your learned perusal. First, New Zealand are the only team to reach the semi-finals of the last four World Cups. Second, New Zealand have never won the World Cup. Third, New Zealand have spent decades showing the folly of underestimating them. I\u2019d argue that given the first, the second refutes the third. Discuss.\u201d I\u2019m not sure it refutes it, but I suppose it discredits it. But they are the most underrated/patronised team in world cricket. \u201cWhilst NZ\u2019s slump in the past couple of weeks, the positive has to be that the players who looked to be struggling for form in the earlier weeks \u2013 Neesham, de Grandhomme and even Latham \u2013 seem to be hitting their straps now,\u201d says Richard O\u2019Hagan. \u201cIf Henry could just do the same they\u2019ll be in with a real chance. And surely the fates won\u2019t allow the CWC careers of Taylor and Guptill to end on a rainy Tuesday in Manchester? Or am I just grasping at straws here?\u201d You are, but just look at those straws! I don\u2019t think this game is a foregone conclusion, though India are clear favourites. Everyone thinks they are going to lose, so New Zealand should treat it as a freebie \u2013 stop worrying and, this being Old Trafford, attack attack attack. India prefer Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Yuzvendra Chahal to Mohammad Shami and Kuldeep Yadav. Ravindra Jadeja also keeps his place. New Zealand\u2019s team is as expected, with Lockie Ferguson returning from injury to replace Tim Southee.. India Rohit, Rahul, Kohli (c), Pant, Dhoni (wk), Pandya, Karthik, Jadeja, Kumar, Chahal, Bumrah. New Zealand Guptill, Nicholls, Williamson (c), Taylor, Latham (wk), Neesham, de Grandhomme, Santner, Henry, Ferguson, Boult. Kane Williamson says he considered bowling because of the overhead conditions, but that it looks like a good surface. Runs on the board, etc, etc. Virat Kohli says he would have also have batted first. \u201cGood Morning Rob!\u201d says Kevin Usher. \u201cLong time listener, first time caller... Given that it occurs after both semi-finals are over (English weather notwithstanding), and two days before the final itself, what\u2019s the significance of the draw on Friday?\u201d It\u2019s an in-joke, with myself, based on the below from Vic Marks in the Observer in 1993. On the field the Australians have humbled us; the Oval excepted, the cricket has been too one-sided to provoke prolonged excitement over the airwaves. Hence there have been more japes than usual and we can takr solace in at least one minor English victory. It took place at Edgbaston when Baxter passed a note to Neville Oliver on air, which he dutifully read out - \u201cThere will be full coverage of the NatWest semi-finals on Tuesday, and on Wednesday the draw for the final will be made live on Radio 5\u201d. The first email \u201cIt is good to start a knockout match as underdogs,\u201d says Krishnamoorthy V. \u201cAn early loss of Rohit Sharma and some tight bowling will send India into a panic. NZ should try starting with a spinner (a la Dipak Patel in 1992).\u201d I wouldn\u2019t do that today \u2013 these look like great swing-bowling conditions. Links. Lots of links It\u2019s been a bat-first tournament - 16 of the last 20 games have been won that way - but New Zealand must be tempted to bowl first if they win the toss. It\u2019s overcast, which suits Trent Boult, and their best chance of winning the game is probably to put India in and take early wickets. That\u2019s the only consideration, right? The weather forecast isn\u2019t the best: cloudy turning to light rain at lunchtime. There is a reserve day for both semi-finals, although they are a last resort. We could still have, for example, a 20-over match today or on Thursday. This explains it in a little more detail, although it doesn\u2019t completely satisfy me that there is no potential for farce. Good morning. The Cricket World Cup is the tournament that always leaves the audience wanting less. The group stages are a tough mudder for supporters \u2013 a draining test of endurance, nerve, commitment, caffeine levels and ability to understand how net run-rate works. They must be quite hard to play in as well. The group stages were good to middling, saved by Sri Lanka\u2019s win over England. But now, after 40 days and 41 matches, we\u2019ve reached the really good bit: the knockout stages. India play New Zealand in the first semi-final at Old Trafford today. Then, on Thursday at Edgbaston, Australia and England will compare testosterone levels. The draw for the final will take place on Friday, with the two teams meeting at Lord\u2019s on Sunday. We will either have a familiar winner of the tournament (Australia for the sixth time, India for the third) or a new one. New Zealand and England have never won the World Cup, as you may have have heard one of two million times in the last six weeks. New Zealand are at least the world champions of consistency. They are the only team to reach the semi-finals at the last four World Cups, and if they win today they will reach their second final in a row. We\u2019re all friends, so let\u2019s speak frankly: nobody really gives New Zealand a prayer today. That, I suspect, is more down to form than the predilection to underestimate a team who have spent decades showing the folly of underestimating them. New Zealand lost their last three games in the league stage, and a number of their players have had poor tournament. Their hope comes in the form of Kane Williamson, Trent Boult and Lockie Ferguson, all potential matchwinners, and the fact they hammered India in a warm-up match at the end of May. The league match between the two sides was rained off, so there are no clues there. India managed to finish top of the league without being quite at their best. Jasprit Bumrah and Rohit Sharma were immense, but Virat Kohli didn\u2019t score a century (he\u2019s still averaging 63 in the tournament) and they have yet to settle on their preferred XI. Maybe they never will. Time is running out, but in a good way. India \u2013 and the other three semi-finalists \u2013 are only two games away from winning the World Cup. Today\u2019s match starts at 10.30am local time, 3pm in Mumbai, 9.30pm in Wellington.",

      "body": "<p>Parents at a Catholic primary school have launched legal action in an attempt to halt academisation after the local bishop said he wanted all Catholic schools in the diocese to convert and join a multi-academy trust (Mat).</p> \n<p>Our Lady of Lourdes (OLOL) primary in Wanstead, east London, is due to become an academy in September as part of the first wave of Catholic schools in the diocese of Brentwood to academise. A second group are due to follow in September 2020.</p> \n<p>Campaigners say about 70 Catholic schools in the diocese, which covers Essex and the London boroughs of Redbridge, Waltham Forest, Newham, Havering, and Barking and Dagenham are affected by the bishop\u2019s policy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2ebf8d4a-60fa-4ce5-afec-82e998d1c05d\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>What is forced academisation?</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cForced academisation\u201d describes how a state school in England is compelled to change its legal status from a school overseen by a local authority to that of an academy, and to accept new management by an academy trust.</p>\n    <p><b>How is it triggered?</b></p>\n    <p>Forced academisation is an order issued by the Department for Education (DfE). A school is forced to become an academy if it is \u201celigible for intervention\u201d under law. The order is triggered by a school being classed as inadequate by Ofsted. Previously it could also be triggered by poor performances in exams but that condition was dropped by the education secretary, Damian Hinds, in 2018.</p>\n    <p><b>Do parents get any say in the matter?</b></p>\n    <p>No. Governing bodies, parents and councils get no input in the DfE\u2019s intervention to force academisation. They also have no say in which trust the school is forced to join, meaning the chain may be based hundreds of miles away. Critics say this is a derogation of local democracy.</p>\n    <p><b>What happens to the school?</b></p>\n    <p>The school\u2019s legal relationship becomes a contract between the trust that manages it and the DfE, cutting ties with local authorities. The school\u2019s land and buildings are effectively leased to the trust. Head teachers are stripped of their autonomy, with budget and staffing decisions made by the trust. In most cases the school\u2019s existing leadership is dismissed. The school\u2019s governors lose legal responsibilities, and there is no requirement for trusts to consult with parents. Often the school is renamed and a new uniform adopted. The trust retains a proportion of the school\u2019s funding for its administration and executive costs.</p>\n    <p><b>Does forced academisation improve schools?</b></p>\n    <p>There is little evidence either way. Previously, three-quarters of schools rated as inadequate by Ofsted later improved without forced academisation. The National Audit Office has concluded there is a lack of capable Mats able to improve schools in difficulty.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Three OLOL parents have decided to challenge the decision made by their school\u2019s governing body to convert and join the Good Shepherd Mat, claiming the consultation process was \u201cunlawful\u201d, that information was not shared with parents and their views were not taken into account. They also say the governing body had no choice in the matter, as the decision to convert had already been made.</p> \n<p>Solicitors acting for the parent have sent a pre-action protocol letter to the governing body\u2019s lawyers, informing them of their intention to seek a judicial review to halt the academisation process to enable \u201ca meaningful and lawful consultation\u201d.</p> \n<p>Vicky Taylor, a former teacher who has two sons at the school, said: \u201cParents have only ever wanted a fair, open and meaningful consultation. Everybody supports the school.

      "bodyText": "Parents at a Catholic primary school have launched legal action in an attempt to halt academisation after the local bishop said he wanted all Catholic schools in the diocese to convert and join a multi-academy trust (Mat). Our Lady of Lourdes (OLOL) primary in Wanstead, east London, is due to become an academy in September as part of the first wave of Catholic schools in the diocese of Brentwood to academise. A second group are due to follow in September 2020. Campaigners say about 70 Catholic schools in the diocese, which covers Essex and the London boroughs of Redbridge, Waltham Forest, Newham, Havering, and Barking and Dagenham are affected by the bishop\u2019s policy. Three OLOL parents have decided to challenge the decision made by their school\u2019s governing body to convert and join the Good Shepherd Mat, claiming the consultation process was \u201cunlawful\u201d, that information was not shared with parents and their views were not taken into account. They also say the governing body had no choice in the matter, as the decision to convert had already been made. Solicitors acting for the parent have sent a pre-action protocol letter to the governing body\u2019s lawyers, informing them of their intention to seek a judicial review to halt the academisation process to enable \u201ca meaningful and lawful consultation\u201d. Vicky Taylor, a former teacher who has two sons at the school, said: \u201cParents have only ever wanted a fair, open and meaningful consultation. Everybody supports the school. We want the opportunity for everything to be shared fairly and our views heard.\u201d Not all parents at the school oppose academisation. Taylor is due to take part in an education rally at Redbridge town hall in Ilford on Wednesday evening, which will raise concerns about school funding cuts in the borough, as well as about academisation. The campaign is one of a number taking place across England, including Waltham Holy Cross primary in Essex, which recently received a temporary reprieve to enable further building work, and Peacehaven community school in East Sussex, where parents and teachers are resisting academisation. The original Catholic academies plan in Brentwood was outlined in a letter from the Right Rev Alan Williams, the bishop of Brentwood, in which he declared he wanted to develop deanery-based Catholic Mats. It was posted on the school website and read out at mass across the diocese on 9 September last year. A position statement posted later on the diocese website said: \u201cOur emphasis on local deanery-based Catholic Mats is borne out of our belief that this provides the best long-term sustainable platform for our schools to work together and to continue to thrive.\u201d It acknowledges the need to consult both staff and the school community. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring that full and accurate information is provided to staff and parents and that this acknowledges the range of opinions and research carried out about academies, education, Catholic Mats and the future of our schools.\u201d A spokeswoman for the diocese of Brentwood said it was unable to comment on the legal action. She said a number of schools were already part of Mats and 10 more schools were becoming academies in September. In a statement released at the end of last year, Robert Simpson, the director of education for the diocese, said: \u201cAll schools in the diocese of Brentwood are under the authority of the bishop, and it\u2019s his informed decision to move forward with these plans, thus moving the diocese in line with the prevailing national trend towards academisation.\u201d A statement from the parents said they had tried to encourage a meaningful consultation. \u201cThe governing body has in return responded only with empty promises and extended periods of silence and has even publicly stated that they were not given any choice but to ratify the will of the diocese.\u201d The OLOL governing body and the diocese were both approached for comment. The National Education Union (NEU), which is due to take part in the Redbridge rally, said: \u201cCurrently Catholic schools are part of the local community of schools but retain their distinct ethos and values. The NEU cannot see what is to be gained forcing schools to comply with the bishop\u2019s will that all schools will, eventually, join a Mat.\u201d",

Sterling lost more than half a cent to fall as low as $1.245 against the dollar on Tuesday, continuing a slide on the foreign exchanges under way since Theresa May triggered the Conservative leadership race early last month.

Manuel Pellegrini was desperate to land G\u00f3mez after allowing Marko Arnautovic to join Shanghai SIPG for \u20ac25m this week and West Ham were prepared to break their transfer record to sign the 22-year-old striker for \u20ac50m (\u00a344.5m). However G\u00f3mez has long favoured a move to Valencia, who can offer Champions League football, and it is understood the La Liga club struck a deal with Vigo on Tuesday afternoon. They will pay in the region of \u20ac16m and also send Santi Mina and loan Jorge S\u00e1enz to Vigo. G\u00f3mez\u2019s contract contains a \u20ac50m release clause. Although West Ham were willing to part with that, La Liga rules state the sum must be paid in full to trigger the clause. West Ham wanted to pay in instalments and have struggled to reach an agreement with Vigo, who are under no obligation to accept those terms. Pellegrini will move quickly to identify new targets. Along with allowing Arnautovic to move to the Chinese Super League West Ham have sold Lucas P\u00e9rez to Alav\u00e9s and released Andy Carroll, leaving Jordan Hugill and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez as their only recognised forwards. However, they are unlikely to move for Callum Wilson. It is understood that Bournemouth want \u00a370m for the England striker. Villarreal have signed Alberto Moreno on a five-year contract after the left-back\u2019s release by Liverpool.",

If \u20ac365 tickets manage to increase the number of people using public transport, network providers also need to buy bigger or longer trains and pay for them to shuttle people across the city at shorter intervals.</p> <p>In Vienna\u2019s case, Wiener Linien receives \u20ac700m in subsidies from the city and the national government a year. Two measures have helped to stem the cost: raising parking fines by 60% since 2012; and a \u201csubway tax\u201d for employers, which amounts to about \u20ac2 a month for each employee.</p> <p>In the \u201ccar nation\u201d of Germany, there are concerns that cities either lack the means to subsidise a switch to public transport, or that citizens are more reluctant to part with their vehicles.</p> <p>In Bonn, only 5,258 out of 17,000 available \u20ac365 season tickets have been taken up since the two-year trial was introduced on 1 January. A spokesperson for the local transport network said it expected uptake to increase as old season tickets ran out over the course of the coming months. But the trial has already illustrated the scale of the challenge: a permanent offer of \u20ac1-a-day travel would cost a relatively small city like Bonn an additional \u20ac23m a year.</p> <p>In Berlin, a similar scheme would come with additional annual costs of about \u20ac100m, according to the newspaper Tagesspiegel. The Green party, a junior coalition partner in the city government, has voiced reservations about M\u00fcller\u2019s proposal.</p> <p>\u201cThe proposal came as a surprise,\u201d a transport spokesman, Harald Moritz, told Berliner Zeitung. \u201cSomehow you have to make up the difference \u2013 and for now that would fall on the taxpayer.\u201d</p>",

If \u20ac365 tickets manage to increase the number of people using public transport, network providers also need to buy bigger or longer trains and pay for them to shuttle people across the city at shorter intervals. In Vienna\u2019s case, Wiener Linien receives \u20ac700m in subsidies from the city and the national government a year. Two measures have helped to stem the cost: raising parking fines by 60% since 2012; and a \u201csubway tax\u201d for employers, which amounts to about \u20ac2 a month for each employee. In the \u201ccar nation\u201d of Germany, there are concerns that cities either lack the means to subsidise a switch to public transport, or that citizens are more reluctant to part with their vehicles. In Bonn, only 5,258 out of 17,000 available \u20ac365 season tickets have been taken up since the two-year trial was introduced on 1 January. A spokesperson for the local transport network said it expected uptake to increase as old season tickets ran out over the course of the coming months. But the trial has already illustrated the scale of the challenge: a permanent offer of \u20ac1-a-day travel would cost a relatively small city like Bonn an additional \u20ac23m a year. In Berlin, a similar scheme would come with additional annual costs of about \u20ac100m, according to the newspaper Tagesspiegel. The Green party, a junior coalition partner in the city government, has voiced reservations about M\u00fcller\u2019s proposal. \u201cThe proposal came as a surprise,\u201d a transport spokesman, Harald Moritz, told Berliner Zeitung. \u201cSomehow you have to make up the difference \u2013 and for now that would fall on the taxpayer.\u201d",

Any fears that the queue\u2019s days were numbered \u2013 to be replaced by digital technology \u2013 were allayed this week by Richard Lewis, the chief executive of the All England Club. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t consider using [technology] for the queue, because we get such great feedback on it,\u201d he said, describing the queue as one of Wimbledon\u2019s \u201cgreat traditions\u201d. Mariska Oosterhuis, from the Netherlands, has been camping for nine days, packing her tent up each morning at 5.30am \u2013 and queuing to hand it in at the storage facility \u2013 before rejoining the queue for tickets. \u201cThe atmosphere is really nice, because it is tennis fans together,\u201d she says. \u201cWe chat about tennis and get to know new people every year.\u201d She has taken out a membership for a month at a nearby gym so she has somewhere to have a shower and change clothes. \u201cWe eat in the queue, or get a takeaway and eat in front of the tent.\u201d Queuers can\u2019t leave their spot for more than 30 minutes, but Oosterhuis says there is time to grab something to eat nearby. This year is Zac Sheppard\u2019s first time at Wimbledon. He and a friend decided to head down and \u201cgive it a go\u201d: \u201cWe\u2019d heard about this legendary queue and how fun it is. It was a good atmosphere. We were pitched up next to people who had been doing it for years, who were much older than us, so you meet people from all walks of life.\u201d They arrived at 3pm on Thursday, stayed overnight in their tent and were woken by stewards at about 5am. \u201cWhat surprised me was how well-organised it is. They give you a number, you never feel that rushed, everyone knows what they\u2019re meant to be doing.\u201d They got Centre Court tickets. This is Tani Christians\u2019 seventh year camping at Wimbledon. \u201cI queue for Roger Federer\u2019s matches,\u201d she says. \u201cI queued from Saturday for his first match on Tuesday, then after the match you run back to the queue and start again for the next match. It\u2019s very nice to hang out with other fans, but it\u2019s very tiring, too. You don\u2019t sleep much and it\u2019s hard to get a decent meal or a shower.\u201d She has rented a room at a nearby B&amp;B to have a quick shower. Nonetheless, she doesn\u2019t think she would prefer a digital system. \u201cThe queue is special. I enjoy it.\u201d",

There was a welcome commitment in Labour\u2019s last manifesto to add VAT to private school fees, but the impact of this will be minimal and certainly won\u2019t hasten the demise of private schools. Labour\u2019s pledge to create a National Education Service is exciting. The party has published a National Education Service charter that commits it to \u201ctackling structural, cultural and individual barriers which cause and perpetuate inequality\u201d. Earlier this year, Corbyn quite rightly pledged to focus on promoting social justice rather than social mobility, but I was bemused by the silence on private schools. How, precisely, does one tackle structural inequalities in England without phasing out private schools? Are we serious about these inequalities or just tinkering? In the past Labour has missed opportunities to integrate private schools into the state sector \u2013 we can\u2019t let that happen again. That\u2019s why we have launched the Labour Against Private Schools campaign. Our first goal is to make the full integration of private schools into the state education system official party policy, by getting a motion passed in support of this at Labour\u2019s annual conference this September. There are models of excellent education systems that exist without private schools. Finland is often held up as a system that consistently achieves some of the best educational outcomes across Europe and the OECD countries. In Finland, private schools were effectively brought into the comprehensive education system over the course of a decade. It is time England started to seriously plan a school system without private schools, so that in the future teachers like me can look their students in the eye and tell them that this country has removed one of the biggest barriers that the richest people erected to unfairly advantage their progeny. So I am proud to tell my students that I am a founding member of the Labour Against Private Schools campaign, and that I will do everything I can to encourage the Labour leadership to commit to dismantling the private schools sector that continues to uphold gross levels of inequality in this country. \u2022 Steven Longden is a Manchester secondary school teacher, a Trafford councillor and executive member of the Socialist Education Association.",

      "bodyText": "MPs have voted resoundingly to extend same-sex marriage and access to abortion to Northern Ireland, bringing the region into line with the rest of the UK on the two significant social issues. The two historic votes, arriving within little more than a quarter of an hour of each other, were greeted ecstatically by equalities campaigners. With ministers promising to respect the results, they could have vital repercussions for people in Northern Ireland. Both were the culmination of long campaigns by backbench Labour MPs, who said the government\u2019s argument that the changes could only be made by the devolved Northern Irish government was defunct, given it has been suspended amid political deadlock since the start of 2017. The changes came via amendments to an otherwise technical government bill connected to budgets and elections for the devolved assembly. In the first amendment, tabled by the Labour MP Conor McGinn, a longstanding campaigner for equal marriage in Northern Ireland, the Commons voted 383 to 73 to extend it to the region. In a vote soon afterwards, MPs approved an amendment by another Labour MP, Stella Creasy, to extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK where it remains illegal. The vote was passed by 332 to 99. Both were free votes as they were viewed as matters of conscience. While the Northern Ireland minister, John Penrose, who spoke for the government, warned MPs that both potential changes would be fraught with complications, he voted in favour of both amendments. McGinn\u2019s amendment would theoretically lead to an automatic change in the law within three months if the devolved government remained stalled, although Penrose warned it might take longer owing to legal practicalities. If and when the region\u2019s executive is revived, it can then approve or repeal the measure. McGinn credited the work of Love Equality, a Northern Irish campaign for equal marriage, and said LGBT people in the region had been \u201clet down so many times before\u201d. The MP, who comes from Northern Ireland but represents St Helens North in the Commons, said he hoped the devolved executive and assembly would be working again within the three-month deadline and would make the change. \u201cBut if Stormont still isn\u2019t functioning by then, the LGBT community in Northern Ireland will know that Westminster will act to ensure equality and respect for all citizens, and finally give them the right to marry the person they love,\u201d he said. Creasy\u2019s amendment argued that abortion laws in Northern Ireland, where women seeking a termination can face life imprisonment, were contrary to international human rights norms. \u201cHow much longer are the women of Northern Ireland expected to wait?\u201d she told MPs. \u201cHow much more are they expected to suffer before we speak up \u2013 the best of what this place does \u2013 as human rights defenders, not human rights deniers?\u201d After the vote, Creasy tweeted: \u201cThank you to everyone who today stood up for equality in Northern Ireland \u2013 whether for same-sex marriage or abortion, today we have said everyone in the UK deserves to be treated as an equal. There\u2019s a road to go yet but today a big step forward.\u201d Both votes were also hailed by rights groups. Amnesty International\u2019s Northern Ireland director, Patrick Corrigan, said the equal marriage decision was \u201ca day for the history books\u201d. Marie Stopes UK, which campaigns on access to abortion, said the Creasy amendment marked \u201ca historic day for women\u2019s rights\u201d. Amid a flurry of amendments tabled, another one which passed has a very different impact: it makes it potentially harder for a future government to prorogue parliament so as to ensure a no-deal Brexit. The amendment, by the remain-minded Tory MP Dominic Grieve, would require a minister to report to the Commons every two weeks until December on the progress of talks on restoring the Northern Ireland assembly. It passed by a single vote: 294 to 293. The idea is that the legal requirement for these regular reports would stop a new prime minister suspending parliament to prevent MPs blocking no deal, something Boris Johnson has refused to rule out. Before the equal marriage and abortion votes, Penrose said the government would honour the results, despite ministerial doubts. \u201cShould this pass it will go into law,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will become part of primary legislation. And so ministers will be bound by it and the government will proceed.\u201d In Northern Ireland, the votes were welcomed by the centrist Alliance party and the moderate nationalist SDLP, but Unionist leaders reacted angrily. Nigel Dodds, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) leader in Westminster, warned before the votes that they would drive \u201ca coach and horses through the principle of devolution\u201d. Jim Allister, the leader of the small Traditional Unionist Voice party, urged the DUP to use the leverage of its confidence-and-supply agreement with the Conservative government to \u201cthwart\u201d the MPs\u2019 decisions. The votes could also affect efforts to revive the executive and assembly at Stormont. While Naomi Long, the Alliance leader, said they could unlock the talks, others speculated that Sinn F\u00e9in, which supports social liberalisation, now has an incentive to delay the restoration of devolution to let the amendments take effect.",

Although steel forks are heaver, they have as an advantage a very benign failure mode. Under load steel bends a bit and then springs back. If you keep bending it too much it will - eventually - fatigue and crack, but the crack will be gradual and the bike will handle more and more oddly - and chances are you\u2019ll notice it before it finally gives way.</p> <p>\u201cAluminium and carbon have much more spectacular failure modes in which they both essentially fail spontaneously. I think. So in summary (and I\u2019m neither a lawyer nor a material scientist) a steel fork will probably last as long as you, assuming you don\u2019t do anything daft with it, and even if it starts to fail, it will do so gently.</p> <p>\u201cAn aluminium or carbon fork will theoretically last just as long, but if it does fail it will basically just collapse, leading to unpleasantness with which Ian is familiar.

      "bodyText": "Alexander Kristoff speaks Talking to Eurosport, the runner-up says he got a perfect lead-out and had conserved energy during the stage, but that he was beaten by a better man on the day. \u201cTo be second, I am proud of that but hopefully I wiull get one stage,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I had just had a little bit extra I would have won it, but unfortunately Viviani was a little bit stronger today.\u201d 1. Elia Viviani 2. Alexander Kristoff 3. Caleb Ewan 4. Peter Sagan 5. Dylan Groenewegen Elia Viviani wins on the perfect lead-out from his team. Not for the first time in this race, Dylan Groenewegen lost his lead-out man, Mike Teunissen, in the closing stages, which appeared to stymie any chance he had of winning. Viviani takes his first ever Tour de France stage win. Hmmm! After waiting all day for that sprint finish, it was slightly tempered by the fact that Viviani was barely in shot as the denouement played out, filmed by a camera facing the finish line head on. WIth 200 metres to go, the riders still couldn\u2019t see the finish line, but it was Kristoff who blinked first. He was in the middle of the road with Sagan and Ewan, while Viviani snuck up on the rail, in the shadows, got his wheel in front and managed to keep it there. Viviani wins for Quick Step: Elia Viviani wins the stage, coming up on the inside to win by half-a wheel from - I think - Alexander Kristoff. Caleb Ewan was third and Peter Sagan was fourth. Elia Viviani wins the sprint from - I think - Kristoff. 1 km to go: Around one side of a massive roundabout they go, with Jumbo-Visna at the front keeping the pace high for Dylan Groenewegen. 2km to go: The road narrows again, then widens again, then narrows again, the riders getting squeezed accordingly. 4km to go: Team Ineos take over at the front with the riders of Cofidis alongside them. There\u2019s a big roundabout ahoy as they speed along the road, which has widened again. 5km to go: Calmejane still has a lead of a couple of seconds - nope, he\u2019s caught. There\u2019s a fairly sharp right to negotiate and Lotto Soudal are best placed as they swing around it, maintaining a very high pace. 6km to go: The road remains wide and there\u2019s several teams fanned across it as they head towards the pinch point they\u2019ll have to squeeze into with about 1.5km to go. 11km to go: Lilian Calmejane of Team Total Direct Energie attacks off the front of the peloton and puts a few seconds between him and the bunch on a downhill. He opens a gap of about seven seconds on the wide road then takes a sharp left with the bunch in hot pursuit. 11 km to go: Unsurprisingly, Michael Schar has been designated the most aggressive rider of the day. An email: This epic, from Nick. \u201cIf Ian\u2019s friends forks failed in the past five years I\u2019m going to guess they were not steel, as most bikes now have aluminium or carbon forks - because they can be made lighter,\u201d he writes. \u201cIan\u2019s 1990\u2019s Peugeot will probably have steel forks. Although steel forks are heaver, they have as an advantage a very benign failure mode. Under load steel bends a bit and then springs back. If you keep bending it too much it will - eventually - fatigue and crack, but the crack will be gradual and the bike will handle more and more oddly - and chances are you\u2019ll notice it before it finally gives way. \u201cAluminium and carbon have much more spectacular failure modes in which they both essentially fail spontaneously. I think. So in summary (and I\u2019m neither a lawyer nor a material scientist) a steel fork will probably last as long as you, assuming you don\u2019t do anything daft with it, and even if it starts to fail, it will do so gently. \u201cAn aluminium or carbon fork will theoretically last just as long, but if it does fail it will basically just collapse, leading to unpleasantness with which Ian is familiar. Hope your friend is on the mend. I have a 1979 Peugeot in the shed, and if it didn\u2019t have too much rust in the bottom bracket threads for me to get a new one in, I\u2019d ride it without a second thought.\u201d Well, every day\u2019s a school day. My question, Nick, is if you\u2019re neither a lawyer nor a material scientist, what the hell do you do?!?!?! 15km to go: The peloton are riding into a headwind and Sunweb rider Nico Roche has a go at one of his team-mates for not doing a long enough turn on the front. 16km to go: Team Sunweb take over at the front of the bunch as Schar is swallowed up and promptly dumped out the back. He\u2019ll win today\u2019s combativity award, you\u2019d imagine. 17km to go: Michael Schar drops Frederick Backaert, who is caught by the bunch. Schar leads the chasing posse by just 12 seconds on the second and final classified climb of the day. Behind him, the members of Team Ineos have massed at the front of the bunch. An email: \u201cI would rely upon metallurgists and engineers to address steel failure or manufacturing malpractice,\u201d writes Dale, in response to my query about Ian Lafford\u2019s mate\u2019s accident (15.57). \u201cAll metals can and will fail eventually, but steel is quite elastic and tends to reveal an impending failure well before the event. Since the failure was at the junction of the fork blades and crown, I would guess either (1) previous incident or (2) manufacturing defect. When that is sorted, the lawyer may step in.\u201d 20km to go: Schar and Backaert pass through a designated litter collection zone. A man with a social conscience, Schar empties his jersey pockets of empty wrappers and chucks them to one side. His travelling companion doesn\u2019t bother. An email: \u201cI was just wondering what the riders do with the Yellow Jersey they are given to at the podium,\u201d\u201d writes Keats from New Jersey. \u201cWith the yellow jersey\u2019s zipper at the back of the jersey rather than the front, I don\u2019t think the jersey is usable at all.\u201d I\u2019m not sure, Keats. Maybe they use it to wash the car or bike instead of a sponge! However, I would guess, given it\u2019s one of the most iconic garments in all of sport, they probably get around to having it mounted in a frame or presentation case and then proudly display it somewhere. 26km to go: With a flick of his elbow, Schar invites Backaert to do a turn in front and the Belgian reluctantly agrees. 28km to go: Our three man breakaway is now a two-man breakaway. Yoann Olfredo has thrown in the towel ands is about to be caught by the by the bunch following an attack by Schar. Frederik Backaert is still on Schar\u2019s wheel and the latter\u2019s sudden burst of enthusiasm means the gap is now back out to 44 seconds. An email: \u201cDo you ever worry about the safety of your classic 1980s De Rosa?\u201d asks Ian Lafford of Gareth Thomas (15:25). \u201cI\u2019ve been happily riding around on a classic 1990s Peugeot, but have started worrying about metal fatigue having attended the scene of a friend\u2019s crash recently. With no warning, his front fork snapped cleanly off at the bottom of the steerer, planting him face-first into the road and leaving him with pretty horrific injuries. His bike was only five years old, though it may well have done more miles than mine has in 25.\u201d That sounds thoroughly unpleasant. As a matter of curiosity, would anyone who knows more about the legal business than I do happen to know if one can sue the bike manufacturer for trauma, medical expenses, wages lost through time off work and all the rest in the event of an accident like that? 32km to go: Thibaut Pinot punctures and gets a new front wheel in no time at all. A team-mate waits for him up the road and the duo set off in hot pursuit of the peloton. They\u2019ll catch them quickly as the bunch isn\u2019t go0ing particularly fast. 35km to go: The gap is down to 21 seconds. In terms of picking a winner of today\u2019s stage, Dylan Groenewegen is the favourite with the bookies. Elia Viviani is next in the betting, followed by Caleb Ewan, Peter Sagan and Sonny Colbrelli. My money is staying in my pocket, but if I was having a speculative punt I\u2019d put my 50p on Alexander Kristoff at a massive 25-1. You can get Andre Greipel at nearly three times that price. I suppose he\u2019s not getting any younger. 44km to go: The gap drops to 54 seconds with 44 kilometres to go. I need to pull into the side of the road again, before we get to the business end of the race but will be back in a few hot minutes. An email: \u201cThe decision not to let Thomas De Gendt go seems to have been down to team orders,\u201d writes Martin Weiler. \u201cDe Gendt himself claims that [Martin\u2019s team] Jumbo-Visma didn\u2019t want any of [TDG\u2019s team] Lotto Soudal\u2019s riders in the lead because of Caleb Ewan. After trying to escape three times, De Gendt decided to hit the brakes in front of Tony Martin and thereby allowed his teammate Tim Wellens to escape. At least that is what he claims himself. You can check it here, if you are fluent in Dutch.\u201d 51 min: Speaking of pinch points, the road narrows just a couple of feet on either side as the peloton go over a bridge and EF Education First rider Mike Woods hits the deck as the bunch concertinas involuntary. He gets straight back on his back and pedals on. An email: \u201cIn response to John Brady in Toronto, it\u2019s just a matter of learning to like the pain!\u201d writes Gareth Thomas. \u201cI used to ride regularly from Canterbury to Lake Garda - over the Alps - every summer. 700 miles in six days 20 hours (at the fastest). \u201cNow at 67, my idea of enjoyment is climbing the local Aitana mountain ridge in the Costa Blanca on a classic 1980s De Rosa and it hurts all the way. Some cyclists enjoy the uphill pain so much they don\u2019t even bother with the downhill freewheel, but get their girlfriend to pick them up in the car at the summit.\u201d Crikey! I really need to get my bike out of the spare room and on to the road. Today\u2019s finish: The road narrows into a pinch-point with about two kilometres to go, then widens again. It\u2019s on a fast downhill, so there\u2019s a big chance of a crash as assorted teams refuse to give way when the road gets more narrow, so desperate will they be to ensure their sprinters - men like Caleb Ewan, Dylan Groenewegen and Elia Viviani \u2013 are in the right place at the right time. Obviously they have to catch the breakaway group first, but it\u2019s only a matter of time before that happens. The gap is currently 1min 27sec. Intermediate sprint result 1. Frederik Backaert: 20 points 2. Michael Sch\u00e4r: 17 3. Yoann Offredo: 15 At 1min 40\u2019sec 4. Elia Viviani: 13 5. Sonny Colbrelli: 11 6. Peter Sagan: 10 7. Matteo Trentin: 9 8. Michael Matthews: 8 9. Michael Morkov: 7 10. Andrea Pasqualon: 6 11. Greg Van Avermaet: 5 12. Ivan Garcia Cortina: 4 13. Andr\u00e9 Greipel: 3 14. Cees Bol: 2 15. William Bonnet: 1 61km to go: The gap between the breakaway and the bunch is coming down and is now at 1min 19sec. Lotto Soudal have been driving the peloton for 38.7% of today\u2019s stage, Quick Step have been bossing it for 26.2% of the time and Jumbo-Visma have been making the pace for 23.7% of the time. That leaves 11.4% for Team None Of The Above. 63km to go: \u201cSpeaking of Tony Martin, why didn\u2019t he let Thomas De Gendt go in the break yesterday?\u201d asks David. \u201cTactics, bad blood between teams, or something else? I always like to see Thomas on the front for hours.\u201d That is a question I do not have the answer to, because I was unaware Tony Martin wielded such influence in the peloton and had no idea he prevented the Lotto Soudal man from doing anything. Can anyone else shed any light on the matter? 65km to go: Elia Viviani is best of the rest, followed by Sonny Colbrelli and Peter Sagan. Intermediate sprint: Frederik Backaert is first over the line, followed by Michael Sch\u00e4r. Yoann Offredo is third. Back in the bunch, the main sprinters are preparing to hoover up the rest of the points on offer. 71km to go: The subject of discussion on Eurosport at the moment is the possible transfer of Tom Dumoulin from Team Sunweb to Team Jumbo-Visma for next year. Dumoulin is not at the Tour this year, having failed to recover from a knee injury in time and is rumoured to have fallen out with his team hierarchy over the way his treatment was managed. \u201cThe last month has been extremely difficult overall and with the setbacks in the knee recovery,\u201d Dumoulin said last month. \u201cAfter what happened at the Giro I really wanted to go for it in the Tour, but this week I realised it\u2019s not realistic for my level to be there in time. I\u2019ve tried so hard to get there but I really have to listen to my body and release myself from chasing an unrealistic goal.\u201d 79km to go: The riders of Team Ineos, the cyclists formerly known as Team Sky, are lined up near the front of the bunch, about five or six men back. With the wind blowing quite strongly, the main GC contenders are all near the front of the bunch after nearly three-and-a-half hours of racing. 82km to go: Michael Sch\u00e4r (CCC), Yoann Offredo (Wanty\u2013Groupe Gobert) and Frederik Backaert (Wanty\u2013Groupe Gobert) are the men who have been in front since the gun and they lead the peloton by 2min 39sec. The director of the TV coverage is now so bored that he is reduced to setting up shots that might earn him a job in arthouse cinema. The latest is a shot of the reflection of the peloton rolling past in the sunglasses of a somebody standing on the side of the road. An email: \u201cI am 59 and a very amateur cyclist, comfortable with longer rides (75km) provided there are no long hills,\u201d writes John Brady from Toronto. \u201cBut anything over 4% has me slinking off to a cozy chair as we have no mountains in Ontario. And then I read of grades like 18% and 20%. Forgive my naivety, but how do these guys do it? And more incredibly, how did Eddy do it on what must have been a much heavier bike on much lower quality roads. Thank you for answering what is probably a very basic question.\u201d I suppose the simple answer, John, is that they do lots of training. In a fit of unbridled enthusiasm, I bought a bike from the good folk at Brixton Cycles, upon my return from covering the first half of the 2015 Tour. Despite my best intentions, I reckon I\u2019ve done less than 75 kilometres in total in combined rides on it in the past four years. Exciting news: Tim Wellens, who won yesterday\u2019s combativity award and is currently wearing the polka dot jersey, has dropped out of the peloton ... and gone back to his team car to pick up some liquid refreshment for himself and his team-mates. It\u2019s all happening today!!! 93km to go: The leading riders hit an incline and are forced out of the saddle for the first time today as they tackle one of just two classified climbs today. Michael Schar takes the solitary King of the Mountains point on offer. The gap to the bunch is 3min 25sec. 95km to go: Back out in the countryside, the three lads in front cycle past a four spectators on the roadside, three of whom are sitting in a large rubber dinghy that is full of water. They are joined by the fourth, who attracts the attention of a passing cameraman and jumps in creating a big splash. And to think some people disapprove of lunchtime drinking. 100km to go: The gap from the breakaway to the bunch is 3min 12sec and we\u2019re past the halfway point. The three men in front are currently being cheered through the town of Bar-le-Duc, where thousands of spectators have lined the streets. An email: \u201cHad life taken you down a (slightly) different path, what kind of cyclist would you have liked to have been?\u201d asks Craig. \u201cI can see you as a Cavendish-style scrappy sprinter.\u201d I don\u2019t think so, Craig. While the idea of being a big name superstar cyclist appeals, I am very much one of life\u2019s domestiques. Global Cycling Network: Here, for anyone who\u2019s interested, is what goes into those musettes the cyclists grab from their soigneurs and swing over their shoulders. 114km to go: The gap from the breakaway to to the bunch is 3min 26sec as the peloton rolls through Revigny-sur-Ornain. The feed zone is on the outskirts of the town and as the three riders in front pass through it, Michael Sch\u00e4r accidentally comes between Frederik Backaert and the soigneur holding out his musette for collection. Backaert leaves empty-handed, but will be sorted out quickly enough by somebody in the team car. Crash! There\u2019s been a crash in the bunch and seven eight riders have gone down. All are fine, but AG2R rider Tony Gallopin, who went off the road and came down hard on some gravel, seems to have come out worst. He gets back on his back and soldiers on. Bennett v Bennett: To clear things up - I mistakenly referred to George Bennett, when I meant Sam Bennett of Bora Hangrohe, who is not riding the Tour this year. Currently third choice with his team, he is expected to leave for Deceuninck-Quick Step as a replacement for Elia Viviani, who is rumoured to be off to Cofidis. Somebody\u2019s had a mare ... New Zealander George Bennett, it was revealed on Eurosport, has put out an appeal to any Tour spectators who might be keeping in the cricket loop, to keep him apprised of New Zealand\u2019s World Cup semi-final progress against India. They\u2019re 170-4 after 42 overs, which doesn\u2019t seem great, but could be a lot worse. 126km to go: It\u2019s more or less as you were, with the gap between the three-man breakaway and the peloton at 2min 42sec. Maxime Monfort (Lotto-Soudal), Yves Lampaert (Deceuninck\u2013Quick-Step) and Tony Martin (Jumbo-Visma) are doing the hard work at the front of the bunch. 137km to go: The gap is 2min 44sec and the peloton is being buffeted by a strong headwind. The riders of Team Jumbo-Visma are lined up at the front of the bunch, doing the heavy lifting. They\u2019ll be hoping to help Sam Bennett to victory in the sprint that is likely to decide today\u2019s stage. 144km to go: The vineyards of Champagne have been replaced by closely cut barley fields as the peloton rolls along, keeping the gap to the breakaway at 3min 19sec. \u201cWorst job in the peloton?\u201d asks Simon Thomas. \u201cRiding pace on the front on a long stage like this to keep the breakaway at a manageable distance \u2013 as hard as being in the breakaway but with absolutely none of the glory. So a rare chapeau to those chaps from me.\u201d Brad on a Bike: Eurosport had Bradley Wiggins, a one-time broadcasting buddy of Max Rushden and I on Talksport (Sunday mornings, don\u2019t touch that dial!) on the back of a motorbike yesterday, gadding up and down the course, armed with a microphone and chatting to riders (which is presumably frowned upon race officials) and assorted other folk involved in the race. It proved quite the hit. There\u2019s a short clip in the tweet below, but you can click on this link to see extended highlights. 151km to go: The breakaway group is travelling at an average speed of 38km per hour. One of them, Yoann Ofredo, has dropped back to his team car for something or other - a snack or help from a mechanic, one presumes. Back in the bunch, riders from Jumbo-Visma, Quick Step and Astana are prominent towards the front of the bunch. 153km to go: The gap from the breakaway to the bunch is out to 3min 25sec. The three gentlemen in said escape party are all between 15 and 16 minutes behind race leader Julian Alaphilippe on GC. 159km to go: Sod\u2019s law decrees that the second I leave my post, we have a crash. Cofidis riders Natnael Berhane and Pierre-Luc Perichon hit the deck but are both back on their bikes and have rejoined the peloton. We\u2019ve have had no abandonments in this year\u2019s Tour yet and all 176 riders are all still upright. Astana\u2019s Jakob Fuglsang is riding in some discomfort, however, following a nasty crash in stage one. \u201cI\u2019m not at 100%\u201d, he said this morning. \u201cI\u2019m still struggling a little bit but it\u2019s okay. I feel better every day. It\u2019s about saving as much as possible on a day like today: stay out of trouble and not getting stuck behind a crash. On a Tour de France, there is nothing such as an easy day where you can relax completely. I didn\u2019t say exactly I could cover Alaphilippe\u2019s move. I just knew he was going to attack and I considered following his move, but I decided that I shouldn\u2019t waste energy on that as I am focusing on the GC.\u201d Global Cycling Network: While your reporter pulls into the side of the road for a quick comfort break, feel free to enjoy these highlights from yesterday\u2019s stage three, courtesy of the good people at the GCN. 171km to go: Our three-man breakaway group of Michael Sch\u00e4r (CCC), Yoann Offredo (Wanty\u2013Groupe Gobert) and Frederik Backaert (Wanty\u2013Groupe Gobert) are 2min 59sec clear of the bunch as they cycle past the Porte Sainte Croix in Chalons-en-Champagne. Yesterday\u2019s big loser: Rohan Dennis had a nightmare day yesterday, with the 29-year-old world time trial champion from Australia losing over eight minutes. In an interview with Velo News before this year\u2019s Tour, he told them he didn\u2019t have GC ambitions for this year\u2019s race and would be chasing stage wins instead. It\u2019s just as well. \u201cI haven\u2019t done the preparation for three weeks, so I\u2019m not going to bite off more than I can chew at a Grand Tour, let alone the Tour de France when I haven\u2019t done the preparation,\u201d he said. Mitchelton Scott stage three diary: Here\u2019s yesterday\u2019s offering from the Aussie team. Warning: may contain the phrase \u201cman titties\u201d. 184km to go: There are noticeable crosswinds, which are always capable of splitting the peloton if they get too strong, so several of teams have made their way to the front of the peloton. Team Inios (nee Sky) are up there, as are Thibaut Pinot\u2019s Groupama-FDJ. There\u2019s also a a few riders from Nairo Quintan\u2019s Movistar team and Adam Yates\u2019s Mitchelton-Scott. The yellow jersey has also moved to the front of the bunch. Today\u2019s climbs: There are two Category 4 speed-bumps to negotiate in today\u2019s largely flat stage, so the first rider over the top of each will get one point. Tim Wellens leads the King of the Mountains standings after his aggressive ride yesterday and is guaranteed to keep his polka-dot jersey for another day as long as he finishes today\u2019s stage within the time limit. Today\u2019s intermediate sprint: Lerouville is the venue for today\u2019s intermediate sprint, 66.4km from the finish line. Peter Sagan is currently in green, as is customary, having amassed 76 points. Michael Matthews is second with 59 points and Sonny Corlbrelli is third with 54. 196km to go: Our three man breakaway of Michael Sch\u00e4r (CCC), Yoann Offredo (Wanty\u2013Groupe Gobert) and Frederik Backaert (Wanty\u2013Groupe Gobert) has opened a gap of 2min 48sec on the bunch, which is of course being towed along by Tony Martin (Jumbo- Visma). There is no sense of urgency whatsoever in either group, with both enjoying the sunshine and scenery as they head through the Champagne region. The vineyards on either side of the road will soon be replaced by barley. The Maillot Jaune speaks: \u201cI struggled to fall asleep last night,\u201d said Julian Alaphillipe, in an interview with French TV ahead of today\u2019s roll-out. \u201cI displayed the yellow jersey on top of the television to make sure that I\u2019d see it at wake-up. Last year I already got a lot of support from the public but this morning, about 150 people were cheering for me outside of my hotel. I\u2019ll enjoy every kilometre I\u2019ll ride with the yellow jersey. I\u2019m overwhelmed and proud. It was an exploit yesterday but on my favourite terrain. I\u2019m not a favourite for winning the Tour de France. Today, we\u2019ll control the race especially because we want Elia Viviani to win in Nancy.\u201d 208km to go: A very, very long day indeed. The breakaway is rolling along at a fairly sedate pace, apparently safe in the knowledge that nobody in the peloton can be bothered trying to chase and join them. Your breakaway: Michael Sch\u00e4r (CCC), Yoann Offredo (Wanty\u2013Groupe Gobert) and Frederik Backaert (Wanty\u2013Groupe Gobert). 213.5km to go: They\u2019re off and \u201cracing\u201d although there\u2019s no discernible change in pace apart from that of the small group of just three riders who have shot off into the distance. This could be a very long day for them ... and us. The roll-out is underway: The peloton is on the move, led by the gentlemen in the picture below and rolling along behind the red Skoda containing race director Christian Prudhomme. He\u2019ll emerge from the sunroof and give the signal to begin racing with a wave of his yellow flag in three kilometres time. Stage three review ... Julian Alaphillipe\u2019s late breakaway enabled him to take both the stage win and the yellow jersey. Jeremy Whittle was there to see it ... From William Fotheringham\u2019s stage by stage -guide: A second long day in a row, but this one will end in a bunch sprint unless it rains and there is some action over the final climb, 15km from the finish. It\u2019s a typical first-week stage, largely main roads and the scenario should be classic: early break, late catch, scary sprint. There aren\u2019t that many opportunities for the flat-road sprinters in this Tour, so again it will be Caleb Ewan, and Andr\u00e9 Greipel in the mix, although the hill close to the finish will favour all-rounders such as Elia Viviani.",

And Greater Manchester police have also tweeted some less-than-sombre items such as: \u201cMale riding moped Princess St found to have no insurance and now has noped.\u201d Police use of Twitter also featured when Jeremy Clarkson complained last month that he had been held up in the wake of a fatal accident in Hammersmith, west London, because the road had been closed for a long time. An officer responded: \u201cSorry you were delayed @JeremyClarkson \u2013 perhaps you\u2019d like to come with us and personally explain to the family of the deceased that we didn\u2019t investigate the death of their loved one thoroughly because you wanted to get home?\u201d Ouch. Crime is often a grim and serious business, so there has to be some room for levity to deal with it all; the phrase \u201cgallows humour\u201d didn\u2019t come from nowhere. The police would also argue that engaging with the public through Twitter makes it easier for them to get publicity when they need help in identifying suspects or solving crimes. Ever since the Leveson inquiry, in the wake of the News of the World\u2019s malpractices, there has been a nervousness within the police of any kind of publicity. It would be sad if a touch of light-heartedness led to a renewed froideur.",

And who could blame them? The negative news keeps stacking up.</p> <p>Today the BRC revealed that retail sales slumped -1.6% year on year, confirming that any wage rise UK households are enjoying is not being reflected at the tills. Adding to the bad news a contraction in the UK economy is as good as confirmed for Q2, with analysts pencilling in a 0.1% decline in GDP, down from 0%.

I, for one, am sitting here, spade in hand, ready to go and dig one up to plant in my backyard when they reveal their location.</p> <p>No, I am actually referring to the economic data and shifting views of policymakers at the Bank of England.

Momentum is weak, and the global backdrop is not exactly encouraging. The drop in UK manufacturing activity really brings it into line with what is happening elsewhere \u2013 <strong>UK manufacturers have been defying gravity for some time. </strong>Without a sharp pick-up in global activity, it is hard to find another catalyst to get the economy going.\u201d</li> <li><strong>BREXIT: </strong>A likely more dovish Bank of England meeting on 1 August could lead the new PM to soften his tone on the chances of no-deal and focus his efforts on leaving with the existing deal in place. More likely, I believe, is that it will just mean <strong>another extension to the deadline.</strong></li> <li><strong>GENERAL ELECTION?</strong>: \u201cExtension would reduce uncertainty in the near term, but it would raise other concerns. The logical conclusion of all of this is going <strong>back to the ballot box</strong>.\u201d</li> <li>\u201cIt is certainly going to be a long, hot summer in more ways than one.

      "bodyText": "And finally, European stock markets have ended the day lower than they started it. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 only lost 12 points, or 0.17%, as the weak pound propped up the index by boosting major exporters. The smaller FTSE 250 index of medium-sized UK firms had a worse day, down 0.6%. Germany\u2019s DAX lost almost 1%, with chemicals giant BASF losing over 3% following last night\u2019s profits warning. BASF\u2019s warnings about the impact of the US-China trade war hit other chemicals groups, and also industrial groups such as Thyssemkrupp (-4%). Shares in carmakers also dropped, following BASF\u2019s gloomy assessment of the auto sector. This helped to knock the French CAC down by 0.3%. Goodnight. GW The pound remains under fire tonight, at its weakest level since January\u2019s flash crash (and a two year low, if you ignore it). Sterling is still bobbing under the $1.25 mark, currently around $1.246 against the US dollar tonight. Brexit fears are a key factor, especially as MPs will not get the chance to block a no-deal crisis today: Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the tide of bad news is worrying the City. Recession concerns coupled with fears over Brexit are proving too much for pound traders to swallow. And who could blame them? The negative news keeps stacking up. Today the BRC revealed that retail sales slumped -1.6% year on year, confirming that any wage rise UK households are enjoying is not being reflected at the tills. Adding to the bad news a contraction in the UK economy is as good as confirmed for Q2, with analysts pencilling in a 0.1% decline in GDP, down from 0%. The outlook for Q3 is equally gloomy. Finally, the prospect a no deal Brexit is running high. The House Speaker Bercow preventing MP\u2019s from voting on an amendment to stop the next PM from proroguing parliament for a no deal Brexit has done little for the prospect of avoiding a disorderly Brexit. In addition to the pound taking a hit, tourism stocks such as TUII, IAG and easyJet fell over 3% ECB chief economist Philip Lane has also denied that central banks pump up the markets...even though asset prices have done very nicely from years of stimulus. Oh, and he\u2019s a football fan too: Lane is sticking strictly to the script in his Q&amp;A, insisting that the ECB remains independent from political pressure.... ... defending his (current) boss\u2019s precious QE scheme.... ...and declining to criticise his next boss either. On cryptocurrencies, the ECB is keen not to give investment advice -- bitcoin fans are on their own! Despite the sharp slowdown in Europe, the ECB reckons the eurozone isn\u2019t going into recession. ECB chief economist Philip Lane says the central bank is ready to take action to stimulate growth and inflation if needed. Lans says he and his colleagues have the tools they need, and are keeping a close eye on the economy. Currently there are \u201cdownside risks\u201d to growth, he adds. That\u2019s very much in the spirit of Mario Draghi, who steps down from the ECB this autumn, Heads-up. Philip Lane, the European Central Bank\u2019s new chief economist, is holding an online Q&amp;A right now. It\u2019s your chance to ask about the eurozone economy, whether a fresh stimulus programme is needed, and Lane\u2019s views on issues such as cryptocurrencies, trade wars, Brexit etc. Perhaps Christine Lagarde\u2019s nomination to replace Mario Draghi as head of the ECB could also come up..... The US stock market has dipped at the open, following the small losses in Europe this morning. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 104 points, or -0.4%, to 26,701 in early trading. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says investors are anxious about two things. 1) Are company profits softening? That\u2019s a key risk following the profit warning from chemicals giant BASF (see opening post). 2) Will the Federal Reserve actually cut interest rates soon, as expected, to support the economy? We\u2019ll get more clues tomorrow when Fed chair Powell testifies to Congress. He explains: Markets remain nervous about the Fed and with earnings season around the corner. In particular, there may just be a growing realisation that the market has banked on the Fed turning more dovish than it is inclined to right now. Equity markets are pricing in a lot of good news, and precious little of the bad. As we approach earnings season, revisions to corporate profit guidance could undermine the positivity we are witnessing in global equity markets right now. The market is so fixated on the Fed put, and buying into this, that they may be blind to the drop in corporate profits. The problem for bulls from here is that several rate cuts by the Fed are already priced in, meaning, in the absence of a material rerating of valuations, we would need to see an improvement in earnings to push equities higher still. Speaking of Jerome Powell.... one of Donald Trump\u2019s top advisors has denied that the Fed chair\u2019s job is at risk. White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow insisted today that Powell\u2019s job is \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cthere is no effort to remove him.\u201d That\u2019s despite a torrent of criticism from Trump recently, blasting the Fed for not cutting interest rates. BlackRock\u2019s Rupert Harrison has been expanding on his concerns about sterling, in this exchange with Reuters\u2019 David Milliken. Over in Washington, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell has warned that the stress tests used to assess the nation\u2019s largest banks need to evolve. Otherwise, Powell says, the fast-changing financial system could make them obsolete. More here. The shake-up at the top of the European Central Bank is an ideal opportunity to shake up the eurozone\u2019s top monetary authority. So argues Stefan Gerlach, chief economist at EFG Bank in Zurich and a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland. He suggests that the ECB\u2019s inflation target - its key mandate - should be reviewed, to see if it is actually helping the eurozone economy. Such a review could help the ECB fight the next financial crisis. Gerlach explains: OMT, Mario Draghi\u2019s chosen tool for fulfilling his 2012 vow to do \u201cwhatever it takes to preserve the euro,\u201d was controversial from the moment it was announced, with the Bundesbank president, Jens Weidmann, \u2013 one of Lagarde\u2019s main rivals for the ECB presidency \u2013 arguing fiercely against it in public. But that was seven years ago, and OMT has never actually been used. Is the governing council still committed to it? Or have the events \u2013 and council membership changes \u2013 of the past few years rendered that commitment obsolete? Here\u2019s the full piece - worth a read. EU finance ministers have launched discussions on how to fill the shoes of Christine Lagarde at the International Monetary Fund. Lagarde\u2019s nomination to lead the European Central Bank from 1 November, creates a vacancy at the top of the Washington-based fund. Interest in the role is mounting, after former UK chancellor George Osborne been eyeing it up. Finland\u2019s finance minister Mika Lintil\u00e4, who chaired the Ecofin meeting today, told journalists the process of finding a candidate for the IMF would soon begin, but names were not discussed at Tuesday\u2019s monthly meeting of finance ministers. Lintil\u00e4 explains: Indeed we had a discussion about the process of nominating the next IMF director-president. The process will start, but we do not have a clear plan, a roadmap yet. We will start the work right now. We did not discuss names yet. They will then come later. By convention the head of the IMF is a European, while an American runs the World Bank. But the minister side-stepped a question on whether Europe means the continent, the European Union, or the 19-members of the single currency zone. The answer to that question matters for Mark Carney, the Canadian head of the Bank of England, who has Irish and British passports. The current governor of the Bank of England, who has run Canada\u2019s central bank and chaired the post-crisis Financial Stability Board, has already been installed as the favourite for some bookmakers and is being considered by European officials, according to Bloomberg. But it is an open question whether Carney will deemed \u201cEuropean\u201d enough, while there are plenty of candidates who missed at on the ECB that could be interested in the IMF job. Back on the pound.... and a top advisor at asset manager BlackRock has warned that markets are underestimating the risk of volatility from the Brexit crisis. Rupert Harrison, portfolio manager (and a former top advisor in the UK Treasury) told clients that the risks of an \u201cextreme\u201d Brexit outcome - either Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, or deciding to stay in the block - have risen. Harrison said: \u201cIt\u2019s even more uncertain than it has been at any point in the process. You can imagine a very, very wide range of outcomes in the next 12 months, and currently the options markets in currencies are not reflecting the scale of that potential volatility.\u201d Harrison, who advised former finance minister George Osborne from 2006 to 2015, also warned that Brexit continued to reduce the attraction of British assets for global investors. \u201cThe cumulative impact of the uncertainty, as well as ... all the stocking and destocking that we\u2019ve seen, has definitely had a negative impact on momentum, which has become significantly more negative over the last three months or so.\u201d The boss of BMW has warned that the Brexit crisis is intensifying,and that manufacturers don\u2019t have the \u201cplanning reliability\u201d they need. Speaking at the launch of BMW\u2019s new electric mini, Oliver Zipse warned that recent Brexit developments are a \u201cbad progression\u201d. Zipse warned that BMW doesn\u2019t know whether a hard Brexit would be a \u201ccomplete disaster\u201d, or whether it could be handled. Any new tariffs at the border would be harmful, though, he added. Britain\u2019s car industry has received a boost -- BMW has unveiled a new electric-powered Mini to be built at its Cowley car plant in Oxford. My colleague Jasper Jolly is there, and explains: BMW said it had 15,000 expressions of interest before order books open on Tuesday. The first deliveries to customers are expected in the first quarter of 2020, with a list price of \u00a324,400, after the government\u2019s plug-in car grant of \u00a33,500 has been applied. The investment in the new Mini will preserve the jobs of about 5,000 workers at the Oxford plant at an uncertain time for an industry awaiting Brexit clarity. The plant produced 234,501 Mini and Mini Clubman cars in 2018, an increase of 4.8% year on year. The pound has now fallen by 5%, or seven cents, against the US dollar in the last two months. The selloff began as pressure mounted on Theresa May to quit, and intensified as most of the candidates to replace the PM backed the idea of a hard Brexit. Fawad Razaqzada of Forex.com says worries about tomorrow\u2019s monthly UK GDP report (for May) are pushing sterling close to a two-year low today. He writes: The pound continues to be undermined by concerns that ongoing Brexit uncertainty is taking its toll on the UK economy. We have seen the release of some very poor domestic macro data in recent weeks. That run could continue tomorrow if the latest monthly GDP, construction output and manufacturing production figures disappoint expectations. All these numbers fell noticeably last time and judging by the latest PMI data, I am not expecting to see a sharp rebound. Another poor set of figures could increase the pressure on the pound even more. With the pound under pressures, David Bloom, global head of currency strategy at HSBC, says it\u2019s very hard to value the currency right now. He warns that sterling could lose at least another 15 cents against the dollar, if Britain crashed out of the EU. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, he predicts: If we go to a hard Brexit, sterling could fall below $1.10 But what if Brexit doesn\u2019t happen? Bloom calls this the \u201cBobby Ewing\u201d scenario, where \u201cit\u2019s all been a bad dream, and he\u2019s in the shower\u201d. In that case, sterling could rise to $1.45 - recovering almost all its losses since the referendum. Brexit news: The opposition Labour Party has just announced that Britain\u2019s next prime minister must put their plan to the people in a referendum. And significantly, leader Jeremy Corbyn says Labour would campaign for remain against No Deal or \u201ca damaging Tory Brexit\u201d. In a letter to party members, Corbyn says: I have spent the past few weeks consulting with the shadow cabinet, MPs, affiliated unions and the NEC. I have also had feedback from members via the National Policy Forum consultation on Brexit. Whoever becomes the new Prime Minister should have the confidence to put their deal, or No Deal, back to the people in a public vote. In those circumstances, I want to make it clear that Labour would campaign for Remain against either No Deal or a Tory deal that does not protect the economy and jobs. However, Corbyn also says that Labour\u2019s position of a Brexit based around a customs union, a \u201cstrong single market relationship\u201d and protections for workers rights and environmental protections is a \u201csensible alternative\u201d. He\u2019s also pushing for a general election, and it\u2019s not clear how that would change Labour\u2019s Brexit position. Our Politics Live blog has full details: Britain\u2019s economic outlook is set to darken this autumn, as no-deal Brexit worries mount and companies struggle. That\u2019s according to Dean Turner, UK economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, in new analysis that helps explains why the pound is under pressure today. Turner cites June\u2019s weak PMI reports, showing UK companies have suffered their worst month since 2016. A warning from Britain\u2019s top central banker, Mark Carney, that trade wars could \u2018shipwreck the global economy\u2019 is also a worry. Turner writes: It has been a tough week for those of us following events in the UK. I\u2019m not referring to the ongoing leadership contest between Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson. If anything that is a great source of amusement to most economists, as we wonder where in the UK we grow the \u201cmagic money-trees\u201d that are going to pay for all the recent campaign promises. I, for one, am sitting here, spade in hand, ready to go and dig one up to plant in my backyard when they reveal their location. No, I am actually referring to the economic data and shifting views of policymakers at the Bank of England. The message, on the whole, is one of much more challenging times ahead for the economy. In conclusion, Britain could faces a \u201cdarker autumn\u201d, and possibly a general election too, Turner says. Here\u2019s his key predictions: UK GDP: \u201cBarring a significant positive surprise, tomorrow\u2019s data is likely to confirm that the economy is on course to register a contraction for the second quarter.\u201d LOOKING AHEAD: \u201cAs we enter the third quarter it is hard to see how things can improve that much for the economy. Momentum is weak, and the global backdrop is not exactly encouraging. The drop in UK manufacturing activity really brings it into line with what is happening elsewhere \u2013 UK manufacturers have been defying gravity for some time. Without a sharp pick-up in global activity, it is hard to find another catalyst to get the economy going.\u201d BREXIT: A likely more dovish Bank of England meeting on 1 August could lead the new PM to soften his tone on the chances of no-deal and focus his efforts on leaving with the existing deal in place. More likely, I believe, is that it will just mean another extension to the deadline. GENERAL ELECTION?: \u201cExtension would reduce uncertainty in the near term, but it would raise other concerns. The logical conclusion of all of this is going back to the ballot box.\u201d \u201cIt is certainly going to be a long, hot summer in more ways than one. We should all be prepared for the darker autumn that is likely to follow.\u201d If you ignore a \u2018mini-crash\u2019 in early January, the pound is now languishing at its lowest levels against the US dollar since spring 2017. Hamish Muress, senior currency strategist at OFX, fears sterling could fall further. \u201cWhilst the Brexit conundrum remains unresolved, the pound is much more vulnerable to the strengths of other currencies. Even tomorrow\u2019s UK GDP figures are unlikely to offer much relief, and Sterling could reach new lows once again.\u201d The pound is also suffering from worries that the UK economy could be shrinking. Overnight, new figures showed that UK retail sales experienced their \u201cworst June on record\u201d, as uncertainty over Brexit continued to affect the economy. The British Retail Consortium warned that \u201cthe picture is bleak\u201d, with total sales falling 1.3% year-on-year in June. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said consumers were too worried about Brexit to risk major purchases. \u201cBusinesses and the public desperately need clarity on Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU. The continued risk of a no-deal Brexit is harming consumer confidence and forcing retailers to spend hundreds of millions of pounds putting in place mitigations \u2013 this represents time and resources that would be better spent improving customer experience and prices. It is vital that the next prime minister can find a solution that avoids a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, just before the busy Black Friday and Christmas periods. Simon Harvey, FX market analyst at Monex Europe, says this slump has compounded fears that Britain\u2019s economy began to contract in the second quarter of 2019. The final leg of support for a Brexit riddled economy looks to have been swiped away overnight as the BRC Sales Monitor points to a third consecutive decline in official retail sales figures, cementing the prospect of a negative Q2 GDP reading.\u201d Tomorrow we learn how the UK economy fared in the three months to May (so not the full second quarter). Economists predict GDP only rose by 0.1% in February-May; a poor reading might fuel worries that Britain\u2019s economy is stalling. Fears over the health of the UK economy, and worries about Brexit, are driving the pound down this morning. Sterling has lost half a cent against the US dollar, sliding as low as $1.246. That\u2019s the lowest levels since early January, and 15% below its value before the 2016 referendum. Sterling is also a little weaker against the euro, at \u20ac1.112 [corrected]. The sell-off comes as Boris Johnson, the front-runner to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister, insists he would take Britain out of the EU on Halloween, with or without a deal. He wrote yesterday: \u201cWe need a change of direction. That\u2019s why we must treat 31st October as a real deadline for leaving the EU, come what may, not a fake one.\u201d Larry Hatheway of Swiss asset management firm GAM says this talk of crashing out of the EU is worrying the markets. He pointed out on Bloomberg TV this morning that a hard Brexit can\u2019t be ruled out. If the [31 October] deadline comes and goes, and the EU does not extend, then it happens. I think it\u2019s going to be another one of those \u2018down to the wire\u2019 moments. Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG, thinks the pound could fall further. Every European stock market is down this morning. Pierre Veyret, technical analyst at ActivTrades, says: European shares are extending yesterday\u2019s losses, following a mixed trading session in Asia where tensions between Japan and South Korea scared stock investors. In Europe, and even globally, investors\u2019 sentiment is still being slashed by last week\u2019s better than expected US job report. Most traders who were anticipating a more dovish Fed due to a global slowdown caused by President Trump\u2019s trade war with China have shifted their trading stance. Deutsche Bank is also having a bad morning. Its shares are down 5% below \u20ac6.50, adding to Monday\u2019s 5.4% slide. That means they\u2019ve lost a tenth of their value since the bank revealed its new restructuring plan. Investors may be doubting DB\u2019s plan to oust 18,000 staff over the next three years, suspend its dividend, scale back its investment bank and quit the equity sales and trading businesses. Royal Bank of Canada analysts who raised their Deutsche Bank price target from \u20ac7.50 to \u20ac8 yesterday, have now cut it back to \u20ac7, warning: The presentation of the strategic plan confirmed our view that execution of the new business plan remains key. Execution risk seems higher though than we initially expected given more headwinds to capital. European stock markets have hit a one-week low, dragged down by the chemicals industry. Miners and industrial groups are also out of favour, amid fresh worries about the impact of the global slowdown on corporate profits. This has pulled the EU-wide Stoxx 600 index down by 0.5%, with the German market particularly weak (-1%). BASF\u2019s struggles will fuel concerns that Germany\u2019s economy is dangerously close to a recession. Manufacturing companies across Europe\u2019s largest economy have been hurt by trade tensions -- lower economic growth means less demand for German-made products. Bloomberg explains: Warnings of economic weakness had been racking up from chemical companies including German lubricant maker Fuchs Petrolub SE and U.S. manufacturer H.B. Fuller Co. amid a deterioration in manufacturing. The diminished outlook underscores the difficulties in the chemical sector as demand weakens in industries from cars to farming to electronics Worryingly, BASF blamed its woes on \u201csignificantly weaker-than-expected industrial production\u201d, particularly in China\u2019s car industry. BASF\u2019s profit warning is hurting the wider German chemicals industry, as investors worry that trade conflicts are hurting the sector. Covestra, which makes high-tech polymer materials, have fallen 5%, while specialty chemicals group Lanxess are down 4%. BASF\u2019s 6% plunge makes it the worst-performing major stock in Frankfurt. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The world\u2019s largest chemicals company, BASF, is taking a hammering this morning after the company became the latest victim of Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China. Last night,the German chemicals giant hit investors with a nasty looking profits warning. BASF slashed its full-year profits forecast for 2019 by up to 30%, warning that profits would half in the second quarter of 2019. Sales are now expected to decline slightly in 2019 - down from a previous forecast of growth of 1%-5%, meaning the company is pressing on with 6,000 job cuts. BASF makes a wide range of chemicals, plastics and foams which are used in a wide range of industries, from pharmaceutical and car-making to construction and textiles. It blamed the profits warning on slowing global economy, and the damage caused by America\u2019s trade conflicts with other major economies, saying: \u201cTo date, the conflicts between the United States and its trading partners, particularly China, have not eased. \u201cIn fact, the G20 summit at the end of June has shown that a rapid detente is not to be expected in the second half of 2019. Overall, uncertainty remains high.\u201d Investors are worried, driving BASF\u2019s shares price down by 6% at the start of trading in Frankfurt. It\u2019s another blow for Deutschland PLC, on top of the problems at banking giant Deutsche Bank which is slashing 18,000 jobs in a desperate turnaround bid. Reaction to follow.... Also coming up Two central bankers could move the markets today. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell will discuss the Fed\u2019s stress tests, at a conference hosted by the Boston Federal Reserve. Investors, though, will want to hear any hints on monetary policy -- and whether a rate cut is still likely in July. They\u2019ll also be keen to hear from the European Central Bank\u2019s new chief economist, Philip Lane, who\u2019s answering questions on Twitter today. Lane\u2019s views on the state of the eurozone\u2019s economy will be crucial, as the ECB weighs up whether to launch fresh stimulus measures. Online grocery group Ocado and housebuilder Bovis are both reporting results - Ocado has posted a half-year loss of \u00a3142.8m after taking a \u00a398.5m hit from a warehouse fire earlier this year.

      "body": "<p>The Tour de France peloton sped eastwards towards Thursday\u2019s first summit finish in the Vosges, with the Italian Elia Viviani of the Deceuninck-QuickStep team taking a sprint victory in Nancy, the day after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/08/tour-de-france-stage-three-julian-alaphilippe-yellow-jersey\" title=\"\">teammate Julian Alaphilippe</a> had won stage three and taken the yellow jersey in \u00c9pernay.</p> \n<p>Viviani\u2019s decision to quit May\u2019s Giro d\u2019Italia, despite a lack of success, in order to save himself for the sprint stages of the Tour, was vindicated as he powered clear of Alexander Kristoff of Norway to take a career-first stage win in the Tour.</p> \n<p>But Viviani was indebted to Alaphilippe, who rode as his pilot fish while also maintaining his race lead and who, for the moment, seems unable to do any wrong, either on the road or in the French media.</p> \n<p>\u201cI enjoyed every kilometre today and at the end we got a beautiful victory so it was amazing,\u201d Alaphilippe said. \u201cI was in a good position and I was helping my teammate but I was also scared [of crashes] because the finish was nervous.\u201d</p> \n<p>For the defending champion, Geraint Thomas, it was a routine, if hot, day in the saddle. But with Thursday\u2019s final climb to La Planche des Belles Filles looming on the horizon, speculation over the Welshman\u2019s form continues following Monday\u2019s finish in \u00c9pernay when he lost five seconds to Egan Bernal in the uphill finish.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo one wins the Tour on five-second sprint finishes but obviously it would be better not to have lost that,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI was hoping just to slowly drift back a bit and the next thing I know no one is coming past me and I was like: \u2018I have to try and close this gap\u2019 but it was a bit late by then.</p> \n<p>\u201cObviously it is nice not to lose five seconds,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I am off the podium [in Paris] by four seconds then I might be more disappointed.\u201d</p> \n<p>At this early stage of a very mountainous Tour that may be won by minutes, a handful of seconds lost may signify little but Thomas\u2019s inattentiveness has been interpreted by some as a sign of uncertain form.</p> \n<p>However, the Ineos team principal, Dave Brailsford, insisted it was a mistake to read anything into the seconds ceded by Thomas to his co-leader Bernal in \u00c9pernay.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a five-second gap, though, was it?\u201d he insisted. \u201cI think way too much has been made of it, if I am honest. If anyone understands the sport and you watch the sport, there is a 30-metre gap. Geraint sat up a little bit, he thought people were trying to come around him and that is it. People are trying to make out that it is a five-second gap and it is not.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWatch the race and see what happened and interpret from the race. The five seconds makes no difference. You just have to watch the race. To you guys [the media] it makes a difference. I watch the race and it was pretty simple to understand what happened.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if the minor setback for Thomas might influence a change in strategy, Brailsford responded: \u201c100% no.

      "bodyText": "The Tour de France peloton sped eastwards towards Thursday\u2019s first summit finish in the Vosges, with the Italian Elia Viviani of the Deceuninck-QuickStep team taking a sprint victory in Nancy, the day after his teammate Julian Alaphilippe had won stage three and taken the yellow jersey in \u00c9pernay. Viviani\u2019s decision to quit May\u2019s Giro d\u2019Italia, despite a lack of success, in order to save himself for the sprint stages of the Tour, was vindicated as he powered clear of Alexander Kristoff of Norway to take a career-first stage win in the Tour. But Viviani was indebted to Alaphilippe, who rode as his pilot fish while also maintaining his race lead and who, for the moment, seems unable to do any wrong, either on the road or in the French media. \u201cI enjoyed every kilometre today and at the end we got a beautiful victory so it was amazing,\u201d Alaphilippe said. \u201cI was in a good position and I was helping my teammate but I was also scared [of crashes] because the finish was nervous.\u201d For the defending champion, Geraint Thomas, it was a routine, if hot, day in the saddle. But with Thursday\u2019s final climb to La Planche des Belles Filles looming on the horizon, speculation over the Welshman\u2019s form continues following Monday\u2019s finish in \u00c9pernay when he lost five seconds to Egan Bernal in the uphill finish. \u201cNo one wins the Tour on five-second sprint finishes but obviously it would be better not to have lost that,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI was hoping just to slowly drift back a bit and the next thing I know no one is coming past me and I was like: \u2018I have to try and close this gap\u2019 but it was a bit late by then. \u201cObviously it is nice not to lose five seconds,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I am off the podium [in Paris] by four seconds then I might be more disappointed.\u201d At this early stage of a very mountainous Tour that may be won by minutes, a handful of seconds lost may signify little but Thomas\u2019s inattentiveness has been interpreted by some as a sign of uncertain form. However, the Ineos team principal, Dave Brailsford, insisted it was a mistake to read anything into the seconds ceded by Thomas to his co-leader Bernal in \u00c9pernay. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a five-second gap, though, was it?\u201d he insisted. \u201cI think way too much has been made of it, if I am honest. If anyone understands the sport and you watch the sport, there is a 30-metre gap. Geraint sat up a little bit, he thought people were trying to come around him and that is it. People are trying to make out that it is a five-second gap and it is not.\u201d \u201cWatch the race and see what happened and interpret from the race. The five seconds makes no difference. You just have to watch the race. To you guys [the media] it makes a difference. I watch the race and it was pretty simple to understand what happened.\u201d Asked if the minor setback for Thomas might influence a change in strategy, Brailsford responded: \u201c100% no. Nothing has changed.\u201d But he also admitted that Team Ineos had noticed the absence of the four-times winner Chris Froome, ruled out of racing after his crash in June\u2019s Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9. \u201cChris definitely has a presence,\u201d Brailsford said. \u201cHe\u2019s a winner, he\u2019s serious about what he does. He\u2019s on it, his attention to detail is good and, if it\u2019s not quite right, he works to get it right. He works with everybody but he\u2019s on it. That pervades the whole team and everybody is really focused and on it.\u201d \u201cGeraint is not a screamer and shouter but he knows what he wants; he\u2019s a strong character,\u201d Brailsford said of the defending champion. \u201cI think in general as a group they actually bond really well. \u201cThey\u2019re quite fiery and, if something happens, they come back in here and they don\u2019t hold back, which is healthy I think. I think there\u2019s enough strength of character here on the bus for any team.\u201d",

The question of the play is, \u2018How can you give meaning to this complete coincidence?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s only 42, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/oct/08/sex-sheep-and-terror-theatre-milo-rau-lam-gods\">Rau</a> is already one of the darlings of the European festival circuit for his provocations as well as his art.

It is performed by his <a href=\"http://international-institute.de/en/news/\">International Institute of Political Murder</a> and uses the raw material of the homophobic killing to question our attitudes to violence, both real and staged. \u201cWhat we need is a collective ritual, which is theatre, that will somehow overcome the trauma of dying,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a6f28affb9b960f9935e2feaecdc15d247bc371\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a6f28affb9b960f9935e2feaecdc15d247bc371/805_282_1375_1718/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We need a collective ritual\u2019 \u2026 Milo Rau.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If you have a crime you only have stories, you don\u2019t have the truth\u2019 \u2026 Milo Rau.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michiel Devijver</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a hybrid of filmed interrogation and documentary re-enactment, Rau uses a cast of professionals and amateurs to get under the skin of Jarfi\u2019s murder.

It\u2019s called La Reprise because of the repeated nature of theatre. A performance designed to appear spontaneous is the result of the very opposite: hours of meticulous preparation.

In the theatre you\u2019re always repeating the emotion, repeating the facts. You\u2019re killing on stage but everybody knows that the next day this actor has to act again. The question of how you come to a total, true fictionalisation is the basic question at the heart of theatre.\u201d</p> <p>His interest in truth extends to the actors, casting \u201creal\u201d amateurs as well as professionals. In this show, he casts Johan Leysen, a major player whose CV ranges from Jean-Luc Godard to TV shows including Spiral and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/01/the-missing-review-fabulous-unbearably-tense\">The Missing</a>, alongside first-timers. The influence works both ways: the amateur actors adopt professional standards, while the professionals are challenged by the lived experience of the amateurs. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about the killing of Ihsane Jarfi, the people on stage knew him and live in Li\u00e8ge, and that changes the point of view,\u201d he says. \u201cIt changes the act of acting.\u201d</p> <p>Doesn\u2019t all this theatre about theatre get very circular? As Leysen says towards the start of the play: \u201cActing is like delivering a pizza. It\u2019s not about the delivery man. It\u2019s about the pizza.\u201d Could Rau himself be more interested in the delivery man? He\u2019s in two minds: \u201cWhen you stage a Shakespeare play for the 500th time, then of course it\u2019s about the actor and the act of delivering.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/oct/08/sex-sheep-and-terror-theatre-milo-rau-lam-gods\">Sex, sheep and terror: the scandalous theatre of Milo Rau</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In practice, the production is both things.

      "bodyText": "On 22 April, 2012, Ihsane Jarfi left a gay bar in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, and got chatting to a group of men in a Volkswagen Polo. At some point after they all drove off together, the 32-year-old Belgian Moroccan was tortured and killed. His naked body was found two weeks later showing evidence of hours of torture. A crime of such arbitrary viciousness and intolerance shocked the city. For theatremaker Milo Rau, it raises many questions, including whether art can create meaning out of such a meaningless act. \u201cCan you give a story a sense of the tragic when it is total coincidence?\u201d he asks. \u201cThese people are drunk, they meet Ihsane Jarfi, they go too far and they kill him, but it was never their intention.

      "body": "<p>A device that can produce electricity from sunlight while simultaneously purifying water has been produced by researchers, an invention they say could solve two problems in one stroke.</p> <p>The researchers say the device is not only a source of green energy but also offers an alternative to current technologies for purifying water. These, they add, often consume large amounts of electricity and require infrastructure beyond the reach of many communities that lack basic access to safe drinking water \u2013 a situation thought to affect more than <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/drinking-water\">780 million people worldwide</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThese people spend a collective 200m hours a day fetching water from distant sources,\u201d said Prof Peng Wang, a co-author of the research from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>With solar farms often located in arid regions, the device could provide clean water where it is needed most. What is more, the team say it could be used in a backyard or on an industrial scale.</p> <p>\u201cHaving a significant amount of freshwater produced continuously on a daily basis [means] many challenging tasks can then be easily achievable,\u201d said Wang. \u201cThe generated clean water can be used [for] cleaning solar panels to remove dust particles; it can be use to irrigate plants and crops, making desert agriculture possible.\u201d</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10817-6\">Nature Communications</a>, Wang and colleagues reveal how they constructed the device.</p> <p>On the top is a horizontal commercial silicon solar cell and beneath this are several tiers through which saline, brackish or contaminated surface water is run. Waste heat from the solar cell warms the saline water passing immediately beneath it \u2013 the water evaporates, passes through a membrane and condenses to yield clean water, releasing heat in the process that warms the saline water in the tier below that \u2013 the process is then repeated for the next tier. The purified water flows out of the device and is collected.</p> <p>The team found the device can be used to purify saltwater as well as seawater contaminated with heavy metals, with the water collected containing levels of lead, copper, sodium, calcium and magnesium all below the levels deemed safe for drinking water by the World Health Organization.</p> <p>While the team outline various versions of the device, they reveal that under conditions on a par with a bright, cloudless day the energy efficiency of the solar cell was about 11% \u2013 a figure they say is on a par with what would be expected without the distillation section attached, and higher than previously reported by others working on such devices.</p> <p>The device was also able to produce clean water from seawater at a rate they say is higher than conventional solar stills.</p> <p>The device, while not the first to make use of solar distillation, has a particular advantage: by combining two types of device that typically each require a large land area, and mounting systems, the approach is relatively compact.</p> <p>Wang said the device turned the traditional link between water and electricity on its head: conventionally, electricity is produced by heating water to produce steam that is then used to turn turbines. While he said the team was still working on scaling up the device and reducing costs, they are optimistic.</p> <p>\u201cIt is our hope that we move quickly to push this technology towards its large-scale adoption,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A device that can produce electricity from sunlight while simultaneously purifying water has been produced by researchers, an invention they say could solve two problems in one stroke. The researchers say the device is not only a source of green energy but also offers an alternative to current technologies for purifying water. These, they add, often consume large amounts of electricity and require infrastructure beyond the reach of many communities that lack basic access to safe drinking water \u2013 a situation thought to affect more than 780 million people worldwide. \u201cThese people spend a collective 200m hours a day fetching water from distant sources,\u201d said Prof Peng Wang, a co-author of the research from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. With solar farms often located in arid regions, the device could provide clean water where it is needed most. What is more, the team say it could be used in a backyard or on an industrial scale. \u201cHaving a significant amount of freshwater produced continuously on a daily basis [means] many challenging tasks can then be easily achievable,\u201d said Wang. \u201cThe generated clean water can be used [for] cleaning solar panels to remove dust particles; it can be use to irrigate plants and crops, making desert agriculture possible.\u201d Writing in the journal Nature Communications, Wang and colleagues reveal how they constructed the device. On the top is a horizontal commercial silicon solar cell and beneath this are several tiers through which saline, brackish or contaminated surface water is run. Waste heat from the solar cell warms the saline water passing immediately beneath it \u2013 the water evaporates, passes through a membrane and condenses to yield clean water, releasing heat in the process that warms the saline water in the tier below that \u2013 the process is then repeated for the next tier. The purified water flows out of the device and is collected. The team found the device can be used to purify saltwater as well as seawater contaminated with heavy metals, with the water collected containing levels of lead, copper, sodium, calcium and magnesium all below the levels deemed safe for drinking water by the World Health Organization. While the team outline various versions of the device, they reveal that under conditions on a par with a bright, cloudless day the energy efficiency of the solar cell was about 11% \u2013 a figure they say is on a par with what would be expected without the distillation section attached, and higher than previously reported by others working on such devices. The device was also able to produce clean water from seawater at a rate they say is higher than conventional solar stills. The device, while not the first to make use of solar distillation, has a particular advantage: by combining two types of device that typically each require a large land area, and mounting systems, the approach is relatively compact. Wang said the device turned the traditional link between water and electricity on its head: conventionally, electricity is produced by heating water to produce steam that is then used to turn turbines. While he said the team was still working on scaling up the device and reducing costs, they are optimistic. \u201cIt is our hope that we move quickly to push this technology towards its large-scale adoption,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>An inquiry into the way the government treated tens of thousands of international students who may have been wrongly accused of cheating will begin on Wednesday with MPs questioning the most senior civil servants in the Home Office.</p> <p>The hearing by the Commons public accounts committee is the latest in a series of official attempts to investigate why the Home Office decided to accuse more than 30,000 international students of cheating in an English language test they were required to sit as part of their visa application process.</p> <p>Pressure is mounting on the department to resolve an issue that has been causing those affected profound difficulties since 2014.</p> <p>About 2,500 students have been forcibly removed from the UK after being accused of cheating in the exam. Another 7,200 left the country after being told they faced detention and removal if they stayed. Many have tried to prove their innocence in court: 12,500 appeals have been heard and so far 3,600 people have won their cases.</p> <p>Sir Philip Rutnam, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, and his deputy, Shona Dunn, will join Mark Thomson, the director general of UK Visas and Immigration, to face questioning from MPs.</p> <p>The committee is looking into whether the Home Office was negligent in its decision to assume that the vast majority of students who took the Home Office-approved test of English for international communication (Toeic) between 2011 and 2014 cheated.</p> <p>A National Audit Office report published in May concluded that some students may have been mistakenly accused and unfairly removed from the UK and it criticised the Home Office for failing to protect those wrongly caught up in the scandal. The report questioned the quality of the evidence used to determine who had cheated.</p> <p>In 2014, undercover filming by the BBC uncovered organised cheating in two of the 90 government-approved centres offering the exam required for visa extensions. The Home Office subsequently asked the test provider, the US-based Educational Testing Service (ETS), to investigate whether the 58,459 tests taken between 2011 and 2014 were valid.</p> <p>The US company made checks and concluded that 97% of all UK tests were in some way \u201csuspicious\u201d. It classified 58% as \u201cinvalid\u201d and 39% as \u201cquestionable\u201d. The Home Office suspended the licences of some test centres and revoked the visas of people accused of cheating.</p> <p>The campaign group Migrant Voice, which has been supporting students accused of cheating, has questioned whether it is likely that 97% of people who took the test were involved in the fraud.</p> <p>Nazek Ramadan, the director of Migrant Voice, said she was glad senior members of the Home Office would be answering questions. \u201cWe hope that it will bring to light more information on the terrible treatment of students by the Home Office,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/23/toeic-english-test-sajid-javid-urged-to-act-in-immigration-scandal-bigger-than-windrush\">Sajid Javid urged to act in immigration scandal 'bigger than Windrush'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sheikh Amin, a business administration student from Bangladesh who was accused of cheating in 2014, said he felt optimistic about the start of the hearing.

We hope the committee will put proper pressure on the Home Office to put things right and to save those students who didn\u2019t cheat in the exams.

But Khan has been rejected by his family, who have such faith in the British justice system that they do not believe the UK government could have wrongly accused students of cheating. He says he is near destitute in Pakistan, staying in a community centre for homeless people. Khan studied in an English-language school before he came to the UK and was already fluent, so he was relaxed about the language test he was required to take when he was renewing his visa towards the end of his business degree.

      "bodyText": "An inquiry into the way the government treated tens of thousands of international students who may have been wrongly accused of cheating will begin on Wednesday with MPs questioning the most senior civil servants in the Home Office. The hearing by the Commons public accounts committee is the latest in a series of official attempts to investigate why the Home Office decided to accuse more than 30,000 international students of cheating in an English language test they were required to sit as part of their visa application process. Pressure is mounting on the department to resolve an issue that has been causing those affected profound difficulties since 2014. About 2,500 students have been forcibly removed from the UK after being accused of cheating in the exam. Another 7,200 left the country after being told they faced detention and removal if they stayed. Many have tried to prove their innocence in court: 12,500 appeals have been heard and so far 3,600 people have won their cases. Sir Philip Rutnam, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, and his deputy, Shona Dunn, will join Mark Thomson, the director general of UK Visas and Immigration, to face questioning from MPs. The committee is looking into whether the Home Office was negligent in its decision to assume that the vast majority of students who took the Home Office-approved test of English for international communication (Toeic) between 2011 and 2014 cheated. A National Audit Office report published in May concluded that some students may have been mistakenly accused and unfairly removed from the UK and it criticised the Home Office for failing to protect those wrongly caught up in the scandal. The report questioned the quality of the evidence used to determine who had cheated. In 2014, undercover filming by the BBC uncovered organised cheating in two of the 90 government-approved centres offering the exam required for visa extensions. The Home Office subsequently asked the test provider, the US-based Educational Testing Service (ETS), to investigate whether the 58,459 tests taken between 2011 and 2014 were valid. The US company made checks and concluded that 97% of all UK tests were in some way \u201csuspicious\u201d. It classified 58% as \u201cinvalid\u201d and 39% as \u201cquestionable\u201d. The Home Office suspended the licences of some test centres and revoked the visas of people accused of cheating. The campaign group Migrant Voice, which has been supporting students accused of cheating, has questioned whether it is likely that 97% of people who took the test were involved in the fraud. Nazek Ramadan, the director of Migrant Voice, said she was glad senior members of the Home Office would be answering questions. \u201cWe hope that it will bring to light more information on the terrible treatment of students by the Home Office,\u201d she said. Sheikh Amin, a business administration student from Bangladesh who was accused of cheating in 2014, said he felt optimistic about the start of the hearing. About 40 students have already made submissions to the committee. \u201cThis is a really important step. We believe that the facts will finally come out. We hope the committee will put proper pressure on the Home Office to put things right and to save those students who didn\u2019t cheat in the exams. We want speedy action now so we can get back our future,\u201d he said. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, is understood to have told MPs he is \u201csympathetic\u201d to the students\u2019 situation, and is due to make a statement, but there is concern among campaigners that the Conservative leadership campaign has removed focus from the issue. Accused of cheating Tejas Soni, 36, spent 11 months in detention in the UK, accused of an offence he denies, with no right to an appeal in a British court. He had hoped studying in the UK would give him better career options in India. He estimates he has spent \u00a335,000 on wasted legal and tuition fees. He had completed an English-language undergraduate degree in commerce in India before he came to the UK. In 2014 he received a letter labelling him an immigration offender and telling him his visa had been curtailed. \u201cIt is the considered opinion of the Home Office that you have utilised deception to gain leave to remain,\u201d the letter read. \u201cYou have no lawful basis of stay in the United Kingdom.\u201d He wanted to stay to clear his name but in December 2014 he was arrested by Home Office staff and taken in handcuffs to a detention centre. He returned to India after being released but still hopes to clear his name. Farzana Boby returned from London two years ago, having spent three years attempting and failing to overturn an allegation of cheating. In 2014 she was arrested by six immigration officers during a dawn raid at her home and given a piece of paper stating that she had gained leave to remain in the UK \u201cby deception\u201d. She has no qualifications to show for her time in London because British officials accused her of cheating in the English test and she was forced to stop attending college before completing her degree. As a consequence she is unable to get a good job back in Bangladesh, relations with her family have been badly damaged, and she describes as her life as a \u201cliving hell\u201d. Her English was already very good before she left home at 19 to study business in London, having completed most of her education in an American-run missionary school. She said she would not have needed to cheat to pass a straightforward English test. Kishor did a degree in English literature and economics in Nepal and worked as an English teacher before moving to Afghanistan to work with Nato troops. His English was fluent long before he came to the UK to study business. But in 2014, a month before he was due to graduate, he received a letter from the Home Office accusing him of cheating in the routine English test he had been required to take to extend his student visa. He was told he faced detention and removal. Five years later, he remains in the UK, prevented by the government from working or studying, surviving with the help of food banks. He has spent more than \u00a350,000 on wasted tuition fees and legal fees trying to clear his name. Kishor thinks the government\u2019s willingness to believe that tens of thousands of students cheated was linked to its drive to vastly cut migration, and he blames Theresa May, who was then home secretary. Naveed Khan, 33, attempted suicide after being accused by the Home Office of cheating in an English language exam. While he was recovering in hospital, doctors advised him to return to Pakistan, hoping this would help lift his depression. But Khan has been rejected by his family, who have such faith in the British justice system that they do not believe the UK government could have wrongly accused students of cheating. He says he is near destitute in Pakistan, staying in a community centre for homeless people. Khan studied in an English-language school before he came to the UK and was already fluent, so he was relaxed about the language test he was required to take when he was renewing his visa towards the end of his business degree. In 2014 he was accused of having cheated in the exam. Classified as an illegal immigrant, his bank account was frozen, he was dismissed from his job, made homeless and had his driving licence suspended. Since Waqas Jawaid, 34, had his student visa cancelled by the Home Office in 2014, he has been held in an immigration detention centre, his fiancee has left him because she can no longer see a future together, his relationship with his parents has disintegrated, he has undergone severe weight loss because he has had so little to eat at times, and he has felt suicidal. Jawaid arrived in England to study business management in 2010. The following year he sat the test of English for international communication. \u201cIt was the easiest English exam I\u2019ve ever sat,\u201d he said. Jawaid has experienced periods of extreme financial hardship. \u201cI was eating boiled rice for two months. I didn\u2019t even have money to put sauce on the rice. I lost a lot of weight.\u201d Raja Noman Hussain spent four months in detention after being accused by the government of cheating in the Home Office-approved English test. He met more than 100 other international students who had also been arrested and detained after being accused by the Home Office of cheating. Hussain says he had no need to cheat as he came to the UK with a good level of English, having studied in an English-language school since the age of 11. He has spent five years trying to clear his name so that he can either resume his studies or return to Pakistan without an allegation of fraud from the UK government hanging over him. He has been supported by relatives who have paid more than \u00a323,000 in legal costs. Students he encountered from poorer families were unable to mount legal challenges to the decision and most were deported. His father has asked him not to return until he has proved his innocence. Since being accused in 2016 of cheating in the Toeic she had taken four years earlier, Bibi Rahima has been unable to study or to work, but she does not want to return to Bangladesh with her reputation tarnished. The process of attempting to challenge the accusation has made her severely depressed; she was admitted to hospital last June feeling suicidal.

Right now, fashion is C\u00e9line\u2019s world, and the rest of us just live in it. From the moment she stepped out of her car into a freak Parisian heatwave last Monday morning, dressed in a sculpted black gown with long, tight leather gloves, a glossy black headpiece that resembled an electrified bird of prey and open-toed booties, it was clear that Ms Dion had not come to haute couture week to play. She had come to slay. When she made her next entrance not just in full Gucci \u2013 peppermint and white puff-sleeved minidress, black bondage collar with silver spikes, lace tights and peep-toe shoes \u2013 but riding an electric scooter, the penny began to drop that this haute couture fashion week had in effect been rebranded as an extended pre-show entertainment to warm up the crowd for Dion\u2019s headlining slot in Hyde Park. By the time she made what might, in a hotly contested field, go down in history as her best look of the week, in a grand Richard Quinn bow-topped gown, the cool tones of its electric blue and jade green floral perfectly set off by a pair of weimaraner dogs that Dion held nonchalantly by their diamante collars \u2013 the vibe in the front row was very much, print her face on our money already, for she is our queen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea75e38c2db11abb518bad51c82ff46b5e0aadd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea75e38c2db11abb518bad51c82ff46b5e0aadd7/1_0_2559_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Celine Dion wows Paris in ???, Off-White swimsuit with blazer and Schiaparelli.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celine Dion wows Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: REX/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I know what you\u2019re thinking. You\u2019re thinking that Dion has completely lost the plot \u2013 and, maybe, so have I. That Dion looks less like a woman of taste than a woman who has covered herself in glue and run through the VIP fitting room of every boutique on the Avenue Montaigne. And the thing is, you\u2019re not completely wrong. Dion is not chic in any conventional sense. Her look is not easy on the eye, which is exactly what makes it interesting. It is the polar opposite of the Duchess of Cambridge school of pleasant, flattering, appropriate clothes. She makes no concession to the playbook of good taste, or the unspoken rules about what a 51-year-old woman should wear to catwalk shows that will be headlined by 18-year-old supermodels. (In Dion\u2019s case, memorably, an Off-White \u201csuit\u201d comprising a one-piece, high-cut zippered graffiti-emblazoned swimsuit with a matching blazer, as seen just a few days earlier on Gigi Hadid.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BzhweFABCeD/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

She is her own muse, the heroine of her own story, and she gives herself all the best plotlines. Even when her looks are at their most jaw dropping \u2013 we haven\u2019t even mentioned the second-skin unitard with C-H-A-N-E-L spelt out in gold hardware jangling from a chain belt \u2013 the most compelling thing about Dion is always the woman herself, not the clothes. In stark contrast to endless, soulless images of women posing in uncomfortable dresses on red carpets with rictus grins and hollow cheeks, looking like they would rather be anywhere else, or pouting with exaggerated boredom in a bathroom selfie, Dion always looks like she\u2019s having the time of her life. This is a woman who really, really loves fashion. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"01e4d00399e6482110039b62a4343bb0a63dd27d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01e4d00399e6482110039b62a4343bb0a63dd27d/0_0_1768_3492/506.jpg\" alt=\"Dion wears a second-skin unitard with Chanel belt.\" width=\"506\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dion wears a second-skin unitard with Chanel belt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ACau/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can tell, not just because she clearly spends an eye-watering amount of time and money on clothes, but also because her exaggerated, sculptural camera-friendly poses are those of a woman who has soaked up a lifetime of fashion imagery. She stands for a photograph like one of the iconic couture models of the 1950s, with the swan-like neck of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/feb/08/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Jean Patchett</a> and the angled hip of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/may/07/guardianobituaries.veronicahorwell\" title=\"\">Suzy Parker</a>, but adds the wink-to-camera knowingness of Elton John in his pomp.

The deaths came within two days of each other. Later that year, a paparazzi shot of her wearing a neon-yellow Balenciaga gown caught the attention of the fashion industry, and she became a more frequent sight on the front row. Dion\u2019s relationship with fashion feels much more than transactional. It feels, in fact, like a bit of a love affair. She gave a standing ovation to a Giambattista Valli collection and was moved to tears at a Valentino show last year. She takes pleasure in its beauty and its silliness. When she began working with Roach two years ago, he was excited to find his new client enthusiastic about the fashion potential of mining her own pop-culture background for street-style jokes. When Roach tentatively showed Dion a Vetements \u201cTitanic\u201d sweatshirt, her reaction was: \u201cWhat do you mean, what do I think about it? I love it. I want to wear it today,\u201d Roach told the Guardian last year. Last week, Dion wore another Vetements X Titanic look: a replica of the film\u2019s iconic Heart of the Ocean diamond, over a T-shirt reading I Love Paris Hilton. In May, for an encore after her epic Met Gala appearance in champagne-toned Oscar de la Renta fringing and peacock feathers, she greeted the photographers outside her hotel in a back-to-front Maison Margiela blazer \u2013 spoofing her own 1999 Oscars look, minus the white cowboy hat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd82e017ca83c7ce9c3cc45b7ce97fe5905a5253\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd82e017ca83c7ce9c3cc45b7ce97fe5905a5253/0_388_3248_3989/814.jpg\" alt=\"Dion in Paris, wearing a Vetements X Titanic look.\" width=\"814\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dion in Paris, wearing a Vetements X Titanic look.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohammed Mosteghanemi/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last month, Dion\u2019s 16-year residency in Las Vegas came to an end.

She had come to slay. When she made her next entrance not just in full Gucci \u2013 peppermint and white puff-sleeved minidress, black bondage collar with silver spikes, lace tights and peep-toe shoes \u2013 but riding an electric scooter, the penny began to drop that this haute couture fashion week had in effect been rebranded as an extended pre-show entertainment to warm up the crowd for Dion\u2019s headlining slot in Hyde Park. By the time she made what might, in a hotly contested field, go down in history as her best look of the week, in a grand Richard Quinn bow-topped gown, the cool tones of its electric blue and jade green floral perfectly set off by a pair of weimaraner dogs that Dion held nonchalantly by their diamante collars \u2013 the vibe in the front row was very much, print her face on our money already, for she is our queen. I know what you\u2019re thinking. You\u2019re thinking that Dion has completely lost the plot \u2013 and, maybe, so have I. That Dion looks less like a woman of taste than a woman who has covered herself in glue and run through the VIP fitting room of every boutique on the Avenue Montaigne. And the thing is, you\u2019re not completely wrong. Dion is not chic in any conventional sense. Her look is not easy on the eye, which is exactly what makes it interesting. It is the polar opposite of the Duchess of Cambridge school of pleasant, flattering, appropriate clothes. She makes no concession to the playbook of good taste, or the unspoken rules about what a 51-year-old woman should wear to catwalk shows that will be headlined by 18-year-old supermodels. (In Dion\u2019s case, memorably, an Off-White \u201csuit\u201d comprising a one-piece, high-cut zippered graffiti-emblazoned swimsuit with a matching blazer, as seen just a few days earlier on Gigi Hadid.) Dion\u2019s wardrobe is about drama \u2013 not just for its own sake, but as a narrative. She is her own muse, the heroine of her own story, and she gives herself all the best plotlines. Even when her looks are at their most jaw dropping \u2013 we haven\u2019t even mentioned the second-skin unitard with C-H-A-N-E-L spelt out in gold hardware jangling from a chain belt \u2013 the most compelling thing about Dion is always the woman herself, not the clothes. In stark contrast to endless, soulless images of women posing in uncomfortable dresses on red carpets with rictus grins and hollow cheeks, looking like they would rather be anywhere else, or pouting with exaggerated boredom in a bathroom selfie, Dion always looks like she\u2019s having the time of her life. This is a woman who really, really loves fashion. You can tell, not just because she clearly spends an eye-watering amount of time and money on clothes, but also because her exaggerated, sculptural camera-friendly poses are those of a woman who has soaked up a lifetime of fashion imagery. She stands for a photograph like one of the iconic couture models of the 1950s, with the swan-like neck of Jean Patchett and the angled hip of Suzy Parker, but adds the wink-to-camera knowingness of Elton John in his pomp. Along with her image-making team \u2013 \u201cimage architect\u201d Law Roach, and stylists Sydney Lopez and Pepe Munoz \u2013 she collaborates with a wide range of designers, rather than being beholden to one label. With a personal fortune estimated by Forbes at $430m (\u00a3345m) she has no need to play the passive paper doll. Dion\u2019s reinvention from bejazzled Vegas diva to avant-garde Parisian street-style star began in 2016, the year in which she lost both her husband of 22 years and her brother to cancer. The deaths came within two days of each other. Later that year, a paparazzi shot of her wearing a neon-yellow Balenciaga gown caught the attention of the fashion industry, and she became a more frequent sight on the front row. Dion\u2019s relationship with fashion feels much more than transactional. It feels, in fact, like a bit of a love affair. She gave a standing ovation to a Giambattista Valli collection and was moved to tears at a Valentino show last year. She takes pleasure in its beauty and its silliness. When she began working with Roach two years ago, he was excited to find his new client enthusiastic about the fashion potential of mining her own pop-culture background for street-style jokes. When Roach tentatively showed Dion a Vetements \u201cTitanic\u201d sweatshirt, her reaction was: \u201cWhat do you mean, what do I think about it? I love it. I want to wear it today,\u201d Roach told the Guardian last year. Last week, Dion wore another Vetements X Titanic look: a replica of the film\u2019s iconic Heart of the Ocean diamond, over a T-shirt reading I Love Paris Hilton. In May, for an encore after her epic Met Gala appearance in champagne-toned Oscar de la Renta fringing and peacock feathers, she greeted the photographers outside her hotel in a back-to-front Maison Margiela blazer \u2013 spoofing her own 1999 Oscars look, minus the white cowboy hat. Last month, Dion\u2019s 16-year residency in Las Vegas came to an end. Having changed the rules of Vegas \u2013 Jon Gray, the general manager of the Palms Casino Resort, told the Daily Beast that \u201cVegas was a place where singers go to die. C\u00e9line changed that\u201d \u2013 she is now changing the rules of the front row. A recent post on her Instagram showing her wearing an Alexandre Vauthier dress \u2013 sumptuous whipped folds of vanilla ice-cream silk, knicker-length hemline, floor-sweeping sleeves \u2013 was captioned \u201cChanneling the inner goddess in all of us \u2013 Team C\u00e9line.\u201d Amen to that. We may not all be in haute couture, but we are all Team C\u00e9line.",

But he said he had not initially asked the Science Museum for further details about the exhibition, and only then realised that Raytheon, a US firm, had been signed up as the principal sponsor. He accused Raytheon of engaging in \u201cartwashing\u201d using its link with the museum to distract from its involvement in the arms trade and conflicts such as Yemen, where more than 10,000 civilians have died.",

      "body": "<p>In the middle of a cavernous factory floor in Pudsey, Leeds, sits a gleaming steel cylinder. One day, its maker believes, most of us will end up in something similar.</p> <p>The machine is a Resomator \u2013 a pressurised canister in which corpses are submerged in a mixture of 150C water and potassium hydroxide solution for three to four hours until the flesh is dissolved, leaving behind only soft, greyish bones. After drying in an adjacent oven, these are ground down into paper-white powder, while the fluid is sent to a water treatment plant for disposal. The entire process is operated by a touchscreen and a single \u201cstart\u201d button, away from the view of mourners. Ashes to ashes no more.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://resomation.com/our-funeral-partners/key-features-benefits-of-resomation/\" title=\"\">Resomator</a>, its supporters say, is badly needed by a burial and cremation industry that is increasingly damaging to the environment. More than three-quarters of Britons now choose cremation over burial, a process that, on average, releases 400kg of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere per body. Cremation fumes also include vaporised mercury from tooth-fillings, accounting for 16% of the UK\u2019s mercury emissions in 2005, along with other toxic emissions from burnt prosthetics and melted bone cement used during common surgeries such as hip replacements.</p> <p>Burial, too, has its consequences, with embalming fluid seeping into the soil as the body and coffin decompose, as well as other toxins such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy drugs. Burial space is also becoming increasingly scarce and expensive in built-up areas. The Money Advice Service found that <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-much-does-a-funeral-cost\" title=\"\">the average cost of a basic burial</a> in the UK is \u00a34,267, with prices increasing by 6% each year \u2013 twice the inflation rate \u2013 for the past 14 years. A UK league table, compiled by the <a href=\"https://www.cremation.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Cremation Society</a>, shows that the cost of a cremation on its own can top \u00a31,000 in 2019, compared with \u00a3650 in 2010. This continued hiking of prices has prompted the Competition and Market Authority to undertake an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-launches-funerals-market-investigation\" title=\"\">investigation into the funerals sector</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee9d19033cd6eda9dcc44cdcf4f179b7645af14b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee9d19033cd6eda9dcc44cdcf4f179b7645af14b/4_0_3060_1836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two Resomators at Resomation\u2019s Leeds HQ\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two Resomators at Resomation\u2019s Leeds HQ</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Resomation.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the US, resomation, also known as alkaline hydrolysis, has been used since the mid-1990s and is legal in 19 states. The technology was initially developed in the US to dispose of cows during a decade-long foot-and-mouth epidemic. In 2008, <a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/ucla-appoints-new-director-to-lead-donated-body-program\" title=\"\">Dean Fis</a><a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/ucla-appoints-new-director-to-lead-donated-body-program\" title=\"\">her</a>, a doctor at the University of California, Los Angeles, realised that it could be used for donated medical cadavers once they were no longer needed. \u201cEverything about this process is a win-win; everything is recyclable,\u201d he says, adding that 1,200 bodies have gone through UCLA\u2019s Resomator since it went into service in 2012.</p> <p>Fisher bought the machine from the Leeds-based company Resomation Ltd, which is hoping the process will become part of public funeral rites. \u201cThere\u2019s an \u2018ick factor\u2019 involved with this technology,\u201d Fisher says. \u201cPeople worry their bodies are being dissolved or that it\u2019s a waste of water \u2013 but that 250 gallons we use per body can then be used as fertiliser because of the nutrients that are in it. People\u2019s perceptions need to change.\u201d</p> <p>Resomation\u2019s founder, Sandy Sullivan, has been dealing with this \u201cick factor\u201d ever since he began in 2007. The company got initial funding from Co-Op Funeralcare and then a partnership with the <a href=\"https://lbbcgroup.com/\" title=\"\">Leeds and Bradford Boiler Company</a>. Funeral directors in the US and Canada bought its technology, including a California-based company that even uses resomation on pets. In 2017, Rowley Regis crematorium, in the West Midlands, was set to become the first in the UK to use a Resomator, but the local water company, Severn Trent, banned it from doing so, citing \u201cserious concerns about the public acceptability of liquefied remains of the dead going into the water system\u201d. Sullivan insists: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why resomation can\u2019t go into operation, though \u2013 it\u2019s a water-like, sterile liquid with no DNA in it and it\u2019s cleaner than most of the things that go into the water treatment plant, like blood and chemicals from hospitals. Crucially, this isn\u2019t water that we will be drinking.\u201d Water UK, the regulatory authority, has refused to comment on the issue.</p> <p>In the two years since the Rowley Regis debacle, however, Sullivan says progress has been made with Water UK. He is convinced the technology will get the go-ahead within the next year. \u201cIt leaves six times less carbon footprint and uses seven times less energy than burial,\u201d he says, noting that a Danish government-funded study also found that the environmental impact of burial/cremation and resomation, can be costed at \u20ac63 per body for the former, while the latter is only \u20ac3. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching a climate catastrophe and yet we\u2019re still burning bodies,\u201d Sullivan says. \u201cOur feedback from the US has been that people are interested because they feel a water-based process is gentler than flame.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c82bedfabbec49f5f3fcc8f6ffd46242f229d94f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c82bedfabbec49f5f3fcc8f6ffd46242f229d94f/2508_300_1289_1289/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sandy Sullivan of Resomation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandy Sullivan: \u2018Resomation leaves six times less carbon footprint and uses seven times less energy that burial\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Resomation.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Resomation\u2019s PR problem has been eased in recent years by the rise of other alternatives to cremation and burial, including promession \u2013 the freeze-drying of bodies, which are then broken into smaller remains through vibration \u2013 and a \u201cmushroom suit\u201d that uses funghi to speed up decomposition. In May, the state of Washington legalised human composting.</p> <p>Pioneered by Katrina Spade and her company <a href=\"https://www.recompose.life/\" title=\"\">Recompose</a>, this involves placing a corpse in an above-ground receptacle filled with soil and organic materials. After about four weeks, Spade says, \u201cYour body is transformed into a usable soil, to grow new life. Your family can then grow a tree and maybe your great-grandchildren will swing from its branches some day.\u201d Despite opposition from the Catholic church, Spade hopes to open the first Recompose facility in Seattle next yearin 2020.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.dur.ac.uk/theology.religion/staff/profile/?id=663\" title=\"\">Prof Douglas Davies</a>, the leader of the Durham University <a href=\"https://www.dur.ac.uk/cdals/\" title=\"\">Centre for Life and Death Studies</a>, our attitudes towards death have changed significantly in recent decades. Cremation was popularised in the UK in the late 19th century, pushed on by growing secularism and the Industrial Revolution, but environmental concerns have led to a rise in natural burials and new technologies. \u201cWe now have roughly the same number of woodland burial sites across the UK as we have crematoria,\u201d Davies says. \u201cLanguage is really important when it comes to these new methods and I think the term \u2018resomation\u2019 will catch on in the UK because it\u2019s sufficiently opaque. People go for cremation because they dislike ideas that burial is somehow gruesome or \u2018lonely\u2019, but then they are also uneasy about the use of fire in cremation, and that\u2019s where resomation will come in.\u201d</p> <p>Devon-based Claire and Rupert Callender opened their <a href=\"http://www.thegreenfuneralcompany.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Green Funeral Company</a> in 2000 and are now among the country\u2019s best-known eco-friendly funeral directors. They are raising funds to buy a Resomator. \u201cFuneral directors are conservative, worried about peoples\u2019 perceptions and about how to sell resomation to the public,\u201d Claire says, \u201cbut, with cremation, your grandma is basically going up a chimney and then coming out as particles of soot and carbon and everybody is inhaling them.\u201d</p> <p>Where larger funeral directors will often take on three to four cremations a day, the Callenders perform only about 70 a year, with some ceremonies taking up to 12 hours at the Sharpham Trust\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.sharphamtrust.org/ceremonies/natural-burials\">natural burial ground</a> at Sharpham Meadow. \u201cPeople are hungry to talk about death and to get involved in it, yet high-street funeral directors totally miss this,\u201d Claire says. \u201cThey have this barrier between themselves and the people, they wear those ridiculous suits and they\u2019re all about upselling. It\u2019s a faux-Victoriana of \u2018dignity\u2019 and \u2018respect\u2019 \u2013 schooling you in the etiquette of bereavement.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"42b4c4dc239138c70a066669cc4a03cb79941be3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42b4c4dc239138c70a066669cc4a03cb79941be3/0_84_5886_3532/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sharpham Trust\u2019s natural burial ground at Sharpham Meadow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flowers and other markers at the Sharpham Trust\u2019s natural burial ground at Sharpham Meadow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beccy Strong/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When her grandmother died in 2018, Oona Mills decided to avoid this conventional approach, opting for a woodland service instead. \u201cShe was a natural gardener for most of her life and lived very minimally,\u201d Mills says, \u201cso it seemed very fitting for her to have a natural service, especially since she\u2019d told me that the greatest achievement in her life was the compost that she\u2019d made.\u201d Mills\u2019s service aimed to keep the burial as low-tech as possible, using a wicker coffin and no embalming fluids. She feels that resomation or human composting is unnecessary: \u201cNatural burials are very effective.

      "bodyText": "In the middle of a cavernous factory floor in Pudsey, Leeds, sits a gleaming steel cylinder. One day, its maker believes, most of us will end up in something similar. The machine is a Resomator \u2013 a pressurised canister in which corpses are submerged in a mixture of 150C water and potassium hydroxide solution for three to four hours until the flesh is dissolved, leaving behind only soft, greyish bones. After drying in an adjacent oven, these are ground down into paper-white powder, while the fluid is sent to a water treatment plant for disposal. The entire process is operated by a touchscreen and a single \u201cstart\u201d button, away from the view of mourners. Ashes to ashes no more. The Resomator, its supporters say, is badly needed by a burial and cremation industry that is increasingly damaging to the environment. More than three-quarters of Britons now choose cremation over burial, a process that, on average, releases 400kg of CO2 into the atmosphere per body. Cremation fumes also include vaporised mercury from tooth-fillings, accounting for 16% of the UK\u2019s mercury emissions in 2005, along with other toxic emissions from burnt prosthetics and melted bone cement used during common surgeries such as hip replacements. Burial, too, has its consequences, with embalming fluid seeping into the soil as the body and coffin decompose, as well as other toxins such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy drugs. Burial space is also becoming increasingly scarce and expensive in built-up areas. The Money Advice Service found that the average cost of a basic burial in the UK is \u00a34,267, with prices increasing by 6% each year \u2013 twice the inflation rate \u2013 for the past 14 years. A UK league table, compiled by the Cremation Society, shows that the cost of a cremation on its own can top \u00a31,000 in 2019, compared with \u00a3650 in 2010. This continued hiking of prices has prompted the Competition and Market Authority to undertake an investigation into the funerals sector. In the US, resomation, also known as alkaline hydrolysis, has been used since the mid-1990s and is legal in 19 states. The technology was initially developed in the US to dispose of cows during a decade-long foot-and-mouth epidemic. In 2008, Dean Fisher, a doctor at the University of California, Los Angeles, realised that it could be used for donated medical cadavers once they were no longer needed. \u201cEverything about this process is a win-win; everything is recyclable,\u201d he says, adding that 1,200 bodies have gone through UCLA\u2019s Resomator since it went into service in 2012. Fisher bought the machine from the Leeds-based company Resomation Ltd, which is hoping the process will become part of public funeral rites. \u201cThere\u2019s an \u2018ick factor\u2019 involved with this technology,\u201d Fisher says. \u201cPeople worry their bodies are being dissolved or that it\u2019s a waste of water \u2013 but that 250 gallons we use per body can then be used as fertiliser because of the nutrients that are in it. People\u2019s perceptions need to change.\u201d Resomation\u2019s founder, Sandy Sullivan, has been dealing with this \u201cick factor\u201d ever since he began in 2007. The company got initial funding from Co-Op Funeralcare and then a partnership with the Leeds and Bradford Boiler Company. Funeral directors in the US and Canada bought its technology, including a California-based company that even uses resomation on pets. In 2017, Rowley Regis crematorium, in the West Midlands, was set to become the first in the UK to use a Resomator, but the local water company, Severn Trent, banned it from doing so, citing \u201cserious concerns about the public acceptability of liquefied remains of the dead going into the water system\u201d. Sullivan insists: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why resomation can\u2019t go into operation, though \u2013 it\u2019s a water-like, sterile liquid with no DNA in it and it\u2019s cleaner than most of the things that go into the water treatment plant, like blood and chemicals from hospitals. Crucially, this isn\u2019t water that we will be drinking.\u201d Water UK, the regulatory authority, has refused to comment on the issue. In the two years since the Rowley Regis debacle, however, Sullivan says progress has been made with Water UK. He is convinced the technology will get the go-ahead within the next year. \u201cIt leaves six times less carbon footprint and uses seven times less energy than burial,\u201d he says, noting that a Danish government-funded study also found that the environmental impact of burial/cremation and resomation, can be costed at \u20ac63 per body for the former, while the latter is only \u20ac3. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching a climate catastrophe and yet we\u2019re still burning bodies,\u201d Sullivan says. \u201cOur feedback from the US has been that people are interested because they feel a water-based process is gentler than flame.\u201d Resomation\u2019s PR problem has been eased in recent years by the rise of other alternatives to cremation and burial, including promession \u2013 the freeze-drying of bodies, which are then broken into smaller remains through vibration \u2013 and a \u201cmushroom suit\u201d that uses funghi to speed up decomposition. In May, the state of Washington legalised human composting. Pioneered by Katrina Spade and her company Recompose, this involves placing a corpse in an above-ground receptacle filled with soil and organic materials. After about four weeks, Spade says, \u201cYour body is transformed into a usable soil, to grow new life. Your family can then grow a tree and maybe your great-grandchildren will swing from its branches some day.\u201d Despite opposition from the Catholic church, Spade hopes to open the first Recompose facility in Seattle next yearin 2020. According to Prof Douglas Davies, the leader of the Durham University Centre for Life and Death Studies, our attitudes towards death have changed significantly in recent decades. Cremation was popularised in the UK in the late 19th century, pushed on by growing secularism and the Industrial Revolution, but environmental concerns have led to a rise in natural burials and new technologies. \u201cWe now have roughly the same number of woodland burial sites across the UK as we have crematoria,\u201d Davies says. \u201cLanguage is really important when it comes to these new methods and I think the term \u2018resomation\u2019 will catch on in the UK because it\u2019s sufficiently opaque. People go for cremation because they dislike ideas that burial is somehow gruesome or \u2018lonely\u2019, but then they are also uneasy about the use of fire in cremation, and that\u2019s where resomation will come in.\u201d Devon-based Claire and Rupert Callender opened their Green Funeral Company in 2000 and are now among the country\u2019s best-known eco-friendly funeral directors. They are raising funds to buy a Resomator. \u201cFuneral directors are conservative, worried about peoples\u2019 perceptions and about how to sell resomation to the public,\u201d Claire says, \u201cbut, with cremation, your grandma is basically going up a chimney and then coming out as particles of soot and carbon and everybody is inhaling them.\u201d Where larger funeral directors will often take on three to four cremations a day, the Callenders perform only about 70 a year, with some ceremonies taking up to 12 hours at the Sharpham Trust\u2019s natural burial ground at Sharpham Meadow. \u201cPeople are hungry to talk about death and to get involved in it, yet high-street funeral directors totally miss this,\u201d Claire says. \u201cThey have this barrier between themselves and the people, they wear those ridiculous suits and they\u2019re all about upselling. It\u2019s a faux-Victoriana of \u2018dignity\u2019 and \u2018respect\u2019 \u2013 schooling you in the etiquette of bereavement.\u201d When her grandmother died in 2018, Oona Mills decided to avoid this conventional approach, opting for a woodland service instead. \u201cShe was a natural gardener for most of her life and lived very minimally,\u201d Mills says, \u201cso it seemed very fitting for her to have a natural service, especially since she\u2019d told me that the greatest achievement in her life was the compost that she\u2019d made.\u201d Mills\u2019s service aimed to keep the burial as low-tech as possible, using a wicker coffin and no embalming fluids. She feels that resomation or human composting is unnecessary: \u201cNatural burials are very effective. You can bury someone at three feet rather than six feet under, which is much quicker for the body to decompose.\u201d For Sullivan, the priority is not to replace natural burial but to provide more green options. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told that our technology comes out at about the same price as cremation,\u201d he says, \u201cso the choice is there. People need to overcome their assumptions and do what is best for the planet.\u201d The National Association of Funeral Directors also \u201cwelcomes any proper method of disposal that offers the public choice\u201d. Fisher, meanwhile, is so enthusiastic about resomation that he would like to undergo the process once he dies. \u201cThey\u2019ll put me in here when I\u2019m dead, too \u2013 and if that isn\u2019t enough of an endorsement for you, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d he says. Back in Leeds, one of Sullivan\u2019s two Resomators is humming quietly during a test cycle, liquid sloshing around as in a dishwasher. It is about to be shipped to a Minnesota funeral home. \u201cThis is the future,\u201d Sullivan says, stroking the curved steel exterior. \u201cChange is always difficult in such a conservative market, but we need to look after the planet even once we die, since we keep on destroying it while we live.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 10 July 2019.

This comes as more than 50 MPs wrote to the education secretary, Damian Hinds, urging the government to show stronger support to schools on teaching about same-sex relationships. Parents of pupils at Parkfield community school in Saltley staged weekly protests over the relationship lessons, which they claimed promoted gay and transgender lifestyles. In March, hundreds of mainly Muslim children, aged between four and 11, were withdrawn from the school for the day. Just before Easter, the school announced the \u201cNo outsiders\u201d lessons, which teach tolerance of diverse groups including those of different races, genders and sexual orientations, would not take place until a resolution had been reached.

Hinds, who has previously spoken in support of the school\u2019s teachers, has been urged to provide further support for schools offering equality lessons. A letter written by the Labour MPs Emma Hardy and Jack Dromey, and co-signed by more than 50 MPs and some members of the House of Lords, said: \u201cWe ask you to provide absolute clarity in regard to relationships education in primary schools, which must be inclusive of all protected characteristics, and treat the different types of relationships in our society equally.\u201d Referring to the recent demonstrations against equality teaching at Anderton Park primary school, also in Birmingham, the MPs say it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d that a school had a high court injunction against demonstrations outside its gates. In response, Hinds said: \u201cOur new guidance is clear that children should leave school having learnt about LGBT relationships, and I strongly encourage primary schools to teach about different types of family, including families with same-sex parents.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "One tonne of white Lego bricks will be scattered across large tables in Tate Modern\u2019s Turbine Hall this summer, allowing anyone who visits to unleash their inner architect. The Lego project is the work of the artist Olafur Eliasson, the subject of a major retrospective opening at the gallery on Thursday. The exhibition includes a waterfall, a 39-metre corridor of dense fog and a huge wall of reindeer moss from Finland. On 26 July the Lego arrives, giving people an opportunity over three weeks to create what they hope or imagine will be the city of the future. Curators said the work was intended to keep on evolving as people modified the efforts of those who had gone before them \u2013 a celebration of individual imagination and the \u201ccollaborative power of communities\u201d. Eliasson is best known in the UK for his Weather Project installation in the Turbine Hall in 2003, one of the most popular art installations in Tate Modern\u2019s history, scenes of people lying down and basking in the dazzling fake sunlight not uncommon. Tate Modern\u2019s director, Frances Morris, credited Eliasson with helping the gallery see how its public spaces could be effectively co-curated with the people who visited. \u201cWhen Olafur made that installation we had no idea how the public would respond to this kind of dematerialised installation full of fog and light. The public performed in that space and took it over \u2026 it shifted our idea of how we could use the building.\u201d Tate said the new show, 16 years on, would give British audiences the first opportunity to see the full range of Eliasson\u2019s work. Embedded in his practice is a concern for the environment. The curator Mark Godfrey said the gallery had consciously chosen pieces that were in Europe. \u201cIn terms of shipping we made active choices to bring work by truck and ferry rather than air freight.\u201d Eliasson\u2019s studio has also taken over the gallery\u2019s Terrace bar, working with Tate to create a vegetarian lunch menu which is organic and locally sourced.

It lives on the humidity in the air so it is in fact alive when it sits there on the wall.\u201d On the terrace outside the artist has installed a large waterfall sculpture on scaffolding, which is also part of his investigation into how we think about and respond to the environment. \u201cIt is a real waterfall with real water but it\u2019s also obviously a construction and there is this notion nature is not outside of our creation.\u201d One of the liveliest environmental debates in the arts is whether museums and theatres should accept the money of BP as a sponsor. Tate ended its partnership with BP in 2017 and Eliasson was asked whether he would have allowed the show if the oil company was still a sponsor. \u201cI actually don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is clear that the fossil fuel companies need to be much more radical.

The cover of Mother Earth\u2019s Plantasia featured a cartoon of two people cuddling a houseplant, and came with a free horticultural booklet. Best of all, it claimed that its intended audience wasn\u2019t human: you were supposed to play its \u201cwarm Earth music\u201d to plants \u201cto aid in their growing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSo I put it on and, man, I absolutely immediately fell in love with it,\u201d says Braaten, who now runs Sacred Bones Records. \u201cThere\u2019s something about it that is immediately nostalgic.

It\u2019s very interesting.\u201d</p> <p>The more Braaten learned about the album, the stranger its story seemed.

YouTube videos of the album attracted views in the millions, commenters hailed it as everything from a precursor to Brian Eno\u2019s ambient music to a prophetic warning about global warming, people made fake Plantasia TV adverts and cover versions of its tracks.

Either way, no one was more startled by the album\u2019s rise to cultdom than Garson\u2019s daughter, Day Darmet. \u201cAfter my dad passed, I took all of his things and I neatly put them away, all the extra music,\u201d she says. \u201cThen friends started telling me there was a whole bunch of Plantasia on YouTube.

Despite her reservations about the album, Day Garson is touched. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t move me, but it moved my dad. So whatever moved him must be moving other people.

I looked at it myself and thought, that\u2019s one bunch of crazy people.\u201d Her bafflement was compounded by the fact that she didn\u2019t particularly care for the album. \u201cThere\u2019s pieces my dad did that are so stunningly beautiful and heartfelt, but this just didn\u2019t do it for me.\u201d Nor did her mother, whose own interest in gardening, rather than The Secret Life of Plants itself, inspired Plantasia. \u201cShe thought he had gone off the deep end.\u201d She batted away a series of inquiries about rereleasing the album until Braaten got in touch, offering to put it out on Sacred Bones \u2013 best known as home to singer-songwriters Zola Jesus and Marissa Nadler \u2013 as part of a wider retrospective of Garson\u2019s work. Despite her reservations about the album, Day Garson is touched. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t move me, but it moved my dad. So whatever moved him must be moving other people. On his epitaph he had me write, \u201c\u2018The music plays on.\u2019 He was right. The music plays on.\u201d \u2022 Plantasia is available on vinyl and CD from Sacred Bones Records.",

Already renowned for his Olivier award-winning adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOVSp-fYUQc\">Shockheaded Peter</a> and such outdoor shows as <a href=\"https://www.improbable.co.uk/portfolios/sticky/\">Sticky</a> (which saw the construction of a 100ft tower using Sellotape), <a href=\"https://www.improbable.co.uk/team/phelim-mcdermott/\">Phelim McDermott</a> has directed three of Glass\u2019s great operas \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2013/nov/28/eno-philip-glass-satyagraha-theatrical-and-musical-wonder\">Satyagraha</a>, about Gandhi; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/03/the-perfect-american-english-national-opera-review\">The Perfect American</a>, about Walt Disney; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/06/akhnaten-review-eno-coliseum-philip-glass-improbable\">Akhnahten</a>, about the pharaoh who briefly brought monotheism to Egypt.</p> <p>This week, the pair will debut a new work at the <a href=\"https://mif.co.uk/\">Manchester international festival</a>. Called Tao of Glass, it explores their creative relationship: the old master and the younger fan. \u201cIt\u2019s about my obsession with Philip\u2019s music,\u201d McDermott says, speaking in a cafe in London, near the offices of his Improbable theatre group. \u201cThe first show I ever made professionally, when I left Middlesex Poly, used music from Glassworks. I listened to that album obsessively when I was a student.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>When you've lost a piece, it can be devastating, like the loss of a child</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tao of Glass owes its origins to the children\u2019s author Maurice Sendak. Glass and McDermott had hoped to create an opera based on <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/InTheNightKitchenByMauriceSendak/page/n3\">In the Night Kitchen</a>, Sendak\u2019s book about a boy almost getting baked in a cake. The pair visited him at his house in rural Connecticut to hatch some plans. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do this show before I die!\u201d Sendak told them \u2013 but sadly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/08/maurice-sendak\">he </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/08/maurice-sendak\">did die, shortly afterwards</a>, in 2012.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dd6bc3db7619781dbeb4c07ce68e4a7f1c1afa5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd6bc3db7619781dbeb4c07ce68e4a7f1c1afa5e/0_0_1277_1642/778.jpg\" alt=\"Creepy tale \u2026 Mauricer Sendak\u2019s In the Night Kitchen.\" width=\"778\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creepy tale \u2026 Mauricer Sendak\u2019s In the Night Kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HarperCollins/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That put an end to their adaptation of In the Night Kitchen, a crushing experience for both McDermott and Glass. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve lost a piece, it can be devastating, like the loss of a child,\u201d says the composer, a father of four. Tao of Glass both is \u2013 and is about \u2013 the work McDermott and Glass decided to make instead. It will consist of 10 scenes set to music by Glass, performed by McDermott and several puppets: some created from paper or objects to evoke a dream world; others expressing the essence of Glass and his music; and a more traditional puppet of a child that represents McDermott as a boy, as his son, and as a character from a dream show that never gets made.</p> <p>Tao of Glass also asks where inspiration comes from. Glass is sure it originates in the subconscious. \u201cWhen I imagine music when I wake up in the morning, that means I\u2019ve been dreaming about it. And then, with very little effort, I can connect that dream with projects I\u2019ve been working on. But the actual connection happens in the part of your mind that doesn\u2019t relate to the everyday world. Music doesn\u2019t come from this world, it comes from the dream world.\u201d</p> <p>Glass\u2019s dreamlife must be as active as ever. This year alone, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/10/philip-glass-the-bowie-symphonies-lodger-london-contemporary-orchestra-royal-festival-hall\">he has debuted a symphony, Lodger</a>, based on the 1979 Bowie album, and created the music for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/theater/king-lear-review-glenda-jackson.html\">Glenda Jackson\u2019s second crack at King Lear on Broadway</a>. Does he compose every day? \u201cPretty much, because I don\u2019t have enough days, so I can\u2019t afford \u2026\u201d he trails off. \u201cI was just in Indianapolis, doing concerts, but I was writing during the day. I got back to New York at one o\u2019clock on Sunday and by three, I was working, and I\u2019ve been working every day since. That\u2019s not uncommon. People who paint paint all the time. I knew <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/08/how-allen-ginsbergs-howl-transformed-pop\">Allen Ginsberg</a> very well and he was writing constantly. Sometimes we were sharing quarters because we were at a retreat, and, in the middle of the night, he would wake up and write poetry.\u201d</p> <p>Ginsberg, he says, would change his poems mid-performance, which would throw Glass off-balance when he was trying to accompany him. \u201cI would say, \u2018Allen, I can\u2019t follow you when you do that.\u2019 And he\u2019d say, \u2018What did I do?\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018It\u2019s like running after a rabbit and you\u2019re never sure where the rabbit\u2019s going to jump to next.\u2019 We always had fun together. Phelim is very similar in the sense that he can draw on his unconscious very easily. That\u2019s what you see when you\u2019re looking at his work. But then people might say that about me and that\u2019s probably true.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9624269f59e6c9c0c9ae6e19171f1bda17432d0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9624269f59e6c9c0c9ae6e19171f1bda17432d0e/0_290_4740_2262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018That\u2019s so stupid it will probably be good\u2019 \u2026 McDermott\u2019s 2016 production of Akhnaten required the ENO cast to juggle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"477\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018That\u2019s so stupid it will probably be good\u2019 \u2026 McDermott\u2019s 2016 production of Akhnaten required the ENO cast to juggle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McDermott says he often gets his best ideas lying in a flotation tank \u2013 most notably, the one about getting the English National Opera chorus to juggle throughout much of Akhnaten. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he laughs, \u201cyou get an idea and think, \u2018That\u2019s so stupid it will probably be really good.\u2019\u201d The chorus were duly given lessons by master juggler <a href=\"http://www.gandinijuggling.com/\">Sean Gandini</a>. \u201cIn the end, they said, \u2018This is helping us learn where we are in the music.\u2019 So actually they really liked it.\u201d The hypnotic, repetitive and incrementally unfurling nature of Glass\u2019s music \u2013 not to mention a libretto largely sung in the languages of ancient Egypt \u2013 make it as hard to perform as it is gorgeous.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The hypnotic, repetitive, incrementally unfurling nature of Glass's music make it as gorgeous as it is hard to perform</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a young Glass fan, McDermott saw ENO\u2019s European premiere of Akhnaten in London in 1985. After picking up his ticket, he says, he spotted the composer in the street and followed him around Covent Garden until Glass disappeared into a sushi restaurant. \u201cI guess there was a fantasy \u2013 if I stopped him, what would I say? A little bit like when I saw Quentin Tarantino at a crime writers\u2019 festival in Nottingham. On some level, Tao of Glass is me finally daring to stop Philip and ask him a question.\u201d</p> <p>McDermott eventually met Glass after Se\u00e1n Doran, then ENO\u2019s artistic director, suggested he direct <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/apr/23/how-we-made-einstein-on-the-beach\">Einstein on the Beach</a>, whose visionary original production was created by Glass and director Robert Wilson. \u201cI was like, \u2018What? That\u2019s a really stupid idea.\u2019 It\u2019s such an extraordinary piece, it\u2019s like a crazy dream.\u201d Nonetheless, McDermott went for lunch in New York with Glass, who told him: \u201cYour genuine reluctance makes me think you should do it.\u201d Instead, McDermott directed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/25/how-we-made-satyagraha\">Satyagraha</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af237e524a2d795d45378c240df11f58701eeea3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af237e524a2d795d45378c240df11f58701eeea3/0_0_4647_3162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seat of the pants \u2026 a revival of McDermott\u2019s ENO production of Satyagraha.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"680\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seat of the pants \u2026 a revival of McDermott\u2019s ENO production of Satyagraha.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Opera, says McDermott, suits his seat-of-the-pants approach. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a chorus, an orchestra, some singers with extraordinary talent and personalities, and a set that could kill people if it hits them on the head. You rehearse, you\u2019ve got three days with the orchestra, a dress rehearsal and then you do the show. It\u2019s like doing a big outdoor gig. You have to go, \u2018Well, the crane comes through here, the audience will hopefully walk through here and the fireworks will go off there.\u2019 You have to create an environment in which all these things come into conversation with each other.\u201d</p> <p>There is a spiritual dimension to Tao of Glass, as the title suggests. Glass once described himself as \u201ca <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass\">Jewish Taoist Hindu Toltec Buddhist</a>\u201d. McDermott, meanwhile, is interested in Taoism: \u201cIt\u2019s basically a belief that nature has a process and a flow that you\u2019re either in alignment with or you\u2019re fighting.\u201d He believes in it \u201cin the sense that making shows, creatively, hasn\u2019t been anything to do with me. Somehow I\u2019ve managed to get out of my own way. In the rehearsals for Tao of Glass we would throw the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/21/ancient-book-wisdom-i-ching-computer-binary-code\">I Ching</a> every now and again. Generally, the message I get is, \u2018Stop trying to be in control.\u2019 Which of course is the hardest thing in the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b84c3b4bdd99af4545cd8f8f4244f12f190e159\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b84c3b4bdd99af4545cd8f8f4244f12f190e159/0_0_5319_3546/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Glass and Phelim McDermott\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In spirit \u2026 Philip Glass and Phelim McDermott.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rod Morata</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s McDermott\u2019s second time at <a href=\"https://mif.co.uk/whats-on/\">MIF</a> \u2013&#xa0;his first was Bambino, an opera for babies. He\u2019s a Mancunian who grew up watching shows at the Royal Exchange, where Tao of Glass will be staged. \u201cI used to sit and watch Max Wall doing Waiting for Godot \u2013 some extraordinary performances. The dream was, \u2018I\u2019ll direct things here.\u2019 But it never really happened. So I gave up on that dream and now it\u2019s come back. The Tao decided that it does happen, but not in the way you think. At first I thought it would be In the Night Kitchen but now it\u2019s me. So I\u2019ll be there, and my 15-year-old self will be there as a ghost.\u201d</p> <p>Another ghost will be Glass, who won\u2019t be on stage but present in spirit, especially if McDermott manages to pull off another dream \u2013 to get Steinway to produce a piano that can record Glass playing the keys, and then at the touch of a button play compositions back, with the keys moving just as Glass touched them.</p> <p>Meanwhile, McDermott is set to take Akhnaten to the <a href=\"https://www.metopera.org/season/2019-20-season/akhnaten/\">Met in New York in November</a> \u2013 and then, he believes, he will finally be ready to tackle Einstein on the Beach. There\u2019s also the big dream: that Glass\u2019s three \u201cportrait operas\u201d (Satyagraha, Akhnaten, Einstein) can be presented for the first time somewhere as a Ring-style marathon. \u201cThese operas are terrifying because you go, \u2018There\u2019s this scene. What actually happens? Anything?\u2019 And then you do things you could never normally do.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Tao of Glass is at <a href=\"https://mif.co.uk/whats-on/tao-of-glass/\">the Royal Exchange theatre, Manchester</a>, 11-20 July.</p></li> </ul>",

Called Tao of Glass, it explores their creative relationship: the old master and the younger fan. \u201cIt\u2019s about my obsession with Philip\u2019s music,\u201d McDermott says, speaking in a cafe in London, near the offices of his Improbable theatre group. \u201cThe first show I ever made professionally, when I left Middlesex Poly, used music from Glassworks. I listened to that album obsessively when I was a student.\u201d Tao of Glass owes its origins to the children\u2019s author Maurice Sendak. Glass and McDermott had hoped to create an opera based on In the Night Kitchen, Sendak\u2019s book about a boy almost getting baked in a cake. The pair visited him at his house in rural Connecticut to hatch some plans. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do this show before I die!\u201d Sendak told them \u2013 but sadly he did die, shortly afterwards, in 2012. That put an end to their adaptation of In the Night Kitchen, a crushing experience for both McDermott and Glass. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve lost a piece, it can be devastating, like the loss of a child,\u201d says the composer, a father of four. Tao of Glass both is \u2013 and is about \u2013 the work McDermott and Glass decided to make instead. It will consist of 10 scenes set to music by Glass, performed by McDermott and several puppets: some created from paper or objects to evoke a dream world; others expressing the essence of Glass and his music; and a more traditional puppet of a child that represents McDermott as a boy, as his son, and as a character from a dream show that never gets made. Tao of Glass also asks where inspiration comes from. Glass is sure it originates in the subconscious. \u201cWhen I imagine music when I wake up in the morning, that means I\u2019ve been dreaming about it. And then, with very little effort, I can connect that dream with projects I\u2019ve been working on. But the actual connection happens in the part of your mind that doesn\u2019t relate to the everyday world. Music doesn\u2019t come from this world, it comes from the dream world.\u201d Glass\u2019s dreamlife must be as active as ever. This year alone, he has debuted a symphony, Lodger, based on the 1979 Bowie album, and created the music for Glenda Jackson\u2019s second crack at King Lear on Broadway. Does he compose every day? \u201cPretty much, because I don\u2019t have enough days, so I can\u2019t afford \u2026\u201d he trails off. \u201cI was just in Indianapolis, doing concerts, but I was writing during the day. I got back to New York at one o\u2019clock on Sunday and by three, I was working, and I\u2019ve been working every day since. That\u2019s not uncommon. People who paint paint all the time. I knew Allen Ginsberg very well and he was writing constantly. Sometimes we were sharing quarters because we were at a retreat, and, in the middle of the night, he would wake up and write poetry.\u201d Ginsberg, he says, would change his poems mid-performance, which would throw Glass off-balance when he was trying to accompany him. \u201cI would say, \u2018Allen, I can\u2019t follow you when you do that.\u2019 And he\u2019d say, \u2018What did I do?\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018It\u2019s like running after a rabbit and you\u2019re never sure where the rabbit\u2019s going to jump to next.\u2019 We always had fun together. Phelim is very similar in the sense that he can draw on his unconscious very easily. That\u2019s what you see when you\u2019re looking at his work. But then people might say that about me and that\u2019s probably true.\u201d McDermott says he often gets his best ideas lying in a flotation tank \u2013 most notably, the one about getting the English National Opera chorus to juggle throughout much of Akhnaten. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he laughs, \u201cyou get an idea and think, \u2018That\u2019s so stupid it will probably be really good.\u2019\u201d The chorus were duly given lessons by master juggler Sean Gandini. \u201cIn the end, they said, \u2018This is helping us learn where we are in the music.\u2019 So actually they really liked it.\u201d The hypnotic, repetitive and incrementally unfurling nature of Glass\u2019s music \u2013 not to mention a libretto largely sung in the languages of ancient Egypt \u2013 make it as hard to perform as it is gorgeous. As a young Glass fan, McDermott saw ENO\u2019s European premiere of Akhnaten in London in 1985. After picking up his ticket, he says, he spotted the composer in the street and followed him around Covent Garden until Glass disappeared into a sushi restaurant. \u201cI guess there was a fantasy \u2013 if I stopped him, what would I say? A little bit like when I saw Quentin Tarantino at a crime writers\u2019 festival in Nottingham. On some level, Tao of Glass is me finally daring to stop Philip and ask him a question.\u201d McDermott eventually met Glass after Se\u00e1n Doran, then ENO\u2019s artistic director, suggested he direct Einstein on the Beach, whose visionary original production was created by Glass and director Robert Wilson. \u201cI was like, \u2018What? That\u2019s a really stupid idea.\u2019 It\u2019s such an extraordinary piece, it\u2019s like a crazy dream.\u201d Nonetheless, McDermott went for lunch in New York with Glass, who told him: \u201cYour genuine reluctance makes me think you should do it.\u201d Instead, McDermott directed Satyagraha. Opera, says McDermott, suits his seat-of-the-pants approach. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a chorus, an orchestra, some singers with extraordinary talent and personalities, and a set that could kill people if it hits them on the head. You rehearse, you\u2019ve got three days with the orchestra, a dress rehearsal and then you do the show. It\u2019s like doing a big outdoor gig. You have to go, \u2018Well, the crane comes through here, the audience will hopefully walk through here and the fireworks will go off there.\u2019 You have to create an environment in which all these things come into conversation with each other.\u201d There is a spiritual dimension to Tao of Glass, as the title suggests. Glass once described himself as \u201ca Jewish Taoist Hindu Toltec Buddhist\u201d. McDermott, meanwhile, is interested in Taoism: \u201cIt\u2019s basically a belief that nature has a process and a flow that you\u2019re either in alignment with or you\u2019re fighting.\u201d He believes in it \u201cin the sense that making shows, creatively, hasn\u2019t been anything to do with me. Somehow I\u2019ve managed to get out of my own way. In the rehearsals for Tao of Glass we would throw the I Ching every now and again. Generally, the message I get is, \u2018Stop trying to be in control.\u2019 Which of course is the hardest thing in the world.\u201d It\u2019s McDermott\u2019s second time at MIF \u2013 his first was Bambino, an opera for babies. He\u2019s a Mancunian who grew up watching shows at the Royal Exchange, where Tao of Glass will be staged. \u201cI used to sit and watch Max Wall doing Waiting for Godot \u2013 some extraordinary performances. The dream was, \u2018I\u2019ll direct things here.\u2019 But it never really happened. So I gave up on that dream and now it\u2019s come back. The Tao decided that it does happen, but not in the way you think. At first I thought it would be In the Night Kitchen but now it\u2019s me. So I\u2019ll be there, and my 15-year-old self will be there as a ghost.\u201d Another ghost will be Glass, who won\u2019t be on stage but present in spirit, especially if McDermott manages to pull off another dream \u2013 to get Steinway to produce a piano that can record Glass playing the keys, and then at the touch of a button play compositions back, with the keys moving just as Glass touched them. Meanwhile, McDermott is set to take Akhnaten to the Met in New York in November \u2013 and then, he believes, he will finally be ready to tackle Einstein on the Beach. There\u2019s also the big dream: that Glass\u2019s three \u201cportrait operas\u201d (Satyagraha, Akhnaten, Einstein) can be presented for the first time somewhere as a Ring-style marathon. \u201cThese operas are terrifying because you go, \u2018There\u2019s this scene. What actually happens? Anything?\u2019 And then you do things you could never normally do.\u201d Tao of Glass is at the Royal Exchange theatre, Manchester, 11-20 July.",

What cannot be stopped, however, is the relative decline of the US as the Chinese global ascendency continues. Indeed the switch in the Trump slogan from \u201cmake America great again\u201d to \u201ckeep America great\u201d, with its implied assumption of the mission being accomplished, is arguably the greatest of Trump\u2019s delusions. Notwithstanding the reality of this decline of the US, Mudde provides four reasons why Trump cannot be stopped, concluding that the Democrats have neither agency nor urgency. However, the volatility of global economics and politics is the new normal and even today\u2019s persuasive analysis has a high probability of becoming tomorrow\u2019s embarrassing speculation. The Democrats will soon have a candidate for president. The task of transforming \u201cpassive majorities\u201d into \u201cmobilised minorities\u201d sufficient to win the election as described by Mudde can then be undertaken. We just need to hope that the Democrats are reading Mudde\u2019s reflections. Stewart Sweeney Adelaide, South Australia Men are not the only ones who have sexual rights I read the article about the race to replace Viagra (21 June) with some dismay. The reporter seemed uncritically in thrall about developments in this area. The article was sadly lacking in any critical analysis about what the partners of these men feel about Viagra and the downsides (no pun intended) for them. Women were invisible, as were other partners of men who use this drug. As a woman of a particular age, I would welcome a lot more research and funding by Big Pharma into alleviating the debilitating effects of menopausal symptoms, including for some the loss of libido. There are other areas where Big Pharma can make a difference. There seems to be an assumption that men have a right to a particular kind of sexual activity, no matter their age or health condition. If only, the same standard was applied to women. Jennifer Dodd Perth, Western Australia The British should stop preaching on Hong Kong Simon Tisdall may describe Hong Kong as \u201ca former British colony steeped in western liberal traditions\u201d, but those of us with long memories recollect the democratic reforms rushed through just before the handover to burden China with (5 July). Why was it that, after 150 years of British rule, the British-appointed governor had most of the powers, and that this was altered only after the handover was agreed? After 150 years of British rule, the legislature only approached being a representative body three years before the handover. Some steeping ... perhaps the British should cease their preaching.

      "bodyText": "The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has not selected the main amendment designed to scupper attempts by a future government to force a no-deal Brexit by proroguing parliament, frustrating the efforts of backbench MPs led by the Conservative Dominic Grieve. But two other amendments, seeking to extend the rights of abortion and equal marriage to Northern Ireland, have been picked for votes on Tuesday evening and if passed could prove a constitutional headache for the government. The amendments were among more than a dozen tabled to a largely technical bill about Northern Ireland, the body of which is intended to delay elections to the long-suspended devolved assembly and deal with associated budgetary matters. MPs will get a chance to vote on other amendments tabled by Grieve intended to make prorogation more difficult, such as one that would oblige ministers to report every two weeks in October on efforts to restore the Northern Ireland executive. The intention of that would be to require the Commons to be in session to hear the reports, but it is unclear whether a government pushing for no-deal could simply ignore this, even though this could then be challenged in court. Grieve, supported by opposition parties and a handful of pro-EU Conservatives, laid an amendment that would have stopped parliament being prorogued in the autumn to achieve a no-deal Brexit. Prorogation has been mooted by some Brexiters as a way of stopping the Commons blocking no deal. But Grieve\u2019s was not among those picked. Selecting amendments is entirely at the discretion of the Speaker, and it is possible Bercow ruled against Grieve\u2019s amendment as it was not directly connected to the bill. An amendment tabled by Labour\u2019s Conor McGinn stipulates that same-sex marriage, which is permitted in all parts of the UK apart from Northern Ireland, would automatically become legal there within three months if the devolved government remains stalled. It has been signed by almost 30 cross-party MPs. Another amendment, tabled by Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy, argues that the government is obliged to extend the right of abortion to comply with UN human rights obligations. This has been signed by more than 80 MPs, including seven Conservatives, giving it a good chance of passing. The government officially supports extending both equal marriage and abortion to Northern Ireland but argues that it must be a matter for the devolved executive, which has been suspended amid political deadlock since January 2017 with no immediate hope of restoration.

The sport\u2019s senior officials believe that in many cases horses are being trained by someone other than the person named in the racecard but they feel powerless to act after failing to make charges stick in a high-profile case five years ago.</p> \n<p>A long list of people have been suspected by British Horseracing Authority staff of training in somebody else\u2019s name in recent years. One has since been jailed. Others have obtained a licence of their own. Three trainers are implicated in multiple cases, meaning they are suspected of allowing more than one person to train horses that are officially registered to their stable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jul/09/talking-horses-sacre-bleu-british-rulers-ask-for-french-name-change\">Talking Horses: sacr\u00e9 bleu! British rulers ask for French name change</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>An internal BHA memo from 2015 states: \u201cThere are far too many individuals who are renting stables from a licensed trainer and training without a licence, with the licensed trainer accepting payment from the unlicensed person in return for the horses running in the licensed trainer\u2019s name. The licensed trainer registers the unlicensed trainer as an employee of the yard and, at this point, it seems there is very little the BHA can do to stop that individual from acting as a trainer ... If nothing is done to put a stop to this practice, then anyone could quite easily set themselves up as a trainer and work behind someone who can get a licence.\u201d</p> \n<p>For similar reasons concerns exist about pre-training yards, generally seen as a legitimate means of preparing a horse for entry into full training. Pre-training yards are not licensed premises, so BHA staff have no right to enter them or conduct inspections. It is suspected that some horses are, in reality, being trained by unlicensed, unregulated persons at pre-training yards and there is little officials can do about it, so long as the horses are moved into a licensed yard 14 days before taking part in a race. In view of the BHA\u2019s limited powers of oversight, there is every possibility that even this rule is not always complied with.</p> \n<p>Secret trainers are a problem for the BHA, not least because they may include people who would never be allowed a licence because of previous rule-breaking. They are also a problem for gamblers, risking their money on the basis of misleading information. But they are accepted as part of the landscape by many racing insiders, who regard some instances as benign and have no great concern if a retired trainer continues to look after a horse or two in someone else\u2019s yard.</p> \n<p>In late 2014 the BHA charged Graham Bradley with unlicensed training in relation to 12 horses based at Brendan Powell\u2019s stable in Lambourn. The disciplinary panel accepted that Bradley brought the horses to Powell\u2019s yard and hoped to train them himself once he had obtained his own licence. It found that, at Bradley\u2019s instigation, they were given different feed from Powell\u2019s other horses and had their own farrier, and that he charged their owners directly through his bloodstock company, sometimes invoicing them under the heading \u201ctrainers expenses\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0589490e-eaac-4413-92fc-33d5622b5834\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Catterick</b><br><b>2.00</b> Blitzle <b>2.30</b> Whiskey And Water <b>3.00 </b>Mrs Bouquet <b>3.30</b> Ghathanfar <b>4.00</b> Lever Du Soleil <b>4.30 </b>Mercenary Rose <b>5.00</b> Lappet <b>5.30</b> Chickenfortea (nb)</p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield<br>2.10</b> Ragstone Cowboy <b>2.40</b> Cherry Cola <b>3.10</b> Royal Hall <b>3.40</b> Kafeel <b>4.10 </b>Laikaparty <b>4.40 </b>Dream Kart (nap) <b>5.10 </b>Attorney General</p>\n    <p><b>Yarmouth<br>2.20</b> Magical Ride <b>2.50 </b>Bubbly Splash <b>3.20 </b>Soloist <b>3.50</b> Fearlessly <b>4.20</b> Muscika <b>4.50</b> Going Places <b>5.20 </b>Sonnet Rose</p>\n    <p><b>Kempton<br>5.15</b> Soar Above <b>5.45</b> Recuerdame <b>6.15</b> Forbidden Dance <b>6.45</b> Skyman <b>7.15</b> Airbrush <b>7.45</b> Encryption <b>8.15</b> Walter White <b>8.45 </b>Revolutionise</p>\n    <p><b>Bath</b><br><b>6.00 </b>Perfect Grace <b>6.30</b> Edged Out <b>7.00 </b>Conspiritor <b>7.30</b> Desert Lion <b>8.00</b> Rose Hip <b>8.30</b> Toolatetodelegate <b>9.00</b> Oborne Lady</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In light of these and other details, the BHA argued Bradley was in effect running his own training operation but the <a href=\"https://www.britishhorseracing.com/disciplinary_notices/disciplinary-panel-reasons-regarding-graham-bradley-brendan-powell/\" title=\"\">panel was not persuaded</a>, concluding that other evidence showed Powell was in charge. The BHA\u2019s disciplinary team responded to the outcome by dropping another case, pending at the time, that was based on similar evidence. No one has since been charged with unlicensed training.</p> \n<p>Asked to comment, the BHA responded with a plea for tip-offs. It said: \u201cThe BHA has a rigorous licensing process which requires applicants to demonstrate suitability across a number of different criteria. This is in place to ensure that only appropriate individuals are granted licences to train in British racing. The BHA will investigate any allegation of unlicensed trainingbefore the Judicial Panel if necessary.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe would ask any individuals who have concerns and evidence regarding potential unlicensed training practices to contact our integrity team via <a href=\"mailto:intel@britishhorseracing.com\" title=\"\">intel@britishhorseracing.com</a> or <a href=\"https://www.britishhorseracing.com/racestraight/\" title=\"\">Racestraight</a>.\u201d</p>",

The sport\u2019s senior officials believe that in many cases horses are being trained by someone other than the person named in the racecard but they feel powerless to act after failing to make charges stick in a high-profile case five years ago. A long list of people have been suspected by British Horseracing Authority staff of training in somebody else\u2019s name in recent years. One has since been jailed. Others have obtained a licence of their own. Three trainers are implicated in multiple cases, meaning they are suspected of allowing more than one person to train horses that are officially registered to their stable. An internal BHA memo from 2015 states: \u201cThere are far too many individuals who are renting stables from a licensed trainer and training without a licence, with the licensed trainer accepting payment from the unlicensed person in return for the horses running in the licensed trainer\u2019s name. The licensed trainer registers the unlicensed trainer as an employee of the yard and, at this point, it seems there is very little the BHA can do to stop that individual from acting as a trainer ... If nothing is done to put a stop to this practice, then anyone could quite easily set themselves up as a trainer and work behind someone who can get a licence.\u201d For similar reasons concerns exist about pre-training yards, generally seen as a legitimate means of preparing a horse for entry into full training. Pre-training yards are not licensed premises, so BHA staff have no right to enter them or conduct inspections. It is suspected that some horses are, in reality, being trained by unlicensed, unregulated persons at pre-training yards and there is little officials can do about it, so long as the horses are moved into a licensed yard 14 days before taking part in a race. In view of the BHA\u2019s limited powers of oversight, there is every possibility that even this rule is not always complied with. Secret trainers are a problem for the BHA, not least because they may include people who would never be allowed a licence because of previous rule-breaking. They are also a problem for gamblers, risking their money on the basis of misleading information. But they are accepted as part of the landscape by many racing insiders, who regard some instances as benign and have no great concern if a retired trainer continues to look after a horse or two in someone else\u2019s yard. In late 2014 the BHA charged Graham Bradley with unlicensed training in relation to 12 horses based at Brendan Powell\u2019s stable in Lambourn. The disciplinary panel accepted that Bradley brought the horses to Powell\u2019s yard and hoped to train them himself once he had obtained his own licence. It found that, at Bradley\u2019s instigation, they were given different feed from Powell\u2019s other horses and had their own farrier, and that he charged their owners directly through his bloodstock company, sometimes invoicing them under the heading \u201ctrainers expenses\u201d. In light of these and other details, the BHA argued Bradley was in effect running his own training operation but the panel was not persuaded, concluding that other evidence showed Powell was in charge. The BHA\u2019s disciplinary team responded to the outcome by dropping another case, pending at the time, that was based on similar evidence. No one has since been charged with unlicensed training. Asked to comment, the BHA responded with a plea for tip-offs. It said: \u201cThe BHA has a rigorous licensing process which requires applicants to demonstrate suitability across a number of different criteria. This is in place to ensure that only appropriate individuals are granted licences to train in British racing. The BHA will investigate any allegation of unlicensed trainingbefore the Judicial Panel if necessary. \u201cWe would ask any individuals who have concerns and evidence regarding potential unlicensed training practices to contact our integrity team via intel@britishhorseracing.com or Racestraight.\u201d",

Those smells might well include slops. The watery soup the prisoners were fed tormented them at night, sending them in \u201cprocession to a bucket\u201d. When this stinking vessel was filled, it had to be emptied \u2013 about 20 times a night. \u201cInevitably, with the shaking,\u201d writes Levi, \u201csome of the content overflows on our feet, so that however repugnant this duty may be, it is always preferable that we, and not our neighbour, be ordered to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Many further pains feature in this chapter on \u201cour nights\u201d: the groans, the snores, the cries of terrified dreamers \u2013 and the terrifying dreams themselves. It ends in the morning. There comes the command to get up, a \u201churricane\u201d of shouting and blows rained down on the prisoners, and a frantic scramble to make the beds and to get dressed without losing sight of the pitiful objects (such as rudimentary spoons and spare threads for sewing) that the prisoners need for survival. Finally, Levi tells us, he climbs down on to the floor, puts on his shoes, \u201cthe sores on my feet reopen at once, and a new day begins\u201d.</p> <p>Those days were even worse than the nights. Levi catalogues more horrors, humiliations, physical and moral agonies than I feel able to comprehend, even after a full night\u2019s sleep in a comfortable bed. I am one of the people Levi invokes in the poem that prefaces If This Is a Man:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You who live safe<br>In your warm houses \u2026</p> </blockquote> <p>Thanks to Levi\u2019s precise and vivid writing, I have an idea of what it means to be deprived of that privilege. I have been shown how it feels like to live in constant fear for my life. I have been made to understand what it means to be exposed, naked, to the biting cold of Polish winter and the \u201cfierce wind of the Carpathians\u201d. I have also come to understand the need to take a spoon or any other precious object if a fellow prisoner has left it exposed to theft, because it may be vital to survival. I have seen \u201cthe crude glare of the searchlight and the well-known profile of the gallows\u201d and bodies wriggling horribly on the end of the rope. I have \u2013 if only for the time it took me to read about it \u2013 joined the queue for soup, for shoes, for medical attention, to have my hair shaved off, to get the chance to take \u2013 of all things \u2013 a chemistry exam, to receive a ticket that could condemn me to immediate execution or give me a chance to postpone my death for another day.</p> <p>Even in my safe warm house, I have come to some kind of understanding of what it may have been like to walk in Levi\u2019s unmatched, broken wooden shoes. He may address readers as people removed from his experience at the start of the book, but he also brings us the gift of empathy. He does a remarkable job of helping us see what he went through, while asking us to consider if we might have endured against the odds. It would be all too easy to become one of the drowned, picked out \u201cfor the chimney\u201d on the whim of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapo_(concentration_camp)\">kapo</a>, or to succumb to hunger, disease, overwork, to despair. It would have been just as easy to become a kapo, collaborating with the Nazis and betraying your fellow prisoners because it offered a way to survive? Perhaps also, if we had the kind of good fortune that the author ironically ascribes to himself <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1986/03/16/primo-levi-the-limis-of-being-human/4cf087e3-2a90-45d0-b0ce-32d60c7e4399/?utm_term=.16127d996ee1\">in the first sentence of his preface</a>, we might have been in a similar position to Levi himself?</p> <p>But this sense of affinity can only go so far. I may feel brotherhood for Levi as I read, but the poisonous logic that put him in Auschwitz would also have kept me on the other side of the fence. And while he gives us a powerful sense of the universality of suffering, Levi always reminds us of the strange particularity of his situation. The story of If This Is a Man is a long chain of coincidences and strange events that sealed his fate. Also, many near random moments of \u2013 for want of a better phrase \u2013 \u201cgood fortune\u201d that kept him alive to bear witness.</p> <p>Lucky for us, too, that he was able to set so much down so eloquently. According to the Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal, the idea that one death is a tragedy and a million is a statistic appeared in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/aug/12/2\">the unpublished autobiography of Adolf Eichmann</a>, one of key leaders of the Holocaust. Little needs to be said about the monstrous stupidity of that notion \u2013 but it does serve as an indication of the importance If This Is a Man. Levi makes every one of those six million murders an individual tragedy, and so helps us to understand what each must have meant in terms of human suffering.</p>",

I have been shown how it feels like to live in constant fear for my life. I have been made to understand what it means to be exposed, naked, to the biting cold of Polish winter and the \u201cfierce wind of the Carpathians\u201d. I have also come to understand the need to take a spoon or any other precious object if a fellow prisoner has left it exposed to theft, because it may be vital to survival. I have seen \u201cthe crude glare of the searchlight and the well-known profile of the gallows\u201d and bodies wriggling horribly on the end of the rope. I have \u2013 if only for the time it took me to read about it \u2013 joined the queue for soup, for shoes, for medical attention, to have my hair shaved off, to get the chance to take \u2013 of all things \u2013 a chemistry exam, to receive a ticket that could condemn me to immediate execution or give me a chance to postpone my death for another day. Even in my safe warm house, I have come to some kind of understanding of what it may have been like to walk in Levi\u2019s unmatched, broken wooden shoes. He may address readers as people removed from his experience at the start of the book, but he also brings us the gift of empathy. He does a remarkable job of helping us see what he went through, while asking us to consider if we might have endured against the odds. It would be all too easy to become one of the drowned, picked out \u201cfor the chimney\u201d on the whim of a kapo, or to succumb to hunger, disease, overwork, to despair. It would have been just as easy to become a kapo, collaborating with the Nazis and betraying your fellow prisoners because it offered a way to survive? Perhaps also, if we had the kind of good fortune that the author ironically ascribes to himself in the first sentence of his preface, we might have been in a similar position to Levi himself? But this sense of affinity can only go so far. I may feel brotherhood for Levi as I read, but the poisonous logic that put him in Auschwitz would also have kept me on the other side of the fence. And while he gives us a powerful sense of the universality of suffering, Levi always reminds us of the strange particularity of his situation. The story of If This Is a Man is a long chain of coincidences and strange events that sealed his fate. Also, many near random moments of \u2013 for want of a better phrase \u2013 \u201cgood fortune\u201d that kept him alive to bear witness. Lucky for us, too, that he was able to set so much down so eloquently. According to the Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal, the idea that one death is a tragedy and a million is a statistic appeared in the unpublished autobiography of Adolf Eichmann, one of key leaders of the Holocaust. Little needs to be said about the monstrous stupidity of that notion \u2013 but it does serve as an indication of the importance If This Is a Man. Levi makes every one of those six million murders an individual tragedy, and so helps us to understand what each must have meant in terms of human suffering.",

      "body": "<p>Molly Scott Cato can hardly contain herself. Having spent more than 30 years as an activist in the ecology and the sustainability movement, the Green MEP for the south-west region feels the UK is finally starting to appreciate the scale of the climate emergency. \u201cPeople are suddenly waking up to it, which is very exciting for someone like me who\u2019s been banging on about this for years,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Take aviation. \u201cWe\u2019re really getting a grip on that now. That was something where I was really out of line with other people. But in the last year, people have stopped thinking that I\u2019m a loony not flying anywhere. They start by being admiring and then they start thinking \u2018Oh God, I\u2019m going to have to start doing that\u2019. We\u2019ve reached that point, it\u2019s really encouraging.\u201d</p> <p>However, Scott Cato, who is also the Green party\u2019s spokeswoman for EU relations, the economy and finance, and stopped flying in 2003, is exasperated at the government\u2019s stance on airport expansion. Barely a week after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/theresa-may-commits-to-net-zero-uk-carbon-emissions-by-2050\" title=\"\">prime minister declared a climate emergency</a>, the government published detailed plans for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/18/heathrow-third-runway-expansion-plans-revealed\" title=\"\">third runway at Heathrow</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s really damaging if people just say this stuff and then carry on as usual. They must be committed to doing something, it mustn\u2019t just be hypocritical empty words.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tackling climate change means we have to address the desperately unequal way both wealth and power are distributed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe positive side is that every time they come forward with a proposal, whether it\u2019s Heathrow, or another road-building scheme, we can say, \u2018Well, you said zero carbon by 2050, you said there was a climate emergency\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>She strongly believes that reducing emissions is a crucial way to reduce inequality. \u201cThe crucial thing about the transition to a carbon-neutral economy is social justice. If you think about why people voted for Brexit, it\u2019s because they felt they were being left behind. Their resentment is being attached to climate denialism, by very irresponsible politicians who whip up resentment caused by austerity. They connect that and say \u2018Now you\u2019re telling me I can\u2019t have my car\u2019. But that\u2019s not what we\u2019re saying at all.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to have a more equal society. It\u2019s the wealthy who are causing climate change; 70% of flights are taken by the richest 15% of people. Tackling climate change means we have to address the desperately unequal way both wealth and power are distributed.\u201d</p> <p>Scott Cato wants the UK, along with other industrialised countries, to take greater responsibility internationally. That means \u201cconstraining the ability of the wealthiest to escape the consequences of what they\u2019ve done to the planet with their greed. If you\u2019re talking about climate apartheid, you\u2019re talking about people in Bangladesh or the horn of Africa whose lives are being made impossible because of our historic emissions.\u201d</p> <p>So what would she do? \u201cBecause we had the industrial revolution which caused the historic emissions that are now making their lives impossible, the least we can do is hand them the clean technologies we\u2019ve now got for free to recompense.\u201d</p> <p>Scott Cato, 56, dates her ecological roots to her time at university in the mid-1980s. \u201cI didn\u2019t know in 1985 that there was such a political thing as a \u2018green\u2019,\u201d she says. But a Chilean friend saw that her politics was about natureand her connection to the Earth. \u201cEverywhere in the world there are greens, and what makes them green is the fact that your politics comes from this deep connection to planet Earth. It\u2019s an extraordinary feeling to know you\u2019re part of a global movement, that you\u2019re connected to the planet we all share.\u201d</p> <p>Later, in the 90s, she did an economics PhD (\u201cwhile struggling to feed three children until working families tax credits came along\u201d, she recalls), and then, in 2012, became the world\u2019s first professor of green economics at the University of Roehampton. This entailed thinking of the economy in terms both of society\u2019s place in the ecosystem, but also social justice, sustainable trade policy and welfare, she explains.</p> <p>In addition to the economic arguments, Scott Cato says there are significant social justice advantages of a universal basic income. \u201cI think it\u2019s right that citizens have a stake in their society and should have security without having to sell their labour. Why should the wealthy have the freedom to develop their potential and the poor just get stuck on to a treadmill? It\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p> <p>A member of the Green party since 1988, Scott Cato\u2019s political rise began in 2011, when she was elected a Green party councillor for Stroud district council. The following year she became group leader, and an electoral agreement led to a shared administration run by Labour, Greens and Liberal Democrats since 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s run cooperatively, but not in a formal coalition\u201d.</p> <p>Then, in 2014, Scott Cato surprised many by being elected a Green MEP. To win in the south-west required around 12% and the Greens were on around 6% nationally then, she recalls. But while the Lib Dems were traditionally strong in the south-west, the election came at the height of their unpopularity. \u201cIt was defecting Lib Dem voters that won me the seat, plus endless travelling everywhere and being seen to be everywhere,\u201d she admits.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/04/enough-climate-nightmare-paint-dream-inequality\">Enough of the climate nightmare.

Examples include:</p>\n    <p><b>First Corporate Shipping Ltd</b>: Donating to both Johnson and Hunt, the firm is co-owned by Terence Mordaunt, a strong Brexiter who is a board member of a climate change denial group the Global Warming Policy Forum.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Robin Birley</b>: A businessman and property developer, the long-time Brexit supporter previously donated to Ukip under Nigel Farage, and recently attended an event run by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/04/tory-mps-back-rightwing-youth-group-turning-point-uk\">controversial youth group Turning Point UK</a>, which was addressed by Farage.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt will debate head-to-head for the first time in the battle to be prime minister, as protesters gather outside to demonstrate against the choice being made by 0.25% of the population who are members of the Conservative party. Johnson, the frontrunner in the Tory leadership race, will face Hunt in front of an audience of 200 ITV viewers in Manchester, answering questions via the moderator, Julie Etchingham, and challenging each other during the 90-minute programme. The audience will be made up of members of the public, even though the decision on who will be the next prime minister will be made by 160,000 members of the Tory party who are overwhelmingly older, male and white. Hunt\u2019s campaign has accused Johnson of dodging televised debates until most Tory members have submitted their postal ballots, and the foreign secretary\u2019s team regard it as their last major chance to change the minds of those who have not yet decided. The contenders have already appeared at hustings events where they were interviewed separately in front of Conservative members and took part in a TV debate when five candidates were still in the race. However, this will be the first time they have faced each other one-on-one, 10 days after ballot papers were sent to Tory members. Outside the event, campaigners for a people\u2019s vote on Brexit plan to protest against the small number of voters making the choice on behalf of the country. Pointing to the 0.25% of the country who are Conservative members, they will wear T-shirts saying the 99.75% should have a say on who governs Britain. They plan to hold a huge mocked-up ballot paper asking: \u201cWho do you want to decide Britain\u2019s Brexit future? Just 160,000 Conservative party members? Or everyone \u2013 with a people\u2019s vote.\u201d Johnson has spent Tuesday so far at events with members and visiting the north of England. He has been urged by William Hague, the former Tory leader, to use the debate to rule out suspending parliament in order to push through a no-deal Brexit. At a hustings organised by the Daily Telegraph on Monday, Johnson issued a fresh warning to Tory MPs seeking to block no deal. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get Brexit over the line then we face a haemorrhage of support,\u201d he said, according to the Telegraph. \u201cThe risk they run is we will hand, by sheer incompetence, this government to a hardline Marxist. \u201cI make that point to Dominic Grieve and others who didn\u2019t want to leave the EU.

      "body": "<p>The attitude of young people towards tackling the environmental crisis is \u201ca source of great hope\u201d, David Attenborough has told MPs, as he predicted that polluting the planet would soon provoke as much abhorrence as slavery.</p> \n<p>Giving evidence to the <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/business-energy-industrial-strategy/\">business, energy and industrial strategy committee</a> on how to tackle the climate emergency, the naturalist and TV presenter said radical action was required.</p> \n<p>Asked by the Tory MP Patrick McLoughlin, a committee member, whether the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/theresa-may-commits-to-net-zero-uk-carbon-emissions-by-2050\">government\u2019s new commitment</a> of net zero carbon emissions for the UK by 2050 was rapid enough, Attenborough said such targets were not necessarily the best approach.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn a way I would think that is not the way of focusing on the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot be radical enough in dealing with the issues that face us at the moment. The question is: what is practically possible? How can we take the electorate with us in dealing with these things?\u201d</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThe most encouraging thing that I see, of course, is that the electors of tomorrow are already making themselves and their voices very, very clear. And that is a source of great comfort in a way, but also the justification, the reality, that these young people are recognising that their world is the future.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m OK, and all of us here are OK, because we don\u2019t face the problems that are coming. But the problems in the next 30 years are really major problems that are going to cause social unrest, and great changes in the way that we live, and what we eat. It\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked by the Labour MP Vernon Coaker to expand on how public attitudes were shifting, Attenborough replied: \u201cThere was a time in the 19th century when it was perfectly acceptable for civilised human beings to think that it was morally acceptable to actually own another human being for a slave. And somehow or other, in the space of 20 or 30 years, the public perception of that totally transformed.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cI suspect that we are right now in the beginning of a big change. Young people in particular are the stimulus that\u2019s bringing it about.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are understanding that to chuck plastic into the ocean is an insult. To have the nerve to say: \u2018This is our rubbish. We\u2019ll give you money and you can spread it on your land instead of ours, in the far east,\u2019 is intolerable. And for some reason or other young people understand that. And that\u2019s a source of great hope to me.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked for his most vivid impressions of the impact of humans on the planet, Attenborough recalled returning to the Great Barrier Reef off Australia, where he had first dived in the 1950s.</p> \n<p>\u201cI will never forget diving on the reef about 10 years ago and suddenly seeing that instead of this multitude of wonderful forms and life, that it was stark white, it had bleached white because of the rising temperatures and the increasing acidity of the sea,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you wipe that out you wipe out whole areas of the ocean.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another example was returning to a glacier in South Georgia after 10 years and finding it was not even visible.</p> \n<p>Attenborough stressed that the important point was the overall picture: \u201cSceptics will say: \u2018I can take you to another place where glaciers grew,\u2019 or something, or \u2018I can take you to a place where the coral reefs are flourishing.\u2019 So it\u2019s difficult to pick one point and one site where you can actually say it\u2019s proof. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just an example.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked about the impact of his Blue Planet II series on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/25/plastics-revolution-marine-life\">awareness about plastic in oceans</a>, Attenborough said he had spent 20 years trying to raise awareness of the issue.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019d been putting it in programmes for years, but nobody took much notice of it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in Blue Planet II it was a sequence that lasted two minutes maximum, I should say, and yet for some reason \u2013 if I knew what the reason was I\u2019d be a richer man, I dare say \u2013 it rang a bell in the public consciousness. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Attenborough said he nonetheless never set out to be a campaigner: \u201cI\u2019m not by nature a propagandist. I started making natural history programmes because I thought there was nothing I would prefer to see more than the beauty of the natural world. And I would love to just go on doing that. That\u2019s what I enjoy.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The attitude of young people towards tackling the environmental crisis is \u201ca source of great hope\u201d, David Attenborough has told MPs, as he predicted that polluting the planet would soon provoke as much abhorrence as slavery. Giving evidence to the business, energy and industrial strategy committee on how to tackle the climate emergency, the naturalist and TV presenter said radical action was required. Asked by the Tory MP Patrick McLoughlin, a committee member, whether the government\u2019s new commitment of net zero carbon emissions for the UK by 2050 was rapid enough, Attenborough said such targets were not necessarily the best approach. \u201cIn a way I would think that is not the way of focusing on the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot be radical enough in dealing with the issues that face us at the moment. The question is: what is practically possible? How can we take the electorate with us in dealing with these things?\u201d He said: \u201cThe most encouraging thing that I see, of course, is that the electors of tomorrow are already making themselves and their voices very, very clear. And that is a source of great comfort in a way, but also the justification, the reality, that these young people are recognising that their world is the future. \u201cI\u2019m OK, and all of us here are OK, because we don\u2019t face the problems that are coming. But the problems in the next 30 years are really major problems that are going to cause social unrest, and great changes in the way that we live, and what we eat. It\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Asked by the Labour MP Vernon Coaker to expand on how public attitudes were shifting, Attenborough replied: \u201cThere was a time in the 19th century when it was perfectly acceptable for civilised human beings to think that it was morally acceptable to actually own another human being for a slave. And somehow or other, in the space of 20 or 30 years, the public perception of that totally transformed.\u201d He said: \u201cI suspect that we are right now in the beginning of a big change. Young people in particular are the stimulus that\u2019s bringing it about. \u201cPeople are understanding that to chuck plastic into the ocean is an insult. To have the nerve to say: \u2018This is our rubbish. We\u2019ll give you money and you can spread it on your land instead of ours, in the far east,\u2019 is intolerable. And for some reason or other young people understand that. And that\u2019s a source of great hope to me.\u201d Asked for his most vivid impressions of the impact of humans on the planet, Attenborough recalled returning to the Great Barrier Reef off Australia, where he had first dived in the 1950s. \u201cI will never forget diving on the reef about 10 years ago and suddenly seeing that instead of this multitude of wonderful forms and life, that it was stark white, it had bleached white because of the rising temperatures and the increasing acidity of the sea,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you wipe that out you wipe out whole areas of the ocean.\u201d Another example was returning to a glacier in South Georgia after 10 years and finding it was not even visible. Attenborough stressed that the important point was the overall picture: \u201cSceptics will say: \u2018I can take you to another place where glaciers grew,\u2019 or something, or \u2018I can take you to a place where the coral reefs are flourishing.\u2019 So it\u2019s difficult to pick one point and one site where you can actually say it\u2019s proof. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just an example.\u201d Asked about the impact of his Blue Planet II series on awareness about plastic in oceans, Attenborough said he had spent 20 years trying to raise awareness of the issue. \u201cI\u2019d been putting it in programmes for years, but nobody took much notice of it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in Blue Planet II it was a sequence that lasted two minutes maximum, I should say, and yet for some reason \u2013 if I knew what the reason was I\u2019d be a richer man, I dare say \u2013 it rang a bell in the public consciousness. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d Attenborough said he nonetheless never set out to be a campaigner: \u201cI\u2019m not by nature a propagandist. I started making natural history programmes because I thought there was nothing I would prefer to see more than the beauty of the natural world. And I would love to just go on doing that. That\u2019s what I enjoy.\u201d",

In Greece (as is happening across Europe, including Britain) the traditional party of the right has adopted, and made mainstream, the discourse of the far right.</p> <p>During the election campaign, New Democracy advanced two different lines of argument in an intertwined offensive. The first was the neoliberal modernising argument about growth and investment, through tax relief to businesses, further privatisations (including in healthcare) and all those things that after the 2008 crisis brought hundreds of thousands of Greeks and other Europeans to their knees. The second strand echoes the Trump/Johnson discourse, attacking every minority and mocking anyone in need. Greece has never been the natural home of a \u201cliberal\u201d or moderate right, but given what the country went through after 2010, it is shocking to witness the brutality of these reinforced attacks on social values.</p> <p>One reason for celebration, of course, is the exclusion of fascist Golden Dawn from the Greek parliament (it failed to pass the 3% threshold), a huge victory for anti-fascist activists.

This is why a strong opposition will be crucial for democracy in Greece.</p> <p>\u2022 Marina Prentoulis is a member of Syriza and a senior lecturer in politics at the University of East Anglia </p>",

Meanwhile, much of the media is trying to present prime minister Mitsotakis (son of a previous prime minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis, and a member of a family that has dominated Greek politics for generations) as a moderate-moderniser. This picture fully misses the crucial point that New Democracy has in fact shifted to the right. In Greece (as is happening across Europe, including Britain) the traditional party of the right has adopted, and made mainstream, the discourse of the far right. During the election campaign, New Democracy advanced two different lines of argument in an intertwined offensive. The first was the neoliberal modernising argument about growth and investment, through tax relief to businesses, further privatisations (including in healthcare) and all those things that after the 2008 crisis brought hundreds of thousands of Greeks and other Europeans to their knees. The second strand echoes the Trump/Johnson discourse, attacking every minority and mocking anyone in need. Greece has never been the natural home of a \u201cliberal\u201d or moderate right, but given what the country went through after 2010, it is shocking to witness the brutality of these reinforced attacks on social values. One reason for celebration, of course, is the exclusion of fascist Golden Dawn from the Greek parliament (it failed to pass the 3% threshold), a huge victory for anti-fascist activists. But this feel-good mood is immediately spoiled if one realises that at least part of the far-right vote transferred to New Democracy. This is why a strong opposition will be crucial for democracy in Greece. \u2022 Marina Prentoulis is a member of Syriza and a senior lecturer in politics at the University of East Anglia",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has sought to draw a line under Labour\u2019s Brexit travails by announcing a \u201csettled\u201d policy of backing remain in any referendum called on a Conservative deal. The Labour leader has been under intense pressure to shift to an overtly anti-Brexit stance, but has insisted on consulting the party\u2019s stakeholders in recent weeks, including the trade unions. In a statement emailed to party members on Tuesday, Corbyn made no reference to what stance Labour would take in the event of a general election in the near future, or whether Labour could enter such a contest saying it would still go ahead with leaving the European Union. But he made clear that if a referendum was called on the Brexit deal negotiated by the incoming Conservative prime minister \u2013 or on whether to go ahead with a no-deal Brexit \u2013 Labour would support remain. Corbyn wrote: \u201cWhoever becomes the new prime minister should have the confidence to put their deal, or no deal, back to the people in a public vote. In those circumstances, I want to make it clear that Labour would campaign for remain against either no deal or a Tory deal that does not protect the economy and jobs.\u201d The trade unions published a statement on Monday that suggested Labour should seek to negotiate its own, better Brexit deal and then put that to the people, but declined to specify how the party would campaign in the event of that happening. Corbyn acknowledged the issue of Brexit had \u201cbeen divisive in our communities and sometimes in our party too\u201d. He defended Labour\u2019s position over the past three years, saying it had been right to respect the result of the 2016 referendum. \u201cLabour set out a compromise plan to try to bring the country together based around a customs union, a strong single market relationship and protection of environmental regulations and rights at work. We continue to believe this is a sensible alternative that could bring the country together,\u201d Corbyn said. With Labour under intense pressure from more overtly pro-remain parties, including the Liberal Democrats, the party had already shifted since the European elections towards urging the Conservatives to put their deal to a public vote. But Corbyn had previously stopped short of saying Labour would campaign for remain in the event of a referendum being called.

Labour also hopes that it can now set aside the Brexit row, and gain more of a hearing for other domestic policies. Differences in the shadow cabinet over Brexit policy have repeatedly been played out in public in recent months, with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, joining calls for his party to adopt a remain stance. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, was dropped from deputising for Corbyn at prime minister\u2019s questions after criticising the party\u2019s position during TV coverage of the European election results. \u201cWe were not clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear,\u201d she said. Corbyn\u2019s deputy, Tom Watson, has publicly urged party members to make their disquiet about Labour\u2019s position known by signing up to a remain \u201cdeclaration\u201d. But their fellow shadow cabinet members Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery have repeatedly expressed concerns about the idea of supporting remain in a referendum, fearing it will undermine Labour\u2019s support in leave-voting constituencies at the next general election.",

But the beauty-conscious are increasingly turning to face-shaped bits of fabric soaked in \u201cserum\u201d \u2013 or, as they are commonly known, sheet masks.

      "body": "<p>When Martin Lewis from Money Saving Expert was touring the UK for his TV roadshow, he met a stressed student who couldn\u2019t find work and didn\u2019t have enough money to eat. He told Lewis his student loan wasn\u2019t big enough to cover living costs, but his parents wouldn\u2019t help because they believed he should stand on his own two feet. A frustrated Lewis, who has campaigned extensively for the government to openly tell parents it expects them to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/08/parents-in-dark-need-top-up-student-loans-maintenance\">stump up thousands of pounds</a> to top up student loans, explained that this is not how the system works.</p> <p>\u201cWhile they weren\u2019t trying to be mean or cruel, they didn\u2019t understand that the student gets less [of a maintenance loan] because they get more income,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cIt\u2019s common sense once you understand the system, but most people don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s essential you understand that parental money has been quietly written into student finance. So, for students and parents in England, here are your questions answered.</p> <h2><strong>What exactly is the so-called parental contribution?</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/nov/08/ive-run-out-of-money-at-university-what-can-i-do\">I've run out of money at university \u2013 what can I do?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the UK the student maintenance loan helps cover living expenses such as accommodation, food and bills. The amount <a href=\"https://blog.moneysavingexpert.com/2016/09/how-much-are-parents-supposed-to-give-their-children-when-they-go-to-university/\">students are entitled to varies</a>, from <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/new-fulltime-students\">up to \u00a37,324</a> for those living at home, to up to \u00a311,354 for those living away from home and in London.</p> <p>The amount you get also depends on how much your parents earn. This means students from higher-income households will get a lower amount. The government unofficially expects higher-earning parents in England to top up the rest \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t tell them.</p> <h2><strong>How much is it?</strong></h2> <p>If your household income is \u00a325,000 or under, you are entitled to the full loan amount. Once the household income is \u00a330,000 or more <a href=\"https://blog.moneysavingexpert.com/2016/09/how-much-are-parents-supposed-to-give-their-children-when-they-go-to-university/\">you will not get the full amount</a>. For example, if you have a household income of \u00a330,000 and live at home, the maintenance loan is \u00a36,707 with an extra \u00a3617 needed. But if it\u2019s \u00a358,210 or more and you live at home, the loan is just \u00a33,224, making the implied parental contribution \u00a34,100.</p> <h2><strong>Why didn\u2019t I know about it?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s been hidden from you, Lewis says. This is arguably for political reasons; middle and higher-income parents \u2013 who are also voters \u2013 might not like being told to foot the bill.</p> <p>When you get your student loan letter it explains how much money you\u2019ll get, but it doesn\u2019t tell you the full amount you could have been given. Nor will it explicitly say parents are expected to pay the difference. \u201cI would describe it as an \u2018unofficial official\u2019 parental contribution,\u201d Lewis says.</p> <p>Politicians may say they don\u2019t expect parents to pay because there are other ways to plug the gap, such as grants or through work. \u201cBut that is of course completely crackers,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cThe assessment is based only on family residual income and therefore it is directly linked. [To say that] you get less money if you have [higher-earning] parents, but we also don\u2019t expect them to pay, is a ludicrous suggestion.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>How can I tell my parents I need money?</strong></h2> <p>It might not be an easy conversation to have, but it\u2019s an important one. \u201cQuite often students feel guilty about asking for money,\u201d says Sharon Sweeney, a student funding officer at the University of Dundee. </p> <p>Chloe Aspland, a money adviser at Swansea University, suggests you start by working out how much you need to live on. Many universities have this information on their websites, she says. \u201cWe have a cost of living page I refer students to.\u201d Once you know how much you need, you can take the information, along with your loan amount, to your parents.</p> <p>Have the conversation before you go to university if possible, Sweeney recommends. \u201cThat way, parents will understand what you\u2019re facing,\u201d she says. \u201cWhereas if you leave it to the time when you really need the extra help, they might think you\u2019ve overspent.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/16/student-saving-tips-how-to-stretch-your-loan-until-the-end-of-term\">Student saving tips: how to stretch your loan until the end of term</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>What if my parents can\u2019t \u2013 or won\u2019t \u2013 pay the rest?</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s no way to force your parents to give you the money if they can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to. If this is the case there are other options, such as getting a part-time job or financial help from the university. The most important thing is to seek help, says Gareth Pearse, a student support coordinator at Bath Spa University. \u201cAll universities will have some form of advice centre,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe would sit down and go through the situation. We\u2019d check you\u2019re receiving your full entitlement and help you to access available employment options.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Is this a good system?</strong></h2> <p>Not according to Lewis and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/08/parents-in-dark-need-top-up-student-loans-maintenance\">other experts</a>. \u201cIf you say, \u2018Isn\u2019t this all a bit silly?\u2019, I\u2019d say yes, it\u2019s crackers that people old enough to vote, old enough to marry, and old enough to serve for our army are not financially independent [when it comes to getting a student maintenance loan],\u201d Lewis says.</p> <p>In his review of higher education, Philip Augar recommended student loan letters explicitly say when students are not getting the full amount. But an implied parental contribution is unlikely to be scrapped altogether, Lewis says, so the best you can do is know about it \u2013 and make sure your parents do too.</p> <ul> <li><p>You can find more information on <a href=\"https://blog.moneysavingexpert.com/2016/09/how-much-are-parents-supposed-to-give-their-children-when-they-go-to-university/\">how much loan you are entitled to here</a>.</p></li> </ul>",

So, for students and parents in England, here are your questions answered. What exactly is the so-called parental contribution? In the UK the student maintenance loan helps cover living expenses such as accommodation, food and bills. The amount students are entitled to varies, from up to \u00a37,324 for those living at home, to up to \u00a311,354 for those living away from home and in London.

The government unofficially expects higher-earning parents in England to top up the rest \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t tell them. How much is it? If your household income is \u00a325,000 or under, you are entitled to the full loan amount. Once the household income is \u00a330,000 or more you will not get the full amount. For example, if you have a household income of \u00a330,000 and live at home, the maintenance loan is \u00a36,707 with an extra \u00a3617 needed.

Politicians may say they don\u2019t expect parents to pay because there are other ways to plug the gap, such as grants or through work. \u201cBut that is of course completely crackers,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cThe assessment is based only on family residual income and therefore it is directly linked. [To say that] you get less money if you have [higher-earning] parents, but we also don\u2019t expect them to pay, is a ludicrous suggestion.\u201d How can I tell my parents I need money? It might not be an easy conversation to have, but it\u2019s an important one. \u201cQuite often students feel guilty about asking for money,\u201d says Sharon Sweeney, a student funding officer at the University of Dundee. Chloe Aspland, a money adviser at Swansea University, suggests you start by working out how much you need to live on. Many universities have this information on their websites, she says. \u201cWe have a cost of living page I refer students to.\u201d Once you know how much you need, you can take the information, along with your loan amount, to your parents. Have the conversation before you go to university if possible, Sweeney recommends. \u201cThat way, parents will understand what you\u2019re facing,\u201d she says. \u201cWhereas if you leave it to the time when you really need the extra help, they might think you\u2019ve overspent.\u201d What if my parents can\u2019t \u2013 or won\u2019t \u2013 pay the rest? There\u2019s no way to force your parents to give you the money if they can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to. If this is the case there are other options, such as getting a part-time job or financial help from the university. The most important thing is to seek help, says Gareth Pearse, a student support coordinator at Bath Spa University. \u201cAll universities will have some form of advice centre,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe would sit down and go through the situation. We\u2019d check you\u2019re receiving your full entitlement and help you to access available employment options.\u201d Is this a good system? Not according to Lewis and other experts. \u201cIf you say, \u2018Isn\u2019t this all a bit silly?\u2019, I\u2019d say yes, it\u2019s crackers that people old enough to vote, old enough to marry, and old enough to serve for our army are not financially independent [when it comes to getting a student maintenance loan],\u201d Lewis says. In his review of higher education, Philip Augar recommended student loan letters explicitly say when students are not getting the full amount. But an implied parental contribution is unlikely to be scrapped altogether, Lewis says, so the best you can do is know about it \u2013 and make sure your parents do too. You can find more information on how much loan you are entitled to here.",

Epstein sexual abuse case could suck in powerful friends Senior Democrats have called for the US labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, to resign over his decision in 2008 to cut a \u201csweetheart\u201d plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein, which spared the billionaire a jail sentence at a time when Acosta was Miami\u2019s top federal prosecutor. Epstein has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges, over allegations that he \u201csexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls\u201d at his homes in New York and Florida between 2002 and 2005. Longstanding allegations. The first claims of sexual abuse against Epstein date to 2005 and, as Edward Helmore reports, the case could draw in powerful men who mingled with the financier before and since, including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Donald Trump. Trump \u2018will no longer deal with\u2019 British ambassador Trump launched a withering attack on the outgoing British prime minister, Theresa May, on Monday, declaring on Twitter that the White House would \u201cno longer deal with\u201d the UK\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Kim Darroch, after the diplomat\u2019s private assessment of the president as \u201cinept\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional\u201d was leaked to the Mail on Sunday newspaper. Trump accused May of making a \u201cmess\u201d of Brexit, after failing to follow his advice on the issue. \u2018Full faith\u2019. May has expressed her \u201cfull faith\u201d in Darroch, despite insisting she did not agree with his \u201chonest and unvarnished\u201d assessment of the White House. Darroch\u2019s future. But the ambassador\u2019s fate will likely be decided by the next prime minister, either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt, who may consider him an impediment to continued good relations with the US. Ted Cruz raged at Fox\u2019s pro-Trump bias in 2016, book claims Ted Cruz became convinced Fox News and its late chief, Roger Ailes, had deliberately worked against him to secure the Republican presidential nomination for Donald Trump in 2016, according to a new book. The Guardian obtained a copy of American Carnage, a study of the \u201cRepublican civil war\u201d by Tim Alberta, which quotes the Texas senator telling friends, after Ailes\u2019 death in 2017: \u201cI think it was Roger\u2019s dying wish to elect Donald Trump president.\u201d Wisconsin win. The book also details an incident on the evening Cruz won the Wisconsin primary in 2016, when the senator allegedly flew into an expletive-filled rage over Fox host Sean Hannity\u2019s favourable coverage of his rival, Trump. Hong Kong leader says bill that sparked protests is \u2018dead\u2019 Carrie Lam, the Hong Kong chief executive, has said the proposed extradition bill that has caused a political crisis and mass protests on the streets of the semi-autonomous territory, is \u201cdead\u201d. The law, which would have allowed China to pursue its political opponents in the former British colony, had been a \u201ctotal failure\u201d, Lam said. But the bill\u2019s critics said Lam\u2019s failure to formally withdraw the bill from parliament meant the protests would continue regardless. Trade war. BASF, the world\u2019s largest chemicals company, has issued an ominous profits warning that it blamed in large part on the US-China trade war, which has also affected the wealth of the world\u2019s super-rich, according to a report. Taiwan arms. The US has further stoked Chinese anger by approving the potential sale of $2.2bn in arms to Taiwan, which Beijing views as part of its own territory. Crib sheet US immigration authorities have accessed drivers\u2019 licenses databases across the country and searched millions of people\u2019s photos without their knowledge, including in states that have allowed undocumented immigrants to obtain drivers\u2019 IDs. A New York couple is suing a Los Angeles fertility clinic after an apparent IVF mix-up left them pregnant with twins who turned out to be genetically unrelated to them, and to each other. A Guardian investigation has revealed numerous cases of former Tesla workers who claim they were unfairly fired for using sick leave, and current workers who say they have been threatened with termination or disciplinary action. California congressman Eric Swalwell has withdrawn from the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, to focus instead on his re-election to the House of Representatives. Must-reads Behind the suicide text scandal that shocked America Massachusetts teenager Michelle Carter was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2017, for coercing her boyfriend Conrad Roy to kill himself via text.

American Pie at 20 American Pie, the 1999 comedy about a group of boys determined to lose their virginity before high school graduation, could never be made today, says Scott Tobias.

It has therefore committed to respect, protect, and fulfil its human rights treaty obligations,\u201d she said. \u201cThe anti-drug campaign has a strong public health dimension, which has prioritised community health services supported by investment of $120m (\u00a395m), to be used for prevention, education, early detection, intervention, voluntary treatment and rehabilitation. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the development and human rights-oriented dimensions of the campaign have been overlooked by media coverage which has been overly focused on the law enforcement aspects and a number of sensational cases,\u201d said Salle.",

UAE officials said the move, under discussion for as long as a year, was designed to support a United Nations-led peace process that began in Stockholm last December. It was the first official UAE confirmation of a withdrawal, which has been reported in recent weeks by witnesses and foreign officials. The officials said the UAE would remain in the Saudi-led coalition that intervened in 2015 to try to restore the Yemeni government ousted from power by the Houthis, a rebel group backed by Iran. Oversight would be passed to Emirati-trained local Yemeni forces and foreign mercenaries, and UAE forces remaining in Yemen would focus on counter-terrorism efforts against al-Qaida and Islamic State rather than the battle against the Houthis. The UAE would also continue to support a secessionist movement in southern Yemen. Analysts have warned it is not yet clear whether local troops and Saudi coalition partners are up to the task of filling the vacuum, sparking fears that the current stalemate in much of the country could be upended. The UAE drawdown also weakens Saudi Arabia\u2019s military capabilities in Yemen, adding to pressure for Riyadh to proactively pursue a political rather than military solution to the war. The withdrawal had been extensively discussed with Riyadh as well as the UN-recognised Yemen government based in Aden, the officials added. The UAE may be braced for accusations that the withdrawal is an admission of defeat, but the officials insisted the redeployment was a considered move reflecting the diplomatic progress being made by the UN in the strategically important Hodeidah. Hodeidah became a major focus of the war last year when the western-backed Saudi-led coalition tried to seize the port, which is the Houthis\u2019 main supply line. In December the UN brokered a complex ceasefire in the city in which both the Yemeni government and Houthi forces were supposed to withdraw, leaving a new security force to take over the port and the city. Only parts of that withdrawal agreement have been implemented. The UAE said it was keen to see the peace process expanded towards a wider peace settlement with deadlines covering the whole country. The officials denied that the move would create a dangerous vacuum around Hodeidah, arguing that there were as many as 19,000 Yemeni troops in the port city area if progress towards a settlement collapsed. In 2018, by contrast, the UAE had argued that the military capture of Hodeidah would force the Houthis to the negotiating table. The international community pressed the UAE and the Saudis to wait outside the city, warning that an assault could lead to a bloodbath and disruption at the port could tip the country into full-blown famine. Emirati officials have also dismissed suggestions that the drawdown reflects a growing rift between Abu Dhabi and Riyadh: their military and political leaders have long differed on preferred strategy in both the bloody impasse in Yemen and dealing with the threat posed to Gulf interests from Tehran. UAE officials refused to go into details of precise troop movements and said some of the withdrawals were tactical, and so could be reversed. Witnesses have said a large-scale drawdown of troops and heavy weaponry is under way in Marib province and the interim capital of Aden as well as Hodeidah.

He was succeeded by Christian Sewing, who said yesterday the bank had \u201cno choice\u201d in axing 18,000 staff.</p> \n<h2><strong>2015-18: The bank paid huge fines for multiple misdemeanors</strong></h2> \n<p>Deutsche is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/23/deutsche-bank-hit-by-record-25bn-libor-rigging-fine\">fined $2.5bn</a> (\u00a31.7bn) by US and UK regulators for rigging the key Libor interest rate.

      "bodyText": "Deutsche Bank\u2019s drastic retrenchment marks the latest chapter in a dramatic fall from grace for a bank that was riding high until the banking crisis struck in 2008. Here\u2019s how the 149-year-old bank ran into trouble. 1989-99: The plan to build a global bank The Frankfurt-based lender embarks on a period of global expansion, beginning with the acquisition of blue-blooded merchant bank Morgan Grenfell in the UK. Capitalising on the rapid pace of globalisation, it pushes into European markets such as Spain, where it buys Banco de Madrid. Acquisitions are part of its ambition to become a major player in investment banking. It consolidates its US operations into one, in an effort to take on the big beasts of Wall Street such as Goldman Sachs, and in 1999 it builds on its US foothold by snapping up New York-based Bankers Trust for $10bn (\u00a38bn). 2001: Joins the New York Stock Exchange Deutsche Bank floats on the New York Stock Exchange, cementing its position as one of the major players, not just on Wall Street but in global banking. 2004-08: Deutsche\u2019s role in the subprime mortgage crisis In the years leading up to the banking crash, Deutsche Bank is a leader in mortgage-backed securities, bundling up homeowners\u2019 debt into huge packages and selling them on to investors. The bank continues to sell toxic mortgage-based investments even as the market turns south and it begins betting against such products itself. A key character in The Big Short movie about the sub-prime scandal \u2013 played by Ryan Gosling \u2013 was based on a Deutsche Bank trader who was enabling investors to bet against the very market in which Deutsche was involved. In 2008 the bank reports its first annual loss for five decades , losing \u20ac3.9bn. \u201cWe have made mistakes, as everyone did,\u201d said chief executive Josef Ackermann. 2009: Using private detectives An internal investigation finds that the bank hired private detectives to spy on people it considered a threat to the bank \u2013 including a shareholder, a journalist and a member of the public. German prosecutors find no evidence of criminal wrongdoing or that senior executives were involved. 2012: The first of four chief executives resigns Deutsche\u2019s boss Josef Ackermann, a Swiss banker, stepped down after a decade in the top job in May 2012. He was succeeded by joint chief executives Anshu Jain and J\u00fcrgen Fitschen, who resigned in the wake of the Libor scandal. A British banker, John Cryan, took over, but he left in 2018 having failed to get to grips with the bank\u2019s problems. Deutsche\u2019s shares lost more than half their value under Cryan as it struggled to return to profitability. He was succeeded by Christian Sewing, who said yesterday the bank had \u201cno choice\u201d in axing 18,000 staff. 2015-18: The bank paid huge fines for multiple misdemeanors Deutsche is fined $2.5bn (\u00a31.7bn) by US and UK regulators for rigging the key Libor interest rate. The bank was also ordered to fire seven employees and accused of being obstructive towards regulators in their investigations into the global manipulation of the benchmark rate. The fine is a record for Libor transgressions. The bank is fined a further $258m in the US for doing business with US-sanctioned countries like Iran and Syria. As regulators continue to sift through the wreckage of the banking crash, Deutsche takes a large slice of the blame. In September 2016, its shares slump on news that the institution faces a $14bn charge over mis-selling mortgage securities in the US. It eventually reaches a $7.2bn settlement with the US Department of Justice. In 2017 UK and US regulators fine Deutsche more than $630m after finding that the lender failed to prevent $10bn of Russian money laundering via \u201cmirror trades\u201d, which had no economic purpose and served only to transfer money covertly. Last year New York financial regulators hand down a fresh fine, $205m this time, for \u201clax oversight\u201d in the bank\u2019s foreign exchange business between 2007 and 2013, when it was the world\u2019s largest dealer in foreign currency. 2019: Dealings with Donald Trump The US Congress issues subpoenas to Deutsche for documents related to the bank\u2019s dealings with Donald Trump. The New York Times reports that senior Deutsche executives blocked employees from alerting the federal government about suspicious activity alerts linked to Trump and Jared Kusher in 2016 and 2017. Deutsche was one of Trump\u2019s biggest lenders, sticking by the real estate mogul when other US banks refused to lend after he went through a series of bankruptcies. Trump is thought to have borrowed at least $2bn from Deutsche with about $300m outstanding. The bank\u2019s entanglement with the Trump family dates back to the 1990s when Bankers Trust continued to lend to him when others had pulled out. In 2008 Trump claimed the financial crisis was an unforeseen event and refused to repay $330m to Deutsche, countersuing for $3bn compensation for Deutsche\u2019s role in the crisis. Trump and Deutsche\u2019s commercial real estate division settled in 2010 but Deutsche\u2019s private banking business continued to lend to Trump. 2019: A merger collapses After struggling to recover from the financial crisis, Deutsche attempts to organise a merger with another troubled German lender, Commerzbank. The talks fell apart in April, scuppering plans for a bank that would have been the eurozone\u2019s second largest. The German government had been in favour of the deal, but the two banks said the risks and costs were too great. Deutsche said it would \u201creview all alternatives\u201d \u2013 and at the weekend Sewing announces 18,000 jobs cuts, 20% of its workforce, with the axe falling worldwide.",

      "bodyText": "If the technological revolution is to work for everyone, it needs the input of all groups \u2013 especially the group that makes up 51% of the population: women. As women, our insights and experiences will be different to those who identify as male, so including women in the process means that we are able to create more rounded solutions. It isn\u2019t just air conditioners that were built to be sexist (most are set to the needs of the average man whose body temperatures is naturally higher, freezing out women in the office), other technological mishaps that ignore women\u2019s needs are far more problematic. Seat belts, for example, are designed to the height of a man and do not factor in breasts. Solutions will ultimately be better when we have more diverse groups involved. Tech is continuously evolving and is part of every industry. It\u2019s really important that young people \u2013 especially young women \u2013 consider working in tech to shape the future. When we look at the data, we see companies that have at least one women on the board are 20% less likely to go bankrupt. We also know that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are likely to outperform their competitors by 15%, and those in the top quartile for ethnic diversity are likely to outperform their competitors by 35%. So it\u2019s clear that when we have a mixture of people in the room we end up creating better solutions and happier teams. As an industry, we need to build diversity into everything we do in order to have challenging conversations and, ultimately, come up with better solutions. For example, many voice-recognition technologies at first did not recognise female voices (despite many AI assistant\u2019s voices being female) because the design teams did not include women. Many voice-recognition technologies still today do not recognise different accents because they are designed by native English speakers, and weren\u2019t made by a team with different backgrounds.

The tech industry is also lucrative. An important part of tech is that people have financial stability because tech is consistently evolving and only getting bigger. However, there is still work to be done \u2013 eight in 10 UK companies still pay men more than women, and this needs to change. A recent study found that 89% of people anticipate a skills shortage in the UK tech sector \u2013 a quarter say it will be significant. That\u2019s why more women and people with diverse backgrounds need to consider technology.

      "bodyText": "What are young workers looking for in an employer? Workplace culture is a high priority, behind only work-life balance and pay, according to a 2018 Confederation of British Industry survey of 1,000 17-23 year olds. Both millennials and generation Z say diversity is also key to workplace loyalty, with 69% agreeing they are more likely to want to stay five or more years if working for employers perceived to have a diverse workforce, according to Deloitte\u2019s 2018 Millennial Survey Report. But what is a diverse and inclusive culture? Jill Miller, diversity and inclusion policy adviser at the CIPD (The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, a professional organisation that has helped to shape pay gap regulations), describes an inclusive culture as \u201csupporting people to perform at their best as they will be able to be themselves and know their contribution is valued\u201d. And at the heart of inclusion is tolerance. A tolerant workplace is built on a diverse workforce, suggests Miller. \u201cPeople with a diversity of identities, backgrounds and circumstances bring with them different perspectives which can challenge \u2018group-think\u2019 and lead to more innovative ideas.\u201d Asked in the survey which three areas most urgently needed to be addressed to improve diversity in business, young people showed a broad spread of concerns. In order of most-selected were: educational background, age, gender, disability, ethnicity, social background and social status, LGBT and religion. Young workers believe that only formal legislation can adequately advance diversity, according to the survey. This includes mandatory gender pay gap reporting. Some companies have also started voluntarily reporting their BAME (black and minority ethnic) pay gap \u2013 an important first step towards racial equality at work, says Miller, as it opens up the conversation on race. She adds: \u201cIt\u2019s only when employers examine the data to unpick the core issues in their organisation and take action to address them that we will see change happen.\u201d According to a Resolution Foundation study BAME workers are losing \u00a33.2bn a year in wages compared with white colleagues. Aside from gender and BAME pay gap figures, what helps determine a commitment to diversity? Bex Bailey, a spokesperson for the Young Women\u2019s Trust says: \u201c[It can be] worth checking an organisation\u2019s sexual harassment policy and complaints procedures.\u201d She also suggests looking at its staff make-up and posing questions on its culture at a job interview. Miller, meanwhile, suggests checking for the following: a commitment to flexible working; promotion of paternity and shared parental leave; a diversity statement combined with diversity within the organisation; the existence of employee networks or resource groups who work with the employer. For young workers who want to help improve their workplace\u2019s diversity, Miller suggests joining networks or resource groups, if they exist \u2013 or setting one up, if they do not. \u201cYou can also look for role models \u2013 people in the organisation who inspire you and who you can learn from.\u201d",

From the late 1940s to 1992 FK Sarajevo \u2013 together with their city rivals Zeljeznicar and Bosnian clubs from Mostar and Tuzla \u2013 were one of the regulars in the strong Yugoslav football league. They won two league titles (1967 and 1985), and that made them one of only three clubs outside the traditional big four of Red Star Belgrade, Partizan, Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb to ever achieve that.</p> <p>Despite being formed by the local communist government in 1946 and with almost no tradition, FK Sarajevo soon became one of the most popular football clubs in Bosnia. More than 40,000 attended the Kosevo City Stadium \u2013 which later hosted the opening ceremony of the 1984 Winter Olympics and was renamed Asim Ferhatovic Hase after the club legend \u2013 when FK Sarajevo hosted future winners Manchester United in the 1967 European Cup and the local derby against Zeljeznicar often attracted even more fans.</p> <p>The war stopped everything but, like so many other things in this country, football was a victim of the post-war transition. During Yugoslav socialism, clubs were officially owned, financed and ruled by \u201cthe people\u201d or \u2013 in real life \u2013 by regime officials. With most of the football infrastructure destroyed during the war and the failure of Bosnian law to regulate the ownership of clubs, football ended up being stuck between two eras and with no system. Or any chance to improve.</p> <p>Since the country\u2019s admittance to Uefa competition and the first ever match played at this very same stadium in 1998 between Zeljeznicar and Kilmarnock, no club have managed to qualify for the group stages of any European competition. The national team made it to the World Cup in Brazil in 2014, but only one player \u2013 the third-choice goalkeeper \u2013 was playing for a Bosnian league club. For decades the domestic league struggled with poor quality, even worse infrastructure and no money at all while being under constant but never proved corruption and match-fixing suspicions.</p> <p>In 2013 FK Sarajevo became the first Bosnian club to be owned by a foreigner. It was not an official ownership as such, as Bosnian law still does not recognise private ownership of the clubs, but Vincent Tan and his advisers managed to bypass the law and become the major shareholders. In five years, Tan may have invested less than \u20ac10m but that was still more than enough to make FK Sarajevo the most powerful club in the country financially. It was a good start but did not yield the success Tan was after. They won only one league title and one cup during his time in charge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a0bf21962b6c67bfa75bfbf54ac964f40035809\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a0bf21962b6c67bfa75bfbf54ac964f40035809/1262_78_2868_1721/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Atalanta\u2019s Marten de Roon challenges for a header with Mersudin Ahmetovic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Atalanta\u2019s Marten de Roon challenges for a header with Mersudin Ahmetovic of FK Sarajevo during the Europa League second qualifying round in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, the Malaysian businessman laid the foundations for a new era and the club built a training centre and turned their youth academy into the best in the country.

In an interview on the NPR show Fresh Air, the Sex and the City star commented on the impact of the #MeToo campaign and said: \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t \u2026 until about six or eight months ago that I started recognising countless experiences of men behaving poorly, inappropriately \u2026 I don\u2019t know why I either wasn\u2019t courageous or more destroyed by some of the things that I was privy to, that I was on the receiving end of.\u201d Parker often felt intimidated, to the extent that she did not feel able to confront her harasser. \u201cNo matter how evolved or how modern I thought I was ... I didn\u2019t feel as powerful as the man who was behaving inappropriately \u2026 I had every right to say, \u2018This is inappropriate.\u2019 I could have felt safe in going to a superior.\u201d Parker said that one particular situation involved a \u201cvery, very big movie star\u201d, whom she did not name.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s second busiest train station came to a standstill on Tuesday morning after a derailment in the early hours caused chaos for commuters and holidaymakers which is expected to continue all day. An engineering train came off its tracks at 3am and ended up blocking five of the 19 lines going into London Victoria, which serves the capital\u2019s southern suburbs as well as Sussex, Kent and Surrey, and Gatwick airport. Network Rail engineers worked throughout the day to get the 50-tonne train back on the rails, using cutting torches to separate the carriages and then lifting them with hydraulic jacks. The aim was to have the vehicles removed by 5pm, which would be too late to provide a full rush hour service from the station. The complex operation caused disruption throughout the day, with Gatwick Express running reduced services. People heading for the airport were advised to take Thameslink trains from London Bridge. A spokeswoman for Network Rail, which is responsible for maintaining Britain\u2019s rail infrastructure, said: \u201cWe would like to apologise to passengers affected by ongoing disruption on Southern trains into London Victoria this morning owing to a derailed engineering train. We are working to remove the derailed vehicle as quickly as possible.\u201d She said passengers were advised to travel later in the day if possible and to seek an alternative route via London Bridge or London Blackfriars as trains were being delayed, diverted or cancelled.

It doesn\u2019t seem to matter about which generation it is \u2013 there is something in the college system and through to the national team that makes these women absolute winners. There\u2019s something in that mentality which I\u2019m not sure you can coach. It\u2019s just in their DNA. We have to figure out in Europe how to embed the same mentality into our football culture. We are, however, closer than ever before. Those fine margins that saw Ellen White\u2019s goal disallowed in the semi-final would not have been the difference years ago. The key could be the growing strength of our domestic leagues, with the Champions League as the pinnacle. I think Uefa now has to introduce group stages for the Champions League so it gives more players exposure to top-level international competition. All of that helps to build experience that could translate to England going from the semi-finals to the final or Netherlands winning the World Cup next time round. The 2021 European Championship in England is surely a big target for Phil Neville and his team to win. It is not far on the horizon, but one thing is certain: the future for women\u2019s football around the world is phenomenally bright.",

It is spread through body fluids, which is why carers \u2013 mostly female relatives and nursing staff \u2013 are particularly at risk. It causes fever, aches and diarrhoea and attacks the immune system, causing blood clotting cells to malfunction so that victims bleed extensively and die if their immune system cannot fight off the viral infection.</p>\n    <p>Drugs are still experimental. Patients are isolated and treated by nurses wearing full protective body suits and masks who try to boost their immune response. Friends and relatives are quarantined for 21 days. Prevention measures include washing hands at every opportunity and safe burial practices, with no touching or washing of the body, as is traditional in some cultures.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How does this compare with other outbreaks?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The 2013 and 2016 outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea spread for months through forest regions in west&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa\">Africa</a>&nbsp;where Ebola was unknown before the emergency was recognised.

      "bodyText": "The head of the World Health Organization has called the world\u2019s second worst Ebola outbreak a \u201cglobal wake-up call\u201d to the escalating risk of disease outbreaks spreading from conflict areas neglected by the international community. Only when there was \u201cfear and panic\u201d in the headlines did the international community put money into responding, said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The real issue was a lack of day-to-day funding for preparedness to combat serious epidemics before they become regional or international threats, he said. Speaking ahead of a new call for funding for the response to the Ebola outbreak, he added: \u201cThe problem is that [donors] refrain from paying until there is fear and panic. That has to change. We should not be funding by huge amounts when we panic, but should be funding to avoid panic.\u201d Invoking the spectre of Spanish influenza, which killed tens of millions in the aftermath of World War I, he added that international health systems in an increasingly globalised world were only as \u201cstrong as the weakest link\u201d. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian in Geneva, Tedros added that while he believed the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo could be controlled in the short term \u2013 given the right security conditions \u2013 the virus would inevitably return while political instability continued in North Kivu and Iruri, the provinces at the heart of the outbreak. Tedros also reiterated his resistance to declaring the current outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). This is despite calls from the British international development secretary, Rory Stewart, during a visit to the city of Butembo, the current epicentre of the outbreak. \u201cI know we can finish this Ebola outbreak,\u201d said Tedros, former foreign minister of Ethiopia, who became director general of the UN global health organisation in 2017. \u201cBut at the same time it can come back because all the [political and security] conditions remain the same. \u201cThere are some people who say we need to declare the outbreak as an [emergency] to mobilise resources. That\u2019s really wrong. Resources should be available to prevent needing to declare a PHEIC. Preparedness is the solution, not firefighting.\u201d WHO officials also questioned Stewart\u2019s assertion in the Guardian that more cash was needed to pay for ring vaccination.

      "bodyText": "The Vatican has waived diplomatic immunity for its envoy to France, who is under investigation for sexual assault. The move \u2013 an indication of the Vatican\u2019s tougher approach to sexual misconduct and abuse \u2013 clears the way for Archbishop Luigi Ventura, the apostolic nuncio, to face criminal charges. Ventura, 74, is accused of molesting a male employee of Paris city authorities during a new year reception at which Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, addressed diplomats, religious leaders and civil society figures. Parisian authorities have been investigating the allegation for several months. According to a judicial source, \u201cduring the ceremony, a city employee was repeatedly groped on the backside, in three instances, once in front of a witness\u201d. In March, Nathalie Loiseau, France\u2019s minister of European affairs, urged the Vatican to waive immunity. \u201cAt this point, [Ventura] benefits from diplomatic immunity, but the Holy See is clearly aware of the serious accusations that have been brought against the apostolic nuncio and I don\u2019t doubt for a second that the Holy See will do the right thing,\u201d Loiseau said. On Monday, Alessandro Gisotti, the interim head of Vatican communications, confirmed the archbishop\u2019s immunity had been waived. \u201cI can confirm that the Holy See renounces jurisdictional immunity enjoyed by the apostolic nuncio in France, Msgr Luigi Ventura, by virtue of the Vienna convention of 18 April 1961 on diplomatic relations, for the purposes of criminal proceedings concerning him,\u201d he said. Describing the move as \u201can extraordinary gesture\u201d, Gisotti said Ventura had agreed \u201cto collaborate fully and spontaneously with the French judicial authorities\u201d. After the initial allegation was made against in Ventura in March, a second man claimed the diplomat had molested him in Canada in 2008. Christian Vachon alleged Ventura touched his buttocks at least twice during a banquet held at the Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupr\u00e9, near Quebec. Under the Vienna convention, diplomatic immunity exempts state envoys from lawsuits or prosecution in their host country. In special circumstances, such as a serious criminal offence, protection can be removed by the diplomat\u2019s home country. The Vatican has faced wave after wave of scandals relating to sexual abuse and misconduct, and has been accused of cover-up and laxity. Earlier this year, Pope Francis summoned bishops from around the world to Rome for a summit on the issue and later issued a decree making it mandatory for all Catholic priests and nuns to report sexual abuse and its cover-up to church authorities. Ventura, who was born in Italy, is a career diplomat at the Vatican. He has been the apostolic nuncio to France for almost 10 years.",

      "bodyText": "Proroguing the House of Commons to achieve a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cthe end of parliamentary democracy\u201d in the UK, Dominic Grieve has said in defending his move to seek to remove the option. Grieve\u2019s amendment, which has cross-party support including from a handful of fellow Conservative MPs, is to the Northern Ireland bill going through the Commons, and would require fortnightly reports on that country\u2019s formation of an executive, which has been vacant since 2017. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Grieve said the amendment calls for \u201cregular motions before parliament in September and particularly October\u201d. If passed, it would prevent the parliamentary session being prorogued, or abruptly ended, in the lead-up to the 31 October departure date. Grieve, a former attorney general, said \u201cthe idea that it is constitutionally proper to prorogue parliament as a device for bringing about a no-deal Brexit is outrageous \u2026 I have never come across a more extraordinary suggestion. \u201cIf you decide that parliament is an inconvenience, when in fact it is the place where democratic legitimacy lies in our constitution, and therefore it\u2019s acceptable to get rid of it for a period because it might otherwise [stop] you from doing something that parliament would prevent, then it\u2019s the end of democracy.\u201d Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to replace Theresa May and become the new prime minister, has said he is not in favour of prorogation, telling the Daily Mail: \u201cI\u2019m not attracted to archaic political devices.\u201d Grieve noted, however, that the \u201cthis extraordinary idea crept in\u201d during the course of the leadership election and Johnson \u201cseemed to adopt it\u201d. \u201cIt should be denounced by anybody who is planning to be the prime minister of a democratic country,\u201d Grieve said, and Johnson \u201cshould be saying very, very clearly that there\u2019s no possibility of proroguing parliament to achieve an aim of the executive\u201d. He said whoever became prime minister in a country \u201cwhere there are deep divisions over Brexit, where the party he is leading does not have a majority in the House of Commons and is dependent on the support of another minority party\u201d should either call a general election or \u201cgovern taking into account the opinion of the Commons\u201d. \u201cTo try to simply disregard that opinion and to try to pretend it doesn\u2019t exist is to court disaster.\u201d If MPs made a stand today to prevent prorogation, it would mean they could avoid having to do something more drastic later, Grieve said. Grieve was backed by the Conservative former foreign secretary William Hague, who told Today: \u201cI think it\u2019s very important that parliament is able to give its opinion. It ought to be unthinkable that we could leave the EU by a manoeuvre, by a procedural ruse of some kind. \u201cWhile I don\u2019t agree with everything Dominic has said or tried to do, I sympathise with attempts to ensure that parliament can have its say.\u201d Opponents of the amendment, such as the Tory MP Steve Baker, who is one of the leaders of the hardline European Research Group, expressed outrage that Theresa May might give Tory MPs a free vote on the amendment. \u201cIncredibly, I understand there is some doubt about the whipping on this matter.\u201d Baker tweeted. \u201cSurely Theresa May won\u2019t allow her legacy to include failing to resist dragging the Queen into politics?\u201d He later drew attention to a newspaper story which suggested the chancellor, Philip Hammond, would support May\u2019s legacy projects if she gave Tory rebels opportunities to vote for measures that ruled out a no-deal departure from the EU. \u201cWhat a way to govern a country,\u201d Baker tweeted.",

      "bodyText": "There are many things you might expect to find while waiting for an early morning flight at Los Angeles International airport. Overpriced breakfast sandwiches and bawling toddlers feature high on the list, but Andr\u00e9 3000 pootling around playing a 40-minute flute solo isn\u2019t usually a contender. And yet that\u2019s exactly what happened last month, with podcast producer Antonia Cereijido spotting the Outkast man strolling from gate to gate, casually going to town on a handcrafted Mayan wind instrument like the low-key legend he is. Of course, this isn\u2019t the kind of moment that can pass without some sort of social media validation. Her joyous selfie with The King of Wind \u2013 as he shall now be known \u2013 has now been liked almost 400,000 times. Flutes, you see, are currently having what\u2019s known as \u201ca bit of a moment\u201d. Sure, they might be one of the world\u2019s oldest-known pieces of kit for bashing out a tune on \u2013 the drum, obvs, takes the top spot here \u2013 but their time is now. The flute\u2019s brightest champion is the rapper Lizzo, who also just so happens to be a classically trained player. Her long silver sidekick Sasha Flute even has its own Instagram account with an extremely decent 130,000 followers. Sasha can be found at @sashabefluting if you wanna give her a follow and see the flute\u2019s many joyful adventures, including outings with Gucci sunglasses and Nando\u2019s takeaway bag. Truly, Sasha is living the rock star dream. Sasha recently joined Lizzo for her most fabulous outing yet, during her BET awards performance of Truth Hurts, which not only saw her twerking on a giant wedding cake but scoring a standing ovation from Rihanna and \u2013 maybe even more excitingly \u2013 the headline \u201cLizzo\u2019s BET 2019 flute performance is a whole vibe\u201d from the bad boys of ClassicFM.com. \u201cLizzo transcends all kinds of stereotypes,\u201d explains Lisa Nelsen, acting chair of the British Flute Society and steadfast Lizzo stan. \u201cThe flute gang are pretty ready to show off what we can do. Pop, classical, beatbox \u2013 we\u2019ve got our fingers in lots of pots.\u201d Earlier this year, Will Ferrell even took Ron Burgundy out of semi-retirement to accept Lizzo\u2019s jazz-flute challenge. She countered with a shot-for-shot recreation of Anchorman\u2019s seminal club scene, set to her single Juice. 1-0 to Lizzo. Norwegian-Mexican-American ambient artist Carmen Villain is also getting in on the action, making flute a key part of her dreamy new album Both Lines Will Be Blue. The playing comes courtesy of Johanna Scheie Orellana \u2013 formerly of Oslo electropop trio Sassy 009 \u2013 who has a particularly spiritual reasoning behind her love of the instrument. \u201cPlaying is a very physical and intimate experience because you have to create the sound within your body, almost like a singer,\u201d she explains. \u201cSometimes I imagine that the airstream comes straight from my soul itself.\u201d Rather than bashing out instantly iconic R&amp;B hits like Lizzo, Orellana\u2019s approach to Villain\u2019s album is way more avant garde. \u201cIn one of the songs I\u2019m blowing air through the instrument without any tone.

      "bodyText": "TisaKorean \u2013 Double Dare (Soapy Anthem) Praised in this column last month for his brilliant guest verse on Chance the Rapper\u2019s GRoCERIES, TisaKorean continues to mark himself out as 2019\u2019s most left-brained new MC. The 24-year-old sounds younger than he is, with naive-melody raps that fall off the beat like a failed skipping rope chant and only ever hang around for a couple of minutes. He is obsessed with soap (his chosen metaphor for announcing his freshness) and his signature ad-lib \u2013 a kind of surprised \u201ceww\u201d noise \u2013 is like a drag queen accidentally touching a hot barbecue. His fashion sense is from the Lil Yachty stable of \u201c14-year-old girl being able to wear whatever she wants on non-uniform day\u201d. He will utterly enrage anyone who thinks rap is about poetic, socially conscious lyricism, but even people who don\u2019t like him wandering off from the beat like a happy toddler might enjoy Double Dare, one of his most focused tunes yet. BBT Ashley O \u2013 On a Roll What looked like the most exciting episode from the new series of Black Mirror turned out to be a total sham: Miley Cyrus\u2019s compromised, purple-haired pop star Ashley O realises that she has \u201csold out\u201d and would be much happier ditching the wig to play bar-room rock in sweaty clubs. To be fair, it is a dystopian concept, if a painfully outdated one. She revamps her character\u2019s trademark song, On a Roll \u2013 a full-throated embrace of ambition \u2013 into something that sounds like Nickelback come the end of the episode.

Their take on post-punk has a lot in common with that of the Raincoats: pattering, circular percussion, interweaving and gang vocals that do away with the idea of a lead singer and an energy that\u2019s as invigorating as it is meditative.

Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Protesters referred to Lam\u2019s track record of going back on promises made to the public, for example that she would resign if the public demanded it.

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, attempted to end what has been the territory\u2019s worst political crisis in decades by declaring a controversial extradition bill that set off weeks of protests \u201cdead\u201d. Yet the operative word protesters were looking for was \u201cwithdraw\u201d, or chit wui, a key demand of the demonstrators to formally withdraw the bill from parliament. Lam has said the bill, already suspended last month in response to protests, would expire at the end of the legislative session that finishes next July. Instead she used a Cantonese idiom to describe \u201creaching the end of one\u2019s life\u201d. Soon after the press conference, protesters panned her \u201cword games\u201d and vowed to organise further protests if she refused to meet demands. Others said that without the bill\u2019s withdrawal, according to the rules and procedures of the legislature, they could only rely on Lam\u2019s promises that it would not be revived. \u201cShe said nothing really. Her personal guarantee is meaningless,\u201d said Yan, a 35-year-old construction worker who asked not to give his full name. \u201cThe bill has not been withdrawn and they can still bring it back in another form,\u201d he said. The extradition bill, which critics fear would be used as a political tool by Beijing to bring dissidents and critics of the government to China, has been a lightning rod for discontent in Hong Kong and an example of the erosion of the city\u2019s freedoms under Beijing\u2019s control. The former British colony, returned to China in 1997, is meant to operate with a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d, with its own courts and legislature. Lam, elected by a 1,194-member committee dominated by pro-Beijing representatives, has been the focus of much of that discontent, with protesters calling for her removal. \u201cThe level of distrust in Lam and her government is so deep at this point that these half measures are unlikely to be accepted and protests will likely continue,\u201d said Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based writer and author of the book, City of Protest. Protesters referred to Lam\u2019s track record of going back on promises made to the public, for example that she would resign if the public demanded it. On Tuesday, Lam said she would not be stepping down. Critics say that even if the bill is truly finished, protesters are not likely to be appeased. \u201cThe bill is dead, but people don\u2019t trust her anymore,\u201d said Dennis Kwok, a pro-democracy lawmaker with the Civic party. Lam also refused to meet other demonstrator demands, including for the release of those arrested in the protests and an independent investigation into police use of force on protesters on 12 June \u2013 when teargas, rubber bullets and truncheons were deployed on largely peaceful crowds. \u201cThe campaign will go on. People want concrete results; they are not happy with what they have seen so far,\u201d said Joseph Cheng, a retired political scientist at the City University of Hong Kong. While the demonstrations may decline in scale, Cheng believes protesters will continue. Their demands have gone beyond simply the withdrawal of the bill.

      "bodyText": "Indonesia says it will send eight containers of household rubbish back to Australia after inspectors declared the material too contaminated to be recycled. It is the latest in a series of announcements by south-east Asian nations that they will not be dumping grounds for overseas waste. Indonesian customs officials said the containers of paper from Australia were contaminated by electronic waste, used cans, plastic bottles, old bottles of engine oil and loose shoes. Some of this was deemed \u201cB3\u201d, an abbreviation of \u201cbahan berbahaya dan beracun\u201d, which refers to toxic and hazardous material. Opening the containers up for the press on Tuesday morning, gloved customs officials held up examples of the offending material, including used nappies and soft drink cans. Speaking at Tanjung Perak port in Surabaya, customs officials said eight containers holding 210.3 tonnes of waste would be returned. The containers arrived in Surabaya, Indonesia\u2019s second-largest city, in mid-June after being sent from Brisbane by a shipping company. Customs in Surabaya said the offending material would be re-exported immediately, following coordination with the Indonesian import firm PT MDI. The customs office said it was obliged to protect Indonesia and its environment from imports of B3 waste and had coordinated with related government ministries, including trade and environment, as a show of how serious it was. Global recycling was thrown into chaos last year when China banned imports of foreign plastic waste, leaving developed nations struggling to find places to send their rubbish. Huge quantities have since been redirected to south-east Asia, but opposition to handling exported waste is growing in the region. In May, the Malaysian government said it would return up to 100 tonnes of Australian waste because it was too contaminated to recycle. It was part of 450 tonnes of imported plastic waste it sent back to countries across the globe. Malaysia\u2019s environment minister, Yeo Bee Yin, said the rubbish was infested with maggots and declared Malaysia would \u201cfight back\u201d and \u201cnot be the dumping ground of the world.\u201d The Philippines returned about 69 containers of rubbish back to Canada last month, putting an end to a diplomatic row between the two countries. Last week, Indonesia announced it was sending back 49 containers full of waste to France and other developed nations. Global concern over plastic pollution has been spurred by shocking images of waste-clogged rivers in Southeast Asia and accounts of dead sea creatures found with kilos of refuse in their stomachs. Environmental group WWF says about 300m tonnes of plastic are produced each year, with much of it ending up in landfills, waterways or oceans. As it repatriates unsanctioned waste, Indonesia has its own huge domestic rubbish issues to contend with. Many across the archipelago continue to burn toxic waste as a form of disposal, while each year tonnes of waste are dumped in the country\u2019s rivers and oceans. Indonesia is the second-largest global contributor to marine plastic waste after China. Comment was sought from the Australian government. \u2022 Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",

Last October Branson, 68, said he hoped to be onboard an early Virgin Galactic flight \u201cin months not years\u201d, with passengers flying \u201cnot too long after that\u201d. Branson said the deal would \u201copen space to more investors and thousands of new astronauts\u201d. The British firm he founded, majority owned by the Virgin group, will sell a 49% stake and merge with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings, a shell company set up by Palihapitiya and listed in New York. Palihapitiya, who will chair Virgin Galactic and has pledged a further $100m investment when the deal is completed, said he was confident the firm was \u201clight years ahead of the competition\u201d. Virgin Galactic said the company would be valued at around $1.5bn. He said the \u201crisk-reward is really compelling\u201d, comparable to software companies right at the start of their growth, adding: \u201cWe have 2,500 people on the waiting list who want to be customers. There are many more people who want to go to space than there is room to fly them.\u201d The fate of his other transport ventures suggest Branson\u2019s eyes are fixed firmly on the heavens: Virgin\u2019s UK train operations, a fixture since rail privatisation, are set to vanish by autumn, and Branson has sold his controlling stake in the Virgin Atlantic airline. Branson will retain the largest share in Virgin Galactic, whose troubled ascent towards being a viable venture included the loss of a test spaceship, which crashed in the Mojave desert in California in 2014, killing its pilot Michael Alsbury. A potential billion-dollar investment from Saudi Arabia was also suspended after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Turkey. In December, Virgin Galactic\u2019s SpaceShipTwo craft reached the edge of space for the first time, and a test flight in February carried a first passenger \u2013 Beth Moses, formerly of Nasa and now Virgin\u2019s chief astronaut instructor. Branson said the flotation could allow Virgin to invest in more craft, stealing a further march on the tech billionaires also in the space race \u2013 albeit ones who are aiming to go further into the final frontier. Blue Origin is targeting the moon for passenger trips by 2024. Meanwhile, Musk has Mars in his sights, with SpaceX planning its first cargo mission to the red planet in 2022, with a crewed mission to follow two years later. Musk\u2019s rockets already supply the International Space Station, a destination some way beyond the altitude of Branson\u2019s space flights. SpaceX is also planning a passenger flight around the moon in 2023, A long history of false starts might deter the cautious investor before rushing to buy shares in Virgin Galactic, which could be trading by the end of the year. However, with a commercial spaceport now at the ready in New Mexico, Branson\u2019s step into space appears to him, as ever, to be just around the corner. He told Sky News: \u201cNext year I\u2019ll be going up.\u201d",

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Others criticised Lam\u2019s refusal to formally withdraw the bill. Lokman Tsui, who teaches journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said: \u201c\u2018Officially dead\u2019 is not a legal or political term. So it\u2019s still unclear whether it is withdrawn, and we can only assume it is not since she still has not said those words.\u201d</p> \n<p>Public opinion of Lam, a target of protesters who see her as a lackey for Beijing, has reached a new low and few trust her pledges.</p> \n<p>One protester, who would only give his surname, Ip, said: \u201cShe said the bill is dead but in the legislative rules, there is only \u2018postpone\u2019 or \u2018withdrawal\u2019.

Protesters and residents have accused the police of using excessive force against demonstrators. Lam has made one concession, however: public discussions with student protesters. Previously she had only agreed to closed-door talks.</p> \n<p>Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said: \u201cShe is still trying hard to put up this strong leader face, refusing to succumb to the people \u2026 that could send a dangerous message to mainland dissent too.

Because getting cancer, and then going through the treatment for it, is like being hit with a sledgehammer: you\u2019re totally floored, everything you thought you knew is changed, and there\u2019s an awful lot about yourself and your body and your psyche that you have to process in a short length of time.

The idea is that, on your final day of treatment, you ring a bell to mark the occasion: sometimes, other patients and staff are there to watch you do it and you\u2019re clapped and cheered.

There are people who bemoan the way it\u2019s called \u201ca journey\u201d; there are those who hate being called \u201csufferers\u201d, still less \u201cvictims\u201d.

Because it\u2019s a terrifying disease, and being scared and being angry aren\u2019t that far apart. So when we have an opportunity to be angry, we take it, and then we flog it for all we\u2019ve got. When I was going through my brush with cancer (yes, that\u2019s how I want to describe it), I got an invitation one day to go for a makeup workshop organised at the hospital. I was outraged, because nothing about the way I looked had changed. I thought they\u2019d made a mistake but when I called up to say so they assured me they hadn\u2019t; and then they invited me along a second time, even after I\u2019d said I wouldn\u2019t be going.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/jul/04/how-a-video-game-community-filled-my-nephews-final-days-with-happiness-elite-dangerous\">How a video game community filled my nephew's final days with joy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was properly angry.

There were so many angles through which we could explore this case.\u201d</p> <p>Carter had landed in the middle of a media frenzy when the shocking details of her relationship with the deceased came to light. Carter had spent a little over two years exchanging text messages and other online communiques with one Conrad Roy, a young man she had met while on vacation in Florida. Though they only lived a brief drive from one another back in New England, their interactions were limited almost solely to the realm of the digital, where the intense bond between them slowly soured. Carter began sending increasingly disturbing sentiments to Roy, eventually building up to exhortations for him to take his own life. When a distraught Roy sealed himself in his exhaust-filled car and stumbled out after having second thoughts, it was Carter that encouraged \u2013 commanded, some alleged \u2013 him to get back inside.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xCTm6PzvF0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5xCTm6PzvF0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The case was literally unprecedented, a new standard-setter for manslaughter allegations with its assertion that a killing could be carried out secondhand via text message. Carr\u2019s film crystallizes just how complex pulling off that legal gambit had to be to succeed, as counsel on both sides repeatedly defined and redefined the terms of Roy and Carter\u2019s mental health. Their saga started to resemble an after-school special supercharged by technological connectivity. Carter herself invoked Romeo and Juliet in their texting; the comparison, in all its overcooked dramatics and rash action, was apt.</p> <p>The citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts saw red during the ensuing trial, placing the blame for Roy\u2019s death squarely on Carter as an ice-cold manipulator. Carr wanted to take a more studied, nuanced approach to a subject she saw as wrestling with her own demons of loneliness and delusion. \u201cAt first I thought it was all inhuman,\u201d the director admits. \u201cI mean, who talks to another person like that? So there was an evolution for me, in my thinking. Being part of this story in a long-term way helped me come to understand what Michelle was dealing with.\u201d</p> <p>Carr wanted to give everyone involved with the litigation a fair shake, to show how Carter\u2019s supposed predation could have been a function of her own instability. She had gone to the Bay State with the intention of producing an episode for a series she was planning at the time, but as she delved into the court documents and archival materials, she got a sense that she had struck on something bigger. She dedicated herself to learning everything she could about the sad tale of Carter and Roy, doing the journalistic legwork of conducting interviews and putting together quotes. But embedding herself in the scene, and gaining entry to the courtroom proceedings as the lone video presence, proved no simple feat.</p> <p>\u201cAccess on this one was deeply difficult,\u201d Carr remembers. \u201cNobody wanted to talk to some goon from Brooklyn. It was about us continually asking but not bothering people. In terms of the court system, I feel there was a lot of luck involved. They basically told us, \u2018You know what? Uh, yeah, you guys can have your shot.\u2019 We showed up the first day in court for opening statements, and if you\u2019re the camera inside the courtroom, that means you have to be the pool camera providing footage for the news organizations. We had to make sure our footage was relayed back to all the news teams, and on day one, everything was malfunctioning.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2a801971ffa5d409b4fa4013c3f140344b7502b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a801971ffa5d409b4fa4013c3f140344b7502b4/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Carter in I Love You, Now Die\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michelle Carter in I Love You, Now Die.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carr laughs as she continues reminiscing about her time in these particular trenches: \u201cThe first day, the video feed wasn\u2019t going through, and suddenly we\u2019re the only ones standing between the news and their coverage of this crazy national case. People were losing their minds at us. They had jobs to do! They were like, \u2018What the fuck is happening, who are these HBO people?\u2019 I started to have a little meltdown. I turned to one guy, and asked what he thought the problem is, if he just had to take a guess. He says it could be any number of things, and I\u2019m asking him to just take a wild guess as to what it could possibly be. He\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, an extension cord out of the converter?\u2019 We changed out the cord during the next recess, and of course that was it. I\u2019m not a religious person, but I prayed to whoever exists in the eternal in that moment and thanked them.\u201d</p> <p>Snafus notwithstanding, Carr got closer to the heart of the dark, confounding situation than anyone else. All the while, as she gained the locals\u2019 trust and developed a personal connection to her material, she strove to remain mindful of her professional obligations. \u201cYou have to be objective as a journalist,\u201d she says. \u201cBut here I am as a documentary film-maker, adding music to some scenes and editing others. You see the text messages when I want you to see the text messages \u2026 You need to remain unbiased when you\u2019re reporting on a murder trial, and I don\u2019t feel that\u2019s something I\u2019m naturally gifted at, nor do I do it on a daily basis. There\u2019s conflict in that, everyone struggles with it. What I try to keep in mind is: what are the facts? What\u2019s the evidence? Who are the key people involved, and how can I talk to them? That\u2019s what I include in the piece. There\u2019s no first-person, no voiceover.\u201d</p> <p>Her work searches for the truth along with a hard-fought decency, a belief that figures the mass media may vilify still contain a core of humanity. She sees this notion of empathy as a foundation of the true crime genre currently dominant in American culture, maybe even the secret ingredient that\u2019s made it so recently ubiquitous. If the people would only look past the kneejerk rage that the Carter case inspires on first glance, they\u2019d be wounded by the same pain that drew Carr to this sordid tale \u2013 a pain emanating from both sides, outward in every direction.</p> <p>\u201cTrue crime has a way of creating a visceral, physical reaction,\u201d Carr firmly states. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like hearing about other people\u2019s hurt. We\u2019re herd animals, and we don\u2019t want to see other people hurting. It\u2019s like sports, with built-in stakes that you get invested in. This is a story about human beings, people also struggling with mental health issues will see it, and so we have to make sure to be compassionate while reporting on scandal.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>I Love You, Now Die starts on HBO on 9 July with a UK date yet to be confirmed</p></li> </ul>",

But embedding herself in the scene, and gaining entry to the courtroom proceedings as the lone video presence, proved no simple feat. \u201cAccess on this one was deeply difficult,\u201d Carr remembers. \u201cNobody wanted to talk to some goon from Brooklyn. It was about us continually asking but not bothering people. In terms of the court system, I feel there was a lot of luck involved. They basically told us, \u2018You know what? Uh, yeah, you guys can have your shot.\u2019 We showed up the first day in court for opening statements, and if you\u2019re the camera inside the courtroom, that means you have to be the pool camera providing footage for the news organizations. We had to make sure our footage was relayed back to all the news teams, and on day one, everything was malfunctioning.\u201d Carr laughs as she continues reminiscing about her time in these particular trenches: \u201cThe first day, the video feed wasn\u2019t going through, and suddenly we\u2019re the only ones standing between the news and their coverage of this crazy national case. People were losing their minds at us. They had jobs to do! They were like, \u2018What the fuck is happening, who are these HBO people?\u2019 I started to have a little meltdown. I turned to one guy, and asked what he thought the problem is, if he just had to take a guess. He says it could be any number of things, and I\u2019m asking him to just take a wild guess as to what it could possibly be. He\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, an extension cord out of the converter?\u2019 We changed out the cord during the next recess, and of course that was it. I\u2019m not a religious person, but I prayed to whoever exists in the eternal in that moment and thanked them.\u201d Snafus notwithstanding, Carr got closer to the heart of the dark, confounding situation than anyone else. All the while, as she gained the locals\u2019 trust and developed a personal connection to her material, she strove to remain mindful of her professional obligations. \u201cYou have to be objective as a journalist,\u201d she says. \u201cBut here I am as a documentary film-maker, adding music to some scenes and editing others. You see the text messages when I want you to see the text messages \u2026 You need to remain unbiased when you\u2019re reporting on a murder trial, and I don\u2019t feel that\u2019s something I\u2019m naturally gifted at, nor do I do it on a daily basis. There\u2019s conflict in that, everyone struggles with it. What I try to keep in mind is: what are the facts? What\u2019s the evidence? Who are the key people involved, and how can I talk to them? That\u2019s what I include in the piece. There\u2019s no first-person, no voiceover.\u201d Her work searches for the truth along with a hard-fought decency, a belief that figures the mass media may vilify still contain a core of humanity. She sees this notion of empathy as a foundation of the true crime genre currently dominant in American culture, maybe even the secret ingredient that\u2019s made it so recently ubiquitous. If the people would only look past the kneejerk rage that the Carter case inspires on first glance, they\u2019d be wounded by the same pain that drew Carr to this sordid tale \u2013 a pain emanating from both sides, outward in every direction. \u201cTrue crime has a way of creating a visceral, physical reaction,\u201d Carr firmly states. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like hearing about other people\u2019s hurt. We\u2019re herd animals, and we don\u2019t want to see other people hurting. It\u2019s like sports, with built-in stakes that you get invested in. This is a story about human beings, people also struggling with mental health issues will see it, and so we have to make sure to be compassionate while reporting on scandal.\u201d I Love You, Now Die starts on HBO on 9 July with a UK date yet to be confirmed",

Marwan Riach unearthed the six-letter word \u2013 which refers to a genre of sexually explicit or pornographic anime or manga \u2013 from an jumble of nine letters. In the episode which aired on Monday afternoon, Riach and his opponent were presented with the nine-letter mix \u201cTINEYATPH\u201d. His opponent, Tom Silverlock, could only find the five-letter word \u201cpatty\u201d. With 30 seconds to think, Riach sheepishly admitted he found six. \u201cUh, hentai?\u201d he offered. Susie Dent, Dictionary Corner\u2019s resident etymologist, responded: \u201cHentai is brilliant.\u201d Dent defined it as \u201ca subgenre of a Japanese anime or manga\u201d, but did not mention its pornographic nature. The guest Suzi Perry suggested a better word, for seven letters, was \u201cpatient\u201d. Hentai is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as \u201ca subgenre of the Japanese genres of manga and anime, characterised by overtly sexualised characters and sexually explicit images and plots\u201d. It originates from the Japanese words hentai seiyoku sha, which means someone who is perverted, and came into its current use in the 1990s. Screenshots and clips of the episode were shared widely online. Riach ended the round on 50 points, trailing Silverlock\u2019s 60, and went on to lose the episode 84 points to 64. But on Twitter, where screenshots and clips of his choice were shared widely, he was embraced. \u201cBig props to the guy on #Countdown who just (very nervously!) threw out \u2018Hentai\u2019 as a winning word,\u201d said one viewer. Another viewer said he had been unlucky to lose the game in the final round. Riach said: \u201cMy mind just went blank as I knew if I\u2019d won that game, I (probably) would have beaten him.

If such an explosive move were to take place, it would effectively render Darroch persona non grata in Washington and of no use as an interlocutor between the British and American governments.

Alternatively, Darroch may recognise that the doors are shutting in his face and that there is nothing to be gained by staying, which might put strain on the so-called special relationship. The leak has caused outrage among MPs, who circulated theories in parliament that the culprit could be Russian government hackers or another hostile state. Isabel Oakeshott, the journalist who received the leak, is close to a number of pro-Brexit politicians and co-wrote an account of the EU referendum with Arron Banks, the leave-supporting donor, who is under investigation by the National Crime Agency over the sources of funding for the Leave.EU campaign. However, Alan Duncan, a Foreign Office minister, told the Commons it was the government\u2019s belief that the leak made its way to Oakeshott \u201cfrom within\u201d Whitehall, rather than being handed over by foreign agents. He said the Cabinet Office had begun its formal hunt for the mole among current senior politicians, aides and civil servants, but did not at this stage think it was right to involve the police. He said one of the documents was saved from 2017, but three of the memos were produced just eight to 10 days ago, which appeared to point to someone who was still in post. The cross-government inquiry has already begun examining who had access to the recent memos \u2013 which went to potentially hundreds of people \u2013 and a highly sensitive letter from 2017 that had a much narrower circulation list. Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, told MPs he had written to the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, to \u201cask that a criminal investigation also be opened into the leak\u201d. Downing Street is resisting demands that the police get involved and insisted it would call in the Met only if the inquiry found evidence of criminality. A similar investigation into who leaked a National Security Council decision about the Chinese company Huawei led to Gavin Williamson losing his post as defence secretary. In the diplomatic memos, it was suggested \u201cyou need to make your points simple, even blunt\u201d to communicate with Trump. Darroch also gave a scathing assessment of the White House, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept.\u201d He questioned whether the White House \u201cwill ever look competent\u201d. Ned Price, who served under Barack Obama as a special assistant to the president for national security affairs, said Trump\u2019s tweets only reinforced Darroch\u2019s descriptions of him in private. \u201cThe UK ambassador didn\u2019t write anything that wasn\u2019t already patently obvious to an informed observer,\u201d Price said. \u201cHe spoke of Donald Trump as someone with thin skin, as someone with a delicate ego, as someone who would be receptive to pandering, and just look at Trump\u2019s reaction. \u201cHe has proved the ambassador right in every respect \u2014 by proving he is ego driven, by proving he is thin-skinned, and by proving he will quite literally refuse to deal with people who don\u2019t say nice things about him.\u201d",

For 2018 digital and technology winner SH:24, the win helped create more awareness of its work as an online sexual health service, now in 17 regions across England, providing STI home testing kits. The award judges said the service is \u201crevolutionising\u201d the treatment of STIs and creating \u201cgenuine improvements\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/22/public-service-awards-2019-entry-forms\">Entry forms for 2019 Guardian Public Service Awards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Managing director Gillian Holdsworth says the award has had a real impact on expanding the service. \u201cThe publicity the following day in the paper was just amazing and we had so many people phoning us up to say well done,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you ever walk past our office, you\u2019ll find the page about us laminated and stuck in the window.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, South London &amp; Maudsley (Slam) NHS foundation trust, winner of the health and wellbeing award, was able to expand its network as news of the win spread. \u201cImmediately after we won the award we received an email from a wonderful charity in Wales that was interested in working with us,\u201d says consultant clinical psychologist Dr Irene Sclare. \u201cWe\u2019re now looking at ways we could train them. That contact would never have happened had it not been for the Guardian award.\u201d</p> <p>The Slam service covers 1.3 million people across Lambeth, Southwark, Lewisham and Croydon, but the award particularly recognised a commitment to providing innovative, specialist services, such as Sclare\u2019s Discover programme. This day-long interactive workshop for 16- to 19-year-olds in schools uses psychological techniques to improve mental health care among participants.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It really made me remember why we do this</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Irene Sclare</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Sclare herself, winning the award was a dream come true. \u201cOh god we were ecstatic. I think we were crying. We were thrilled and felt very validated,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really made me remember why we do this, and that we must keep trying other ways to develop the programme to reach more young people.\u201d</p> <p> The confidence boost was felt not just by individual team members, but also extended to key stakeholders and clients. \u201cIt made schools feel that there was a quality measure and that made them feel confident in us. They were saying this will confirm to funders that they are putting money into a worthwhile cause.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s all about credibility, agrees Chris Allcock, programme director at Safe Families for Children, care winners at last year\u2019s awards for work to connect struggling families with volunteers who provide help tailored to individual needs and priorities. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly been one of the things that has helped give us credibility with local authorities,\u201d says Allock. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just us saying that what we do has an impact on families \u2013 here\u2019s an award showing that. In the past year we\u2019ve started working with five or six new local authorities, and it\u2019s no doubt because of the credibility we gained from the award.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that many of last year\u2019s winners received much more than an award.

      "bodyText": "One year on from winning in the housing category at the Guardian Public Services Awards 2018, Heart and Home\u2019s award is still proudly displayed in the office for everyone to see. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been a whole year! I don\u2019t want our year to end now,\u201d says Pip Yaxley, multiservice manager for the host scheme. Run by the Benjamin Foundation in Norfolk and Suffolk, the service pairs up young care leavers with hosts who can provide them with safe and supported accommodation as they make the transition to independent living. It matches each young person with a house in their local area, close to their established support networks. Hosts range from single people to couples and families, but the focus is always on finding appropriate and meaningful pairings that can transform lives. \u201cTo be recognised nationally was incredible and it motivated the team,\u201d says Yaxley. \u201cOur hosts who do the amazing work with people in their homes were so proud \u2013 it\u2019s a real credit to them for all the hard work that they put in day after day.\u201d The publicity award winners receive can be a big boost in many ways. For 2018 digital and technology winner SH:24, the win helped create more awareness of its work as an online sexual health service, now in 17 regions across England, providing STI home testing kits. The award judges said the service is \u201crevolutionising\u201d the treatment of STIs and creating \u201cgenuine improvements\u201d. Managing director Gillian Holdsworth says the award has had a real impact on expanding the service. \u201cThe publicity the following day in the paper was just amazing and we had so many people phoning us up to say well done,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you ever walk past our office, you\u2019ll find the page about us laminated and stuck in the window.\u201d Meanwhile, South London &amp; Maudsley (Slam) NHS foundation trust, winner of the health and wellbeing award, was able to expand its network as news of the win spread. \u201cImmediately after we won the award we received an email from a wonderful charity in Wales that was interested in working with us,\u201d says consultant clinical psychologist Dr Irene Sclare. \u201cWe\u2019re now looking at ways we could train them. That contact would never have happened had it not been for the Guardian award.\u201d The Slam service covers 1.3 million people across Lambeth, Southwark, Lewisham and Croydon, but the award particularly recognised a commitment to providing innovative, specialist services, such as Sclare\u2019s Discover programme. This day-long interactive workshop for 16- to 19-year-olds in schools uses psychological techniques to improve mental health care among participants. For Sclare herself, winning the award was a dream come true. \u201cOh god we were ecstatic. I think we were crying. We were thrilled and felt very validated,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really made me remember why we do this, and that we must keep trying other ways to develop the programme to reach more young people.\u201d The confidence boost was felt not just by individual team members, but also extended to key stakeholders and clients. \u201cIt made schools feel that there was a quality measure and that made them feel confident in us. They were saying this will confirm to funders that they are putting money into a worthwhile cause.\u201d It\u2019s all about credibility, agrees Chris Allcock, programme director at Safe Families for Children, care winners at last year\u2019s awards for work to connect struggling families with volunteers who provide help tailored to individual needs and priorities. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly been one of the things that has helped give us credibility with local authorities,\u201d says Allock. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just us saying that what we do has an impact on families \u2013 here\u2019s an award showing that. In the past year we\u2019ve started working with five or six new local authorities, and it\u2019s no doubt because of the credibility we gained from the award.\u201d It\u2019s clear that many of last year\u2019s winners received much more than an award. They\u2019ve also gained extra credibility, publicity and confidence that has helped them to thrive over the past 12 months. For many, the initial excitement has yet to wear off; as Heart and Home\u2019s Yaxley says: \u201cWe\u2019re really still shouting about it.\u201d How to enter Entries are now open for the Guardian Public Service Awards 2019, which will showcase new projects, teams and individuals making a real difference to people\u2019s lives.

Asked about the nearly 14% increase in homelessness between the 2011 and 2016 census surveys, Howarth claimed the increase was \u201cnot ahead of population growth\u201d. \u201cThe population from the last census to the previous one increased by almost 20% and when you look at what we\u2019re seeing \u2026 there is about 116,000 homeless people out of 25 million,\u201d he told ABC Radio National. Australia\u2019s population increased by 8.8% between the 2011 and 2016 census surveys, meaning the rise in the number of homeless people in Australia outstripped population growth. Instead comparing the 2016 census with the 2001 census, he also argued there was \u201cgood news\u201d around a drop in the raw numbers of people rough sleeping from 8,946 to 8,200. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying, and I want your listeners to know, is that Australia, we live in a fantastic country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have 99.5% of our Australians \u2026 homed and living in safe places.

Between the two surveys, there were also increases recorded in four of the six cohorts measured: people temporarily staying in another home (2%), people in boarding houses (17.1%), and people living in \u201cseverely\u201d crowded dwellings (23.5%). In response to Howarth\u2019s comments, the Melbourne City Mission said there was \u201cnothing positive about experiencing or being at risk of homelessness\u201d while Anglicare said there was no way to \u201cput a positive spin\u201d on the housing crisis. The housing peak body National Shelter said Howarth was \u201cout of touch\u201d and that it had been \u201cbombarded with messages aghast that a minister would show such poor taste with so little real knowledge\u201d. Howarth conceded that \u201ccertainly over the census period numbers have increased slightly\u201d but argued the big increases had occurred among those living in overcrowded accommodation. Scott Morrison introduced the homelessness portfolio after the May election. The government has previously been criticised by experts and advocates for failing to tackle the issue. The new minister made the comments ahead of a meeting with the nation\u2019s capital city lord mayors, who have identified a lack of affordable housing as a key driver for the increasing concentration of homelessness in Australia\u2019s capital cities. But Howarth said his priority was emergency accommodation and he planned to ask the mayors about zoning laws that he suggested made it difficult to build shelters. \u201cMy research suggests that we need more emergency accommodation so people that are on the street and find themselves homeless \u2026 how do we get them into accommodation straight away,\u201d he said. The Anglicare Australia acting executive director, Roland Manderson, said emergency accommodation was important but it \u201cwon\u2019t solve the root causes of homelessness\u201d. Manderson said investing in social housing would be the \u201cpowerful first step to tackling homelessness\u201d. Later on Sky News, Howarth suggested community housing and homelessness were \u201cseparate issues\u201d, also putting him at odds with advocates. Asked about his comments on Tuesday morning, Howarth told Guardian Australia: \u201cI have seen the detrimental impact that homelessness can have on every part of a person\u2019s life. \u201cI want to assure you I don\u2019t want to see anyone at risk or experiencing homelessness in this country.\u201d Jason Clare, Labor\u2019s housing spokesman, told Sky News he would not have used the same words as Howarth. \u201cRather than using rhetoric like saying \u2018let\u2019s put a positive spin on homelessness\u2019, let\u2019s do something real about it,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>I\u200as there a more soporific feeling than an animal settling in your lap? The warmth; the weight; the fact you can\u2019t move your body, for fear of disturbing Chairman Miaow, or Pugboat 500 (I don\u2019t know what you call your pets). To my mind, this is the best snooze available. The catnap nonpareil. I think it\u2019s something to do with being lightly incapacitated. For this reason, weighted blankets have always fascinated me.</p> <p>Gravity Blanket (<a href=\"https://gravityblankets.co.uk/product/gravity-blanket/\" title=\"\">\u00a3149, gravityblankets.co.uk</a>) is a handmade, Polish, duvet-like creation that may relieve anxiety, stress and insomnia. They are made to measure, with buyers advised to choose one approximately 10% of their bodyweight. I\u2019m testing a 6kg model and will thank you not to do the maths. As an aside: technically, all blankets are gravity blankets, being subject to the universal constant. We don\u2019t talk about snacking on gravity Quavers, or reading a gravity book, or moving to gravity Canada. (Bad example \u2013 for some reason, Quebec <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11826-satellites-solve-mystery-of-low-gravity-over-canada/\" title=\"\">has less gravity than the rest of the world</a>.) Still, it\u2019s a cool name. The cover is space grey, in velvet and plush. I hold it aloft and wonder: how does it work? Does it have extra gravity sewn in? Is it stitched with golden thread? Then I put it down because my arms hurt.</p> <p>Inside I find a cotton insert, quilted into 104 sealed chambers. Each chamber has very fine grains like uncooked couscous rolling around inside. These are actually glass microbeads. This fluid, equal weight distribution means the blanket does not have heavy sections or a bumpy feel. It feels like a blanket \u2013 a magically dense one. On the website, customers are told they can expect \u201cthe feeling of a gentle, loving embrace\u201d, light pressure over the body being thought to stimulate the production of serotonin.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t they just try being loved?\u201d I chuckle to myself, before remembering I am totally alone and that my job, curling up in a blanket, is also my hobby. Probably best not to think about that.</p> <p>Weighted blankets are sold to the insomnia crowd, but are also often recommended to children with autism, as a means of helping them sleep. The benefits of deep pressure stimulation are contested. Research conducted at <a href=\"http://www.researchautism.net/research-autism-our-research/research-autism-projects-completed/snuggledown-weighted-blankets?print=1\" title=\"\">the Evelina children\u2019s hospital in central London</a> found that heavy blankets do not affect sleep quality, although they may have a soothing effect while a child is awake. The autistic campaigner Temple Grandin invented the hug box to combat sensory processing disorder. She also invented a restraining system to keep cattle calm before being stunned. Best not to think about that, either.</p> <p>For my less pressing needs, it offered great relief. The blanket settled me at night, helping me feel less restless. My breathing slowed and I was yawning almost instantly. Lying under the blanket is deeply comforting, although it is hard to describe why \u2013 something to do with abdicating responsibility for your body. It\u2019s a safe feeling, relaxing on the muscles and joints. Six kilograms doesn\u2019t sound like much, until you try to reposition, or pick the blanket up off the floor. It\u2019s a workout, like lifting small buckets of water in each hand. Who knows what the 12kg end of the range would feel like. Punching through a wall of honey, probably.</p> <p>One issue: the blanket is hot. (I\u2019ve been testing mine for a few months, since before the sun showed up.) The velvet is incredibly soft and dense, like being smothered by a super-chinchilla. If you\u2019re not careful, leg sweat can enter the equation. On the other hand, I do have hot legs. Always have done. With a window open, the temperature regulated itself, and the company sells cotton covers better suited for summer. However, like the gravity blanket itself, these do not come cheap.</p> <p>Not everyone will respond in the same way to the product \u2013 you know your own legs \u2013 so it\u2019s hard to make a blanket judgment. Which obviously makes my job awkward. But if you\u2019re looking for an extra-soft hug, some incredibly mild BDSM, or just the thrill of undercover couscous, there\u2019s much here to love. I\u2019m lightly depressed, and highly impressed.</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t think about it part 3</strong></h2> <p>I am now obsessing over the possibility of more weight and whether I need a heavier blanket, searching \u201cCarthaginian crushing\u201d and wondering how a few rocks on the chest might feel. This is not healthy. In fact, it\u2019s keeping me up at night.</p> <h2><strong>Wellness or hellness?</strong></h2> <p>Some Like It Hot.<strong> 5/5</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "I\u200as there a more soporific feeling than an animal settling in your lap? The warmth; the weight; the fact you can\u2019t move your body, for fear of disturbing Chairman Miaow, or Pugboat 500 (I don\u2019t know what you call your pets). To my mind, this is the best snooze available. The catnap nonpareil. I think it\u2019s something to do with being lightly incapacitated. For this reason, weighted blankets have always fascinated me. Gravity Blanket (\u00a3149, gravityblankets.co.uk) is a handmade, Polish, duvet-like creation that may relieve anxiety, stress and insomnia. They are made to measure, with buyers advised to choose one approximately 10% of their bodyweight. I\u2019m testing a 6kg model and will thank you not to do the maths. As an aside: technically, all blankets are gravity blankets, being subject to the universal constant. We don\u2019t talk about snacking on gravity Quavers, or reading a gravity book, or moving to gravity Canada. (Bad example \u2013 for some reason, Quebec has less gravity than the rest of the world.) Still, it\u2019s a cool name. The cover is space grey, in velvet and plush. I hold it aloft and wonder: how does it work? Does it have extra gravity sewn in? Is it stitched with golden thread? Then I put it down because my arms hurt. Inside I find a cotton insert, quilted into 104 sealed chambers. Each chamber has very fine grains like uncooked couscous rolling around inside. These are actually glass microbeads. This fluid, equal weight distribution means the blanket does not have heavy sections or a bumpy feel. It feels like a blanket \u2013 a magically dense one. On the website, customers are told they can expect \u201cthe feeling of a gentle, loving embrace\u201d, light pressure over the body being thought to stimulate the production of serotonin. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they just try being loved?\u201d I chuckle to myself, before remembering I am totally alone and that my job, curling up in a blanket, is also my hobby. Probably best not to think about that. Weighted blankets are sold to the insomnia crowd, but are also often recommended to children with autism, as a means of helping them sleep. The benefits of deep pressure stimulation are contested. Research conducted at the Evelina children\u2019s hospital in central London found that heavy blankets do not affect sleep quality, although they may have a soothing effect while a child is awake. The autistic campaigner Temple Grandin invented the hug box to combat sensory processing disorder. She also invented a restraining system to keep cattle calm before being stunned. Best not to think about that, either. For my less pressing needs, it offered great relief. The blanket settled me at night, helping me feel less restless. My breathing slowed and I was yawning almost instantly. Lying under the blanket is deeply comforting, although it is hard to describe why \u2013 something to do with abdicating responsibility for your body. It\u2019s a safe feeling, relaxing on the muscles and joints. Six kilograms doesn\u2019t sound like much, until you try to reposition, or pick the blanket up off the floor. It\u2019s a workout, like lifting small buckets of water in each hand. Who knows what the 12kg end of the range would feel like. Punching through a wall of honey, probably. One issue: the blanket is hot. (I\u2019ve been testing mine for a few months, since before the sun showed up.) The velvet is incredibly soft and dense, like being smothered by a super-chinchilla. If you\u2019re not careful, leg sweat can enter the equation. On the other hand, I do have hot legs. Always have done. With a window open, the temperature regulated itself, and the company sells cotton covers better suited for summer. However, like the gravity blanket itself, these do not come cheap. Not everyone will respond in the same way to the product \u2013 you know your own legs \u2013 so it\u2019s hard to make a blanket judgment. Which obviously makes my job awkward. But if you\u2019re looking for an extra-soft hug, some incredibly mild BDSM, or just the thrill of undercover couscous, there\u2019s much here to love. I\u2019m lightly depressed, and highly impressed. Don\u2019t think about it part 3 I am now obsessing over the possibility of more weight and whether I need a heavier blanket, searching \u201cCarthaginian crushing\u201d and wondering how a few rocks on the chest might feel. This is not healthy. In fact, it\u2019s keeping me up at night. Wellness or hellness? Some Like It Hot. 5/5",

She thinks employers take advantage of people like her. \u201cOne intern ended up doing maintenance round the office, like changing light bulbs,\u201d she says.</p> <p><strong>Apprenticeships are </strong><strong>low-level</strong><strong><br></strong>People often think apprenticeships are just for specific trades, such as construction, or that they are in some way not academic. This isn\u2019t true. They cover a range of sectors and levels. Over the past decade, they have become an alternative to academic education and there are now apprenticeship routes into becoming a solicitor, an accountant, an engineer, or business manager.</p> <p>According to Stephen Isherwood from the Institute of Student Employers, many high-profile companies now recruit apprentices. \u201cApprenticeships offer the opportunity to gain a degree-level qualification whilst working and not incurring student debt,\u201d he says.</p> <p>You can also ended up being the boss. \u201cA large number of business leaders in the sector are former apprentices themselves\u201d, says David Fagan from Make UK, who points out that the average pay for a craft apprentice is \u00a311,000, rising to \u00a320,000 in the fourth year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2019/jul/09/despite-the-challenges-of-job-insecurity-there-are-things-for-young-people-to-feel-hopeful-about\">Despite the challenges of job insecurity, there are things  for young people to feel hopeful about</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Apprentices miss out on the uni experience<br></strong>True, as an apprentice you\u2019ll enter the world of work earlier than your uni mates. You\u2019ll also be trained very specifically within a sector, so you need to be dedicated to that from the offset. But this doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be part of a shared experience. Most organisations take on more than one apprentice, so you will usually have a network of similar aged colleagues.</p> <p>Corey Bueno-Ballantyne, a mechanical engineering apprentice from Telford, says a big part of going to uni is making friends and you get that from apprenticeships. \u201cWe\u2019re together every day, we go out for drinks,\u201d he says. \u201cWe spent our first and second years living together in a hotel.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Grad schemes are for recent grads<br></strong>Getting hired is competitive.

A common misconception is if you don\u2019t get one straight away, you\u2019ve missed out. Plenty of people apply for consecutive years, do a post-university gap year, or even work in a different sector before starting a grad scheme.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s likely you\u2019ll start your grad scheme with lots of young people who have just graduated, but you don\u2019t have to be fresh out of uni to do one,\u201d says Becky Kells, editor of AllAboutSchoolLeavers.</p> <p>*<em>Name changed for confidentiality</em></p>",

Unfortunately, many companies still offer them unpaid or run them under the guise of volunteer work. \u201cIn the arts, there is this genuine belief that you are lucky to have one because 100 other people have applied,\u201d says Millie Jones*, 21, who did a four-month unpaid internship for a film festival. \u201cYou can end up doing 16 hour days. I felt I couldn\u2019t say no or put my foot down because I didn\u2019t want to lose the contact.\u201d Jones, who was not paid expenses, funded herself with a childcare job at the weekends and evenings. She thinks employers take advantage of people like her. \u201cOne intern ended up doing maintenance round the office, like changing light bulbs,\u201d she says. Apprenticeships are low-level People often think apprenticeships are just for specific trades, such as construction, or that they are in some way not academic. This isn\u2019t true. They cover a range of sectors and levels. Over the past decade, they have become an alternative to academic education and there are now apprenticeship routes into becoming a solicitor, an accountant, an engineer, or business manager. According to Stephen Isherwood from the Institute of Student Employers, many high-profile companies now recruit apprentices. \u201cApprenticeships offer the opportunity to gain a degree-level qualification whilst working and not incurring student debt,\u201d he says. You can also ended up being the boss. \u201cA large number of business leaders in the sector are former apprentices themselves\u201d, says David Fagan from Make UK, who points out that the average pay for a craft apprentice is \u00a311,000, rising to \u00a320,000 in the fourth year. Apprentices miss out on the uni experience True, as an apprentice you\u2019ll enter the world of work earlier than your uni mates. You\u2019ll also be trained very specifically within a sector, so you need to be dedicated to that from the offset. But this doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be part of a shared experience. Most organisations take on more than one apprentice, so you will usually have a network of similar aged colleagues. Corey Bueno-Ballantyne, a mechanical engineering apprentice from Telford, says a big part of going to uni is making friends and you get that from apprenticeships. \u201cWe\u2019re together every day, we go out for drinks,\u201d he says. \u201cWe spent our first and second years living together in a hotel.\u201d Grad schemes are for recent grads Getting hired is competitive. According to the Institute of Student Employers there are 41 applications for every graduate vacancy. A common misconception is if you don\u2019t get one straight away, you\u2019ve missed out. Plenty of people apply for consecutive years, do a post-university gap year, or even work in a different sector before starting a grad scheme. \u201cIt\u2019s likely you\u2019ll start your grad scheme with lots of young people who have just graduated, but you don\u2019t have to be fresh out of uni to do one,\u201d says Becky Kells, editor of AllAboutSchoolLeavers. *Name changed for confidentiality",

And you can catch our monthly Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here. For daily updates, follow the indefatigable Andrew Sparrow and the politics live blog. Top stories Last week started with the Brexit party\u2019s MEPs turning their backs in the European parliament and ended with the leak of emails from the British ambassador in the US referring to \u201cvicious infighting and chaos\u201d within the Trump administration. Kim Darroch\u2019s memos were leaked to a pro-Brexit journalist at the Mail on Sunday, and there was speculation that the motive might have been to exact revenge for what Brexiters see as a failure to promote a pro-Brexit Britain in Washington. There were also suggestions that the leak would stop the new PM from appointing a pro-EU ambassador when Darroch leaves by the end of the year. Nigel Farage said Darroch was \u201ctotally unsuitable to remain as our man in the US\u201d. Farage\u2019s Brexit party colleague Ann Widdecombe used her maiden speech as an MEP to liken Brexit to the emancipation of slaves. Elsewhere, the perils of no deal remain the focus of many, and there have been a series of warnings from former civil servants. Philip Rycroft, the former permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the EU, said the public should be worried about no deal, while a former official in charge of delivering a frictionless border in Ireland and Dover said that just because planning for the worst-possible scenario was good, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean everything will be fine\u201d. The Police Service of Northern Ireland\u2019s Brexit chief, Tim Mairs, went on record to tell the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme that no deal would be a recruitment opportunity for the New IRA. What about the Tory leadership campaign? Boris Johnson, who has pledged that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d, is stretching his lead over his rival, Jeremy Hunt, two polls over the weekend suggest. His biggest problem remains the parliamentary arithmetic on Brexit. On Monday the Tory backbencher Dominic Grieve launched another attempt to block no-deal with an amendment to the Northern Ireland bill, claiming he would get \u201c30-plus\u201d Tories onside. According to the Sunday Times, Johnson has considered offering the people of Northern Ireland their own referendum on whether the region should stay in the customs union. Such as poll would not warm the hearts of the Democratic Unionist party and is therefore unlikely to be a runner. What else? The Labour MP Kate Hoey, who has enraged many of the party\u2019s supporters in her London constituency with her support for a hard Brexit, is standing down at the next election. Jaguar Land Rover, which has previously issued warnings about the future of the UK car industry after a no-deal Brexit, had some good news for workers, announcing it would invest billions in producing new electric vehicles in Britain. The European commission settled on its nominees to take over from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk: the little-tipped German defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, and the former Belgian prime minister Charles Michel. Labour splits over Brexit continue with Tom Watson urging grassroots members to sign up to a public declaration calling for Labour to be \u201cthe party of remain\u201d, as a YouGov poll puts its ratings at 18%, its joint lowest ever ranking. Other news Boris Johnson is considering establishing six \u201cSingapore-style\u201d tax-free economic zones and says it could be a good idea for Belfast. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, rejects claims he has been urging Jeremy Corbyn to sack his two most senior aides over their stances on Brexit. Threat of no deal causes sharpest drop in investment since financial crash. Top comment The psephologist Peter Kellner says polling shows an autumn election would offer a huge advantage for Johnson: There is one big downside for Johnson in delaying an election. Labour might acquire a new leader. Its current support \u2013 even taking Ipsos Mori\u2019s 24% rather than YouGov\u2019s calamitous 18% \u2013 is simply awful for an opposition party facing a government whose record is less than glorious Farewell tweet for Hoey While there are many who dislike her politics on Brexit, her decision to stand down brought gratitude from local councillors who praised her \u201ctireless\u201d work in her constituency:",

There must be significant investment in cycling infrastructure to develop dense, continuous networks of cycle paths that are physically separated from traffic, including building cycling and pedestrian bridges or tunnels. Cycling should be for the many, not the brave. People must also be encouraged and given the confidence to cycle, so there should be training and support for all who need it, including affordable access to bikes for all. Support for e-bikes could be vital for encouraging older people to change their travel habits. Cycling and walking ought to be a priority at every level of government, meaning an end to developments planned around car use to the exclusion of sustainable transport, and the DfT must understand the strategic importance of cycling in driving down emissions. We know that roadbuilding begets traffic, which in turn begets emissions. The government\u2019s colossal roadbuilding programme is environmentally unsustainable and will drive traffic growth and worsen congestion, failing even on its own terms. This is one of the rarely mentioned but most serious failings of our blundering transport secretary. In Tuesday\u2019s debate, MPs should accept nothing less than a radical change in transport policy. Labour understands that cycling and walking are an essential part of our plan to save the climate, and the next Labour government will give them the backing to play that role. \u2022 Andy McDonald is shadow transport secretary and MP for Middlesbrough",

At the time, the Farrelly brothers hits Kingpin and There\u2019s Something About Mary were sparking a can-you-top-this cycle of R-rated comedies that carried into the early 2000s, with titles now either forgotten (Say It Ain\u2019t So, Slackers, Waiting \u2026) or not worth remembering (Scary Movie, National Lampoon\u2019s Van Wilder).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d3128bf2db6fc78a3f596db1dabb4d612bb2db6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d3128bf2db6fc78a3f596db1dabb4d612bb2db6/0_0_3224_2114/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Biggs, Eddie Kaye Thomas and Thomas Ian Nicholas in American Pie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jason Biggs, Eddie Kaye Thomas and Thomas Ian Nicholas in American Pie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Critics were divided on American Pie\u2019s contributions to the trend \u2013 the infamous pie, the semen in a beer cup, the mochaccino spiked with laxatives \u2013 but they were by no means the lowest of the low.

The film also worked in the post-Animal House tradition of boys behaving badly, specifically Porky\u2019s, which was also about nerdy high school students who make a pact to lose their virginity. The webcam in American Pie was merely a tech update on the locker-room peephole that Porky\u2019s plastered on its poster, and both films were fully prepared to deliver the voyeuristic kick they promised.

Much of it has to do with the casting, which brought together several stars (or near stars) of tomorrow before they were recognizable faces. Eugene Levy and Jennifer Coolidge were the only established comic talents \u2013 Levy, out of some mercenary sense of obligation, would be the only star to appear in all eight American Pie movies \u2013 and Alyson Hannigan had completed a couple seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, Natasha Lyonne, Seann William Scott and Shannon Elizabeth were mostly unknown, and John Cho, who comments briefly on Coolidge\u2019s Milf-y appeals, was still five years away from the first Harold &amp; Kumar film.</p> <p>Directors Paul and Chris Weitz, working from a script by Adam Herz, give American Pie a democratic quality that allows all these young actors a chance to set themselves apart, though the boys naturally get more opportunities than the girls. Biggs, Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas and Eddie Kaye Thomas play the four virgins on the prowl, and they all eventually get what they want, but not before the universe punishes them for their efforts. Hannigan, Suvari, Reid and Coolidge are, respectively, the partners who generously escort them into manhood, half by their own sexual aggression (Coolidge as a Mrs Robinson type, Hannigan as a dorky flutist who had an awakening \u201cthis one time, at band camp\u201d) and the other half by romantic coercion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6969b91dd100217386fe151c1d5df4ff4effc7e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6969b91dd100217386fe151c1d5df4ff4effc7e1/0_0_2848_1883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Natasha Lyonne and Tara Reid in American Pie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natasha Lyonne and Tara Reid in American Pie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zink/Universal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Jim Levenstein, Biggs constantly hurls himself into a buzzsaw of sexual mortification, which the film shrewdly casts as at once identifiable and wildly over-the-top. It\u2019s common for teenage boys to squint at softcore porn through the bars on premium cable channels or to get caught masturbating by a parent or to fumble out of inexperience or overexcitement. But it\u2019s uncommon to have Mom squeal at a boner in a sweatsock or Dad come home to the pie wreckage or the entire school witness a striptease act, followed by two straight instances of premature ejaculation. Through all the cringing, there\u2019s the comfort that many have had experiences <em>like</em> Jim\u2019s, but nothing so epically hapless and clumsy, and no heart-to-hearts with Dad afterwards to heighten the agony.</p> <p>American Pie emphasizes the camaraderie of the group and the harmless good nature of its members, who maybe aren\u2019t in the category of regrettable lovers, after all. But it gives so little thought to the opposite sex, who are either brazenly lusty or careful gatekeepers of their own chastity, waiting for an \u201cI love you\u201d or some other show of sensitivity, like a password at a speakeasy. Women seem as inexplicable to the film-makers themselves as they are to the characters. That\u2019s been an unfortunate part of the continuum of teen sex comedies, too, long before American Pie and well past it.</p> <p>There\u2019s a moment in the film that deals with the fallout from Jim\u2019s webcam encounter with Nadia (Elizabeth), the foreign exchange student. Jim\u2019s classmates are all pointing and laughing, of course, at his goofy striptease and sexual ineptitude, but Nadia has been disappeared from the scene, hastily booted back to Slovakia. She\u2019ll appear again at the end, happily taking in more dancing via webcam, but the film is never conscious of how she might actually feel. For Jim, their bedroom rendezvous was another in a series of screw-ups to get over; for Nadia, it meant immediate exile to the hinterlands of eastern Europe. American Pie may not be about her, but in a film about young men going through emotional and sexual rites of passage, she\u2019s just another bump in the road.</p>",

Biggs, Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas and Eddie Kaye Thomas play the four virgins on the prowl, and they all eventually get what they want, but not before the universe punishes them for their efforts. Hannigan, Suvari, Reid and Coolidge are, respectively, the partners who generously escort them into manhood, half by their own sexual aggression (Coolidge as a Mrs Robinson type, Hannigan as a dorky flutist who had an awakening \u201cthis one time, at band camp\u201d) and the other half by romantic coercion. As Jim Levenstein, Biggs constantly hurls himself into a buzzsaw of sexual mortification, which the film shrewdly casts as at once identifiable and wildly over-the-top. It\u2019s common for teenage boys to squint at softcore porn through the bars on premium cable channels or to get caught masturbating by a parent or to fumble out of inexperience or overexcitement. But it\u2019s uncommon to have Mom squeal at a boner in a sweatsock or Dad come home to the pie wreckage or the entire school witness a striptease act, followed by two straight instances of premature ejaculation. Through all the cringing, there\u2019s the comfort that many have had experiences like Jim\u2019s, but nothing so epically hapless and clumsy, and no heart-to-hearts with Dad afterwards to heighten the agony. American Pie emphasizes the camaraderie of the group and the harmless good nature of its members, who maybe aren\u2019t in the category of regrettable lovers, after all. But it gives so little thought to the opposite sex, who are either brazenly lusty or careful gatekeepers of their own chastity, waiting for an \u201cI love you\u201d or some other show of sensitivity, like a password at a speakeasy. Women seem as inexplicable to the film-makers themselves as they are to the characters. That\u2019s been an unfortunate part of the continuum of teen sex comedies, too, long before American Pie and well past it. There\u2019s a moment in the film that deals with the fallout from Jim\u2019s webcam encounter with Nadia (Elizabeth), the foreign exchange student. Jim\u2019s classmates are all pointing and laughing, of course, at his goofy striptease and sexual ineptitude, but Nadia has been disappeared from the scene, hastily booted back to Slovakia. She\u2019ll appear again at the end, happily taking in more dancing via webcam, but the film is never conscious of how she might actually feel. For Jim, their bedroom rendezvous was another in a series of screw-ups to get over; for Nadia, it meant immediate exile to the hinterlands of eastern Europe. American Pie may not be about her, but in a film about young men going through emotional and sexual rites of passage, she\u2019s just another bump in the road.",

Its heavy industries have been impacting water quality for years. However, since the revolution of 2011, conversation over the environmental impact of its industrial legacy has at least become possible, even if the kind of reversals activists are calling for remain some way off.</p> <p>Officially <a href=\"https://global-recycling.info/archives/1465\">around a quarter</a> of Tunisia\u2019s waste water is recycled, intended, among other things, to irrigate the country\u2019s farmlands.

According to environmental regulations, industrial waste water should initially be treated at source, before being transferred for further treatment. However, campaigners question how rigorously this is being enforced.</p> <p>There are three hulking water treatment plants servicing the population around the Gulf of Tunis, at Raoued, to the north-west of the Gulf, Rades, near La Goulette on the western side and Souliman, at the gulf\u2019s industrialised southern reaches.</p> <p>All are operated by <a href=\"http://www.onas.nat.tn/Fr/index.php?code=3\">Onas</a> (L\u2019Office National de l\u2019Assainissement), a <a href=\"http://www.environnement.gov.tn/index.php?id=203#.XPUywdRKjIU\">subdivision</a> of the ministry of the environment and sustainable development and, according to activists, heavily subsidised by loans from international bodies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/jul/02/life-in-the-fastest-warming-place-on-earth-podcast\">Life in the fastest warming place on earth - podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Morched Garbouj, president of the environmental pressure group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Sos-Biaa-166656993878189/\">SOS BIAA</a>, tells the Guardian. \u201cWe tested the water going into these treatment plants and we tested it going out and, I can tell you, there\u2019s very little difference.\u201d</p> <p>Across Tunisia, industrial and domestic waste water is channelled from broad areas to large treatment plants. Within the Gulf, the outcomes are clear. \u201cWe tested both input and output flows between 2016 and 2017 and the results were consistent,\u201d Garbouj, an environmental engineer, says. \u201cWe found increased levels of nitrates, manganese particles, phosphate plus faecal coliforms and streptococci \u2013 both present within human waste \u2013 among other matters. All of these are harmful to health.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has disputed these findings, but they haven\u2019t shared their methodology with us, so it\u2019s hard to say how credible those denials are.</p> <p>\u201cWaste water treatment in Tunisia is entirely centralised. Everything goes through Onas, including the development loans from, say, the World Bank, the EU and the German Development Bank. We\u2019ve taken our findings to them. They\u2019re aware of what\u2019s happening. They know it\u2019s not working. They\u2019re just not interested.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems no one really cares how well the treatment plants are performing. Onas, which runs the plants, is a subdivision of the ministry of the environment and, you know who\u2019s responsible for testing their effectiveness? The ministry of the environment,\u201d Garbouj says.</p> <p>Wafa Hmadi, a programme coordinator with the environmental group <a href=\"https://www.raj-tunisie.org/accueil/\">RAJ Tunisie</a> is equally damning, \u201cIt isn\u2019t just the Gulf of Tunis,\u201d she tells the Guardian.

Some areas are just totally dead.</p> <p>\u201cThere really is hardly any monitoring. Industrial polluters can expel their waste largely untreated, as there are no inspections and no one is holding them accountable,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Little of this is news for Lobna and Samir. They and their families have been living with the outcome of rising water pollution for years. However, in a country struggling with ingrained unemployment and desperate to fight back against an ever increasing cost of living, both are equally aware of the desperate need for industry and jobs.</p> <p>However, for a city built by the sea, change comes slowly. Outside the cafe, along the sun-drenched shoreline, children swim in the the cloudy waters, or dive off the walls of La Goulette\u2019s ancient canals as they have done for years.</p> <p>\u201cPeople come here.

However, since the revolution of 2011, conversation over the environmental impact of its industrial legacy has at least become possible, even if the kind of reversals activists are calling for remain some way off. Officially around a quarter of Tunisia\u2019s waste water is recycled, intended, among other things, to irrigate the country\u2019s farmlands. The rest (around 247m cubic metres a year), is expelled from the country\u2019s treatment plants directly into the sea and inland waterways. According to environmental regulations, industrial waste water should initially be treated at source, before being transferred for further treatment. However, campaigners question how rigorously this is being enforced. There are three hulking water treatment plants servicing the population around the Gulf of Tunis, at Raoued, to the north-west of the Gulf, Rades, near La Goulette on the western side and Souliman, at the gulf\u2019s industrialised southern reaches. All are operated by Onas (L\u2019Office National de l\u2019Assainissement), a subdivision of the ministry of the environment and sustainable development and, according to activists, heavily subsidised by loans from international bodies. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Morched Garbouj, president of the environmental pressure group SOS BIAA, tells the Guardian. \u201cWe tested the water going into these treatment plants and we tested it going out and, I can tell you, there\u2019s very little difference.\u201d Across Tunisia, industrial and domestic waste water is channelled from broad areas to large treatment plants. Within the Gulf, the outcomes are clear. \u201cWe tested both input and output flows between 2016 and 2017 and the results were consistent,\u201d Garbouj, an environmental engineer, says. \u201cWe found increased levels of nitrates, manganese particles, phosphate plus faecal coliforms and streptococci \u2013 both present within human waste \u2013 among other matters. All of these are harmful to health. \u201cThe government has disputed these findings, but they haven\u2019t shared their methodology with us, so it\u2019s hard to say how credible those denials are. \u201cWaste water treatment in Tunisia is entirely centralised. Everything goes through Onas, including the development loans from, say, the World Bank, the EU and the German Development Bank. We\u2019ve taken our findings to them. They\u2019re aware of what\u2019s happening. They know it\u2019s not working. They\u2019re just not interested. \u201cIt seems no one really cares how well the treatment plants are performing. Onas, which runs the plants, is a subdivision of the ministry of the environment and, you know who\u2019s responsible for testing their effectiveness? The ministry of the environment,\u201d Garbouj says. Wafa Hmadi, a programme coordinator with the environmental group RAJ Tunisie is equally damning, \u201cIt isn\u2019t just the Gulf of Tunis,\u201d she tells the Guardian. She says that around the industrial town of Sfax, and Gabes \u2013 near the phosphate mining basin of Gafsa \u2013 whole stretches of coastline were \u201cunusable\u201d. \u201cMany of Tunisia\u2019s inland waterways are also affected by heavy industry, such as paper manufacturing. Pollutants from industry find their way out into the local environment, impacting local populations, before heading out to the sea. Fish, particularly larger fish, are dying. Some areas are just totally dead. \u201cThere really is hardly any monitoring. Industrial polluters can expel their waste largely untreated, as there are no inspections and no one is holding them accountable,\u201d she says. Little of this is news for Lobna and Samir. They and their families have been living with the outcome of rising water pollution for years. However, in a country struggling with ingrained unemployment and desperate to fight back against an ever increasing cost of living, both are equally aware of the desperate need for industry and jobs. However, for a city built by the sea, change comes slowly. Outside the cafe, along the sun-drenched shoreline, children swim in the the cloudy waters, or dive off the walls of La Goulette\u2019s ancient canals as they have done for years. \u201cPeople come here. They always will,\u201d says Lobna. The Tunisian ministry of the environment has not responded to requests for comment.",

A few months into her employment she was promoted to supervisor , making about $25 an hour.

They later struggled to pay for diapers and other essentials for their newborn.</p> <p>A Tesla spokesperson said Beccera\u2019s termination was due to performance issues.</p> <p>Over the past few years, Tesla has faced numerous <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-lawsuit-claims-discrimination-harassment-inflated-solarcity-sales-2018-7\">lawsuits</a>, National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) charges and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/28/tesla-female-engineer-lawsuit-harassment-discrimination\">allegations</a> that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/10/tesla-workers-union-elon-musk\">included</a> unfair firings, union busting, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/19/tesla-factory-workers-discrimination-claim-race-lgbt-elon-musk\">work atmosphere</a> that enabled<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/business/tesla-factory-racism.html\"> racial discrimination</a> and sexual harassment. In March, an NLRB settlement mandated Tesla post flyers that affirmed workers\u2019 rights to organize at their Fremont, California plant. A few months later, workers at Tesla\u2019s Buffalo, New York plant <a href=\"https://buffalonews.com/2019/06/24/tesla-accused-of-firing-pro-union-workers/\">filed federal labor charges</a> accusing Tesla of firing workers for union organizing.</p> <p>Now a Guardian investigation has revealed numerous cases where former workers claim they were unfairly fired and current workers allege threats of termination and disciplinary action for taking sick days.</p> <p>Jennifer Peercy worked at Tesla as a customer care agent in Las Vegas, Nevada, since August 2018. A mother of four and more than five months into her pregnancy, her colleagues offered her their own time off to help with childcare. But Tesla management told her the time wasn\u2019t transferable between employees. She stopped taking it, but was fired two weeks later for doing so.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m 22 weeks pregnant without a job or income and four girls to care for.</p> <footer> <cite>Jennifer Peercy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf I knew that, I never would have taken it,\u201d Peercy said. \u201cI\u2019m 22 weeks pregnant without a job or income and four girls to care for.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s currently applying for unemployment and looking for jobs while still hoping to return to Tesla . Peercy provided the Guardian with her termination letter and an email she sent the chief executive officer, Elon Musk, which resulted in another follow-up from an HR staffer who reaffirmed her termination.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we\u2019re sympathetic to her personal situation and work hard to do the right thing by our employees, using another employee\u2019s personal information to obtain their benefits \u2013 with or without their permission \u2013 violates the benefit policy, jeopardizes employee\u2019s access to those benefits and is not appropriate behavior we can support,\u201d said a Tesla spokesperson.</p> <p>Maggie Aranda worked at Tesla\u2019s Fremont plant for 19 months before she was fired on 11 June.</p> <p>\u201cI had permission from my supervisor to use my phone to help my husband and myself.

      "bodyText": "In February 2018, Devon Beccera started working at the Tesla Giga factory in Sparks, Nevada. A few months into her employment she was promoted to supervisor , making about $25 an hour. She found out in July that year that she was pregnant, and informed management she planned on taking maternity leave in February, 2019, once she became eligible. Instead, on 14 December 2018, Beccera was fired. \u201cNevada is a right-to-work state, so they didn\u2019t need any sort of reason for firing me, but it was very convenient to fire me two weeks before Christmas, and about 50 days before my maternity leave started,\u201d she said. It meant that 28 weeks into her pregnancy, Beccera lost her medical insurance and only source of income, as her husband was a stay-at-home dad. They later struggled to pay for diapers and other essentials for their newborn. A Tesla spokesperson said Beccera\u2019s termination was due to performance issues. Over the past few years, Tesla has faced numerous lawsuits, National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) charges and allegations that have included unfair firings, union busting, and a work atmosphere that enabled racial discrimination and sexual harassment. In March, an NLRB settlement mandated Tesla post flyers that affirmed workers\u2019 rights to organize at their Fremont, California plant. A few months later, workers at Tesla\u2019s Buffalo, New York plant filed federal labor charges accusing Tesla of firing workers for union organizing. Now a Guardian investigation has revealed numerous cases where former workers claim they were unfairly fired and current workers allege threats of termination and disciplinary action for taking sick days. Jennifer Peercy worked at Tesla as a customer care agent in Las Vegas, Nevada, since August 2018. A mother of four and more than five months into her pregnancy, her colleagues offered her their own time off to help with childcare. But Tesla management told her the time wasn\u2019t transferable between employees. She stopped taking it, but was fired two weeks later for doing so. \u201cIf I knew that, I never would have taken it,\u201d Peercy said. \u201cI\u2019m 22 weeks pregnant without a job or income and four girls to care for.\u201d She\u2019s currently applying for unemployment and looking for jobs while still hoping to return to Tesla . Peercy provided the Guardian with her termination letter and an email she sent the chief executive officer, Elon Musk, which resulted in another follow-up from an HR staffer who reaffirmed her termination. \u201cWhile we\u2019re sympathetic to her personal situation and work hard to do the right thing by our employees, using another employee\u2019s personal information to obtain their benefits \u2013 with or without their permission \u2013 violates the benefit policy, jeopardizes employee\u2019s access to those benefits and is not appropriate behavior we can support,\u201d said a Tesla spokesperson. Maggie Aranda worked at Tesla\u2019s Fremont plant for 19 months before she was fired on 11 June. \u201cI had permission from my supervisor to use my phone to help my husband and myself. My husband was very sick at that time. My supervisor then told me two hours into a shift to clock out and go home. They did an \u2018investigation\u2019 and then fired me for cellphone usage,\u201d Aranda said. She noted her husband, Carlos Aranda, who also worked at Tesla but had been on medical leave, submitted a letter of resignation from Tesla on 24 June but received a response from Tesla human resources that he, too, was involuntarily terminated on 26 June. Aranda said they are now currently homeless due to losing their jobs, still suffering from injuries sustained on the job, and are trying to raise money via GoFundMe to help get back on their feet. \u201cWith only me working we got behind,\u201d Aranda added. \u201cThe landlord worked with us for a while but it got to be too much and when I lost my job we had nothing, so we had to leave.\u201d A Tesla spokesperson claimed Maggie Aranda\u2019s termination was due to cellphone usage at work, and Carlos Aranda was terminated over a tweet that violated Tesla standards. At Tesla\u2019s Fremont plant, several current workers claimed the company uses a point-system attendance policy and uses it to deter workers from taking sick days and prevent workers from promotions. \u201cI didn\u2019t get leveled up even after two years of being a team lead because I had a couple of days where I was two minutes late to clock in because the parking lot was so hard to find spots,\u201d said one Tesla worker who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. The worker noted they had been threatened with termination after a supervisor asked them to work one Saturday, and the worker agreed if they could leave early to cash their check to pay rent. \u201cHe said \u2018yes\u2019, and then wrote me up as an early-out, which they consider to be just like a late or call-in,\u201d the worker said. The next week the worker claimed they were suspended for a day without pay, and threatened with termination for absence infractions. \u201cTwo separate times I got points on my record for being out sick,\u201d said another Tesla worker. \u201cIn my new department, we get points on our record for being out sick because they consider it an unplanned day off.\u201d The Guardian obtained a copy of Tesla\u2019s attendance policy, which was revised on 23 June.

According to a lawsuit filed in New York by the married couple \u2013 referred to only as AP and YZ to \u201cminimise the embarrassment and humiliation already caused\u201d \u2013 they sought the services of CHA Fertility in Los Angeles last year after years of trying to conceive without success. When, in September 2018, the couple, from Flushing, New York, were told that they were expecting twin girls, they were \u201cecstatic\u201d, according to the lawsuit. But, it states, the couple were \u201cconfused\u201d when at their three and five-month sonograms they were told they were, in fact, carrying two boys. The lawsuit claims: \u201cPlaintiffs called [clinic owners] Defendant [Joshua] Berger and Defendant [Simon] Hong to discuss the sonogram results. Defendant Hong and Defendant Berger advised Plaintiffs that the sonogram results were not accurate and that it was not a definitive test.\u201d It adds: \u201cDefendant Berger and Defendant Hong assured Plaintiffs that they were having girls and that nothing was wrong.\u201d But after the birth, it says, they were \u201cshocked\u201d to discover the two boys did not appear to be related to them. It reads: \u201cOn March 31, 2019, Plaintiff AP gave birth via caesarean section to two male babies, neither of which was of Asian descent.\u201d The lawsuit states that representatives of the defendants went to New York to meet the couple in hospital. The couple agreed for themselves and their babies to undergo DNA tests, which confirmed that they were not genetically related to the children and that the two boys were not related to each other. They then had to \u201crelinquish custody\u201d of the children. \u201cSubsequently, the testing revealed that Baby A was genetically matched to Couple A and Baby B was genetically matched to Couple B\u2026As a result, Plaintiffs were required to relinquish custody of Baby A and Baby B, thus suffering the loss of two children,\u201d it reads. According to the lawsuit, the couple do not know what happened to their own two embryos, which they believe \u201cwere never thawed and/or lost or destroyed by Defendants\u201d. Attorneys acting on behalf of the couple have filed a complaint and demand for jury trial on 16 counts \u2013 including medical malpractice, negligence, reckless and wanton misconduct and deceit and fraudulent concealment. It states: \u201cPlaintiffs have suffered significant and permanent emotional injuries for which they will not recover\u2026In addition, Plaintiff AP underwent physical and emotional injuries for which she is still under the treatment of medical providers and will continue to be in the future.\u201d The lawsuit claims the treatment cost the couple spent \u201cin excess of $100,000\u201d on the treatment in charges including doctors\u2019 and facility fees, medication, travel and specialist services.

      "body": "<p>In the astonishing desolation and wonder that is Ingeborg Bachmann\u2019s <em>Malina</em>, first published in 1971, there is no certain narrative, but there are many, deeply internalised, stories. There is the buried detective story struggling to surface; the story of female subjectivity and trauma, and male violence; of the nightmare of the war that tore her century (Bachmann was born in Austria and was the daughter of a Nazi party member); of the impossibility of love between a man and a woman; of the disintegration of words and meanings. Intended as the first in a three-volume series entitled Death Styles, <em>Malina </em>is above all a \u201cstory within the self\u201d \u2013 though self is an increasingly unstable concept in this novel in which nothing is fixed, everything is unsafe, and an ill wind blows through the text.</p> <p>There might not be the comfort of a narrative, but a clear structure attempts to hold chaos at bay. <em>Malina</em> is made up of three long chapters. The first, Happy with Ivan, evokes the narrator\u2019s obsessive relationship with a heedless younger man who withholds himself and to whom she is in thrall. She waits for him to turn up, tries to call him on phones that are sometimes dead, smokes, drinks, feels \u201calways in a panic\u201d, her mouth full of cotton wool and throttle marks on her neck, death lurking in the shadows. Meanwhile Malina, the man she lives with, embodies an increasingly sinister masculinity. He\u2019s a military historian, a man of reserve and order, chilly, enigmatic, watchful.</p> <p>In this opening chapter there is a time \u2013 \u201ctoday\u201d, which in its boundlessness is an impossible word, one that \u201conly suicides should use\u201d \u2013 and a precise geography: a named street in Vienna where all three characters live. But with the second chapter, The Third Man, we are in \u201cnon-times\u201d, in a sequence of hallucinatory nightmares that the narrator suffers. She dreams of her father, the violent third man who murders and rapes and next to whom Sylvia Plath\u2019s Daddy seems positively sweet. Into these brutalising dreams swarm the horrors of war and its aftermath. Here, in sentences that last so long you want to scream, are ice and fire and blackened skin; murdered daughters and whips and instruments of torture. Here, finally, are the gas chambers themselves. There is no longer war and peace, \u201conly war\u201d, and \u201cyou are the war\u201d, Malina tells her. \u201cYou yourself.\u201d</p> <p>The third section, Last Things, returns to the calm of erotic despair. In it, the narrator\u2019s charismatic voice is repeatedly interrupted by a collage of letters (that are never sent), of phone calls (that may have never taken place), of dialogues with Malina, of his insistence that she must kill Ivan. The word echoes through the text: \u201ckill, kill, kill\u201d. Because in the end, as we have known from the beginning, this is a murder story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"379f508c01b9e2b4d40f9548e3bd70c0b702284d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/379f508c01b9e2b4d40f9548e3bd70c0b702284d/662_51_7122_4276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Many, deeply internalised, stories\u2019: a scene from the 1991 adaptation of Malina\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Many, deeply internalised, stories\u2019: a scene from the 1991 adaptation of Malina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But who dies?

The narrator declares herself Malina\u2019s double, but doubleness is everywhere; everything mutates and slides queasily into everything else.</p> <p>Above all, who is this narrator whose voice so captures us and draws us on? She is a writer of stories that will never be read; in the novel\u2019s opening, very short, cast list she is listed as \u201cMyself\u201d. She signs her letters \u201can unknown woman\u201d: she is unknown to herself, and ironically and desperately performs herself, less and less convinced by her lines, by her thoughts, by her own reality.

The announcement is likely to anger Beijing, which views Taiwan as part of its territory and has previously expressed \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the possible sale. Congress has been notified about the potential deal, which would include 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks, some 250 Stinger missiles, related equipment and support, according to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). US lawmakers have 30 days to object to the sale but are unlikely to do so. The proposed tank sale would \u201ccontribute to the modernization of the recipient\u2019s main battle tank fleet, enhancing its ability to meet current and future regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense,\u201d DSCA said. But would not alter the \u201cbasic military balance in the region,\u201d according to DSCA. Taiwan\u2019s Presidential Office expressed \u201csincere gratitude\u201d to the US government for the arms sale. \u201cTaiwan will speed up investment on defense and continue to deepen security ties with the United States and countries with similar ideas,\u201d Chang Tun-han, a spokesman for Taiwan\u2019s president, said in a statement. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said in March that Washington was responding positively to Taipei\u2019s requests for new arms sales to bolster its defenses in the face of pressure from China. The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help provide it with the means to defend itself. Beijing registered its opposition to the possible sale earlier this month. \u201cWe have repeatedly emphasized to the US to fully understand the extremely sensitive and damaging nature of their decision to sell arms to Taiwan, and abide by the One China principle,\u201d foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. Taiwan has been ruled separately since the end of a civil war in 1949, but China has vowed to take control of the island, by force if necessary. China has significantly stepped up diplomatic and military pressure on Taipei since Beijing-sceptic president Tsai Ing-wen was elected in 2016. It has staged military exercises near the island, and steadily reduced the already small number of nations that recognize Taiwan. The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, but Taipei has remained an important ally. In recent years, Washington has been wary of completing big ticket arms deals with Taiwan, fearful of stoking China\u2019s anger. But President Donald Trump \u2013 whose administration is locked in a trade war with Beijing that has seen the two sides impose tariffs on hundreds of billions in two-way commerce \u2013 has sought to strengthen ties with Taipei and appeared more willing to sell major weapon systems. Taiwan would be massively outgunned in terms of troop numbers and firepower in any war with China and it desperately needs to upgrade much of its equipment. Its current tank force consists of around 1,000 CM 11 Brave Tiger and M60A3 tanks, technology that is increasingly obsolete. Abrams tanks and anti-aircraft missiles that can be quickly moved by soldiers in the field would significantly increase Taiwan\u2019s ability to destroy Chinese armor and warplanes in the event of an invasion.",

The hut, and its sister Copperas, each sit in private clifftop sections of Lydford Farm, above the north Devon coast, between Ilfracombe and Combe Martin. There are several other sandy coves within walking distance, including Broadsands, and at the foot of the hill is the natural harbour of Watermouth Bay. The small hut has one double bed, en suite bathroom, kitchenette, woodburner and firepit barbecue outside. Berrynarbor is the closest village, with a community-run shop, and there are several pubs within a 15-minute walk.

It\u2019s right on <a href=\"http://www.ceredigioncoastpath.org.uk/\">the coastal path</a> and next to sandy Cwmtydu beach, which has a cafe.

The 14 two-storey huts reopened last year as converted holiday rentals, with compact interiors, including kitchenettes, and traditional exteriors with black panelling and green shutters. The smallest sleeps two adults and the largest four adults and two children, all with breakfast included (served in the Hotel Continental, a 10-minute walk away).

The coastline is varied: the nearest beach is shingle, less than 20 minutes away on foot. It\u2019s a good place to start a windswept walk to Blakeney Point for seal-spotting on the nature reserve. Cley next the Sea, a 10-minute walk the other way, has two pubs, a smokehouse, deli, bookshop, gallery and the famous <a href=\"http://www.cleywindmill.co.uk/\">Cley windmill</a>, which serves a seasonal Norfolk tasting menu (\u00a332pp, booking advised).<br>\u2022 <em>From \u00a3127 a night, <a href=\"https://www.norfolkcottages.co.uk/north-norfolk-coast-cottages/cley/1961-hillrise-cottage\">norfolkcottages.co.uk</a></em></p> <h2>Star &amp; Garter apartments, Falmouth, Cornwall</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6935e2d9678646d81e4ed816e98778c459d98ce3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6935e2d9678646d81e4ed816e98778c459d98ce3/0_80_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Star and Garter apartments, Falmouth, Cornwall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The waterfront <a href=\"http://starandgarter.squarespace.com/\">Star &amp; Garter</a>, on Falmouth High Street, has added a third apartment above the pub.

All have smart but comfy living spaces and small kitchens, and come with a welcome hamper of fresh bread and cakes from the local bakery. It\u2019s a 20-minute walk from the sandy beaches of Gyllingvase and Swanpool, and close to where the passenger ferry sails across the Fal estuary to the town of St Mawes and the Roseland peninsula.

Angered by leaked memos that described his administration as \u201cinept\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional\u201d, he again hit out at the UK\u2019s man in Washington, Sir Kim Darroch: \u201cI do not know the Ambassador, but he is not liked or well thought of within the U.S. We will no longer deal with him,\u201d Trump tweeted. He also criticised Theresa May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/08/pm-has-full-faith-in-kim-darroch-but-rejects-his-view-of-trump\">whose spokesperson has defended Darroch\u2019s right to make an \u201chonest and unvarnished\u201d</a> assessment of the White House. Trump said May had made a \u201cmess\u201d of Brexit and didn\u2019t listen to his advice: \u201cI told her how it should be done, but she decided to go another way,\u201d he said, adding \u201cthe good news for the wonderful United Kingdom is that they will soon have a new prime minister\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s anger has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/08/can-kim-darroch-continue-as-ambassador-to-us-after-trump-leak\">escalated the row to new heights</a>, which will no doubt create a problem for the next PM, who will have to decide whether or not to recall Darroch. If Trump cuts him off, he will be redundant, but if he is recalled before the end of his tenure this winter, it could risk looking like Downing Street has kowtowed to Washington and handed a victory to whoever leaked the cables.

Roughly half of those surveyed said they were anxious about poverty and homelessness, terrorism, inequality and the environment, while about 40% worried about Brexit, sexism and racism. Children from low-income families were strikingly more pessimistic about their childhoods: 39% thought childhood was getting worse, compared to 25% from higher income backgrounds.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Hong Kong </strong>\u2013 Carrie Lam says the extradition bill that prompted millions to join street protests<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/09/hong-kong-carrie-lam-says-extradition-bill-is-dead-but-stops-short-of-withdrawal\"> is \u201cdead\u201d, but the city\u2019s leader stopped short of saying it had been withdrawn</a>. Lam instead used a Cantonese phrase to describe the proposal as \u201creaching the end of its life\u201d. She said she felt \u201cheartbroken\u201d over the conflict caused by the proposed law, which she described as a \u201ctotal failure\u201d. Her remarks were her strongest yet since the government suspended progress on the bill after mass protests but critics say she has not fully met the demands of demonstrators.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> \u2013 The billionaire Wall Street financier and sex offender has pleaded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/08/jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-charges-court\">not guilty to charges of sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking</a>. Some of the victims were just 14 years old, prosecutors alleged. Epstein, who was arrested on Saturday in New Jersey, allegedly \u201csexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls\u201d from 2002 to 2005 at homes in Manhattan and Florida. The indictment alleged Epstein \u201centiced and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, minor girls\u201d to \u201cengage in sex acts with him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars in cash\u201d. Epstein\u2019s lawyer said the allegations were \u201cancient stuff\u201d, dealt with in prior proceedings.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Abolish Eton\u2019</strong> \u2013 Labour activists are aiming to capitalise on Boris Johnson\u2019s likely election as Conservative leader with an aggressive campaign against his old school, Eton, and other elite private schools in England. The group, Labour Against Private Schools, is circulating a motion for the party\u2019s conference in September <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/09/abolish-eton-labour-groups-aim-to-strip-elite-private-schools-of-privileges\">that would commit a Labour government to stripping fee-paying schools of their privileges</a> and integrating them into the state system. The campaign, being launched today using the @AbolishEton Twitter handle, is backed by a number of Labour MPs including the former party leader Ed Miliband.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>HPV vaccine </strong>\u2013 The NHS will expand the vaccination programme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/09/hpv-vaccine-to-be-given-to-boys-in-effort-to-slash-cancer-rates\">to include all boys in school year 8 in England from September,</a> safeguarding them and girls from a range of cancers.

Supermarkets have cut into his trade, selling cheap ice-cream, he says, but competition isn\u2019t the only reason for his declining trade. Children don\u2019t play outdoors as much as they used to, he says \u2013 you can\u2019t hear the chimes of an approaching ice-cream van over the whirrs of iPads. From his vantage point in quiet cul-de-sacs, he sees social change up close: austerity which limits what parents can spend. People don\u2019t carry cash any more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54e9bb42b398ed4958d75b9683c4b08221efe6a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54e9bb42b398ed4958d75b9683c4b08221efe6a2/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Roach is part of the fabric of Eastbourne\u2019s community.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Roach is part of the fabric of Eastbourne\u2019s community.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony is also an expert on Britain\u2019s changing palates. Recently, people have started asking for vegan ice-cream. He doesn\u2019t have any, but he does have dog ice-cream \u2013 not because dogs are more deserving than vegans, but because he did a dog show last week. But Tony, whose father was in ice-cream man before him, has observed more worrying trends, too, such as the climate emergency. \u201cWe\u2019re having different weather than we had 20 years ago,\u201d he says darkly. \u201cThe weather\u2019s changing ... we get very hot spells and then very wet spells.\u201d Tony knows he is at the heart of a dying trade, and a rapidly melting community.</p> <h2>Sport</h2> <p>Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal dropped only 18 games between them and needed less than five hours <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/08/rafael-nadal-crushes-joao-sousa-straight-sets-quarter-finals-wimbledon-roger-federer-novak-djokovic\">to book their places in the quarter-finals</a> at Wimbledon yet again.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018He is not liked or well thought of\u2019 Good morning and welcome to the Tuesday briefing with Alison Rourke. Donald Trump is very unhappy, to put it mildly. Angered by leaked memos that described his administration as \u201cinept\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional\u201d, he again hit out at the UK\u2019s man in Washington, Sir Kim Darroch: \u201cI do not know the Ambassador, but he is not liked or well thought of within the U.S. We will no longer deal with him,\u201d Trump tweeted. He also criticised Theresa May, whose spokesperson has defended Darroch\u2019s right to make an \u201chonest and unvarnished\u201d assessment of the White House. Trump said May had made a \u201cmess\u201d of Brexit and didn\u2019t listen to his advice: \u201cI told her how it should be done, but she decided to go another way,\u201d he said, adding \u201cthe good news for the wonderful United Kingdom is that they will soon have a new prime minister\u201d. Trump\u2019s anger has escalated the row to new heights, which will no doubt create a problem for the next PM, who will have to decide whether or not to recall Darroch. If Trump cuts him off, he will be redundant, but if he is recalled before the end of his tenure this winter, it could risk looking like Downing Street has kowtowed to Washington and handed a victory to whoever leaked the cables. You can read John Crace\u2019s take on the diplomatic spat: \u201cTrump would be bound to prove Darroch\u2019s judgement right soon enough by sticking his nose in, and then the shit would really hit the fan.\u201d Cue Twitter. * * * \u2018Crisis of childhood\u2019 \u2013 Young people are struggling to achieve at school, fit in with their peers and cope with wider anxieties over issues such as Brexit, poverty and the climate crisis, a new survey shows. Action for Children charity\u2019s survey of 5,000 children, parents and grandparents found a strong shared perception that modern childhoods were getting worse under what it called unprecedented social pressures. Roughly half of those surveyed said they were anxious about poverty and homelessness, terrorism, inequality and the environment, while about 40% worried about Brexit, sexism and racism. Children from low-income families were strikingly more pessimistic about their childhoods: 39% thought childhood was getting worse, compared to 25% from higher income backgrounds. * * * Hong Kong \u2013 Carrie Lam says the extradition bill that prompted millions to join street protests is \u201cdead\u201d, but the city\u2019s leader stopped short of saying it had been withdrawn. Lam instead used a Cantonese phrase to describe the proposal as \u201creaching the end of its life\u201d. She said she felt \u201cheartbroken\u201d over the conflict caused by the proposed law, which she described as a \u201ctotal failure\u201d. Her remarks were her strongest yet since the government suspended progress on the bill after mass protests but critics say she has not fully met the demands of demonstrators. * * * Jeffrey Epstein \u2013 The billionaire Wall Street financier and sex offender has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking. Some of the victims were just 14 years old, prosecutors alleged. Epstein, who was arrested on Saturday in New Jersey, allegedly \u201csexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls\u201d from 2002 to 2005 at homes in Manhattan and Florida. The indictment alleged Epstein \u201centiced and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, minor girls\u201d to \u201cengage in sex acts with him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars in cash\u201d. Epstein\u2019s lawyer said the allegations were \u201cancient stuff\u201d, dealt with in prior proceedings. * * * \u2018Abolish Eton\u2019 \u2013 Labour activists are aiming to capitalise on Boris Johnson\u2019s likely election as Conservative leader with an aggressive campaign against his old school, Eton, and other elite private schools in England. The group, Labour Against Private Schools, is circulating a motion for the party\u2019s conference in September that would commit a Labour government to stripping fee-paying schools of their privileges and integrating them into the state system. The campaign, being launched today using the @AbolishEton Twitter handle, is backed by a number of Labour MPs including the former party leader Ed Miliband. * * * HPV vaccine \u2013 The NHS will expand the vaccination programme to include all boys in school year 8 in England from September, safeguarding them and girls from a range of cancers. Human papilloma virus (HPV) is sexually transmitted, so vaccinating boys will help protect their partners, but reducing the circulation of the virus, which is linked to 5% of cancers, will also help prevent penile, anal and genital cancers and some cancers of the head and neck. Today in Focus podcast: The sea captain facing jail after saving the lives of refugees Carola Rackete defied Italy\u2019s ban on migrant rescue ships by forcing her way into the port of Lampedusa last week. She tells the Guardian\u2019s Lorenzo Tondo she would do it all again, even though she faces a lengthy trial and a possible jail sentence. Plus: Simon Jenkins on the leaked diplomatic cables of the UK\u2019s Washington ambassador, which were highly critical of Donald Trump. Lunchtime read: The big scoop You can learn a lot about Britain by spending a day in an ice-cream van, writes Sirin Kale. Ice Cream Tony has been an icon in parts of Eastbourne for 40 years, selling soft, sweet treats to a dwindling number of customers. Supermarkets have cut into his trade, selling cheap ice-cream, he says, but competition isn\u2019t the only reason for his declining trade. Children don\u2019t play outdoors as much as they used to, he says \u2013 you can\u2019t hear the chimes of an approaching ice-cream van over the whirrs of iPads. From his vantage point in quiet cul-de-sacs, he sees social change up close: austerity which limits what parents can spend. People don\u2019t carry cash any more. Tony is also an expert on Britain\u2019s changing palates. Recently, people have started asking for vegan ice-cream. He doesn\u2019t have any, but he does have dog ice-cream \u2013 not because dogs are more deserving than vegans, but because he did a dog show last week. But Tony, whose father was in ice-cream man before him, has observed more worrying trends, too, such as the climate emergency. \u201cWe\u2019re having different weather than we had 20 years ago,\u201d he says darkly. \u201cThe weather\u2019s changing ... we get very hot spells and then very wet spells.\u201d Tony knows he is at the heart of a dying trade, and a rapidly melting community. Sport Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal dropped only 18 games between them and needed less than five hours to book their places in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon yet again. The British No 1, Johanna Konta, recovered from a set down to beat the No 6 seed, Petra Kvitova, and set up a quarter-final against Barbora Strycova in the women\u2019s singles, but it was the end of the road for Coco Gauff, the American 15-year-old who came of age at this year\u2019s tournament. Australia\u2019s Cricket World Cup squad have \u201cpoured their hearts out\u201d in a barefoot team-building session before the semi-final against England, said Peter Handscomb, who may come in for Usman Khajawa for the game at Edgbaston. And Crusaders coach Scott Robertson has confirmed he wants to succeed Steve Hansen as All Blacks mentor after this year\u2019s Rugby World Cup and is buoyant about his chances. Business Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China and fears over rising interest rates triggered stock market losses worth $2tn (\u00a31.6tn) for the world\u2019s super-rich last year. According to the annual world wealth report from the consultancy firm Capgemini, which surveys the global elite, the number of \u201chigh net worth individuals\u201d (HNWI are those with at least $1m, or \u00a3641,000, in \u201cinvestable assets\u201d ) dropped by about 100,000 to stand at 18 million. Asia was hardest hit, with with China accounting for more than a quarter of the fall in total HNWI wealth against a backdrop of plunging Chinese stock markets.

According to the regime\u2019s official version of events, Dimitrovgrad was established on 10 May 1947 when a group of 40 young people arrived at the site on the banks of the Maritsa River on the Thracian Plain and decided to build the city of the future.

      "bodyText": "In her flat overlooking the main square of Dimitrovgrad, 90-year-old Maria Oteva casts her mind back more than seven decades to the foundation of the town in the early years of Bulgaria\u2019s communist era. \u201cBack then, 50,000 volunteers built this city because they believed in something,\u201d she says. \u201cNowadays, you wouldn\u2019t find 50 people to come and clean up the dirty streets.\u201d Oteva was one of those volunteers, aged 17 and eager to build a new socialist Bulgaria after the ravages of the second world war. She had joined the partisan resistance against the Nazi-allied government as a young teenager before joining the regular army in 1944 when Bulgaria, under Soviet occupation, switched sides. She operated a machine gun and then worked as a medic as the army fought its way into Hungary. Left: Young volunteers during the construction of Dimitrovgrad; right: Maria Oteva today Following the war, she joined the police force before being invited to join the \u201cbrigades\u201d movement of volunteers being assembled by the new communist government for public works projects. The most ambitious of these was Dimitrovgrad, a city that was to exemplify the brave new world being created. Its spacious streets, parks and imposing public buildings, constructed in \u201cStalin baroque\u201d style, still stand today. Oteva was the leader of the first group of \u201cbrigadiers\u201d to work on Dimitrovgrad, following a course of lessons in construction techniques. She lives in one of the original buildings constructed for workers in the city and spends much of the day on the balcony looking out over the town hall, watching life go by and children playing. \u201cI believed strongly in the ideas and perspectives offered by socialism,\u201d Oteva says. \u201cIt gave people power and the keys to their future.\u201d A group of young volunteers pose during the construction of Dimitrovgrad Dimitrovgrad was constructed on the site of three small villages, and named after the first communist leader of Bulgaria, Georgi Dimitrov, who would die two years after the city was founded.

But Tony Roach flicks off the Popeye tune after only a moment\u2019s airtime. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t 12 seconds!\u201d I wail. Roach blinks and looks at me oddly, then promises to play it for longer next time. There\u2019s something about ice-cream vans that brings out the child in all of us.</p> <p>I\u2019m riding shotgun in a pink-and-cream 2009 Whitby Morrison Millennium, accompanying Roach on the same round of Eastbourne, his hometown, that he has been doing for 40 years. The weather is warm, the sky is cloudless. Humming the Popeye tune under my breath, I help myself to another flake from the box above the fridge. It\u2019s going to be a good day.</p> <p>Known to all as Ice-Cream Tony, 57-year-old Roach learned to scoop practically before he could walk. His father, Paul, was in the trade. \u201cAll I can remember is ice-cream vans,\u201d says Roach. \u201cFrom the age of six, I was going with my dad in the ice-cream van and helping. It\u2019s all I wanted to do.\u201d Paul taught him how to repair the refrigeration units and the engine. Most mechanics won\u2019t touch ice-cream vans because they are complex vehicles, so, like an astronaut going into space, you have to be prepared to fix everything yourself. After his father died, Roach restored his 1972 Bedford CF Morrison van. It was an emotional task. \u201cHe was a great geezer.

According to the trade body, the Ice Cream Alliance, there are between 2,500 and 5,000 vans operational in the UK, but only 10% of them do street trading. In the 50s, there were 20,000. \u201cWe had a lot of competition in those days,\u201d says Roach. \u201cNow, street trading is dying.\u201d</p> <p>The past five years have been the worst, even as ice-cream parlours are one of a handful of growing sectors on the high street; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/09/ice-cream-parlours-booming-instagram-teetotalism\" title=\"\">a PricewaterhouseCooper report</a> found that their number rose by 20% in 2017. Roach blames the downturn on supermarkets selling ice-cream so cheaply, but competition is not the only reason.

If, as Malcolm Gladwell claimed, it takes 10,000 hours to achieve mastery in any given field, then Roach \u2013 who works seven days a week from the February half-term until October, 6am to 11pm \u2013 is a master 10 times over. He is the grandmaster of soft-serve; Don Whippy; King Cone.</p> <p>But fewer people are buying ice-cream than I thought. It\u2019s murder at the infant school, and the primary school further down the road, and the third stop, a local park. In two hours, we sell maybe 20 ice-creams in total. At the park, Roach is anxious to tell me that, the day before, the queue was 20 minutes long.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that the product is bad \u2013 it\u2019s delicious. Roach uses a fresh milk mix from Mediterranean Ices, and is snobbish about providers who make their ice-cream from UHT. \u201cI can always taste a UHT mix. You notice it when they\u2019re walking away from the ice-cream van. You see how it runs down the edges? It\u2019s melting.

Outside Stafford school, a child whines that his cone isn\u2019t big enough. \u201cThat\u2019s all the money we have,\u201d says his mother, exasperated. \u201cI\u2019m not having anything for myself!\u201d Later, at the Kingsmere estate, 40-year-old Christina Ward looks at the menu and says: \u201cIt\u2019s well expensive, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Roach\u2019s kindly mien slips for a moment behind his wraparound shades. \u201cIt\u2019s only \u00a32,\u201d he retorts.

      "bodyText": "You are only allowed to play the ice-cream jingle for a maximum of 12 seconds, when the van is approaching its destination. But Tony Roach flicks off the Popeye tune after only a moment\u2019s airtime. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t 12 seconds!\u201d I wail. Roach blinks and looks at me oddly, then promises to play it for longer next time. There\u2019s something about ice-cream vans that brings out the child in all of us. I\u2019m riding shotgun in a pink-and-cream 2009 Whitby Morrison Millennium, accompanying Roach on the same round of Eastbourne, his hometown, that he has been doing for 40 years. The weather is warm, the sky is cloudless. Humming the Popeye tune under my breath, I help myself to another flake from the box above the fridge. It\u2019s going to be a good day. Known to all as Ice-Cream Tony, 57-year-old Roach learned to scoop practically before he could walk. His father, Paul, was in the trade. \u201cAll I can remember is ice-cream vans,\u201d says Roach. \u201cFrom the age of six, I was going with my dad in the ice-cream van and helping. It\u2019s all I wanted to do.\u201d Paul taught him how to repair the refrigeration units and the engine. Most mechanics won\u2019t touch ice-cream vans because they are complex vehicles, so, like an astronaut going into space, you have to be prepared to fix everything yourself. After his father died, Roach restored his 1972 Bedford CF Morrison van. It was an emotional task. \u201cHe was a great geezer. An ice-cream man through and through.\u201d Roach bought his first van, a 1965 Bedford CA, for \u00a3500 in 1979. He follows Paul\u2019s route from the 60s. The streets might be the same, but the days in which ice-cream vans were a staple of local communities are gone.

Roach blames the downturn on supermarkets selling ice-cream so cheaply, but competition is not the only reason. Children don\u2019t play outdoors as much as they used to; you can\u2019t hear the chimes of an approaching ice-cream van over the pinball whirr of an iPad. And don\u2019t get Roach started on Jamie Oliver\u2019s war on unhealthy eating: \u201cThat didn\u2019t help at all,\u201d he says grimly. We pull up at our first stop, Roselands infant school, where parents are loitering outside. Roach switches off the engine and we sit there with the hum of the Carpigiani soft-serve machine for company. I feel like a lion watching my prey. The bell rings. Children flood out.

It occurs to me that this may be the fictitious Arcadia that Brexiters want: communities where the ice-cream man knows your name and your order, and your mother\u2019s order before yours, and her grandmother\u2019s order before that, probably. They have been searching for it, but it\u2019s already here. This summer, at least.",

Referee Julie Etchingham will do her best to elicit actual answers. <em>Mike Bradley</em></p> <h2>Charles I: Downfall of a King<br>9pm, BBC Four</h2> <p>Over three consecutive nights this week, the historian Lisa Hilton recreates and explains a tempestuous 50-day period \u2013 November 1641 to January 1642 \u2013 that shook the foundations of the British state and led to nine years of civil war and, ultimately, regicide. In an intelligently assembled opener, we find King Charles in Edinburgh while the leader of the house, John Pym, plots a move to limit the king\u2019s power, resulting in a battle between the pair that escalates out of control. Dramatic reconstructions and new history make for good television. <em>MB</em></p> <h2>Atomic Age Declassified<br>8pm, Smithsonian Channel</h2> <p>This three-parter, based on files released in the 1990s, starts with a brisk tour of cold war brushes with oblivion. After a mania for unmasking communists claimed victims such as the atomic scientist Robert Oppenheimer, the US narrowly avoided war with the USSR, then nearly nuked itself by mistake. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Judi Dench\u2019s Wild Borneo Adventure <br>9pm, ITV</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5e2e32f09ea44667f025c8973bdb1ee6da576acd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e2e32f09ea44667f025c8973bdb1ee6da576acd/109_0_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dame Judi Dench in Borneo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swinging Dame: Judi Dench in Borneo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A delightful finale to a lovely series. This time, Dame Judi Dench travels down the Kinabatangan river and along the island\u2019s coastline encountering saltwater crocs, a serpentine secret agent with a Bond connection and an orphaned orangutan called Happy. Plus, we get to see her tattoo. <em>MB</em></p> <h2>Cyclists: Menace on Our Roads? <br>9.15pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>The relationship between cyclists and drivers on UK roads seems to get more fractious every day, and this documentary is unlikely to inspire a truce. A trio of loquacious cabbies, a traffic cop and a militant cyclist who takes hostile drivers to task are among the talking heads sharing forthright views. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Drag SOS<br>10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>The Family Gorgeous head to Scarborough to help more people find their inner fabulousness. Fleur, who is struggling to come to terms with her weight gain, is hoping her new drag persona will boost her confidence, while fitness instructor Mark goes way out of his comfort zone, in heels. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a566eca0f70a427193df3167d8cd02414bddd071\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a566eca0f70a427193df3167d8cd02414bddd071/0_318_5647_3388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zhenya (Maryana Spivak) in Loveless.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zhenya (Maryana Spivak) in Loveless.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Altitude Film Distribution/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Loveless (Andrey Zvyagintsev, 2017) 11.25pm, Film4</strong><br>Another painful parable of modern Russia from Andrey Zvyagintsev.

Consider that the roleplay featured in the Facebook group isn\u2019t the only recent trend in which younger demographics consciously emulate those in late-middle age. In recent years, style publications have taken heed of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.racked.com/2017/10/18/16453412/menocore-wealth-age-eileen-fisher\">menocore</a>\u201d a fashion trend in which young women adopt a linen-draped aesthetic associated with the wealthy, post-menopausal set (think <a href=\"https://a.disquscdn.com/get?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.manrepeller.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F12%2FDK-somethings-gotta-give.jpg&amp;key=l2WK6PIewlU8Hi6AxDpCnw\">Diane Keaton in a Nancy Meyers film</a>). For men, 1960s-style <a href=\"https://hk.asiatatler.com/style/designer-bowling-shirts-2019\">Hawaiian and bowling shirts have returned to runways</a>.

Perry explains that the impulse to satirize boomers may be a reaction to negative stereotypes younger cohorts face about themselves \u2013 a kind of generational tit-for-tat. \u201cIt\u2019s playful at first, until it\u2019s not,\u201d she cautions.</p> <p>Indeed, just as the <a href=\"https://time.com/247/millennials-the-me-me-me-generation/\">preconceptions</a> about younger generations are unfair, the group\u2019s jabs against boomers sometimes veer harsh, or inaccurate.</p> <p>Eric Fredericksen, a Gen X arts professional, joined thinking it would be fun to satirize the generation he grew up in the shadow of. However, while he enjoys the group\u2019s humor, he also feels many of its members misinterpret the boomer identity.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s this assumption for a lot of people that it\u2019s an excuse to be a Trump/Maga-type, or to write homophobic things,\u201d says Fredericksen. Yet that\u2019s a reductive take on what was in fact an often-radical generation. \u201cProbably most of the trans people who rioted at Stonewall were boomers,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For Fredericksen, the real comedic gems come from transmuting the way people who came late to computers communicate on social media into high camp \u2013 rather than jibes that simply convey \u201cOh, these are the olds who don\u2019t get the world now,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI almost feel like in the coming days there are going to be a lot of \u2018#NotAllBoomers\u2019; people coming out saying, \u2018We\u2019re not all like this!\u2019\u201d says Liney Marks, a 31-year-old teacher who joined the group because it reminded her of how her real boomer Facebook friends post online. \u201cBut at the same time, that\u2019s how we millennials feel when articles are posted about how we\u2019re lazy and entitled and don\u2019t want to work. I think in a lot of ways it\u2019s inaccurate, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, Marks has found the group \u201ckind of cathartic\u201d, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like the old comedic standard of punching up, not down, because we kind of feel like we\u2019re being made out to be something we\u2019re not, now we\u2019re kind of turning the tables a little bit.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/12/millennial-baby-boomer-trade-places-stab-envy\">A millennial and a baby boomer trade places: \u2018I can\u2019t help but feel a stab of envy\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Saliently, some boomers also have joined, and enjoy, the group. \u201cI deal with people who sound like this on my page,\u201d says 61-year-old Lauren Perrine. \u201cI am a boomer \u2026 and I find this fking [<em>sic</em>] funny,\u201d she commented on one of the group\u2019s posts.</p> <p>Despite this burgeoning youth culture relevance, boomers probably won\u2019t feel especially<em> </em>flattered upon reading the group\u2019s typo-ridden imitations.

      "bodyText": "You know it when you see it: a couple of extra commas following a thought, a private message or search entry accidentally made public, a comment on a friend\u2019s new profile picture telling them to \u201csay hi to Joe and the kids for me,,, love! You\u201d. This is a baby boomer posting to Facebook. It could be your parent, an uncle, a family friend, a grandparent; if you were born between 1946 and 1964, it could be you. Posting typos and non sequiturs is harmless, revealing a user\u2019s unfamiliarity with the conversational conventions of social media, and perhaps an inexpert command of keyboards. Yet, as indicated by the skyrocketing popularity of a new Facebook group called \u201cA group where we all pretend to be boomers,\u201d in which members of Generations X through Z adopt boomer-ish affectations for fun, they can also be amusing. The group, which has 229,000 subscribers, was created in mid-May. According to moderator Robert Snyder, 20, membership increased by over 5,200% within a month. Members-pretending-to-be-boomers enthusiastically share earnest personal news, Minions gifs, and hoax posts imploring friends to copy and paste alarmist messages, all riddled with whacky syntax and redundant punctuation. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a lot more successful than I expected, and I think a lot of that can be attributed to the relatable nature of how boomers post,\u201d says Snyder. At any given moment, members of the group are creating tongue in cheek events with names like \u201cSPEAK ON PHONE LIKE THE SPEAKER IS NOT ON WITH SPEAKER ON,\u201d or sharing quotes such as \u201cWhen someone says \u2018stop living in the past,\u2019 I say, \u2018but the music was so much better back then.\u2019\u201d Beneath one black and white concert video of the band MC5 playing live in 1970, one user commented: \u201cI remember when Walter and I went to a concert in 1971. It was Strawberry Alarm Clock and Bread. We slept in the back of his Barracuda. It was so romantic! We had some Boones Farm and made love for the first time. I got so sick and threw up! This is Florrie.\u201d Comedic value aside, there are reasons why a younger crowd may want to channel boomers. Their generation boasted affordable college tuition, accessible home ownership and entry into a strong job market \u2013 no longer realities for today\u2019s youth. Boomer envy is real. Don\u2019t believe me? Consider that the roleplay featured in the Facebook group isn\u2019t the only recent trend in which younger demographics consciously emulate those in late-middle age. In recent years, style publications have taken heed of \u201cmenocore\u201d a fashion trend in which young women adopt a linen-draped aesthetic associated with the wealthy, post-menopausal set (think Diane Keaton in a Nancy Meyers film). For men, 1960s-style Hawaiian and bowling shirts have returned to runways. Next time you get a manicure, you can even ask for \u201cbaby boomer nails\u201d. The stereotypes emphasized in the Facebook group happen to have struck a particularly resonant chord with younger demographics, predominantly millennials, long sensitive to being labeled entitled, lazy, wildly selfish and feckless by their elders. \u201cA very common reaction to stereotyping is the denigration of the other,\u201d says Dr Elissa Perry, a professor of psychology at Columbia University. Perry explains that the impulse to satirize boomers may be a reaction to negative stereotypes younger cohorts face about themselves \u2013 a kind of generational tit-for-tat. \u201cIt\u2019s playful at first, until it\u2019s not,\u201d she cautions. Indeed, just as the preconceptions about younger generations are unfair, the group\u2019s jabs against boomers sometimes veer harsh, or inaccurate. Eric Fredericksen, a Gen X arts professional, joined thinking it would be fun to satirize the generation he grew up in the shadow of. However, while he enjoys the group\u2019s humor, he also feels many of its members misinterpret the boomer identity. \u201cThere\u2019s this assumption for a lot of people that it\u2019s an excuse to be a Trump/Maga-type, or to write homophobic things,\u201d says Fredericksen. Yet that\u2019s a reductive take on what was in fact an often-radical generation. \u201cProbably most of the trans people who rioted at Stonewall were boomers,\u201d he says. For Fredericksen, the real comedic gems come from transmuting the way people who came late to computers communicate on social media into high camp \u2013 rather than jibes that simply convey \u201cOh, these are the olds who don\u2019t get the world now,\u201d he says. \u201cI almost feel like in the coming days there are going to be a lot of \u2018#NotAllBoomers\u2019; people coming out saying, \u2018We\u2019re not all like this!\u2019\u201d says Liney Marks, a 31-year-old teacher who joined the group because it reminded her of how her real boomer Facebook friends post online. \u201cBut at the same time, that\u2019s how we millennials feel when articles are posted about how we\u2019re lazy and entitled and don\u2019t want to work. I think in a lot of ways it\u2019s inaccurate, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair.\u201d In fact, Marks has found the group \u201ckind of cathartic\u201d, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like the old comedic standard of punching up, not down, because we kind of feel like we\u2019re being made out to be something we\u2019re not, now we\u2019re kind of turning the tables a little bit.\u201d Saliently, some boomers also have joined, and enjoy, the group. \u201cI deal with people who sound like this on my page,\u201d says 61-year-old Lauren Perrine. \u201cI am a boomer \u2026 and I find this fking [sic] funny,\u201d she commented on one of the group\u2019s posts. Despite this burgeoning youth culture relevance, boomers probably won\u2019t feel especially flattered upon reading the group\u2019s typo-ridden imitations. Yet rather than take umbrage, perhaps the lesson to glean is that age-based stereotypes are largely unhelpful. \u201cI think that recognizing that, even when we are poking fun at another group in relatively good taste, it still perpetuates stereotypes,\u201d says Dr Kelly Weeks, who has researched generational characteristics at Rhodes College. \u201cSo much research trying to show the differences between generations has actually resulted in showing that we\u2019re so much more similar than we think. If we would just realize we all want the same things in life and in society, I think we could start to communicate better.\u201d And should that communication feature a few wayward commas and a random burst of caps-lock, well \u2026 so be it.",

Centrists might balk at Ha\u0161ek\u2019s manifesto promises, including mandatory alcoholism and the institutionalisation of feeble-minded MPs, but the tendency he mocked remains: proposing political reform, but ever so slowly; refusing to grapple with the speed with which the world is changing, or the fact the economy has for four decades been working for few but the wealthiest.</p> <p>Centrist thinking is focused on two false premises. The first is that the 2012 London Olympic ceremony represented an idyllic high-point of culture and unity in the UK, rather than occurring amid the brutal onslaught of austerity, with food bank use growing and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/27/the-bedroom-tax-explained\" title=\"\">the bedroom tax</a> ruining lives. The second is that the UK became divided by Brexit and the 2016 vote, rather than it being a symptom of long-term problems: the decline of industry and the public sector begun by Margaret Thatcher and continued by Tony Blair and David Cameron; vast inequality of opportunity, wealth and health; and the number of people being routinely ignored in a system with a huge democratic and electoral deficit.</p> <p>The 2017 manifesto helped Labour to increase its vote share because it addressed so many of the problems faced by people and communities across the country. Labour won more seats, in spite of people like Tom Watson and his ideological bedfellows. Many centrist Labour MPs desperately wanted the party to lose heavily so they could depose Jeremy Corbyn. They still do. A Labour government with Corbyn in charge is less preferable to them than an indefinite Tory government.</p> <p>If Tom Watson \u2013 the MP who said he <a href=\"http://labour-uncut.co.uk/2010/12/08/tory-lies-lib-dem-lies-phil-woolas-and-a-mystical-shaman-of-truth/\" title=\"\">\u201clost sleep\u201d</a> after Phil Woolas was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/nov/05/phil-woolas-ejected-parliament-election\" title=\"\">found guilty of lying</a> in racially inflammatory leaflets and stripped of his seat \u2013 had guts, he would quit the party and try to prove that his ideas have electoral traction. Yet, as he has probably discovered, it is hard to come up with bold and original ideas that benefit the electorate and prove popular with voters: it is far easier to stay in a party, wrecking it week by week, hoping to terminally undermine the leader and then inherit the ruins.</p> <p>But the end result of Watson et al\u2019s constant attacks will not be electoral success under another Labour leader, but a Tory victory.

Last weekend, he was rending his garments at the fact that former Labour members have released confidential material to the media, despite signing legal agreements not to do so: this is the same Watson who campaigned against hacking victims having emails and other data illegally intercepted. The deputy leader is also calling on members to sign an ill-defined pledge that would change very little in terms of Labour\u2019s position on Brexit. Neither of those stances are designed to do anything other than undermine the party leadership. Watson\u2019s wing of the party is convinced there is a huge untapped reserve of voters who share their precise politics, but exactly where these voters live remains to be seen. I travel extensively around the country, and the only time I meet these people are in TV and radio studios. The electoral failure of the Independent Group/Change UK (or whatever the handful of remaining ex-Labour and Tory MPs now call themselves) should be a warning to the Labour right, but their self-confidence is far greater than their analytical ability. All the MPs who make a living by constantly attacking the leadership and promoting themselves over the party, Watson included, abstained in the fateful Tory welfare reform vote in 2015 that sparked a huge surge of support for Corbyn. The centrist \u201causterity-lite\u201d platform of the former leader Ed Miliband was roundly rejected by the party membership. The Liberal Democrats have been buoyed by a protest vote in the always volatile European parliamentary elections, but both their leadership candidates, Jo Swinson and Ed Davey, served under the Conservatives in the coalition government. In 1911 in Prague, the writer Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek formed the satirical group The Party of Moderate Progress Within the Bounds of the Law, mocking the overtly accommodating tendencies of the Czech Social Democrats. Centrists might balk at Ha\u0161ek\u2019s manifesto promises, including mandatory alcoholism and the institutionalisation of feeble-minded MPs, but the tendency he mocked remains: proposing political reform, but ever so slowly; refusing to grapple with the speed with which the world is changing, or the fact the economy has for four decades been working for few but the wealthiest. Centrist thinking is focused on two false premises. The first is that the 2012 London Olympic ceremony represented an idyllic high-point of culture and unity in the UK, rather than occurring amid the brutal onslaught of austerity, with food bank use growing and the bedroom tax ruining lives. The second is that the UK became divided by Brexit and the 2016 vote, rather than it being a symptom of long-term problems: the decline of industry and the public sector begun by Margaret Thatcher and continued by Tony Blair and David Cameron; vast inequality of opportunity, wealth and health; and the number of people being routinely ignored in a system with a huge democratic and electoral deficit. The 2017 manifesto helped Labour to increase its vote share because it addressed so many of the problems faced by people and communities across the country. Labour won more seats, in spite of people like Tom Watson and his ideological bedfellows. Many centrist Labour MPs desperately wanted the party to lose heavily so they could depose Jeremy Corbyn. They still do. A Labour government with Corbyn in charge is less preferable to them than an indefinite Tory government. If Tom Watson \u2013 the MP who said he \u201clost sleep\u201d after Phil Woolas was found guilty of lying in racially inflammatory leaflets and stripped of his seat \u2013 had guts, he would quit the party and try to prove that his ideas have electoral traction. Yet, as he has probably discovered, it is hard to come up with bold and original ideas that benefit the electorate and prove popular with voters: it is far easier to stay in a party, wrecking it week by week, hoping to terminally undermine the leader and then inherit the ruins. But the end result of Watson et al\u2019s constant attacks will not be electoral success under another Labour leader, but a Tory victory. And the people who need a Labour government to change their lives and communities are unlikely to forgive people like him. \u2022 Dawn Foster is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>As this week is Naidoc week, there will be plenty of celebratory events which will usually involve a sausage sizzle, a family day, and a few dance performances by Indigenous kids, among other activities.</p> <p>As schoolchildren are on holiday, Naidoc was celebrated last week in most local schools. Quite a few teachers I know said their school put on fantastic Naidoc celebrations.</p> <p>For instance, Bidwill campus \u2013 a Chifley College in Mount Druitt \u2013 held a celebration that was extremely well organised. It was apparent the college had put dedication and thought into its celebration. In other words, it did not treat the celebration as an event that needed to be over and done with, instead it was treated as significant and important \u2013 as Naidoc events should be treated.</p> <p>But unlike Bidwill, its sister school Chifley College senior campus seemingly failed to stage appropriate celebrations. Last week eight Indigenous teenagers say they were subject to unnecessary humiliation by their peers and teachers during a Naidoc assembly. </p> <p>The students say they were given no time to prepare and were forced on stage, half ready. Their four promised dances were reduced to two, without their knowledge. The students were then subject to humiliation as the audience laughed at their performance. And a number of those students say they also were subject to racial slurs by another student as they were gathering leaves for the performance. </p> <p>A spokesperson for the New South Wales Department of Education said a technical glitch had occurred during the performance and it was unintentional.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/05/even-education-has-been-used-as-a-weapon-of-white-supremacy-in-australia\">Even education has been used as a weapon of white supremacy in Australia | Amy Thunig for IndigenousX</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHowever, the school and the department do not tolerate racism,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cChifley College Senior Campus prides itself on being a diverse and harmonious school. Any allegation of racism will be looked into.</p> <p>\u201cThe NSW Department of Education rejects all forms of racism. We are committed to the elimination of racial discrimination in NSW Government schools, including direct and indirect racism, racial vilification and harassment, in all aspects of the learning and working environment.\u201d</p> <p>On Facebook the school issued an apology.</p> <p>What these teenagers were subject to was potentially emotional abuse. Emotional abuse is defined as \u201cany act including confinement, isolation, verbal assault, humiliation, intimidation, infantilisation, or any other treatment which may diminish the sense of identity, dignity and self-worth\u201d.</p> <p>These teenagers left the stage in tears, humiliated and embarrassed, their self-worth and dignity damaged. Unfortunately, thousands of Indigenous teenagers are subject to emotional abuse at the hands of their peers and those who owe a duty of care to them.</p> <p>Throughout my life I have been racially abused and thus, emotionally abused, so many times, that at 27, I am almost desensitised to such encounters. There were the \u201cYou\u2019re too pretty for an Aboriginal\u201d and the \u201cAbos sniff petrol\u201d racist stereotypes throughout primary and secondary school.</p> <p>There was the time when a friend in the Transport for New South Wales graduate program, upon meeting me for the first time, asked if I received benefits (a totally normal conversation to have with a stranger).</p> <p>This was just one instance of many where I was subject to racism during the three horrific years of the program.But the worst of it is that in the majority of these incidents not one person intervened.</p> <p>Just recently, another Indigenous colleague and I suffered racial abuse by a landowner when I was working on an Indigenous archaeology dig. My non-Indigenous colleagues remained silent during the ordeal.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/publications/child-protection-and-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-children\">the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare</a>, the most common form of abuse substantiated by statutory child protection services, like the wider Australian community, is emotional abuse. As mentioned, emotional abuse can encompass several acts. Evidently, racial abuse can be included in this definition, as such an act causes humiliation and diminishes one\u2019s self-worth.</p> <p>The Indigenous community is now amid a suicide epidemic, one which has been declared a humanitarian crisis by the United Nations. To put this into perspective, 40% of the children under the age of 17 who took their own lives last year <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/broken-heart-of-a-nation-and-77-souls/news-story/c8b07e6b2fa24bb92ec8e4ae7fea4d39\">were Indigenous</a>. Yet Indigenous children under the age of 17 only account for 5% of the population. There are a number of risk factors which have contributed to the rapidly increasing rate of suicide, such as intergenerational trauma and sexual abuse.</p> <p>But emotional abuse as a risk factor is so often negligently ignored in discussions surrounding the high rates of abuse in Indigenous communities.</p> <p>Last year 14-year-old Rochelle Pryor took her own life. Her family members said Rochelle had been a victim of racism and bullying. Hours before her death she sent friends a message on social media saying: \u201cOnce I\u2019m gone, the bullying and the racism will stop.\u201d For a child to be so horrendously emotionally abused by her peers, would it not be apparent to her teachers? </p> <p>Remaining silent in such ordeals is unethical. But it should be stressed that those who have a duty of care, for instance teachers, could potentially be in breach of that duty when they refuse to acknowledge the emotional abuse of vulnerable Indigenous students or even partake in it.</p> <p>Ultimately, Indigenous people need their voices heard.

      "bodyText": "As this week is Naidoc week, there will be plenty of celebratory events which will usually involve a sausage sizzle, a family day, and a few dance performances by Indigenous kids, among other activities. As schoolchildren are on holiday, Naidoc was celebrated last week in most local schools. Quite a few teachers I know said their school put on fantastic Naidoc celebrations. For instance, Bidwill campus \u2013 a Chifley College in Mount Druitt \u2013 held a celebration that was extremely well organised. It was apparent the college had put dedication and thought into its celebration. In other words, it did not treat the celebration as an event that needed to be over and done with, instead it was treated as significant and important \u2013 as Naidoc events should be treated. But unlike Bidwill, its sister school Chifley College senior campus seemingly failed to stage appropriate celebrations. Last week eight Indigenous teenagers say they were subject to unnecessary humiliation by their peers and teachers during a Naidoc assembly. The students say they were given no time to prepare and were forced on stage, half ready. Their four promised dances were reduced to two, without their knowledge. The students were then subject to humiliation as the audience laughed at their performance. And a number of those students say they also were subject to racial slurs by another student as they were gathering leaves for the performance. A spokesperson for the New South Wales Department of Education said a technical glitch had occurred during the performance and it was unintentional. \u201cHowever, the school and the department do not tolerate racism,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cChifley College Senior Campus prides itself on being a diverse and harmonious school. Any allegation of racism will be looked into. \u201cThe NSW Department of Education rejects all forms of racism. We are committed to the elimination of racial discrimination in NSW Government schools, including direct and indirect racism, racial vilification and harassment, in all aspects of the learning and working environment.\u201d On Facebook the school issued an apology. What these teenagers were subject to was potentially emotional abuse. Emotional abuse is defined as \u201cany act including confinement, isolation, verbal assault, humiliation, intimidation, infantilisation, or any other treatment which may diminish the sense of identity, dignity and self-worth\u201d. These teenagers left the stage in tears, humiliated and embarrassed, their self-worth and dignity damaged. Unfortunately, thousands of Indigenous teenagers are subject to emotional abuse at the hands of their peers and those who owe a duty of care to them. Throughout my life I have been racially abused and thus, emotionally abused, so many times, that at 27, I am almost desensitised to such encounters. There were the \u201cYou\u2019re too pretty for an Aboriginal\u201d and the \u201cAbos sniff petrol\u201d racist stereotypes throughout primary and secondary school. There was the time when a friend in the Transport for New South Wales graduate program, upon meeting me for the first time, asked if I received benefits (a totally normal conversation to have with a stranger). This was just one instance of many where I was subject to racism during the three horrific years of the program.But the worst of it is that in the majority of these incidents not one person intervened. Just recently, another Indigenous colleague and I suffered racial abuse by a landowner when I was working on an Indigenous archaeology dig. My non-Indigenous colleagues remained silent during the ordeal. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the most common form of abuse substantiated by statutory child protection services, like the wider Australian community, is emotional abuse. As mentioned, emotional abuse can encompass several acts. Evidently, racial abuse can be included in this definition, as such an act causes humiliation and diminishes one\u2019s self-worth. The Indigenous community is now amid a suicide epidemic, one which has been declared a humanitarian crisis by the United Nations. To put this into perspective, 40% of the children under the age of 17 who took their own lives last year were Indigenous. Yet Indigenous children under the age of 17 only account for 5% of the population. There are a number of risk factors which have contributed to the rapidly increasing rate of suicide, such as intergenerational trauma and sexual abuse. But emotional abuse as a risk factor is so often negligently ignored in discussions surrounding the high rates of abuse in Indigenous communities. Last year 14-year-old Rochelle Pryor took her own life. Her family members said Rochelle had been a victim of racism and bullying. Hours before her death she sent friends a message on social media saying: \u201cOnce I\u2019m gone, the bullying and the racism will stop.\u201d For a child to be so horrendously emotionally abused by her peers, would it not be apparent to her teachers? Remaining silent in such ordeals is unethical. But it should be stressed that those who have a duty of care, for instance teachers, could potentially be in breach of that duty when they refuse to acknowledge the emotional abuse of vulnerable Indigenous students or even partake in it. Ultimately, Indigenous people need their voices heard. Our colleagues and teachers must understand the power in their words and the harming affect their actions and inactions have. Failing to address your own and other\u2019s problematic behaviour can contribute to one\u2019s diminishing state of mind, especially in the case of vulnerable Indigenous children. According to Dr Tracy Westerman, for Indigenous people who suffer from depression, 30% of those cases can be attributed to racism. Those responsible for young Indigenous children and those who work with or manage Indigenous adults must remember how their action or inaction affects the Indigenous people they are affiliated with. This is not an issue of policing one\u2019s behaviour. This is an Indigenous woman who has been subject to such emotional abuse telling those who are interested enough to read this article, that empathy and compassion can save lives. Almost every protest the Indigenous community conducts is met with, \u201cWhat about the abuse of children?\u201d Yes, I am asking the same question. Even after writing this article, I know I\u2019ll be called out for my alleged deflection of the \u201creal issues\u201d. But the emotional abuse of Indigenous teenagers and children and those who allow such abuse is one of many very \u201creal issues\u201d. One that is so blatantly clear but so heavily ignored. \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

It takes little encouragement for little people to make a stomping-big impact, and books are an easy introduction to make the most of their curiosity and compassion for the world around them and beneath them. As Murphy says: \u201cYou must only take from this land what you can give back.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Just in case Australia was suffering post-election outrage withdrawal, rugby player Israel Folau has burst through the gap with his own special breed of neo-feudal theology to get the nation firing again. Folau\u2019s social media comments have unleashed a tsunami of outrage: from those offended by his blunt homophobia to those who are outraged that those who are offended would dare to impinge on his freedom to outrage them. There\u2019s the outraged sponsors concerned the comments could spark a backlash from angry consumers, pressuring Rugby Australia into a pre-emptive intervention that Folau, in turn, has taken offence to, sparking deeper waves of outrage by the authorities who have responded by tearing up his contract. But it doesn\u2019t stop here: there are the employment lawyers who are outraged that said employment contract could impinge so far into someone\u2019s personal life, not to mention the people who are outraged that a player on a million-dollar contract would ask outraged members of the public to demonstrate their anger by funding his legal challenges. Then there\u2019s the outrage at the outrage: the rightwing culture warriors outraged that Rugby Australia should presume to enter the culture war; and the left outraged that the cultural warriors are at it again. The Folau brouhaha is a case study in post-media media; a whirlpool of emotion that drives protagonists into the safety of their filter bubbles where they can whip up a frenzy, driving clicks in the legacy media and engagement on social platforms. And as the outrage peaks to 11, the Morrison government dusts off laws purporting to deal with the \u201ccrisis\u201d of religious freedom, which will surely fuel the next cycle of escalating outrage. What\u2019s missing from the whole thing, sadly, is a public square equipped to deal with the complexity of an issue that presents in many shades of grey. In a series of questions in this week\u2019s Essential Report, the public appears to be displaying a degree of nuance sorely lacking in the shoutiness of the current debate. A strong majority of respondents, across all voting groups, it should be added, reject the idea that religious freedom should be used as an excuse for abusing others. Yet a similarly strong majority are not comfortable with employment contracts that dictate what employees say outside work. People also support the idea that they should think through how their words can affect others, even if that means that people are less likely to say what they really think. What they don\u2019t support, however, is the need for stronger laws to protect people who express their religious views in public. This suggests a collective desire for a degree of common sense sadly lacking in the current cycle of outrage: that this is not a fight about absolutes, but an argument for individual self-moderation. A further round of statements takes this idea further. Rejecting the Brandian libertarianism that one has the \u201cright to be bigot\u201d, the public just wants Folau to recognise that his celebrity and his social media following carry with them levels of responsibility. Again these views are remarkably consistent across partisan lines. That\u2019s what this orgy of outrage really comes down to: not new attacks on personal freedoms but establishing norms for how one should behave in a digital world; especially when one has made a fortune playing a game that has given them a national profile. Rather than just getting angry, it\u2019s time we all recognised that what this is really all about is manners in a world where only the loudest cut through.

      "bodyText": "What is the deeming rate? The deeming rate is the amount the government deems your income to be from your financial assets. It calculates the amount of income received from a financial asset regardless of the actual return. This calculation is used for the pension income assessment and can affect how much someone receives through their pension. A pensioner can earn up to $172 a fortnight before their payments are reduced. The deeming rate for singles is 3.25% for assets over $51,200 and 1.75% for those under that threshold \u2013 but more detail on this later. Why are we talking about it? The Reserve Bank\u2019s decision to cut the official cash rate to 1% has put pressure on the government to cut the deeming rate accordingly. This is because the deeming rates are supposed to be set with regard to the returns available in the market from a variety of financial investments. The cash rate was 2.25% when the current deeming rates were set in 2015. Labor and seniors groups are calling on the government to act urgently, saying more than 600,000 people are being short-changed because the government is overestimating how much they\u2019re earning from their investments. When will it be changed? Soon. The government\u2019s expenditure review committee is understood to be reviewing options for change this week, after a recommendation for change was put forward by the new social services minister, Anne Ruston. But any change to the rate carries a significant budget cost \u2013 a quarter of a percentage point decrease in the deeming rate would cost the government at least $200m a year. There is also little chance that the government will relinquish its control of setting the rates, rejecting calls for it to be pegged to interest rates. How does it work? There are two deeming interest rates, a higher deeming rate and a lower deeming rate. The lower deeming rate applies up to what is called a deeming threshold. Everything above this threshold is deemed to earn the higher deeming rate. The deeming thresholds are different for singles and couples. For singles the threshold is $51,800, which is deemed to earn the lower deeming rate of 1.75%. For couples the threshold is $86,200 (combined), which is deemed to earn the lower deeming rate of 1.75%. Amounts above these thresholds are deemed to earn the higher deeming rate of 3.25%. Here is an example. A couple has financial assets of $172,388. The first $86,200 is deemed to earn 1.75% interest ($86,200 x 0.0175) = $1,508. The remaining balance ($86,188) is deemed to earn 3.25% interest ($86,188 x 0.0325) = $2,801.11 Total deemed annual earnings of $4,309 equals $165 a fortnight \u2013 this is the \u201cdeemed\u201d income. But if in reality the couple\u2019s assets are earning interest at a lower rate than the deeming rate, then the government would be overestimating their income, and making deductions to their pension accordingly. What payments are affected by deeming? The income test applies to service pensions, veteran payments, income support supplement, the age pension and the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. What are financial assets? Basically any financial asset, including cash in the bank, gold bullion, shares, managed investments and bonds. Real estate investments are not deemed to be financial assets under the test. How much more will pensioners get if the rate is changed? Labor analysis suggests that if the government matched the five interest rate cuts of the past four years, a single non-home-owning pensioner could be more than $3,000 better off, while couple home owners would see up to an extra $1,850.",

      "bodyText": "Conservatives within the Morrison government are campaigning for a religious freedom bill but less than half of Coalition voters argue that there should be stronger laws to protect people who express their religious views in public, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. While only 44% of Coalition voters would back a proposal like the one now being sought by a group of rightwingers in the government, support for the idea across all the voting cohorts is even more tepid, with only 38% backing the move (16% strongly and 22% somewhat). Clear majorities in the sample also agree with the statements \u201cit is only right that people consider how what they say can affect others\u201d (69%) and \u201cpeople should not be able to argue religious freedoms to abuse others\u201d (64%). While the poll suggests Australians are reluctant to codify freedom of religious expression, the latest poll also indicates Australians feel constrained in what they can say and are concerned about the capacity of employers to dictate behaviour outside working hours. A majority, 64%, agree that people now hesitate before saying what they really think because they are afraid of how others will react, and a majority, 58%, agree that employers should not have the right to dictate what their employees say outside of work. Coalition voters were more likely to feel their speech was constrained by negative reactions from others (74%) than other voting cohorts (61% of Labor voters and 47% of Greens voters). Older voters were also more likely to feel curbs on their expression (75% agreement from the over-55s compared with 62% of 35- to 54-year-olds and 52% of 18- to-34-year-olds). A majority of the sample, 68%, have been following the heavily publicised dispute between Israel Folau and Rugby Australia, triggered by a social media comment from Folau that asserted that gay people go to hell. But the headline-generating dispute has divided the sample, with respondents sharing nuanced views. Similar proportions in the survey report the dispute is mainly about Folau\u2019s freedom of speech and right to express his religious views (43%) and the more mundane issue of Folau breaching his employment contract (49%). Voters who support the Coalition are more likely to see the dispute as a free speech issue than a breach of contract issue (49% Coalition compared with 35% Labor and 28% Greens). A majority of voters in the sample agreed with the statements: \u201cIsrael Folau chose to share his religious views on social media and should take responsibility for them\u201d (68%) and \u201cIsrael Folau has used his public profile to attack a minority group in the community\u201d (51%). \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Only 34% of the sample agreed with the statement: \u201cIsrael Folau has the right to voice his religious views, regardless of the hurt it could cause others.\u201d A slightly higher percentage, 36%, disagreed with that statement. Coalition voters were more likely than Labor or Greens voters to agree that \u201cIsrael Folau has the right to voice his religious views, regardless of the hurt it could cause others\u201d (41% of Coalition voters agreed, compared with 30% of Labor voters and 20% of Greens). The attorney general, Christian Porter, has indicated cases like Folau\u2019s will be captured by the government\u2019s proposed religious discrimination bill. Porter told Guardian Australia this week that legislation will include a \u201cpowerful avenue\u201d for people of faith who face \u201cindirect\u201d unfair treatment. But Porter is holding firm against calls from conservative MPs to establish a religious freedom act, saying such legislation could see \u201csensitive public policy\u201d determined by the courts as it adjudicated competing rights. With the 46th parliament opening last week, voters were asked which groups in the community were the likely beneficiaries of the government\u2019s post-election policies. A majority thought big companies would do well under the re-elected government, while less than a third (28%) thought the government would be good for them and their families. Voters are also expecting that older Australians (38%), the environment (33%) and farmers and rural communities (33%) will have a bad time over the next three years as a result of the government\u2019s direction and policies. There has been controversy post-election about the reliability of opinion polling because none of the major surveys \u2013 Newspoll, Ipsos, Galaxy or Essential \u2013 correctly predicted a Coalition win on 18 May, projecting Labor in front on a two-party-preferred vote of 51-49 and 52-48. The lack of precision in the polling has prompted public reflection at Essential, as has been flagged by its executive director, Peter Lewis. Guardian Australia is not currently publishing measurements of primary votes or a two-party-preferred calculation.",

      "bodyText": "Representative Eric Swalwell dropped out of the 2020 presidential race. Some of the gajillion other Democratic candidates still fighting the good fight responded. Representative Justin Amash, the first Republican to back impeachment of President Trump, sent formal notification today that he is withdrawing his membership from the House Republican Conference and resigning from the House oversight and reform committee. The United Nations\u2019 human rights chief said she was \u201cappalled\u201d by the conditions migrants and refugees face in US detention facilities. Attorney general William Barr said he sees a way around the citizenship census question, but did not detail exactly what that plan was. Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein was charged with sex trafficking minors today, raising questions about his many powerful friends. President Bill Clinton has since issued a statement about his dealings with Epstein. Sir Kim Darroch, UK ambassador to Washington, was reportedly disinvited from dinner with the emir of Qatar. But Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots who was allegedly caught up in a Florida sex trafficking ring earlier this year, still got to keep his invite. The Associated Press is reporting that the State Department is proposing the sale of $2.2bn in arms to Taiwan, including 108 Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger surface-to-air missiles. The Chinese foreign ministry firmly opposes US arms sales to Taiwan, a self-governing island that China claims as its territory. Taiwan split from China in 1949. The State Department says the arms will help Taiwan \u201cmeet current and future regional threats.\u201d President Trump tweeted about California governor Gavin Newsom declaring a state of emergency following two large earthquakes in southern California. President Bill Clinton issued a statement on Jeffrey Epstein and the sex trafficking case against him: The Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration from asking about citizenship on the 2020 census. The Associated Press is reporting that attorney general William Barr sees a way to legally require 2020 census respondents answer the question. However, he would not detail said plan. If you\u2019ll recall back to June, when the Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision to reject the commerce department\u2019s justification for including the question, the court did not deem the question unconstitutional (though pro-democracy advocates have warned that a citizenship question would suppress participation among immigrant-aligned population and disenfranchise Democratic-leaning voters). The court ruled that the justification was not credible. The justification, as stated by commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, was to obtain better data to enforce the Voting Rights Act, the civil rights-era legislation against voter discrimination. From the Associated Press: Barr said he has been in regular contact with Trump over the issue of the citizenship question. \u201cI agree with him that the Supreme Court decision was wrong,\u201d the attorney general said. He said he believes there is \u201can opportunity potentially to cure the lack of clarity that was the problem and we might as well take a shot at doing that.\u201d Barr\u2019s statement comes after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused the Trump administration of having a goal of \u201cmaking America white again\u201d with its census question. Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are among a group of lawmakers proposing to declare climate change an official emergency. My colleague Emily Holden now has the text of that resolution: Read more about the resolution here: Remember Felix Sater? The Moscow-born businessman at the center of the Trump Tower Moscow project? The United Nations\u2019 human rights chief said she was \u201cappalled\u201d by the conditions migrants and refugees face in US detention facilities, the Associated Press is reporting. Children stopped by border agents should never be held in immigration detention facilities or separated from their families, said United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, and \u201cany deprivation of liberty of adult migrants and refugees should be a measure of last resort.\u201d A spokeswoman for the U.N. human rights office, Ravina Shamdasani, said Bachelet decided to speak out more forcefully than before after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general issued a report last week warning of dangerous conditions in U.S. immigration detention facilities. Many migrants and refugees set off on \u201cperilous journeys with their children in search of protection and dignity and away from violence and hunger,\u201d Bachelet said in a statement. \u201cWhen they finally believe they have arrived in safety, they may find themselves separated from their loved ones and locked in undignified conditions,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis should never happen anywhere.\u201d President Donald Trump said Sunday that migrants were coming from \u201cunbelievable poverty\u201d and \u201cthose are people that are very happy with what\u2019s going on because, relatively speaking, they\u2019re in much better shape right now\u201d in U.S. custody. He went on to praise the work of the Border Patrol and other law enforcement officers on the U.S.-Mexico border, saying, \u201cit\u2019s incredible what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019ve had to become nurses. They\u2019ve had to become janitors.\u201d The Homeland Security report was the second by the inspector general\u2019s office to blast conditions at temporary detention centers in Texas where migrants are held. The first, based on visits to Border Patrol facilities in western Texas in May, showed dozens of migrants packed into spaces so tight that some had to stand on toilets. It detailed how 900 migrants were in a 125-person facility at one point, with many held for weeks in violation of the government\u2019s policy. Last week\u2019s report, released July 2, said several Border Patrol facilities in south Texas were dangerously overcrowded. Detainees banged on cell windows, shouted and pressed notes to a window for inspectors, according to the report released July 2. A photo showed a man holding a piece of cardboard with one word: \u201chelp.\u201d Inspectors also warned that many children had no access to showers and were being detained long past the maximum of 72 hours. Five children have died in Border Patrol custody since December. \u201cAs a pediatrician, but also as a mother and a former head of state, I am deeply shocked that children are forced to sleep on the floor in overcrowded facilities, without access to adequate health care or food, and with poor sanitation conditions,\u201d Bachelet, a former president of Chile, said Monday. \u201cDetaining a child even for short periods under good conditions can have a serious impact on their health and development \u2014 consider the damage being done every day by allowing this alarming situation to continue,\u201d she said. Bachelet acknowledged the \u201csovereign prerogative\u201d of countries to set the conditions under which foreigners are permitted to enter and stay but also highlighted their human rights obligations. Her office said she recognized the \u201ccomplexity\u201d of challenges faced by migrants\u2019 countries of origin, the ones they travel through and destinations like the U.S. \u201cI\u2019m not going to the fucking White House,\u201d so says World Cup champion Megan Rapinoe, but what about the Senate? The House Judiciary Committee has released the written responses from the former chief of staff to former White House counsel Don McGahn: Downing Street responds to the statements from President Trump regarding UK ambassador Sir Kim Darroch and his leaked assessments of the administration: If you need a quick memory jog, Sir Kim Darroch is the UK ambassador to Washington. Leaked memos revealed Darroch\u2019s scathing assessment of the White House: \u201cWe don\u2019t really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept.\u201d For more on Darroch, read here: Representative Justin Amash, the first Republican to back impeachment of President Trump, sent formal notification today that he is withdrawing his membership from the House Republican Conference and resigning from the House oversight and reform committee. As House Democrats began issuing subpoenas for President Trump\u2019s financial records, the Justice Department fought a federal judge\u2019s decision to allow the lawsuit accusing Trump of profiting off the presidency to go forward, the Associated Press is reporting: Justice Department lawyers want an appeals court to take the case instead. They filed papers Monday seeking to move the case from federal court in D.C. to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia. They also want to stop subpoena requests seeking Trump\u2019s business tax returns, and documents from Trump\u2019s D.C. and New York hotels, Mar-a-Lago Club and Trump Tower. Justice Department lawyers said answering the 37 subpoena requests by July 29 would cause Trump irreparable injury. Our climate and environment reporter, Susie Cagle, listened in on President Trump\u2019s speech about \u201cmaintaining a healthy environment.\u201d Here are some choice quotes from the speech: \u201cI went to the fires in California. It\u2019s also management. It\u2019s a lot of things happening.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t have dirty floors \u2026. you can\u2019t have 20 years of leaves.\u201d \u201cI will say this, I spoke with the governor of California, and the process of cleaning is now really taking precedent. A lot of people are looking at forest management.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have any forest fires.\u201d (This is false) \u201cI spoke to certain countries - well-known countries - that say, \u2018We\u2019re a forest nation.\u2019 And they don\u2019t have problems....Because they manage, they clean.\u201d \u201cWhen I went to California, they sort of scoffed at me for the first two weeks, ... and after about five weeks they said, \u2018He\u2019s right.\u2019\u201d There\u2019s a lot to unpack there. First, take a read of this article, which will disprove many of the president\u2019s points: Fire management is important, but fires are also natural. Forest fires will happen, and experts say they\u2019ll happen more often with the climate crisis going the way it\u2019s going. The issue in California is that much of what is burning is not forest - it\u2019s inhabited areas. The top two Democratic presidential candidates weigh in on Representative Eric Swalwell dropping out of the race: Representative Eric Swalwell of California announced today that he will be ending his 2020 presidential bid. Hey all, Vivian Ho with the west coast bureau taking over for Tom McCarthy. Happy Monday. Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: Wealthy sex offender Jeffrey Epstein pleaded not guilty in federal court in New York to two counts of sex trafficking. Prosecutors accused him of victimizing dozens of girls as young as 14 and requested that he be detained pending trial. A bail hearing was set for Monday. Former friends hosted by Epstein at his homes or aboard his plane include Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Allen Dershowitz. \u201cToo often adults in our society have turned a blind eye to this type of criminal behavior alleged here,\u201d an FBI official in the case said. Epstein had earlier avoided prison by striking a sweetheart deal overseen by current labor secretary Alexander Acosta. The White House did not comment on Epstein\u2019s arrest. Trump tweeted that \u201cwe will no longer deal with\u201d British ambassador Kim Darroch after cables by Darroch critical of Trump were leaked. Trump also blamed PM Theresa May for the Brexit \u201cmess.\u201d Attorney general William Barr said he saw a legal way for the Trump administration to include a citizenship question on the US Census and said the Supreme Court was \u201cwrong\u201d to deny an earlier effort. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said the intention behind the proposed Census question was \u201cmaking America white again.\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign raised $19.1m in the second quarter of this year, besting Bernie Sanders. Donald Trump at the White House has just delivered a speech about \u201cmaintaining a healthy environment\u201d. You can watch it here (skip to 3:00 for Trump): Representative Eric Swalwell is holding a news conference. Earlier guidance was he would suspend his presidential campaign today to run again for congress. Update: that\u2019s what\u2019s happened. \u201cToday ends our presidential campaign.\u201d \u201cHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused President Donald Trump\u2019s administration Monday of having a goal of \u2018making America white again\u2019 with its plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census,\u201d Bloomberg reports: \u201cYou know his hat? \u2018Making America white again.\u2019 They want to make sure that people, certain people, are counted,\u201d Pelosi said at a press conference on election security. \u201cIt\u2019s really disgraceful and it\u2019s not what our founders had in mind.\u201d Read further. A last dispatch from Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s day in court, via Victoria Bekiempis: Several of Epstein\u2019s accusers were present at court for the proceedings. David Boies and Sigrid McCawley, lawyers for some of Epstein\u2019s accusers, lauded the arrest. Boies said \u201cour clients are extremely gratified.\u201d McCawley read statements from two Epstein accusers, Giuffre and Sarah Ransome, during a brief presser after the proceedings. In this statement, Giuffre said she was \u201cdeeply pleased\u201d by federal prosecutors\u2019 decision to arrest him, and said \u201cit is time for Jeffrey Epstein, and those who participated in these sex crimes, to be brought to justice.\u201d Ransome\u2019s statement, also read by McCawley, said \u201cthe news of my abuser\u2019s arrest today was a step in the right direction to finally hold Epstein accountable for his crimes and restore my faith that power and money can\u2019t triumph over justice.\u201d Ned Price, who served under Barack Obama as a special assistant to the president for national security affairs, said Trump\u2019s tweets about UK ambassador to the US Kim Darroch only reinforced Darroch\u2019s descriptions of Trump in private. \u201cThe UK ambassador didn\u2019t write anything that wasn\u2019t already patently obvious to an informed observer,\u201d Price said. \u201cHe spoke of Donald Trump as someone with thin skin, as someone with a delicate ego, as someone who would be receptive to pandering, and just look at Trump\u2019s reaction. \u201cHe has proved the ambassador right in every respect \u2014 by proving he is ego driven, by proving he is thin-skinned, and by proving he will quite literally refuse to deal with people who don\u2019t say nice things about him.\u201d Attorney General William Barr said Monday that he sees a legal path to adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census, despite a Supreme Court ruling that blocked its inclusion, at least temporarily, the AP reports: In an interview with The Associated Press, Barr said the Trump administration will take action in the coming days that he believes will allow the government to ask the controversial question. Barr would not detail the administration\u2019s plans, though a senior official said President Donald Trump is expected to issue a presidential memorandum to the Commerce Department instructing it to include the question. The Supreme Court\u2019s June ruling was a blow to Trump , who has been pressing for the government to ask about citizenship on next year\u2019s census. The U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s experts have said a question asking about citizenship would discourage immigrants from participating in the survey and result in a less accurate census. That in turn would redistribute money and political power away from Democratic-led cities where immigrants tend to cluster to whiter, rural areas where Republicans do well. Barr said he has been in regular contact with Trump over the issue. \u201cI agree with him that the Supreme Court decision was wrong,\u201d said Barr. He said he believes there is \u201can opportunity potentially to cure the lack of clarity that was the problem and we might as well take a shot at doing that.\u201d What Barr calls an innocent-sounding \u201clack of clarity\u201d on the administration\u2019s part, chief justice John Roberts saw as a \u201ccontrived\u201d \u201cdistraction\u201d from the administration\u2019s real reason for wanting the citizenship question, which Trump himself helpfully stated on Friday: \u201cNumber one, you need it for Congress \u2014 you need it for Congress for districting,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need it for appropriations \u2014 where are the funds going? How many people are there? Are they citizens? Are they not citizens? You need it for many reasons.\u201d \u201cDistricting.\u201d The commerce department had argued before the supreme court that the question was needed to improve data for the administration of the Voting Rights Act. Attorney General William Barr says Democrats are trying to create a \u201cpublic spectacle\u201d by subpoenaing Special Counsel Robert Mueller to testify before Congress about the Russia investigation, the AP reports: In an interview with The Associated Press, Barr says the Justice Department would support Mueller if he decides he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to subject himself\u201d to congressional testimony. Barr also says the Justice Department would seek to block any attempt by Congress to subpoena members of the special counsel\u2019s team. There is no indication that Mueller is planning to skip his July 17 appearance before Congress. He\u2019s said he will not go beyond his 448-page report released in April. Mueller no longer works for the Justice Department, but the department could attempt to limit his testimony about decisions he made as special counsel. The department of homeland security has asked the defense department to authorize 1,000 additional Texas National Guard troops \u201cto provide supplemental holding and port of entry enforcement support\u201d to US customs and border patrol efforts within Texas, CNN reports. A crisis of migrants detained in subhuman conditions at the border shows no signs of abating, writes Amanda Holpuch: Hundreds of children at a migrant detention center in Texas are being held in \u201cinhumane\u201d conditions that amount to an \u201cemergency public health crisis\u201d and should be allowed immediate access to doctors, according to an attorney who gained rare access to the facility. Elora Mukherjee, the director of Columbia Law School\u2019s immigrant rights clinic, was one of six attorneys to visit the detention center in Clint as part of ongoing litigation about an agreement that states unaccompanied children can\u2019t be held in US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities for more than 72 hours. The team found that children had no adequate access to medical care, had no basic sanitation, were exposed to extreme cold and did not have adequate access to drinking water or food. \u201cI\u2019ve been visiting children detained in federal immigration custody for 12 years,\u201d Mukherjee told the Guardian. \u201cI have never seen anything like this before. I have never seen, smelled, had to bear witness to such degrading and inhumane conditions.\u201d Read further: The president adds new reaction to the Kim Darroch telegrams. He blames Theresa May for creating a \u201cmess\u201d with Brexit, says Darroch \u201cis not liked\u2019 and \u201cwe will no longer deal with him\u201d, and then predicts a new incoming PM and says the queen impressed him most. Before a different judge in the Epstein case, Rossmiller, the assistant US attorney, is asked whether he anticipates \u201cother defendants\u201d (via Courthouse News): Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign raised $19.1m in the second quarter of this year, more than triple her total of the previous quarter. The number outran Bernie Sanders and was behind only the Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg campaigns \u2013 and she did it without holding fundraisers. Warren\u2019s campaign reported 384,000 donors, a $28 average donation and $19.7m cash on hand, the Washington Post said. Earlier today Jul\u00edan Castro, the former housing secretary, announced he had more than 130,000 individual donors, clearing a key threshold to qualify for future presidential debates. Read our recent coverage of the Warren campaign: \u201cOur country\u2019s in real trouble,\u201d Warren said, pacing as she spoke. \u201cA lot of trouble. \u201cSo what\u2019s it going to take to change that?\u201d she continued. \u201cBig, structural change.\u201d Alexandra Barker, the host of the event, couldn\u2019t agree more. \u201cIf things don\u2019t change, this is the home I\u2019ll sell to send him to college,\u201d she said, hugging her 11-year-old son, Ricky. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone who can actually get it done, I believe it\u2019s going to be her.\u201d More than six months into her presidential campaign \u2013 after holding 105 town halls, answering nearly 500 questions from voters and taking more than 35,000 selfies \u2013 the Massachusetts senator has emerged as a top-tier contender, and increasingly as the top choice of the American left, in the crowded race for the Democratic nomination. The hearing has adjourned to resume on Thursday, Courthouse News reports. Update: in a second hearing before a different judge, the bail hearing was moved to Monday. Epstein\u2019s lawyer, Reid Weingarten, is speaking in court, Courthouse News reports: The report continues: Rossmiller slams one of Weingarten\u2019s statements: \u201cSurely the concept of child prostitution is offensive\u201d and outside federal law. Rossmiller on Weingarten calling the conduct \u201cancient\u201d: The prosecutor notes that it is not beyond the statute of limitations. Weingarten then rose to assert that Epstein claimed \u201cThere\u2019s no statutory rape\u201d supplying graphic detail that might be triggering for some readers. Link to report here. Assistant US attorney Alex Rossmiller is arguing in court that Epstein must be detained prior to trial, saying \u201che\u2019s a man of nearly infinite means\u201d, Courthouse News reports: via Victoria Bekiempis in court: When asked to enter a plea, Epstein told the judge \u201cnot guilty, your honor,\u201d while maintaining an air of resigned stoicism. \u201cA fatigued-looking Jeffrey Epstein was just brought into the courtroom,\u201d reports Victoria Bekiempis from federal court in Manhattan. \u201cHe sported navy blue jail scrubs and his silver hair was messy.\u201d And then there were... something like 26? It looks like California Representative Eric Swalwell, who made combatting gun violence the central issue of his brief presidential campaign, will drop out of the race, the Los Angeles Times reports: But elsewhere today there have been reports that Tom Steyer, the billionaire hedge funder turned progressive philanthropist and environmentalist, has told people he\u2019s going to get into the race after all. Will it happen? For now let\u2019s call it a wash. In court documents, prosecutors describe \u201ca vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls\u201d seized at Epstein\u2019s Manhattan mansion. The document states in part: \u201cThe defendant, a registered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant; rather, he is a continuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting deeply serious charges\u201d. Another friend of Epstein: prominent Trump defender Allen Dershowitz: Dershowitz is the author of The Case Against Impeaching Trump. Asked to comment Saturday on Epstein\u2019s arrest, Dershowitz told the Daily Beast, \u201cI\u2019ll wait to see what the evidence is.\u201d Dershowitz also called the Miami Herald\u2019s reporting on Epstein \u201cFake News\u201d and mounted a public campaign against Pulitzer buzz for the reporting: Also from the Epstein news conference, William F Sweeney of the FBI criticized adults who \u201chave turned a blind eye to this type of criminal behavior,\u201d reports legal analyst and professor Jennifer Taub: Berman, the US Attorney in the southern district of New York (a Trump appointee, no less), praised the \u201cexcellent investigative journalism\u201d that helped his team build their case against Epstein. Dig into Julie K Brown\u2019s reporting here. When a reporter asked how Epstein could be prosecuted here given his non-prosecution agreement in the Southern District of Florida, Berman explained that the Florida non-prosecution agreement was only binding there, Victoria Bekiempis reports. Asked why the public corruption unit was investigating Epstein \u2013 potentially indicating the involvement of a government official at some level \u2013 Berman answered, \u201cI\u2019m not getting into staffing decisions at the US Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201d \u201cI have confidence that the public corruption unit is able to handle...as it has so many other matters.\u201d \u201cI will again urge you not to read into the unit assignment anything one way or the other.\u201d \u201cNude photographs of what appeared to be underage girls\u201d were seized at Epstein\u2019s residence, prosecutors say. Then they make the case for Epstein\u2019s detention: \u201cWe think he\u2019s a significant flight risk and that is why we are seeking detention pending trial. \u201cHe has enormous wealth.. and [the charges] carry with them a maximum sentence of 45 years in jail, which given Epstein\u2019s age is an effective life sentence.\u201d They note Epstein has two airplanes and lives much of the year abroad. It all adds up to a flight risk, they say. Prosecutors in Manhattan note that other high-profile individuals have been associates with Epstein in the past and there has been speculation about their potential involvement in the case. Prosecutors say they won\u2019t be commenting on any such speculation and that unwillingness to comment should not be taken one way or another. Maurene Comey, former FBI director James Comey\u2019s daughter, is among the prosecutors pursuing the case against Epstein, Victoria Bekiempis reports. She is present at the Manhattan US Attorney\u2019s press conference on Epstein\u2019s indictment. Berman said prosecutors will ask for Epstein to be detained pending his case. \u201cThe alleged behavior shocks the conscience and while the charged conduct is from a number of years ago, it is still profoundly important to the many alleged victims, now young women,\u201d Berman said at a press conference. \u201cThey deserve their day in court, and we are proud to be standing up for them by bringing this indictment.\u201d Manhattan US attorney Geoffrey Berman is addressing reporters. He says Epstein was arrested at Teterboro airport in New Jersey at 5:30pm Saturday. He says Epstein is suspected of exploiting and abusing \u201cdozens of victims\u201d \u201cas young as 14 years old at time of recruitment.\u201d He describes the victims as \u201cchildren who were asked to engage in direct or indirect sex acts in exchange for money\u201d while Epstein was two or three times their age. He says people, unnamed, failed to confront Epstein\u2019s criminal behavior. They \u201cturned a blind eye,\u201d Berman said. To the victims, Berman asks them \u201cto take a good look at this man.\u201d \u201cIf you have been victimized in any way, or if you are somebody who has additional information... we want to hear from you,\u201d Berman says. He walks potential victims through the phone tree they will navigate if they call the 1-800 number. \u201cThe Jeffrey Epstein case is number one on that list of major cases in the country.\u201d \u201cThere never was, nor will there be, an excuse for this kind of behavior.\u201d Victoria Bekiempis (vicbekiempis) is outside federal court in Manhattan awaiting a news conference expected to follow an appearance in court by accused child molester Jeffrey Epstein. The FBI has made a callout for potential victims. Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey Berman issued a statement on Epstein\u2019s indictment on two charges of sex trafficking: \u201cEpstein exploited girls who were vulnerable to abuse, enticed them with cash payments, and escalated his conduct to include sex acts, often occurring at his residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan,\u201d Berman said. \u201cWhile the charged conduct is from a number of years ago, the victims \u2013 then children and now young women \u2013 are no less entitled to their day in court. \u201cMy Office is proud to stand up for these victims by bringing this indictment.\u201d This is not far from the White House: Only three weeks to wait before the next Democratic presidential debate. This one will be hosted by CNN, which has announced, in a reality show twist worthy of the age of Trump, that the candidate lineup will be decided by live draw. Once again, the debate will be held over two nights, July 30-31, with half the field onstage each night. In the first debate pundits were split on whether Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s accidental exile in the land of also-rans \u2013 she was on a separate stage from Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg \u2013 helped her or hurt her. The second debate will be moderated by CNN journalists Dana Bash, Don Lemon and Jake Tapper. Democrats in the early presidential contest states of Iowa and Nevada will be able to cast their votes over the telephone instead of showing up at their states\u2019 traditional neighborhood caucus meetings next February, according to plans unveiled by the state parties, the AP reports. Only a handful of states are using caucuses to settle on a Democratic presidential candidate this year. Allowing voters to access caucuses by phone could change the dynamics of the process, which in the past has favored candidates with particularly enthused (not to mention able-bodied) followings because voters must show up in person and remain on-site, sometimes for hours, as the candidate is selected. AP: The tele-caucus systems, the result of a mandate from the Democratic National Committee, are aimed at opening the local-level political gatherings to more people, especially evening shift-workers and people with disabilities, whom critics of the caucuses have long said are blocked from the process. The changes are expected to boost voter participation across the board, presenting a new opportunity for the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 candidates to drive up support in the crucial early voting states. \u201cThis is a no-excuse option\u201d for participation, said Shelby Wiltz, the Nevada Democrats\u2019 caucus director.

A federal grand jury in New York is investigating top Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy, examining whether he used his position as vice chair of President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee to drum up business deals with foreign leaders, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press and people familiar with the matter. Last year it was revealed that Michael Cohen, Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer at the time, arranged for a $1.6m payment to a Playboy playmate in 2017 to keep secret her sexual relationship with Broidy. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, which took money from shell companies tied to foreign donors, was already under investigation in New York for allegedly harvesting money from donors and transferring it to friends and associates of the Trump family who had relatively small roles in the inauguration. The event took in and disbursed $107m. But the new investigation scrutinizes an alleged scheme by Broidy to capitalize on his post in another way, AP reports: A wide-ranging subpoena the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Brooklyn recently sent to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee seeks records relating to 20 individuals and businesses. All have connections to Broidy, his investment and defense contracting firms, and foreign officials he pursued deals with \u2014 including the current president of Angola and two politicians in Romania. Prosecutors appear to be investigating whether Broidy exploited his access to Trump for personal gain and violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it illegal for U.S. citizens to offer foreign officials \u201canything of value\u201d to gain a business advantage. Things of value in this case could have been an invitation to the January 2017 inaugural events or access to Trump. A statement released to the AP by Broidy\u2019s attorneys said that at no point did Broidy or his global security firm Circinus have a contract or exchange of money with \u201cany Romanian government agency, proxy or agent.\u201d It also said that while Circinus did reach an agreement with Angola in 2016 there was no connection whatsoever to the inauguration or Broidy\u2019s role on the inaugural committee. \u201cAny implication to the contrary is completely false,\u201d the statement said.

Court documents unsealed Monday show that Jeffrey Epstein is charged with creating and maintaining a network that allowed him to sexually exploit and abuse dozens of underage girls, the Associated Press reports [update: read the indictment here]: The alleged victims were as young as 14 at the time. Epstein was taken into custody on Saturday. Authorities say he paid underage girls for massages and then molested them at his homes in Florida and New York in the early 2000s. Read earlier. Epstein was expected to appear in Manhattan federal court later Monday. Melania Trump is headed to West Virginia for meetings about the opioid epidemic: In other first lady news, in case you missed it over the holiday weekend: A new indictment against Jeffrey Epstein, the wealthy financier and erstwhile friend of luminaries including Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Prince Andrew and others, has just been unsealed in New York, Victoria Bekiempis (@vicbekiempis) reports for the Guardian. Epstein faces two counts: sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking, for alleged encounters between 2002 and 2005. Epstein is being prosecuted in the southern district of New York. He avoided a prison sentence on similar charges in the early 2000s in a lenient plea deal that required him to pay restitution to victims and register as a sex offender. That deal was overseen by former Miami US Attorney and current Trump labor secretary Alexander Acosta. The White House has not commented on Epstein\u2019s arrest. In 2002, Trump called Epstein a \u201cterrific guy\u201d and mentioned his love of girls on the \u201cyounger side.\u201d There\u2019s buzz \u2013 unclear how much substance to it \u2013 about whether, as part of this new prosecution, Epstein might end up spilling stories about one or another of his powerful former friends. Hello and welcome to our live politics coverage. Hours after the USA triumphed in the Women\u2019s World Cup on Sunday, Donald Trump told reporters that the White House had not thought to invite the team for a visit, but would \u201clook at it\u201d. A couple weeks ago, however, the president invited the team to the White House in a tweet. On Sunday, Trump said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t really thought about it. We\u2019ll look at that,\u201d Voice of America reports. In June, Trump slammed team co-captain Megan Rapinoe, who had vowed never to visit Trump at home, and said: \u201cI am now inviting the TEAM, win or lose.\u201d Rapinoe, 34, repeated her vow not to visit the White House on Saturday. Asked about it by Agence France-Presse, she said: \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to everyone about it, obviously not myself, not Ali Krieger, and I suspect not many, if any, of the other players [would attend the visit].\u201d Trump has hosted many men\u2019s championship teams at the White House including minor division college football champions the North Dakota Bisons, whom Trump served fast food. Now the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has invited the team to the US Capitol: There\u2019s a lot of politics news out there this morning. Thank you for joining us ... perhaps from your office? To be fair, many of these elected officials will be busy running for president.",
