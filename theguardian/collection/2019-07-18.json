They cherish their daughters, but are struggling to cope. As well as dealing with the challenges of adoption, they are at the sharp end of a funding and provision crisis affecting thousands of families with children who have special educational needs and disabilities (Send). In May the family moved from rural Pembrokeshire to Buckinghamshire to be closer to relatives who could offer support \u2013 they have two older children and five grandchildren \u2013 and to be in an area more accessible for wheelchair users. Since moving, however, the girls have been unable to go to school because no places have been available; they have been unable to register for summer holiday activities, having missed the deadline; and they are even struggling to get around their rented bungalow while waiting for ramps to be fitted. \u201cThis is anything but an inclusive society,\u201d said Jan.

      "bodyText": "County councils across England are warning that the cost of covering special needs education is breaking their budgets, with local authorities overspending by more than \u00a3100m last year to meet the sharp rise in demand. Research by the County Councils Network found that some councils had recorded a 90% increase in young people being given care plans requiring special support, with 27 county councils overspending by a total of \u00a3123m in 2018-19 at a time when local authority purses are under severe pressure. MPs on the education select committee have published a report on school funding in England that calls for \u00a31.2bn to fill the deficit in provision for special educational needs and disabilities (Send). The county councils said the number of young people on education, health and care plans (EHCPs) requiring additional support in their areas had risen by 50,000 in five years following reforms introduced by the 2014 Children and Families Act. Carl Les, Conservative leader of North Yorkshire county council and the network\u2019s spokesman on children\u2019s services, said the 2014 reforms \u2013 which raised the age limit for statutory support to 25 \u2013 had been \u201cwell intentioned\u201d but were causing severe difficulties. \u201cAdditional demand \u2026 has created a financial crisis for some local authorities, with huge rises seeing costs spiral out of control,\u201d he said. \u201cCounties already face a funding gap of \u00a321.5bn over the next five years, and if we continue to overspend at the level we have done it will break many of our budgets.\u201d Les added that the cost burden was falling on other service areas, with local authorities shifting funds from \u201cmainstream pupils\u201d and reducing preventive services \u2013 an approach that would \u201conly store up problems for the future\u201d. Councils would be forced to make further compromises on their quality of service, he added. \u201cThis is why we are urging the new government to urgently inject funding into special education.\u201d With the number of children and young people on EHCPs rising from 240,000 in 2015 to 354,000 this year, the impact on county councils has been repeated across England. The network\u2019s call was echoed by the Commons education select committee, whose report on school funding calls for a 10-year settlement along the lines of that agreed for the NHS last year. It recommends an immediate increase of \u00a3760 per student in further education colleges to \u201curgently address underfunding\u201d in the sector, with FE and sixth-form colleges among the hardest hit by funding contractions, and a \u201cmultibillion-pound investment\u201d in schools. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP who chairs the education committee, said he wanted \u201ca proper 10-year plan and long-term funding settlement\u201d for school budgets. \u201cThere is a crisis of confidence in the ability of mainstream schools to provide adequate Send support. This needs to be tackled through increased school funding to support better early intervention,\u201d he said. Jules White, a secondary school headteacher who helped found the Worth Less? group to lobby for better funding, welcomed the call for an increase in per-pupil funding and said there was an urgent need for more support for special needs education. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a devastating report and the Department for Education and wider government should be ashamed that they have failed to publicly recognise and then adequately address a funding crisis that\u2019s having severe ramifications for the most disadvantaged children and all schools across the country.\u201d",

By 2020 Coca-Cola intends to spend $12bn (\u00a39.5bn) on marketing its products across Africa, in contrast to WHO\u2019s total annual budget in 2017 of $4.4bn, they write. Watt said: \u201cSugar consumption is the primary cause of tooth decay. The UK population is consuming far too much sugar \u2013 considerably higher than the Department of Health and WHO recommends. \u201cA particular concern is the high levels of sugar in processed commercial baby foods and drinks which encourage babies and toddlers to develop a preference for sweetness in early life. We need tighter regulation and legislation to restrict the marketing and promotion of sugary foods and drinks if we are to tackle the root causes of oral conditions.\u201d Cristin Kearns, of the University of California, San Francisco, and Prof Lisa Bero, of the University of Sydney, warn in a linked commentary of financial links between dental research organisations and the processed food and drink industries. \u201cEmerging evidence of industry influence on research agendas contributes to the plausibility that major food and beverage brands could view financial relationships with dental research organisations as an opportunity to ensure a focus on commercial applications for dental caries interventions \u2013 such as xylitol, oral hygiene instruction, fluoridated toothpaste and sugar-free chewing gum \u2013 while deflecting attention from harm caused by their sugary products,\u201d they write.",

So it is clear that we need to do more. The UK has some of the most generous maternity leave allowances in the world, but we only guarantee new dads and same-sex partners a fortnight off work \u2013 making it harder for them to bond with their child and care for their partner, and implying that it is the lot of the mother to be the primary caregiver.\u201d</p> <p>May says giving fathers longer leave and better pay to spend time with their newborns will not only benefit children but equalise men and women\u2019s roles both at home and in the workplace.</p> <p>\u201cCaring for children is a shared responsibility and means that employers will not be able to make assumptions about who will take on childcare responsibilities when a couple starts a family.\u201d </p> <p>She says she was deeply affected by a visit to Alder Hay Children\u2019s hospital when she met parents whose babies had been born prematurely or suffered complications, and the fathers were worried they would need to return to work before their newborns got home. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair and it\u2019s not right. These are issues close to my heart and I\u2019m proud that today\u2019s consultation \u2013 the next evolution of the shared parental leave policy that I started long ago \u2013 is one of my final acts as prime minister.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May is throwing down the gauntlet to her successor, pushing for fathers to have more time with their newborns. Writing in the Guardian she says she hopes that better paternity leave and time off work to care for premature infants will be one of her lasting legacies as prime minister. She says the status quo is holding back women and reinforcing the gender pay gap. She writes: \u201cMore often than not it is the mother who cuts her hours or opts to works flexibly, the mother who decides not to go for promotion, the mother who stays at home when the child is ill. \u201cMuch of the gender pay gap can be traced back to the balance of childcare responsibilities, while the lack of women in senior positions is partly caused by the fact that mothers, much more than fathers, are too often expected to juggle careers with caring.\u201d May says that division is not inevitable but that policy is \u201cnot sending fathers the correct message when our current leave allowances give women 26 times more leave than men\u201d. On Friday the government will launch a consultation on changes to parental leave entitlements, one of May\u2019s last acts as prime minister and which will have to be enacted by her successor. The proposal envisages a longer period of paternity leave as well as a new neonatal leave entitlement for parents of premature and sick babies who need to spend a prolonged period in hospital. May says she believes the choice offered to parents by shared parental leave was gradually starting to shift societal attitudes about who should stay home with a baby, but that the slow uptake makes it clear the government has to go further. \u201cAll too often it is still mothers, not fathers, who shoulder the burden of childcare. So it is clear that we need to do more. The UK has some of the most generous maternity leave allowances in the world, but we only guarantee new dads and same-sex partners a fortnight off work \u2013 making it harder for them to bond with their child and care for their partner, and implying that it is the lot of the mother to be the primary caregiver.\u201d May says giving fathers longer leave and better pay to spend time with their newborns will not only benefit children but equalise men and women\u2019s roles both at home and in the workplace. \u201cCaring for children is a shared responsibility and means that employers will not be able to make assumptions about who will take on childcare responsibilities when a couple starts a family.\u201d She says she was deeply affected by a visit to Alder Hay Children\u2019s hospital when she met parents whose babies had been born prematurely or suffered complications, and the fathers were worried they would need to return to work before their newborns got home. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair and it\u2019s not right. These are issues close to my heart and I\u2019m proud that today\u2019s consultation \u2013 the next evolution of the shared parental leave policy that I started long ago \u2013 is one of my final acts as prime minister.\u201d",

The former Brexit secretary, David Davis, was among those to offer strident criticism of the decisions, saying the government had failed to outlaw torture as it published fresh guidance on the treatment of detainees abroad. He was joined by the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, who said the move represented a \u201cfundamental error of judgment\u201d and accused the prime minister, Theresa May, of reneging on promises made by her predecessor. Almost a year after parliament was told there would be a response to calls for an inquiry within 60 days, the Cabinet Office secretary, David Lidington, said it was not necessary to carry out any further investigations and that the government was under no legal obligation to do so. Lidington\u2019s statement was condemned in the Commons by former Tory ministers, including Davis, who said the decision would be subject to legal challenge. Dan Dolan, a deputy director of the civil liberties organisation Reprieve, accused the government of breaking its promise to parliament, the public and those who had been tortured during the so-called war on terror. He said: \u201cTweaked Whitehall guidance doesn\u2019t provide redress for victims, most of whom remain in the dark as to the government\u2019s role in their mistreatment. \u201cBy refusing to deliver on its commitment to hold a fully independent inquiry, the government has failed to fulfil its legal responsibility to independently investigate allegations of torture and hold those responsible to account. \u201cReprieve is exploring legal action to challenge this decision.\u201d Thornberry said: \u201cIf the government is so confident that all of the lessons of the past have been learned, that all of the abuses of the past cannot be repeated, and that the new procedures and rules announced today prohibit any breach of UK and international law, then what exactly do they have to fear by allowing a judge to look into this issue, to examine all the evidence, interview all the witnesses and look at those new procedures and rules?\u201d Moazzam Begg, the outreach director at the campaign group Cage, said: \u201cCage and former prisoners have participated in multiple processes \u2013 through the courts, the police, judges who have led government-appointed inquiries, and even the parliamentary intelligence and security committee. \u201cAll of them have confirmed and accepted that UK officials have been both complicit in, and turned a blind eye to, torture. \u201cDespite survivors of torture seeking justice and accountability for almost two decades, the government has shown repeatedly, and today confirmed, that it simply does not hold itself to the values it claims to promote.\u201d Last year, parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee found that the UK had planned, agreed or financed 31 rendition operations.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 19 July. Top stories The federal agency that manages the Great Barrier Reef has made an unprecedented call for urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, warning only the \u201cstrongest and fastest possible action\u201d will reduce the risks to the natural wonder. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has published a climate position statement that says the reef is already damaged from warming oceans and it is \u201ccritical\u201d global temperature increases remain within 1.5 degrees. \u201cOnly the strongest and fastest possible action on climate change will reduce the risks and limit the impacts of climate change on the reef,\u201d the authority said. \u201cFurther loss of coral is inevitable and can be minimised by limiting global temperature increase to the maximum extent possible.\u201d New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern will raise the deportation of Kiwis from Australia on character grounds when she meets Scott Morrison on Friday, saying the issue was having a \u201ccorrosive\u201d effect on relations between the neighbouring countries. Ardern will hold talks with the Australian prime minister on Friday morning and the issue will be discussed alongside terrorism, trade and the Pacific step-up. \u201cWe have seen cases where there is also almost no connection of an individual to New Zealand who have been deported,\u201d she told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday. \u201cAnd it\u2019s having a corrosive effect on our relationship.\u201d The 2014 changes to Australian law mandated the automatic cancellation of a visa for anyone sentenced to 12 months or more in jail. In the past five years more than 4,000 people have been stripped of their Australian visa and returned to their country of birth, regardless of how long ago they left. New Zealanders have made up the vast bulk of the deportations. The federal government is preparing to unveil \u201cambitious\u201d new recycling targets to kickstart the waste market. The targets will require all states and territories to spend a portion of their procurement budgets on recycled materials for public projects. The move is aimed at kickstarting a domestic commercial market for Australian waste, responding to a growing crisis in the sector after China stopped importing plastic recyclables, and after other south-east Asian countries, including Indonesia, rejected shipments of Australian waste. World Donald Trump has said that a US warship destroyed an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz, amid heightened tensions between the two countries. The US president said the USS Boxer took defensive action after the drone came within 900 metres of the warship and ignored multiple calls to stand down. Iran has meanwhile offered a deal with the US in which it would formally and permanently accept enhanced inspections of its nuclear programme, in return for the permanent lifting of US sanctions. The European commission\u2019s new president has said a hard Brexit would have \u201cmassively negative consequences\u201d for both Britain and the EU, and said Brussels could provide emergency help for nations such as Ireland that bear the brunt of such an outcome. British MPs have given Boris Johnson a brutal preview of the scale of the challenge facing his premiership, as Conservative rebels voted to block any attempt to suspend parliament in order to force through a no-deal Brexit. An arson attack on an anime studio in Japan has left at least 33 people dead and dozens injured in Japan\u2019s worst mass murder in nearly two decades. The perpetrator, who was also injured, has been taken into police custody. A court in Cyprus has remanded 12 Israeli youths in custody on suspicion of the alleged rape of a 19-year-old British tourist at a holiday resort on the island. The youths, aged between 16 and 18, are alleged to have raped the woman in a hotel room in Ayia Napa, a resort on the south-eastern coast. Opinion and analysis A recent drop in tampon sales has been linked to women using contraceptive methods that stop, or lighten their periods, writes Nicola Davis. \u201cFor some, it is about bringing an end to debilitating pain or dark thoughts. For others, it is as simple as being liberated from the sinking realisation that you need a tampon \u2013 but you left them in your other handbag. When a new wave of feminist authors and activists are calling on women to embrace their periods, the idea that some do not want a monthly bleed and are seeking to avoid having them altogether can seem radical.\u201d Nothing messes you up quite so royally as becoming Insta-famous, writes Verity Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s just as bad as genuine fame, only without the public fawning or free Fendi sports bras to soften your descent into self obsession, insecurity and casual bitchiness. Of course you don\u2019t realise it. You\u2019re busy preaching love, harmony and laxative tea. Plus you\u2019re distracted by every brick wall or passing dog that you could drag in to your #candid shots of you laughing maniacally while holding a conveniently placed (and delicious!) protein shake.\u201d Sport Caitlin Bassett has shot Australia to a narrow Netball World Cup win over New Zealand. The 193cm spearhead, who came into the sixth match of this tournament with 132 goals from 145 attempts at 91% accuracy, shot 37/41 at 90% and led the Diamonds to a heart-stopping 50-49 win. The first day of women\u2019s Test cricket in two years concluded with the series pendulum still firmly in favour of Australia, who clocked up 265 runs for the loss of only three wickets. \u201cEngland were yet again undone by a patient effort from Ellyse Perry, who finished unbeaten on 84 after a century partnership with Rachael Haynes for the fourth wicket, in an innings that has already sparked comparisons to her 213 not out on the last occasion of this kind, at North Sydney in 2017,\u201d writes Raf Nicholson. The Wallabies will play South Africa in their opening Rugby Championship test in Johannesburg on Saturday (Sunday morning AEST). There, Michael Cheika will reveal the biggest secret of his coaching career. But how much of the new attacking strategy should the coach show and how much should he keep up his sleeve for the World Cup in Japan? Thinking time: The little Australian dish that could Around the world more than 600 million people were glued to TV screens. Coordinated by Tom Reid, tracking stations at Australia\u2019s Honeysuckle Creek, Tidbinbilla and Parkes, and their combined staff of almost 200, would be responsible for maintaining all communications with Apollo 11 during the crucial moon walk phase. These communications included the televising of Neil Armstrong\u2019s first step and the monitoring of his heartbeat and respiration rate as he did so, while at the same time enabling him to give Mission Control a second-by-second description of his progress. As Armstrong crawled backwards across the Eagle\u2019s porch towards the top rung of the ladder, Reid realised that the TV broadcast from the moon would begin some minutes before it rose over the Parkes dish at its lowest angle of 30 degrees above the horizon. There was a chance that Parkes\u2019 off-axis receiver might get a TV signal before that. But Tom knew that this signal would be unstable, possibly jerky, and prone to drop in and out. It would not be up to Mission Control\u2019s broadcast standard. Media roundup The Australian\u2019s splash this morning is Nothing to fear from \u2018indigenous voice\u2019, as former high court chief justice Murray Gleeson declares a \u201cnew Indigenous \u2018voice to parliament\u2019 could be created through legislation \u2013 with only minimal references in the constitution \u2013 without eroding the power of the nation\u2019s politicians\u201d. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that a fourth Sydney unit block has been abandoned. The NT News warns: Beware the crack-odiles, as it reveals: \u201cThe Territory\u2019s Power and Water Corporation is monitoring crocs and other animals that frequent Darwin\u2019s waste ponds to ensure they are not being affected by drugs and other substances flushed down the loo.\u201d Coming up There will be a case management hearing for former Labor MP Emma Husar who is suing BuzzFeed for defamation over an article and two social media posts.

And I think that he has a responsibility for that environment.\u201d The 2020 presidential candidate and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders was one of the first to offer his support to Omar, accusing the president of \u201cstoking the most despicable and disturbing currents in our society\u201d and called him the \u201cmost dangerous president in the history of our country\u201d. The California senator and 2020 Democratic candidate Kamala Harris labeled the behavior as vile, cowardly and racist. The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who is also a leading 2020 Democratic candidate, said impeachment proceedings against Trump must begin. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to divide us and distract from his own crimes, and from his deeply unpopular agenda of letting the wealthy and well-connected rip off the country. We must do more,\u201d Warren said. But Trump attempted to distance himself from the chant on Thursday, saying he \u201cwas not happy\u201d with the phrase, which was reminiscent of the \u201clock her up\u201d rallying cry against his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. The president said he thought he ended the chant at the rally, saying \u201cI felt badly about it.\u201d But video shows him pausing his remarks and not admonishing his supporters. He added he \u201cwould certainly try\u201d to stop the chant in future. Omar, of Minnesota, arrived in the United States at age 12 as a refugee of war from Somalia and was naturalized as a US citizen as a child. Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley and Tlaib were born in the US. Omar reacted to the chants with a tweet on Wednesday evening, in which she quoted a poem by Maya Angelou: \u201cYou may shoot me with your words, You may cut me with your eyes, You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I\u2019ll rise.\u201d She later posted: \u201cI am where I belong, at the people\u2019s house and you\u2019re just gonna have to deal.\u201d Some Democrats voiced fears for Omar\u2019s safety following the chants. \u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear to me that her life is in imminent danger,\u201d Bobby Rush, a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus, told Politico. \u201c[Trump] has threatened the safety of a member of Congress. That takes this to a whole different level.\u201d The civil rights leader Jesse Jackson accused Trump of \u201cputting targets on the backs\u201d of the four congresswomen. Republican reaction to the moment in Wednesday night\u2019s rally has been much less robust, with only a handful chiming in. The former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld said he challenged \u201cevery Republican to watch Donald Trump\u2019s rally last night, complete with chants of \u2018Send her back\u2019, and ask if that is the Party of Lincoln and Reagan we signed up for\u201d. Weld, who is mounting a highly improbable primary challenge against Trump for the Republican nomination for president ahead of the 2020 election, continued: \u201cWe are in a fight for the soul of the GOP, and silence is not an option.\u201d The Fox News host Laura Ingram chided the media for \u201cconjured up\u201d outrage over the chant and for \u201cfram[ing] the entire rally around this one section of the crowd\u2019s reaction\u201d. Meanwhile, leading British politicians including Jeremy Corbyn and London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, were among thousands to sign a letter of support for the Squad created by the anti-racist charity Hope Not Hate. The letter described the four US congresswomen as \u201cthe best of America\u201d, and condemns Trump\u2019s \u201cblatant, unashamed racism\u201d. Going after the four Democratic congresswomen one by one, a combative Trump turned his campaign rally into an extended dissection of their liberal views. All of the women are progressives within the Democratic party, and advocate for left-leaning policies which Trump has caricatured as \u201csocialist\u201d and un-American. \u201cTonight I have a suggestion for the hate-filled extremists who are constantly trying to tear our country down,\u201d Trump told the crowd in North Carolina, a swing state he won in 2016 and wants to claim again in 2020. \u201cThey never have anything good to say. That\u2019s why I say: \u2018Hey if you don\u2019t like it, let \u2019em leave, let \u2019em leave.\u2019\u201d Eager to rile up his base with the some of the same kind of rhetoric he targeted at minorities and women in 2016, Trump declared on Wednesday night: \u201cI think in some cases they hate our country.\u201d Hours before Trump\u2019s rally on Wednesday, the US House of Representatives killed an attempt to impeach Trump, with 137 Democrats joining Republicans to table a vote on articles of impeachment brought by the Texas congressman Al Green. \u201cTabling\u201d the impeachment articles means they are, in effect, dead. Ninety-five Democrats voted to advance the impeachment resolution, which blasted Trump for bringing \u201cdisgrace\u201d on the presidency by issuing racist tweets last Sunday. Many Democrats said they agreed with the sentiment, but the caucus followed the lead of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who said multiple investigations into the president, his associates and their activities should play out before impeachment could be considered. The vote provided an early snapshot of just how divided Democrats are over ousting Trump, as the 2020 presidential and congressional campaigns heat up. The question has split the Democratic caucus between the progressive wing, which has called for it forcefully, and the leadership, which has cautioned that impeachment could backfire. Some Democratic strategists think impeaching Trump could galvanize Republicans and increase his chances of re-election. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 July 2019. An earlier version said Ilhan Omar arrived in the US at the age of eight. She actually arrived at the age of 12.",

      "bodyText": "Campaigners have welcomed the government\u2019s stated intention to add the Paralympic Games to the list of sporting events that must be screened live on free-to-air television in the UK, with ministers also considering whether to ensure major women\u2019s sporting events remain accessible to all. The protected list of so-called \u201ccrown jewels\u201d events that have to be shown on terrestrial TV has not changed substantially since it was introduced more than 20 years ago. The list is dominated by male and able-bodied sports, such as football\u2019s World Cup and European Championship, the FA Cup final and the Rugby Union World Cup final. Some sporting events can be shown live on pay-TV, as long as highlights are made available to free-to-air channels. The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, has now announced his intention to add the Paralympics to the list of protected events, while also consulting later this year on whether to protect the Women\u2019s (football) World Cup and other women\u2019s sports. The women\u2019s football tournament, which concluded earlier this month \u2013 and in which England reached the semi-finals \u2013 achieved record rating figures on the BBC. Tanni Grey-Thompson, the 11-time Paralympic champion, said the move would be fantastic for disabled people and girls and women. \u201cIt\u2019s important that people are able to see those sports on TV, know about them and share them.\u201d Lady Grey-Thompson added the Paralympic Games had always been shown on terrestrial TV, but adding the contest to the list showed \u201cthat the government wants to protect it. It shows the government takes these events really seriously.\u201d Wendy Hawk, interim CEO of the charity Women in Sport,said she supported the announcement, but urged the government to include more women\u2019s sporting events. \u201cVisibility is crucial in helping to raise the profile of women\u2019s sport but also to normalise it, breaking down gender stereotypes through inspirational and positive role models \u2013 all of which is vital for grassroots sport participation and engaging the next generation of girls,\u201d she added. The culture secretary has the power to add to or remove from the list at any time, although it is largely unchanged from 1998. Under the terms of the law, broadcast rights to these events must be offered to the main free-to-air terrestrial broadcasters on \u201cfair and reasonable terms\u201d. The government made clear it has no desire for a wholesale reappraisal of the list, meaning there is no prospect of the government forcing cricket to return to free-to-air services despite the success of Sky\u2019s decision to allow the Cricket World Cup final to be shown on Channel 4. Instead the focus will be on ensuring equality between men\u2019s and women\u2019s sports, while bringing disability sport in line with its able-bodied equivalents. The success of the BBC\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup coverage and Channel 4\u2019s Paralympics coverage have raised the prospect of commercial pay-TV providers being interested in buying broadcast rights in future. Mike Sharrock, chief executive of the British Paralympic Association, said: \u201c We have been advocating for some time that the Paralympic Games should be treated in the same way as the Olympic Games and always be available on free-to-air TV. This is a significant moment for a nation that is proud to be the home of Paralympic sport.\u201d Earlier this month Ofcom changed the rules stipulating which channels count as free-to-air, meaning providers can meet their requirements by showing events on BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Four, CBBC, CBeebies, BBC News, BBC Parliament, ITV, ITV2, ITV3, ITV4, Channel 4, More 4 and Film 4. The list as it stands Group A \u2013 live coverage must be offered to free-to-air broadcasters The Olympic Games. The Fifa World Cup. The FA Cup Final. The Scottish FA Cup Final. The Grand National. The Derby. The Wimbledon Tennis Finals. The European Football Championship. The Rugby League Challenge Cup Final. The Rugby Union World Cup Final. Group B \u2013 live coverage can be provided by pay-TV broadcasters as long as highlights packages are offered to free-to-air broadcasters Cricket Test Matches played in England. Non-finals play at Wimbledon. All other matches in the Rugby Union World Cup. Six Nations Rugby tournament matches involving home countries. The Commonwealth Games. The World Athletics Championship. The Cricket World Cup \u2013 the final, semi-finals and matches involving home nations. The Ryder Cup. The Open Golf Championship.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m the centre of attention,\u201d insisted Rory McIlroy before a ball was struck in this, the 148th Open Championship. Well, he is now \u2013 for reasons far removed from the fairytale scenario in which McIlroy would raise the Claret Jug at the venue where he excelled as a 16-year-old. Such a memorable occasion for Northern Ireland instantly lurched towards calamity for one of its most celebrated sons.</p> <p>One of the most extraordinary \u2013 and extraordinarily damaging \u2013 rounds of McIlroy\u2019s career began with an eight and finished with a seven. The 30-year-old\u2019s 79, eight over par, on the Open\u2019s historic return to Royal Portrush leaves him embroiled in a desperate scrap to make the cut. The last time McIlroy opened golf\u2019s oldest major with this score, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/19/rory-mcilroy-open-missed-cut\" title=\"\">in 2013</a>, he lasted only two days. In four subsequent Open appearances before this wounding day on the north coast of Antrim, McIlroy had not scored higher than 71. McIlroy has not so much drifted as sunk, from one of the short-priced Open favourites to a 400-1 outsider. This was not in anyone\u2019s script.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/18/rory-mcilroy-choked-the-open\">Rory McIlroy\u2019s talk of resilience cannot disguise horrible Open choke | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is doubtful whether there has ever been a McIlroy scorecard like this one. It featured two birdies, 12 pars, a bogey, double bogey, triple bogey and quadruple bogey. To his credit, the four-times major winner undertook media duties and sought to explain how the \u201csimple stuff\u201d went awry. Privately, he must be devastated about what transpired in front of such an expectant audience.</p> <p>\u201cI definitely think if I can put the ball in the fairway tomorrow I can shoot a good enough score to be around for the weekend,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cObviously I\u2019m pretty sure anyone starting with a 79 in this golf tournament doesn\u2019t think about winning at this point. But I think I can go out there and shoot something in the mid-60s, be around for the weekend, and then try to play good from there.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give a very good account of myself out there. And I can definitely play better, as all of you know.\u201d Indeed we do, which made this situation such a head-scratcher. McIlroy did not sugarcoat an \u201cinexcusable\u201d missed putt from tap-in range at the 16th.</p> <p>When walking to the 2nd tee, McIlroy was already eight from the lead. By close of play on a squally day, he sat 13 shots adrift of the front-running JB Holmes. Shane Lowry returned an impressive 67 to lie within one of Holmes\u2019s five-under tally. Holmes has something of a curious Open record, with a third-place finish at Troon in 2016 leaping out among a string of missed cuts and the making up of numbers. In his past six starts on the PGA Tour, Holmes has not lasted beyond Friday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02f9370f895770e8043e6a5df78544c8d23590bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02f9370f895770e8043e6a5df78544c8d23590bf/700_464_3913_2347/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory McIlroy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">More anguish for Rory McIlroy after a double bogey at the 16th.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In another unquestionable blow to the profile of the Open\u2019s staging at Portrush for the first time in 68 years, Tiger Woods joined McIlroy in the gallery of infamy. Woods\u2019s struggles, that said, were far less of a surprise. The Masters champion winced at impact on his opening tee shot; there was further cause for Woods to grimace as he reached the turn in 41. Woods, unfamiliar with these surroundings and visibly fragile, laboured towards a 78.</p> <p>Pre-tournament, little was made of the fact Lowry had tasted success here, as an amateur in the North of Ireland Championship. The man from Offaly is comfortable on links courses and enjoying one of the finest seasons of his professional career. It would be no shock whatsoever should Lowry at least remain prominent for another three days.</p> <p>\u201cI think four under is a great score on that course and I\u2019ll take it any day,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cI was probably as nervous as I\u2019ve been in quite a while on the 1st tee, almost ever, I\u2019d say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/mcilroy_first_hole/giv-3902rPAUKYiEGvgO/\" data-alt=\"Rory McIlroy's nightmare start\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/mcilroy_first_hole/giv-3902rPAUKYiEGvgO/\">Rory McIlroy's nightmare start</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cLook, nerves are a good thing, aren\u2019t they? It\u2019s where you want to be. I just hope I\u2019m nervous on Sunday afternoon out there. It\u2019s right where you want to be and you have to tell yourself that when you\u2019re there. Where would you rather be? Would you rather be here or sitting at home watching on TV?\u201d</p> <p>A string of illustrious names are well placed. Sergio Garc\u00eda, Jon Rahm, Alex Noren, Tyrrell Hatton, Tommy Fleetwood and Brooks Koepka are among the group at three under par. Garcia has endured a dismal time in majors since winning one, the Masters of 2017.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m the centre of attention,\u201d insisted Rory McIlroy before a ball was struck in this, the 148th Open Championship. Well, he is now \u2013 for reasons far removed from the fairytale scenario in which McIlroy would raise the Claret Jug at the venue where he excelled as a 16-year-old. Such a memorable occasion for Northern Ireland instantly lurched towards calamity for one of its most celebrated sons. One of the most extraordinary \u2013 and extraordinarily damaging \u2013 rounds of McIlroy\u2019s career began with an eight and finished with a seven. The 30-year-old\u2019s 79, eight over par, on the Open\u2019s historic return to Royal Portrush leaves him embroiled in a desperate scrap to make the cut. The last time McIlroy opened golf\u2019s oldest major with this score, in 2013, he lasted only two days. In four subsequent Open appearances before this wounding day on the north coast of Antrim, McIlroy had not scored higher than 71. McIlroy has not so much drifted as sunk, from one of the short-priced Open favourites to a 400-1 outsider. This was not in anyone\u2019s script. It is doubtful whether there has ever been a McIlroy scorecard like this one. It featured two birdies, 12 pars, a bogey, double bogey, triple bogey and quadruple bogey. To his credit, the four-times major winner undertook media duties and sought to explain how the \u201csimple stuff\u201d went awry. Privately, he must be devastated about what transpired in front of such an expectant audience. \u201cI definitely think if I can put the ball in the fairway tomorrow I can shoot a good enough score to be around for the weekend,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cObviously I\u2019m pretty sure anyone starting with a 79 in this golf tournament doesn\u2019t think about winning at this point. But I think I can go out there and shoot something in the mid-60s, be around for the weekend, and then try to play good from there. \u201cI didn\u2019t give a very good account of myself out there. And I can definitely play better, as all of you know.\u201d Indeed we do, which made this situation such a head-scratcher. McIlroy did not sugarcoat an \u201cinexcusable\u201d missed putt from tap-in range at the 16th. When walking to the 2nd tee, McIlroy was already eight from the lead. By close of play on a squally day, he sat 13 shots adrift of the front-running JB Holmes. Shane Lowry returned an impressive 67 to lie within one of Holmes\u2019s five-under tally. Holmes has something of a curious Open record, with a third-place finish at Troon in 2016 leaping out among a string of missed cuts and the making up of numbers. In his past six starts on the PGA Tour, Holmes has not lasted beyond Friday. In another unquestionable blow to the profile of the Open\u2019s staging at Portrush for the first time in 68 years, Tiger Woods joined McIlroy in the gallery of infamy. Woods\u2019s struggles, that said, were far less of a surprise. The Masters champion winced at impact on his opening tee shot; there was further cause for Woods to grimace as he reached the turn in 41. Woods, unfamiliar with these surroundings and visibly fragile, laboured towards a 78. Pre-tournament, little was made of the fact Lowry had tasted success here, as an amateur in the North of Ireland Championship. The man from Offaly is comfortable on links courses and enjoying one of the finest seasons of his professional career. It would be no shock whatsoever should Lowry at least remain prominent for another three days. \u201cI think four under is a great score on that course and I\u2019ll take it any day,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cI was probably as nervous as I\u2019ve been in quite a while on the 1st tee, almost ever, I\u2019d say. \u201cLook, nerves are a good thing, aren\u2019t they? It\u2019s where you want to be. I just hope I\u2019m nervous on Sunday afternoon out there. It\u2019s right where you want to be and you have to tell yourself that when you\u2019re there. Where would you rather be? Would you rather be here or sitting at home watching on TV?\u201d A string of illustrious names are well placed. Sergio Garc\u00eda, Jon Rahm, Alex Noren, Tyrrell Hatton, Tommy Fleetwood and Brooks Koepka are among the group at three under par. Garcia has endured a dismal time in majors since winning one, the Masters of 2017. Koepka\u2019s recent run on the same stages, of course, has been outstanding. \u201cI feel good, I feel very comfortable,\u201d Koepka said. \u201cIt\u2019s a major championship; this is what you\u2019re trying to peak for.\u201d Scotland has been desperate for a golfing superstar for some time. Further proof that it might have one was delivered by Bob MacIntyre\u2019s joining of the 68 club. The left-hander from Oban held the lead for a brief spell on day one. MacIntyre does not seem remotely fazed by his major debut. Francesco Molinari\u2019s Open defence began with a 74. Adam Scott slumped to a 78. Phil Mickelson\u2019s recently drastic weight loss did not have an instantly positive impact; he signed for 76. David Duval attracted attention for all the wrong reasons after taking 14 at the 7th \u2013 blow by blow accounts of this debacle would give you a headache \u2013 en route to a 91. There was, then, considerably worse than McIlroy. It just did not feel that way.",

But as Omar has risen as a prominent progressive voice in Washington, Trump has seen an opportunity to weaponize her faith and identity. He has claimed she \u201chates America\u201d, falsely linked her to terrorists and earlier his year shared a video juxtaposing her words with images from September 11. Trump\u2019s top conservative boosters have followed suit, using their powerful platforms to spread conspiracy theories about Omar\u2019s background.

The previous record of 30 was set by Eric Brown at Lythan in 1958, and has since been matched by Tommy Nakajima (1986 Troon), Ross Drummond (Muirfield 1987), Mark Brooks (Turnberry 1994), Phil Mickelson (St Andrews 2000), Stuart Appelby (Muirfield 2002), Kenichi Kuboya (Turnberry 2009), Rory McIlroy (St Andrews 2010) and Justin Rose (last year at Carnoustie). He\u2019s -3 ... which is now two off the lead, because Jon Rahm has made it three birdies in a row, at 9. He turns in 31 (which seeing we\u2019re on the subject, is three shots shy of the Open front-nine record, 28, set by Denis Durnian at Birkdale in 1983).</p> <p><strong>-5: </strong>Rahm (9)<br><strong>-4: </strong>Lowry (F)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d30a4a08f0845f89e30fd6f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T16:59:55.761Z\">5.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>While Tyrrell Hatton\u2019s team tell him it was a great day really</strong>, Tiger continues to leak oil.

And so the Open, for what it\u2019s worth at this infant stage, is now led by a former champion and an amateur.</p> <p><em><strong>-1: </strong>Clarke (2), Sugrue -a- (2)<br><strong>E: </strong>Hoffman (2), Grillo (1), Kang (1), Thurloway -a- (1)</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d300a118f08d0b6ca532cf1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T06:02:01.551Z\">7.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Clarke\u2019s drive at the par-five 2nd dribbles into a bunker down the left, and he won\u2019t be able to go for the green with his second. </strong>After splashing back out onto the fairway, he takes a pensive draw from a delicious morning cigarette. But his stress levels will be nothing on poor Andy Sullivan: the 33-year-old from Nuneaton, who tied for 12th at Troon three years ago, hooks his opening drive out of bounds down the left. A horror start. He\u2019s the first to do so, but almost certainly won\u2019t be the last, as there\u2019s OB running down both sides of 1.

But only one of the 147 previous tournaments has taken place in Northern Ireland, here at Royal Portrush way back in 1951. Well, it\u2019s back, baby! It\u2019s been a while, but it\u2019s back.</p> <p><strong>And what a venue! </strong>Carnoustie might have the reputation as the toughest course on the Open rota, St Andrews the one most steeped in history. But Portrush - set among rolling dunes hugging the gorgeous Antrim coast, offering views of the Giant\u2019s Causeway, hilly Inishowen, peaty Islay, all that - is perhaps the prettiest. </p> <p><strong>Not that it\u2019ll be a pushover. </strong>Back in 1951, only three players broke 70 during the entire tournament, although none of them went on to win. Max Faulkner lifted the auld Claret Jug after rounds of 71, 70, 70 and 74, his trendy long-shafted blade putter smoking hot, making up for the wild slice he\u2019d battled all week. The Dunluce Links course has changed a bit since then, in preparation of an Open for the modern era - a couple of new holes, extra length, more bunkers - but chances are we\u2019ll see a few more sub-70 rounds this time. Even so, let\u2019s bear in mind that two of the three closing holes are called Calamity and Purgatory. One way or another, we\u2019ll see some drama this week.</p> <p><strong>So who\u2019ll follow Faulkner into the history books as an Open winner at Portrush? </strong>Local hero Rory McIlroy is the favourite, having held the old course record here (61) before the big redesign of 2015. He\u2019s looking for his fifth major title, as is Brooks Koepka, who paid his dues on the European Tour as a young man and knows full well what needs to be done on this sort of track. The usual suspects line up behind the two favourites: Dustin Johnson, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, the defending champ Francesco Molinari, Xander Schauffele, Tommy Fleetwood, Adam Scott, Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth and of course Tiger Woods. We could continue in this vein for a long, long time - the new US Open champ Gary Woodland? An overdue major breakthrough for Rickie Fowler? Late-career glory for that other local lad G-Mac? - but we\u2019ve got four days of hot golf action stretching out ahead of us, so let\u2019s immediately get down to business. Open fever is raging!

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s nearly 14 hours since Darren Clarke hit the first shot of the 2019 Open, so this HBH report must come to a close. We\u2019re back in the morning, early doors. See you then! -5: Holmes -4: Lowry -3: Noren, Simpson, Garcia, Frittelli, MacIntyre, Aphibarnrat, Fox, Hatton, Fleetwood, Koepka, Westwood, Finau, Rahm -2: Langasque, Rose, Park, Turner Rahm batters his tee shot down the middle of 18. Much good it does him, because his second is a poor effort, short and left of the green. He lobs up nicely to six feet, but it\u2019s no gimme. Before he can putt out, Cantlay attempts to get up and down from sand. He doesn\u2019t make it. A final bogey that slips him back to -1. And then Rahm\u2019s putt slips by the left of the hole. A poor denouement to his round, but it\u2019s still a fine opening-day 68. A level-par 71 for the 2018 Masters champion Patrick Reed. That was a battling round that may stand him in good stead. His storied playing partner Tiger bogeys the last, however, and that\u2019s a hope-shattering 78. He\u2019s +7, just one shot better off than Rory McIlroy, which goes to show how bad he\u2019s been. He\u2019s looked tight all day, a stiff back limiting his rotation. Meanwhile the third member of the group, Matt Wallace, finishes with a 73, not a bad result given the three double bogeys he made. A strange group to follow today. A fine sandy par by Rahm on 17. His approach was dismal, trickling into the trap, and he was left with a tricky lie on the downslope. But he whipped his ball out to four feet, a miraculous result, and it allowed him to save his par. He remains at -4. Rory won\u2019t be back in it, though, whatever happens tomorrow. Here\u2019s Andy Bull on one of the great Open nightmares. Bogeys for Dustin Johnson and Jason Day at the last. Day will be happy enough with his 70 nonetheless. DJ a little more miffed with his 72. Neither have played their way out of the competition a la McIlroy or Woods, however. A profitable morning tomorrow and they\u2019ll be right back in it. It\u2019s Rahm\u2019s turn in Bobby Locke\u2019s Hollow to the left of 16. He putts up gently to a couple of feet, and that\u2019s an easy par. His playing partner Patrick Cantlay makes only the seventh birdie of the day at the hole - Calamity Corner indeed - and he rises to -2. Up on 18, both Rose and Finau find the green in regulation, but neither can make their mid-range birdie putt. They end the day at -2 and -3 respectively. Finau has made it all the way round without a single bogey. -5: Holmes (F) -4: Lowry (F), Rahm (16) -3: Noren (F), Simpson (F), Garcia (F), Frittelli (F), MacIntyre (F), Aphibarnrat (F), Fox (F), Hatton (F), Fleetwood (F), Koepka (F), Finau (F), Inamori (13) Could this be Lee Westwood\u2019s time, after all this waiting? His second into 18 takes a slightly fortuitous bounce off the shoulder of the bunker guarding the front right of the green, and kicks his ball left to 15 feet. In goes a carpe-diem putt for birdie, and he\u2019s off to the clubhouse whistling and smiling, posting a card of 68 into the box. He\u2019s -3. A long time yet to travel, but this may be the first chapter of a tale for the ages. Or yet another false dawn, of course, but let\u2019s not sour the moment. Rahm\u2019s second into 15 is clunked heavy. He looks to have rescued the situation with a lovely chip from off the front of the green to three feet, but he suffers a rush of blood as he putts and sends his ball whistling past the hole. That\u2019s his second bogey of the day, and JB Holmes now has the sole lead at -5. Tiger makes an up and down for par from the cute little depression - Bobby Locke\u2019s hollow - to the left of the green. He remains at +6. \u201cArnold Palmer in his later, Seniors Tour career, had a phrase he often used after a good round: \u2018I\u2019m glad the fans got to see a bit of the Palmer of old instead of the old Palmer\u2019,\u201d writes Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cToday I fear we see the old Tiger as he moves through the rough with the winces of a sour back, such as it becomes all of us eventually when pushing a lawnmower (or getting up off a couch) becomes a task of Sisyphus.\u201d Rahm\u2019s tee shot at 14 leaked into the thick rough down the right of the fairway. He could only thrash his second to the front right of the green as a result. But he does extremely well to putt up the bank to a couple of feet, then tidy up for par. He remains at -5 ... but now only has a share of the lead, because JB Holmes sends a low fizzer into the 18th, then rolls in the 20-footer that remains. A birdie that means he\u2019s back home in 32 strokes! He\u2019s the new clubhouse leader after a 66. -5: Holmes (F), Rahm (14) -4: Lowry (F) -3: Noren (F), Simpson (F), Garcia (F), Frittelli (F), MacIntyre (F), Aphibarnrat (F), Fox (F), Hatton (F), Fleetwood (F), Koepka (F), Finau (17), Inamori (11) Some showmanship from Tiger Woods, as a tramliner across 15 disappears into the hole! He holds his arms out wide in Rapinoesque celebration, then licks a finger and performs the internationally recognised mime for chalking one up. A birdie at last, and he\u2019s +6 again. A wry smile momentarily flickers around the corners of his mouth, but his situation\u2019s not so great and his mood quickly reverts to pensive-stroke-misery. Yuki Inamori is playing in his first Open, reward for winning last year\u2019s Japan Open. The 24-year-old from Kagoshima, Japan has yet to make a mark outside his home tour - a couple of middling performances in the States this year, one cut missed in Europe - until now, that is. Birdies at 2, 3 and now 11, the latest the result of an approach that kicked off a hillock to the right of the green and gathered towards the hole. He\u2019s -3. A lovely tee shot from Justin Rose at the tricky 16th. He uses a little of the camber on the left edge of the green to kick his ball towards the hole, then he arrows in the dead-straight 15-footer he\u2019d left himself. He quietly rises to -2. Meanwhile some less agreeable news for fans of English golf ... Danny Willett had been going along nicely after three birdies in a row around the turn. But a double at 11 knocked his equilibrium, and there followed two more bogeys, at 12 and 17, plus another double at 14. He ended up with an extremely disappointing three-over 74. Rahm doesn\u2019t give his birdie effort enough on the right. That\u2019s a poor putt, but he remains a shot clear at the top. Tiger however can\u2019t get up and down from the deep bunker. Half in the trap, half out, he can only power-hoick his ball up onto the green, the truculent little orb stopping dead 40 feet from the hole. Another bogey, and he\u2019s +7 now. Lee Westwood sends a lovely snaking putt into the cup at the long par-three 16th from 40 feet. Over a bump, right to left, left to right, then back left again at the final turn. A birdie that takes the major-championship nearly man to -2. What a story this could be if the 46-year-old from Worksop finally achieves his potential just before the sands of time run out. A long way to go yet, of course, but we\u2019re all allowed to dream. It\u2019s free and you can\u2019t stop us. It\u2019s very mild at Portrush now. A low, bronze sun shimmering. Not too much wind. No rain. The late starters are enjoying the best of today\u2019s weather. The leader Rahm caresses an iron into the heart of the 200-yard par-three 13th. He\u2019s pin high and will take a look at birdie from 15 feet. Tiger\u2019s woes continue, however, as he sends his approach at 14 into a deep bunker to the left of the green. This round is turning into a McIlroyesque disaster. (Let\u2019s not riff on poor old David Duval\u2019s pain again.) Rahm whistles his second into the heart of 12. Two careful putts later and that\u2019s a bounce-back birdie that gives him sole ownership of the lead once again. Big Dustin follows up birdie at 13 with a fuss-free par at 14. He remains at -1, a shot behind his playing partner Jason Day who also pars. -5: Rahm (12) -4: Lowry (F), Holmes (16) -3: Noren (F), Simpson (F), Garcia (F), Frittelli (F), MacIntyre (F), Aphibarnrat (F), Fox (F), Hatton (F), Fleetwood (F), Koepka (F), Finau (14) After Jordan Spieth\u2019s aforementioned birdie at 12, the 2017 champ parred his way home. He signs for a one-under 70. Cameron Smith nearly slam-dunks a chip into the cup at 18 for an outrageous birdie from atop a grassy knoll. But it\u2019s just par and he\u2019s signing for a 70 as well. Rahm responds by crashing a big drive down the par-five 12th. Up on the green, Patrick Reed makes birdie to get himself back to level par. And a nice up and down from a shallow swale to the side of 14 by Justin Rose. A par that keeps him at -1. A first bogey of the day for Jon Rahm. The slip sends him back into a tie for the lead at -4 with Shane Lowry and JB Holmes. Meanwhile the 2015 PGA champion Jason Day - who came within a shot of making the play-off at St Andrews that same year - has been going along nicely, without fuss or fanfare. Birdies at 5 and 9 saw him hit the turn in 34; it\u2019s been pars all the way since. He\u2019s -2 through 13. -4: Lowry (F), Holmes (15), Rahm (11) -3: Noren (F), Simpson (F), Garcia (F), Frittelli (F), MacIntyre (F), Aphibarnrat (F), Fox (F), Hatton (F), Fleetwood (F), Koepka (F), Finau (13) An update on David Duval. Turns out his octuple-bogey 13 on 7 wasn\u2019t a 13 after all. It was a 14. A nonuple bogey, then. And that\u2019s a round of 91. Still not quite as bad as Ian Baker-Finch\u2019s effort at Troon in 1997, but that\u2019s a low bar for a former champion to clear. So here\u2019s what happened: he lost his first two tee shots, then sent his third into deep rough. At which point he played the wrong ball, a mistake only discovered up on the green. So he had to go back to the tee having been hit with three penalties for lost balls, plus a two-stroke penalty for playing the wrong ball. He teed off for the fourth time, and took six from there. All of which adds up to 14. JB Holmes continues his slow climb up the rankings. He joins clubhouse leader Shane Lowry in second place, following his birdie at 12 with another at 14. This one\u2019s the reward for rolling in a 30-footer. -5: Rahm (10) -4: Lowry (F), Holmes (14) -3: Noren (F), Simpson (F), Garcia (F), Frittelli (F), MacIntyre (F), Aphibarnrat (F), Fox (F), Hatton (F), Fleetwood (F), Koepka (F), Finau (13) A garden-variety par for Brooks Koepka coming up the last, and he signs for a 68. He\u2019s the tenth player to do so today. Chances are he won\u2019t be the last. Bogey for Louis Oosthuizen, though, and the 2010 champ settles for a slightly disappointing 70. Shots gone at 16 and 18. And par for great young Indian hope Shubhankar Sharma; the 22-year-old cards an almost-Faldoesque card of 17 pars and a birdie at 13. He\u2019s -1, and looks happy enough with his day\u2019s work. Tommy Fleetwood isn\u2019t far away from draining a 60-footer across 18 to finish like Kiradech Aphibarnrat. But he\u2019s happy enough with par, and that\u2019s a blemish-free round of 68. He\u2019s in the big group at -3. Meanwhile Justin Rose keeps pootling along in steady fashion, with a birdie at 12. He\u2019s -1. Many thanks to David. So before we concentrate on the live action, another quick word on Ryan Fox\u2019s record-breaking back nine at the Open of 29. He birdied every hole from 12 to 18, with the exception of Calamity, the par-three 16th. The previous record of 30 was set by Eric Brown at Lythan in 1958, and has since been matched by Tommy Nakajima (1986 Troon), Ross Drummond (Muirfield 1987), Mark Brooks (Turnberry 1994), Phil Mickelson (St Andrews 2000), Stuart Appelby (Muirfield 2002), Kenichi Kuboya (Turnberry 2009), Rory McIlroy (St Andrews 2010) and Justin Rose (last year at Carnoustie). He\u2019s -3 ... which is now two off the lead, because Jon Rahm has made it three birdies in a row, at 9. He turns in 31 (which seeing we\u2019re on the subject, is three shots shy of the Open front-nine record, 28, set by Denis Durnian at Birkdale in 1983). -5: Rahm (9) -4: Lowry (F) While Tyrrell Hatton\u2019s team tell him it was a great day really, Tiger continues to leak oil. He\u2019s reached the turn in +6 and that\u2019s so bad it\u2019s one worse than Rory managed on the front nine. Back to the top and Rahm sets up another birdie chance, this one from about 20 feet at 9. It must definitely be getting chillier as Rahm has boosted his outerware with a gilet. Righty, on that note I shall hand you back to a refreshed Scott Murray. In a blink of an eye, the four-way tie for the lead is halved. Hatton\u2019s bogey at 18 is expected but Koepka\u2019s at 17 is not. Par putts from four feet in majors are gimmes for the American but he pushes this one right and it doesn\u2019t even touch the hole. His first mistake of the day leaves Lowry and Rahm - both Irish Open winners - in tied first. Tyrrell Hatton nearly got through 18 holes without blowing a fuse but the lid has come off at the last. He hacks out of the rough, looks furious and we\u2019re just grateful there\u2019s not a big branch and a red mini in the vicinity. After clearing his head and possibly counting to ten, Hatton plays a solid approach to 20 feet so could still escape with a par. Ryan Fox, so cruelly beaten by two monster putts from Russell Knox (Knox sinks Fox) in the Irish Open two years ago, has come home in 29! What a response from the Kiwi after a 3-over 39 on the front nine. Back at 7 and Rahm completes the job by rolling in his birdie putt to join Lowry, Hatton and Koepka in a tie for first place on -4. Rahm\u2019s charge continues. The Spaniard has his tail up, flighting an approach to 8 which grabs and sucks back to about four feet. Some real action on that ball which highlights the soft conditions. Another squally shower passes through but it\u2019s a brief appearance with minimal inconvenience. Tyrrell Hatton joins the lead! The Englishman makes it a three-way tie at the top by draining a 20-footer across the green at 17. A birdie at 18 will give him the new clubhouse lead although that\u2019s a big ask given how it\u2019s playing. With the weather calming again, more and more afternoon starters are infiltrating the leaderboard and among those at -3 now is double Irish Open champion Jon Rahm thanks to a birdie at 7. The sweet-swinging Louis Oosthuizen cruises to -3 and just one off the pace. The South African won the Open at St Andrews in 2010 and lost a play-off at the Old Course in 2015 but he\u2019s not managed another top 15 in his other seven starts in this event. Favourite Oosthuizen fact: he celebrated his 2010 Open win by buying a tractor for his farm. I\u2019m sure many of us would have done the same. With a quadruple-bogey at 1, Rory found a spectacular way to get to +4 but Tiger Woods has arrived there more by slow death. He looks cold, weary and out of synch. Tiger opened steadily enough but has slid down to tied 120th with a run of bogey, double bogey, bogey at 5, 6 and 7. Tiger can still strut his stuff at Augusta National on a Sunday but can he do it on rainy evening in Ireland on a Thursday, asked the critics? Not so far it would seem. Tyrrell Hatton comes within a whisker of joining Lowry and Koepka at the top of the charts. His pitch over a valley checks up on its second bounce and does a little dance around the hole, just failing to topple in. The Englishman is a two-time winner of the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship and has been showing signs of a return to form in recent weeks. He stays one back and in a big tie for third which includes Tommy Fleetwood. Tyrrell and Tommy, a pair of cheeky scamps, possibly from the 1940s. Koepka hits a lovely second into the 15th and has a 15-footer to take the lead on his own. In theory, this is the stretch of the course where Royal Portrush bites back. Looking at the hardest holes on the course today, the 18th is ranked second (4.37) while 15, 16 and 17 are sixth, fourth and third respectively. Not that Koepka will be bothered. Brooks Koepka shares the lead in another major. Wow. The guy is so serene he must have a TV in every room. One for Monkees fans there. Yep, Koepka is at it again, sauntering along and, before you know, hitting top spot without appearing to do that much. For the first time in many an hour, Shane Lowry has company at the top. Hello again from Royal Portrush just as one of those pesky squally showers passes through. It\u2019s been t-shirt weather for a while but caddies are reaching into bags for raingear. The good thing is these little bursts don\u2019t last long and the weather looks pretty decent for the rest of the day. Jordan Spieth made bogey at 11. Coming hot off the heels of that double at 8, he\u2019d wiped out all his early gains and was back at level par. But the chap from Dallas is made of strong stuff, and he\u2019s instantly bounced back with birdie at 12 to move back into red figures. Incidentally, apologies for mistakenly referring to Spieth as simply \u201che\u201d when reporting that double on 8. Fixed that now. Many thanks to a couple of friendly eagle-eyed readers for spotting the error, including blood pressure\u2019s Alan Hardy, who spluttered: \u201cIt would have been nice if you\u2019d told us who the \u2018he\u2019 you were referring to is at 15.38 actually was. Yes, I know it\u2019s Jordan Spieth, but I wish I didn\u2019t have to do the research for you highly paid \u2018journalists\u2019.\u201d Blimey. That\u2019s me told. I haven\u2019t seen anyone get so hot under the collar about the use of a pronoun since the emergence of Jordan Peterson. And with that, I\u2019m going to sit on the naughty step in my hairshirt for a while. David Tindall will be your loving guide while I repent. Patrick Cantlay posted top-ten finishes at the Masters and the PGA. His quest for another high finish at a major looks to be starting well, with birdies at 2 and 5. He\u2019s -2. Matt Kuchar is gong round with him, and he\u2019s done exactly the same thing, step by step. And birdie for Justin Thomas, who has responded to slipping to three over through 4 with birdies at 5, 9, 10 and now 14. He\u2019s -1 and just three off the lead! Even the greatest can thin a chip straight through the green. And that\u2019s what Tiger\u2019s just done from the bottom of the hill to the side of 6. The ball initially threatens to snag on a hairy hillock, before toppling back down another swale. He does extremely well to bump up to six feet, but he can\u2019t knock in the bogey putt. A double, and that\u2019s three shots shed in two holes. He\u2019s +3. Brooks Koepka spurns a fine chance to grab himself a share of the lead at 13, having knocked his tee shot to six feet. That was always heading left, most uncharacteristically. He stays at -3. Erik van Rooyen meanwhile tugs at a short one on 15, and he slips back to -2. Another birdie for Tyrrell Hatton! This one comes at 14, and he\u2019s the latest of the later starters to join the ever-growing group a shot behind the leader Shane Lowry at -3. Back on the par-three 6th, Tiger pulls his tee shot into the deep swale to the left of the green. That\u2019ll be a testing up and down. The 15-time major winner\u2019s post-Augusta malaise continues ... for now, anyway. There\u2019s always time. Dustin finally gets his flat stick going! A lovely tee shot at 6, over the flag to eight feet, and he guides in the putt. He returns to level par. Tiger however makes a terrible error with the putter on 5, leaving a 40-foot birdie effort 12 feet short. The greens are running at around 10 on the stimp, not exactly PGA Tour speeds, but there\u2019s no excuse for that. The mistake costs Tiger a shot, and he slips to +1. A couple of big rakes. Erik van Rooyen tickles in a long downhill effort on 14, while Tommy Fleetwood converts from distance at 13. Birdies that take both men to -3. They\u2019re alongside Brooks Koepka, who nearly drains an eagle putt on 12. Instead he taps in to calmly rise up an increasingly exciting leaderboard. -4: Lowry (F) -3: Noren (F), Simpson (F), Garcia (F), Frittelli (F), MacIntyre (F), Aphibarnrat (F), Van Rooyen (14), Fleetwood (13), Koepka (12) Lee Westwood has finished second at the Open on one occasion (2010), third twice (2009 and 2013) and fourth once (2004). Throw in a tie for tenth back in 1997, and there are a lot of what-ifs in a Montgomeriesque career. If he wants to land that elusive major, his time is running out: he\u2019s 46 years old. That might explain the zeal with which he\u2019s begun his round today. Responding to bogey at 4, he\u2019s carded three birdies in a row, at 5, 6 and 7. He\u2019s -2! When Dustin Johnson putts well, he\u2019s practically unstoppable. But he\u2019s not putting well. Having fired a long putt miles past the hole at 4, leading to a three-putt bogey, he leaves an eagle putt ten feet short at 5, having driven the green. The par putt inevitably drifts by the left of the cup. He remains at +1. Meanwhile back to back birdies for Thomas Pieters, at 12 and 13. The big Belgian is -2. A cool start to the week for everyone\u2019s favourite entertaining hothead Tyrrell Hatton. Birdies at 5 and now 12 have whisked him up the standings to -2. The 27-year-old Ryder Cup hero from High Wycombe already has a top-five finish at the Open to his name. He\u2019d have been just two off winner JB Holmes at Troon in 2016, if you factor out Henrik Stenson and Phil Mickelson, that is, on account of their playing another tournament. Anyway, he takes his good form from last week\u2019s Scottish Open to the Antrim coast. Justin Rose drops back to level par after a wild tee shot at 4 forces him to take a drop. Dustin Johnson also finds himself heading the wrong way: after opening with three pars, he trundles a heavy handed putt 15 feet past the flag, and can\u2019t save himself coming back. He\u2019s +1. Birdie for Jon Rahm at 2. He\u2019s -1, as is Tony Finau , who makes one at 4. Tiger sticks his tee shot at 3 to eight feet, but can\u2019t make his birdie putt and that\u2019s three pars in a row. Birdies at 8, 9 and 10 for the former Masters champion Danny Willett! He\u2019s -3 already, just one off Shane Lowry\u2019s lead. Willett has a decent if not spectacular record at the Open: a tie for sixth in 2015, and a tie for 15th in 2013. It\u2019d be lovely to see him finish high this week, putting an end to his elongated post-Augusta comedown. More from a downcast Rory McIlroy. \u201cI didn\u2019t hit it well enough, I didn\u2019t put it in the right positions. I put myself behind the eight-ball from the start. I thought if I could have got home and shot, maybe, two over par for the day, I could have still been in the tournament. But obviously the finish derailed that a little bit. I\u2019ve always said I always get nervous on the first tee, whether it\u2019s the Open at Portrush or any other tournament. I\u2019m always anxious to get going. But it almost settled me down: I can\u2019t get off to a worse start, so you may as well get your head down and keep trying. The support was fantastic, I really appreciated it. A rough start and a rough finish, and it adds up to a pretty dreadful score.\u201d Hats off to him for coming out and answering those questions - there are many sports stars who wouldn\u2019t - especially as he looked utterly dejected, his dream of winning the Open on home soil up in smoke. A thoroughly depressing watch. Ah well, he\u2019ll always have Hoylake. Say what you like about Rory McIlroy, he always comes out to talk to his public. Here he is, talking to Sky after that horror-show 79. \u201cObviously when you play the first and last holes in a combined seven over par, you\u2019re making life tough for yourself! I was understandably nervous on the first tee. I hit a bad tee shot OB. Got a bad lie with the second and had to take an unplayable, obviously it wasn\u2019t the ideal start. But after that I felt I battled back and showed some resilience. A couple of birdies, then held it together in some difficult conditions at the start of the back nine. But I lost concentration a bit after the missed par putt on 16, and then hit a tee shot a couple of yards offline on 18 and got a dreadful lie. So it was one of those days.\u201d Callum Shinkwin is best known for his near miss at the 2017 Scottish Open. But could things be about to change for the 26-year-old from Watford? Birdies at 12 and 15 have lifted him up the leaderboard to -2. Rory Sabbatini, once of South Africa but now a citizen of Slovakia, has birdied 10 and 11 to rise to -2 as well. Erik van Rooyen, who had a good run at the PGA this year, has birdied 9 and 11; he\u2019s -2 as well. And completing the set of new faces at -2: JB Holmes, who started with bogey but has since birdied 2, 3 and 5. An eventful end to Kevin Kisner\u2019s round. Bogey-birdie-birdie-bogey. He finishes with a 70. A fine round, though it promised to be so much better: he was four under through eight holes. But it\u2019s a birdie for Rickie Fowler at the last, and he\u2019ll be happier to sign for exactly the same score. Rory also isn\u2019t the only big name to suffer a rush of blood to the neep on the greens. On 8, Spieth misreads a putt so badly that Laura Davies on Sky describes it as \u201ca wide\u201d. Then he yips the three-footer he\u2019s left himself. The brake is applied to his fast start. A double that clatters him back down the standings to -1. Rory McIlroy isn\u2019t the only big name to have suffered a collapse today. Adam Scott had been talked up, supposedly on song during the practice days. But he never really recovered from a double-bogey at 2. A bounce-back birdie at 3 was a false dawn; he went on to bogey 7, 9, 13 and 15, before making another double at 17. He finished up with a 78. He\u2019s +7. We\u2019ve already heard about Phil Mickelson\u2019s 76. Ian Poulter ended up with a 75, as did Padraig Harrington. And alongside defending champion Francesco Molinari in the clubhouse at +3: the US Open champ Gary Woodland, the 2015 Open winner Zach Johnson, Xander Schauffele and Bryson DeChambeau. Links golf on an inclement day, huh. Tiger, having lashed his opening tee shot into thick rough, sends his second at 1 into a bunker guarding the front left of the green. He faces a long sand shot, and can only get his ball to 20 feet. But in goes the putt, and the great man saves an unlikely par. However his tee shot at the par-five 2nd scampers into a fairway bunker, so he\u2019ll have a little bit of work to do again. The gallery watch Rory McIlroy walk up the last in embarrassed silence. Finally a small smattering of sympathetic applause breaks out. After another wayward tee shot, he\u2019s hitting four into the green, and sends it long and right, into a clump of bother near the grandstand. He\u2019s shortsided, a terribly tricky hack out. He lands the ball as softly as he can onto the downslope, and it whistles past the hole. He\u2019ll have a ten-footer coming back for double bogey. It\u2019s always missing on the right. Having started with a quadruple bogey, he ends with a triple. That\u2019s a spirit-crushing 79. He\u2019s +8, and it\u2019s a long time until the first Sunday in April and the next major at Augusta. It\u2019s an opening round of 74 for the defending champion Francesco Molinari. Far from ideal, but it could have been worse, much worse. Consider one David Duval, who puts his name to a thoroughly dispiriting 90. That\u2019s the worst round by a former champion since Ian Baker-Finch misplaced his mojo completely at Troon in 1997, shooting a 92 that stopped a stellar career in its tracks. Henry Cotton shot 93 at Turnberry in 1977, but he was 70 years old at the time. Duval was two under after the first two holes, but went on to card six bogeys, a triple, a quadruple and a octuple. He\u2019s +19 and - this won\u2019t surprise you - in last position. One of the loudest cheers of the day as Tiger takes to the tee. He\u2019s got a history of dreadful first shots at the Open, and this one isn\u2019t great, off to the left. But while it snags in the thick stuff, at least it\u2019s not gone OB like Rory\u2019s a few hours ago. Speaking of McIlroy, he nearly goes from the ridiculous to the sublime, an inch away from draining a monster birdie putt on 17. But it stays out on the lip. When it\u2019s not your day, it\u2019s not your day. Any weekend hacker will sympathise. Another example of why golf is the most relatable sport of all. An opening birdie for Justin Rose. Kevin Kisner rakes in a long one on 16 to move back to -1. Meanwhile Xander Schauffele, who started so strongly with birdies at 1, 2 and 5, ended the day with 74. He was back in 39, having doubled 11 and bogeyed 16 and 18. He\u2019s +3. McIlroy\u2019s race is run, and we\u2019re only halfway into day one. He pulls a three-foot par putt on 16 left of the hole ... then doesn\u2019t bother thinking about the tap-in coming back. He shoves it right from inside a foot. A double bogey. That was beyond careless. Back to +5, and back to the drawing board, because it\u2019ll be another year without a major title. On Sky, co-commentator Paul Azinger suggests he\u2019s going into the biggest tournaments with his mind all out of whack: he\u2019s trying to treat the majors as any other championship ... but they\u2019re not, they\u2019re just not. Another birdie for Jordan Spieth! That one comes at the short par-four 5th, and the 2017 champ is flying. He\u2019s -3. His pal Justin Thomas, a couple of holes ahead, is however struggling. Having opened with bogey, then made a double at 4, he\u2019s repaired some of the damage with birdie at 5. But now at the par-five 7th, he\u2019s left himself with a testing 12 footer to save his par. In it goes, but he stays at +2, and doesn\u2019t look too happy with life at the moment. His playing partner Tommy Fleetwood birdies, though, his second of the day after the shot picked up at 3. Some of the later starters beginning to make inroads at the top of the leaderboad. -4: Lowry (F) -3: Noren (F), Simpson (F), Garcia (F), Frittelli (F), MacIntyre (F), Aphibarnrat (F), Spieth (5) -2: Langasque (F), Kim (14), Fleetwood (7), Koepka (6) Nothing much rattles Brooks Koepka. He sends a double cross into the par-three 6th, and is left with a huge putt across the green. A good 70 feet or so. Most folk would do well to get it down in two; Koepka very nearly drains it. The ball stops one turn away, and he tidies up for par. He stays at -2. It\u2019s a thoroughly miserable end to local lad Graeme McDowell\u2019s day. Having been three under through 14, he made two three-putt bogeys, at 15 and 17, and now he flays his tee shot into deep nonsense down the right of 18. The ball\u2019s lost. Back to the tee, and he ends up with a triple bogey. That\u2019s a horror finish, five shots gone in the last four holes. He ends up with a two-over 73, and is the picture of misery as he scuttles off to the sanctuary of the clubhouse. The disappointment of the gallery is palpable. And his compatriot isn\u2019t doing much to cheer them up right now; it\u2019s been pars all the way since the turn for Rory McIlroy, who remains stuck at +3. He\u2019s had a couple of looks at birdie, but nothing\u2019s dropping. Three holes to go. A strong finish could salvage his day. But it\u2019s a hell of a closing stretch, so it\u2019s a big ask. It\u2019s a major championship, and Brooks Koepka keeps on keepin\u2019 on. A second birdie of the day, this time at 5, and he\u2019s started off very nicely indeed. The four-time major winner is -2 already. We shouldn\u2019t be too surprised at this carry-on. Here are the best cumulative scores to par after the year\u2019s first three majors: -30: Brooks Koepka -17: Dustin Johnson -16: Xander Schauffele -15: Gary Woodland -14: Patrick Cantlay -12: Jon Rahm -11: Adam Scott Kim Si-woo is a major champion in the making. The 24-year-old from Seoul is the youngest-ever winner of the unofficial fifth major, the Players Championship, something he did as a 21-year-old in 2017. So, y\u2019know, QED. But his form going into this championship hasn\u2019t been all that. He\u2019s missed the cut in eight of his last nine tournaments! But quality will always out, and he\u2019s going along very nicely today. Birdies at 2, 7 and now 12, more than offsetting bogey at 8, and he\u2019s -2. Jordan Spieth has been going through a barren spell. His last tournament win was the 2017 Open at Birkdale, the Titleist trucks, the birdie-eagle-birdie-birdie response, all that. But the flame\u2019s been showing signs of flickering back into life: a tie for third at the PGA, plus another couple of top tens on Tour. Now he\u2019s clacked his tee shot at 3 to ten feet, and calmly rolled in the putt. It\u2019s only a matter of time before he ends his drought, and you wouldn\u2019t put it past the young Texan ending it here. He\u2019s -2. What a finish to the round for Kiradech Aphibarnrat! Always an exciting watch, he rattles in a 40-footer up the green for his third birdie of the day. No dropped shots, so that\u2019s a very satisfying 68 for the Thai star. He\u2019s one off the lead. No John Daly this week, the injured 1995 winner not allowed to go round in his mobility cart. So it\u2019s good to see his spiritual successor taking up that particular everyman-style slack. -4: Lowry (F) -3: Noren (F), Simpson (F), Garcia (F), Frittelli (F), MacIntyre (F), Aphibarnrat (F) Another shot dropped by Kevin Kisner, this time at the par-five 12th. He slips to -1. McIlroy nearly drains a long birdie putt on the par-three 13th, but the ball turns off to the left at the last. He\u2019s still at +3. And it\u2019s two shots gone in three holes for G-Mac, who leaves a long birdie putt well short, then fails to tidy up. His mood has suddenly turned a bit sour, and no wonder: that\u2019s two three-putts in the last three holes. (Well, technically he was just off the green with his first putt at 17, but that\u2019s how it\u2019ll feel to the 2010 US Open champ.) It\u2019s suddenly stopped pelting down, and the sun\u2019s out. You have got to love the Open. Some early birdie action for the 2017 champion Jordan Spieth, and the 2016 Masters winner Danny Willett. Both birdie 2 to move to -1. Aaron Wise birdies the opening hole; he\u2019s -1 through 3. McIlroy sends an excellent lob up from the swale to six feet, and scrambles his par. But having crashed a fine drive down that par five, he\u2019ll be disappointed nevertheless. A good opportunity to repair some more of all that early damage has been spurned. He remains at +3. His partner Paul Casey slips back to level par meanwhile after horseshoeing out from 12 feet. So much for McIlroy\u2019s comeback. He sends his second at the par-five 12th into a thicket to the left of the green, and his third squirts out and down a bank over the other side. He\u2019ll have his work cut out to get up and down for par from there. Meanwhile up ahead, some news of the defending champ Francesco Molinari. Hopes of becoming the first man to retain the Open since Padraig Harrington in 2008 already look slim: having birdied 2, he\u2019s subsequently bogeyed 6, 11 and now 12. Throw in a double at 8, and he\u2019s +4. Two of Europe\u2019s biggest hopes suffering today. Emiliano Grillo\u2019s hole in one at 13 was the first ace at the Open since Louis Oosthuizen made one on 14 at Troon in 2016. Much good it did him, though. He made after-the-lord-mayor\u2019s-show bogeys at 14 and 15, and ended up signing for a two-over 73. That triple at 5 didn\u2019t help. Meanwhile a lip-out bogey for Robert MacIntyre at 18, and he slips out of the lead. And it\u2019s a 73 for Beef, who was three over coming back home. -4: Lowry (F) -3: Noren (F), Simpson (F), Garcia (F), Frittelli (F), MacIntyre (F) -2: Langasque (F), Aphibarnrat (16), McDowell (16), Kisner (10) Brooks Koepka has such a delicate touch around the greens. Having reached the front edge of the par-five 2nd, he sends a chip bouncing up the green, then biting and spinning slowly towards the hole. Almost as though the ball is on remote control. That\u2019s a kick-in birdie, and he moves into red for the first time this week. The 2010 champ Louis Oosthuizen rattles in a 15-footer for his birdie, and he\u2019s -1 too. And up on 3, Tommy Fleetwood cards his first birdie of the day with a 30-foot roller. Dylan Frittelli, who only secured his place here by winning the John Deere last week, makes his first bogey of the day on 18. Always a punch to the guts, but he\u2019ll have taken a three-under 68 this morning. Fine par saves for McIlroy (+3) and Paul Casey (-1) at 11. But G-Mac misreads a short par putt on 15 to drop his first stroke of the day. He\u2019s -2 again. Robert MacIntyre - with a couple of second-place finishes to his name on the European Tour this season - joins Lowry and Frittelli in the lead at -4! He rakes in a 30-footer on the 17th. Tommy Fleetwood misses a short birdie effort on 2, such a shame after an approach dialled in to six feet. And some breaking news on 12, where David Duval makes a par. His second in eight holes. Four bogeys. One quadruple. One octuple. Oh David! \u201cAre we officially on Sergio Watch yet?\u201d wonders Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cBe a fine thing for a fine young Irish lad like Sergy O\u2019Garcia to win on our moss-covered Open. I\u2019m trusting on our weather to douse the course overnight at least twice over the next three days (safest prediction I\u2019ve ever made) to keep the fire out of the greens so our man can give putts a good old whack instead of the tiddlers and topplers that make his fingers twitch. Slainte Sergio!\u201d Brooks Koepka is out and about. The reigning PGA champion pars the opening hole without too much fuss, but it doesn\u2019t look as though he\u2019s going to enjoy the best of the weather. It is positively pelting down now. Eagle-eyed readers will have noticed that Kevin Kisner has slipped off the leader board. That\u2019s the result of wanging his approach at 9 into a bush and running up a double bogey. He still turns in 34, mind you, sitting nicely at -2. But some harder holes to follow. A miserable end to the round for Webb Simpson. A weak chip from a tight lie to the side of 17 cost him one shot, then another goes down the last. Still, he\u2019s back in the hut with a fine 68. His playing partner Sergio also signs for a 68, and looks very happy with his lot as well. His mood may augur well for the rest of the week. Can he put the demons of 2007 and 2014 behind him? It\u2019d be lovely to see, especially as he\u2019s done bugger all in the majors since slipping on that green jacket a couple of years ago. -4: Lowry (F), Frittelli (17) -3: Noren (F), Simpson (F), Garcia (F), MacIntyre (16), McDowell (14) Thanks David. Now then, before I get back to business, a word on David Duval. You may remember his eight at the 5th. Well, he\u2019s followed that up with a 13 (!) at 7. Details are a little sketchy, but it would seem he ended up hitting such a bad provisional off the tee that a second was required ... and then he played the wrong one. For a while, he was reported to have run up 15 on the hole, but that\u2019s been revised down by the match referee. Just a octuple bogey, then! By way of comparison, the biggest number on Maurice Flitcroft\u2019s infamous card of 121 in the 1976 qualifiers was a 12 (though to be fair, there was a question mark beside that one). Anyway, the former champ has since dropped another couple of strokes, and is currently +13 through 10. Conclusive proof, if you required it, that 2001 is an awfully long time ago. Another birdie for Rory McIlroy, this time at 9. That\u2019s two birdies in three holes and +3 after 9 means his outward score could be downgraded from disastrous to disappointing. Is he back in the game? I\u2019ll hand back to Scott Murray to guide you through Rory\u2019s back nine. An Irishman, who teed off this morning, leads the Open at Royal Portrush. Nope, not Rory McIlroy but Clara native Shane Lowry. An excellent 4-under 67 is two better than the early target posted by Frenchman Romain Langasque. Lowry has missed his last four Open cuts which comes as a surprise. On each occasion, a slow start has undermined his challenge and today\u2019s 67 is his lowest round-one score in eight appearances. The last time Lowry shot in the 60s at an Open he took tied ninth at Royal Liverpool so this could prove an excellent foundation. Shane Lowry\u2019s strong opening round is almost at conclusion. It\u2019s been an excellent morning\u2019s work from the Irishman but he\u2019s just fighting his swing a little as the finishing line approaches. A rather weary Lowry gives it the big lean as his approach to 18 soars towards the green and his body language gives it away. Short, right and into a greenside bunker. An up and down will give him a 67 and the new clubhouse lead of 4-under. Fun fact: Rory McIlroy\u2019s caddie, Harry Diamond, played in the 2012 Irish Open held at Portrush. He missed the cut after rounds of 77-74 although did beat several well-known names, including 2005 US Open champion Michael Campbell and European Tour winners George Coetzee and Scott Jamieson. Meanwhile, his boss (and childhood buddy) Rory just misses a curling 20-foot birdie effort at 8. Shame. That would have been back-to-back gains and perhaps the start of a move. McIlroy remains tied 79th and nine back from leader Webb Simpson. The last six golfers to have a piece of the first-round lead at an Open were all Americans. And generally elite ones at that - Kevin Kisner, Jordan Spieth, Matt Kuchar, Brooks Koepka, Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson. Webb Simpson is upholding that tradition and rolls in a six-foot putt at 15 to stay one clear. Ten pars, five birdies and -5 with three to play. Birdie for Rory. A first red number of the day for the local hero and just a little spring in his step as he walks off the side of the 7th green after rolling in an eight-footer on the second of the front nine\u2019s par 5s. A positive take is that he\u2019s played his last six holes in even-par following the quadruple-bogey horror show at the first hole. Some context of his performance so far is provided by the bookmakers. Before his first shot, Rory traded at 8/1. When he faced further ruin at the fifth, McIlroy touched 66/1. Following the birdie at 7, he\u2019s a more cautious 28/1. Fake news. One early press tent rumour was that Alex Noren was playing poorly in practice. Not a big surprise given his somewhat indifferent form this season. That said, whilst getting a thorough drenching when walking the course yesterday afternoon, I stumbled upon the Swede and saw him play a wonderful approach to the tough 11th for what would have been a kick-in birdie. A birdie at that very same hole today has helped ignite an early challenge and he\u2019s still one of the early pacesetters at -3 after 15. Let\u2019s talk about Henrik Stenson. The man who epitomises Swedish cool is a likely contender this week having won at Royal Troon in 2016 and accumulated a trio of other top three Open finishes. He warmed up with a top four in last week\u2019s Scottish Open and has reached the turn here in 1-under, strolling off the green after a par at 9. Current status: lurking. The PGA Tour\u2019s John Deere Classic would seem a strange way to prepare for an Open. It\u2019s played on a parkland course in nice weather and requires an absurd about of birdies if you want to win it. And yet, two of the last four Open winners - Zach Johnson (2015) and Francesco Molinari (2018) - had used it as their Open warm-up. Last week\u2019s John Deere was won by South African Dylan Frittelli with 21-under and, lo and behold, he\u2019s upholding the curious John Deere-Open link with a fast start here, moving to 3-under after 12 and just two off the lead. Rory\u2019s hole scores so far: 8-5-4-4-4-3. Well, at least the trend is going in the right direction. Not sure he can make a 2 on the par-5 7th mind but it does represent a good chance to finally get a birdie on the board. If it\u2019s any consolation (it isn\u2019t), he\u2019s not the only former Open champion to have put a \u2018snowman\u2019 on his card today. David Duval, the 2001 Lytham champion, was bowling along nicely after a birdie-birdie start but then followed a pair of bogeys with an eight at the fifth. Back at the top, fellow major winner Webb Simpson is the first man to hit -5 after a birdie at 13. He leads by one. Here comes Sergio! Garcia, he of 10 Open top 10s, bursts into tied fourth spot after a birdie at 12, the final of the three par 5s at Royal Portrush. I\u2019ve just stuck my head outside the media centre and the wind is picking up. Nothing too severe yet but trousers are flapping and comb-overs starting to stand tall. Grey clouds are lurking but no sign of a downpour yet. So, a WGC winner, a Wentworth winner and a US Open winner share the lead at -4. That\u2019s Lowry, Noren and Simpson. As for Rory, some good news at last. His ball is found and he gets a serious break with a line-of-sight drop thanks to the scoreboard. He hacks on to the green and actually has a putt for birdie which doesn\u2019t drop but a further crisis avoided. Then again, +5 after 5 is not good, unless you like nice symmetry. Webb Simpson is hot, hot, hot. It\u2019s now four birdies in five holes, the latest at 11, and he joins the leaders at -4. Alex Noren is now one of those lads, having followed up birdie at 11 with another at 12. Kevin Kisner is going along nicely, too, with eagle at 2 and birdie at 4. And big-hitting Luke List makes good use of his distance with eagle at 2. Here\u2019s the always evolving leaderboard as it stands ... -4: Lowry (13), Noren (12), Simpson (11) -3: Langasque (15), Pepperell (13), MacIntyre (10), Kisner (4) ... and with that, I\u2019m off for a little break. David Tindall will be your guide until I next see you. Anon! A fair chance that McIlroy has lost his ball on 5. He sends a huge slice off towards some mutant curly kale down the right. It disappears into the verdant nonsense. Problem is, the stewards were looking for Paul Casey\u2019s tee shot at the time, which was terrible enough but not quite so awful, and so they didn\u2019t see where McIlroy\u2019s effort landed. God speed, Rory. Just as well for the home crowds that G-Mac is going along nicely: birdie at 7 to follow the shot he\u2019d picked up at 2, and he\u2019s -2. Par for Darren Clarke down the last. And the man who took the first stroke this morning is the first man back in the clubhouse. A fine 71. The Amateur Champion James Sugrue also signs for a 71. Both men get a rousing reception from the Portrush punters. And the third member of the opening group, Charley Hoffman, departs with a 70. All three will be a little disappointed right now, having bogeyed 16 and 17, dragging each other down. But all three would have taken those cards in the morning, surely. It\u2019s all change at the top yet again. Bogey for MacIntyre at 9, and he\u2019s replaced at -4 by Lowry, who bounces back with birdie at 12, rolling in a fine 15-footer. Birdies for Pepperell - at 13, his third in four holes - and Noren, at 11, fatten up the group in second place. -4: Lowry (12) -3: Langasque (14), Pepperell (13), Noren (11) Simpson (10), MacIntyre (9) Phil Mickelson\u2019s hopes of a second Open Championship look as slim as his all-new waistline. Bogeys at 9 and now 11 have furthered his fall down the leaderboard; he\u2019s +3. Here, can you picture that police car (9.06am) bobbing off towards Islay, atop some foamy waves, a confused Phil in the passenger seat trying to read an upside-down map, red-faced Rory at the wheel tapping frantically into the sat-nav? Yes, me too. More bad luck for the Irish. Lowry\u2019s always out of position coming down 11. He very nearly drains a 30-footer for par, but that\u2019s his first bogey of the day, and he drops out of the lead. Clarke meanwhile makes a second bogey in as many holes, this time at 17. He old boy\u2019s tired since his hot start over the first five holes. Five bogeys and just two birdies since then. He\u2019s back to level par and struggling to hold a brave smile for the gallery. Belated news of Romain Langasque, who birdied 12. He takes Xander Schauffele\u2019s spot at -3, the Californian having bogeyed 6 to slip back to -2. And he\u2019s passed by Webb Simpson going the other way: his third birdie in four holes, at 10, takes the North Carolinian to -3. -4: MacIntyre (8) -3: Langasque (13), Lowry (11), Simpson (10) McIlroy was five over after the first six holes at Birkdale in 2017, yet still finished the week in a tie for fourth. He\u2019ll have to pull something similar out of the bag if he\u2019s to have any hope whatsoever this week, because his chip up onto the green only just fails to topple back down the bank. He\u2019s left with a 15-footer for par, and a bobbly effort stops just short. He\u2019s +5 after three. He\u2019s beaten his previous worst start in double-quick time. It\u2019s no longer breaking news, but Rory McIlroy is having an absolute shocker. He\u2019s just sent his tee shot at the par-three 3rd into the lush grass at the back of the green. Up and down for par\u2019s not a pipe dream, but even so, this is awful to watch. A man crumbling to dust under the leaden weight of expectation. \u201cYou say Darren Clarke would become the oldest major winner at age 50 were he to win on Sunday, but I think you\u2019ll find that Tom Watson was 59 when he won the Open at Turnberry in 2009. At least that\u2019s how I remember it. Just like I remember Scotland winning the World Cup in 1978, Dundee United the European Cup in 1984, and Colin Montgomerie the US Open in 2006.\u201d Simon McMahon, there, speaking from a parallel universe for so many of us. It\u2019s been an eventful back nine for Darren Clarke. Having bogeyed 14, he followed up with birdie at 15 and now bogey at 16. He\u2019s still in good nick at -1 though. Molinari, having birdied 2, retains his momentum by rolling in a missable par putt on 3. He stays at -1. His partner Scott, having doubled 2, regains some positivity by raking in a long birdie putt on 3. He\u2019s back to +1. An eventful par for the new US Open champion Gary Woodland at 2. He whiffs a wedge from thick greenside nonsense, then clips his second attempt to kick-in distance. He\u2019s level par. His partner Paul Casey has also started par-par. And the third member of the group, Rory McIlroy, sets himself up for a birdie attempt that would give him some desperately required succour. But there\u2019s no bounce-back joy as he tugs a horrible putt wide left from six feet. He\u2019s all over the shop, his mind scrambled, poached and Ulster fried. A huge break for McIlroy on 2, as he lets go of the club on his follow-through while lashing out of the rough. His ball squirts between a couple of fairway bunkers and scampers forward. A chance now to get up and down for a restorative birdie. All the way up the other end of the leaderboard - the pre-tournament favourite McIlroy is currently 60th out of 61 - Lowry birdies 10 and MacIntyre birdies 4. Schauffele keeps on their tail with birdie at 5. So with Hoffman bogeying 16 and Noren dropping one at 9, there\u2019s suddenly some separation at the top! -4: Lowry (10). MacIntyre (7) -3: Schauffele (5) -2: Hoffman (16), Pepperell (10), Noren (9), Simpson (8), Garcia (8), Johnston (7), Im (5), Knox (4), Duval (3) Another fast start for a Scottish star, as Russell Knox follows birdie at 2 with another at 4. He\u2019s -2, alongside Sergio, who after a long string of pars has carded back-to-back birdies at 7 and 8. The rejuvenated 2012 US Open and 2018 Players champion Webb Simpson, playing alongside Garcia, does exactly the same. He\u2019s -2 as well. And on 2, Rory McIlroy, facing up to another year without a major, sends his drive at the par-five 2nd into the thicker rough down the right. The noggin gone. But he\u2019s not alone, because up on the green, Adam Scott makes a double-bogey seven and slips to +2. McIlroy was in deep bracken. So he\u2019s forced to take an unplayable. This is a complete fiasco. He lobs his sixth shot up onto the green, and he\u2019s left with a six-footer. He can\u2019t make it. An opening quadruple-bogey eight. The gallery is stunned into near silence. The expectation too much. Meanwhile birdies for Charley Hoffman at 15, Shane Lowry at 9, and Alex Noren at 8. They all join MacIntyre at -3. McIlroy seven off the lead having played one hole of golf. Yep, McIlroy\u2019s first shot was out of bounds. A disastrous start. The sort of thing Tiger has made a habit of doing at the Open over the years, so in that sense it\u2019s a good omen. But it isn\u2019t good, is it. And things continue to unravel as, taking his fourth stroke from the rough down the left, he allows the thick grass to wrap around the hosel. He sends his ball whistling into even thicker nonsense to the left of the green. He\u2019ll do well to make a triple bogey from here. Dear lord. Here comes Rory. And he might have flayed his opening drive out of bounds down the left. He furrows his brow and mutters the eff-word with great passion and some added feeling. Uh-oh. He\u2019s forced to hit a provisional, and that one goes into the thick rough down the same side too. At least that one\u2019s definitely still on the course. Grillo creams an iron into the 200-yard par-three 13th. The ball bounces off the shoulder of a bunker to the left of the green, and is gathered towards the hole by the camber. It rolls gently towards the cup, one of those that you just know is always going in. So satisfying to watch. Grillo - who has also carded a triple bogey today - grins broadly as he flings a dappled souvenir into the crowd. He\u2019s level par for his work so far. His postman has some work to do after all! Someone finally breaks clear of the pack at -2! It\u2019s the 22-year-old Scot Robert MacIntyre, whose drive at the short par-four 5th finds the fringe. He rolls home a monster eagle putt and ... well, it\u2019s way too early of course, but it\u2019s the 20-year anniversary of the last Scottish winner of the Open. Anyone who fancies a wander down memory lane could do a lot worse than reading this marvellous piece by Elizabeth Nelson of the Ringer. The defending champion Francesco Molinari takes to the first tee. A huge roar of respect - and great fondness - greets the popular Ryder Cup hero, the first Italian to have lifted the Claret Jug. The first shot of his title defence slips just off the left of the fairway, but that\u2019s decent enough. He\u2019s going round with Bryson DeChambeau and 2012\u2019s nearly man Adam Scott. Both find the fairway with their irons. Few would begrudge Scott victory this week, after his heartache at Lytham back in the day, throwing away the title with four bogeys in the last four holes. He\u2019s apparently been playing very well in practice, so perhaps redemption awaits. After Ben Stokes last weekend at Lord\u2019s, perhaps something\u2019s in the air? It seems like half of the field are at -2. Charley Hoffman joins the gang with birdie at 13. His playing partner Darren Clarke had a good chance to grab the lead for himself after sending his tee shot at the par-three to six feet, but he tugs nervously at the putt and has to make do for a par that keeps him at -2. Mixed news for fans of Scottish golf. Robert MacIntyre drops a stroke at 4 to slip to -1. But back on the opening hole, Connor Syme looks to be in a spot of bother, having driven into the thick stuff and chipped out. However he sends his wedge bumping into the green, the ball screeching to a halt a couple of inches to the right of the cup, then taking an abrupt left turn and spinning into the hole. What a way to make a birdie! He\u2019s -1 too. You\u2019ll have noticed a lack of Beef in that leading group. That\u2019s a result of his hacking left and right down 4, finding trouble on both sides of the hole. Bogey, and he slips to -1. G-Mac and Henrik Stenson birdie 2; they\u2019re -1. And it\u2019s back-to-back birdies for Xander Schauffele, who curls in a left-to-right 12-footer on 2 to join the leading group at -2. Im Sung-jae looks a proper player. It\u2019s just his first year on the PGA Tour, but he\u2019s already got top-ten finishes at the Safeway Open, the Phoenix Open, the Valspar, the Corales Puntacan and the Canadian Open to his name. The 21-year-old South Korean has opened with a couple of birdies, and he joins a crowded leading group at -2, that also now includes Darren Clarke and James Sugrue, who have both birdied 12, and another amateur in Brandon Wu, who you may recall making the cut at the US Open a couple of months ago. -2: Clarke (12), Sugrue -a- (12), Wu -a- (9), Langasque (8), Pepperell (7), Lowry (6), Noren (6), Im (2) Langasque didn\u2019t have the sole lead for long. Coming up short at 8, he was only able to send his chip up from the bottom of a bank to 12 feet. He missed the putt, and he\u2019s back in the back at -2. Meanwhile a simple two-putt birdie for Ian Poulter at 2: he\u2019s -1. A super start for Xander Schauffele. Only Brooks Koepka has more top-ten finishes in the majors during the last couple of years. In the mix right up until the end last year at Carnoustie, it\u2019s surely just a matter of time for the 25-year-old from San Diego. He\u2019s unflappable. And in goes a long birdie putt at 1. Pars for his partners G-Mac and the 2016 champ Henrik Stenson. We have a new leader: Romain Langasque. The 24-year-old Frenchman is a man in form, having finished third at the Scottish Open last week, a couple of strokes behind the Bernd Weisberger / Benjamin Hebert play-off. He rattles in a 20-footer on 7 for his third birdie of the day. Meanwhile James Sugrue finds himself out of position on 11, and though he nearly rescues the situation with a 30-foot par putt, the ball stops a turn short. And his partner Darren Clarke, much to the gallery\u2019s chagrin, makes his second bogey in five holes. Both slip out of the leading bunch, dropping to -1. -3: Langasque (7) -2: Pepperell (6), Lowry (5), Noren (5), MacIntyre (3), Johnston (3) Here comes another gallery favourite: Graeme McDowell of Portrush. He looks anxiously after his tee shot, an iron that just creeps into the thicker stuff down the left. But he might get a good lie. Whatever, he\u2019s got an ear-splitting roar of support at his back. Wait until Rory rocks up in an hour\u2019s time. Meanwhile Sergio has opened with four pars. He might have missed a short birdie effort at 2, but he\u2019s since made a couple of missable par putts, so he\u2019ll be in a reasonable enough mood. He\u2019s level par. The biggest cheer of the day so far! Why, who could it be? It\u2019s Beef, isn\u2019t it. He finds the par-five 2nd in two big crashes, then rails home a 50-footer for the first eagle of the week! The gallery go wild, as Beef shrugs and smiles, soaking up the love. It\u2019s so good to see the big man back on form. He\u2019s going round with the young Scottish prospect Robert MacIntyre, and the shinty-loving 22-year-old from Oban has opened with a pair of birdies. No sweat, no fuss. And another birdie for Lowry, at 5. This is hotting up nicely now ... though nobody\u2019s been able to make an early break for it. -2: Clarke (10), Sugrue -a- (10), Langasque (6), Pepperell (5), Lowry (5), Noren (4), MacIntyre (2), Johnston (2) Another birdie for Padraig Harrington! This one comes at 5. He joins the leaders at -2 ... as does James Sugrue, the amateur bouncing back with birdie at 10. But then Harrington hands his shot straight back after a poor tee shot at the par-three 6th. His place at the top table is taken by Alex Noren: the 37-year-old Swede, who finished in the top ten in 2012 and 2017, follows an opening-hole birdie with a second at 4. Away from the golf, some local bobbies have got their panda car stuck in sand down on the beach. They\u2019re wheelspinning away, trying in vain to reverse out of bother, and the tide\u2019s coming in. Shoulders to the boot. Heave! No time to spare. Let\u2019s hope they hoick their vehicle out of the big hole they\u2019ve dug for themselves, else both officers find themselves standing impotently on the shore, watching their car bob off towards the North Atlantic, wondering what to tell the duty sergeant when they return, on foot, to the station. Nobody wants to see any of that. A slow start for the new lo-cal Lefty. Mickelson, slim as a rake after a six-day fast, leaves a chip at 4 well short, and isn\u2019t able to scramble his par. He\u2019s +1. Energy levels low? Meanwhile Sergio\u2019s out and about, and having knocked his approach at 2 to eight feet, misreads the birdie putt and walks off shaking his head. He\u2019s level par. And Darren Clarke reaches the turn in 34, saving his par at 9 after leaving a long putt short. The last three holes have been a struggle for Clarke, but he\u2019s hung on in there. -2: Clarke (9), Langasque (5), Pepperell (4) -1: Sugrue -a- (9), Hoffman (9), Levy (7), Harrington (4), Lowry (4), Noren (3), MacIntyre (1) Beef at breakfast. Andrew Johnston hasn\u2019t been on top of his game for a while now, struggling through some tough times, feeling low. But the wildly popular 30-year-old Londoner rediscovered his form at the Scottish Open last week, shooting a final-day 62 to grab one of the last places at this Open. He cracks an iron down the middle of the opening hole, receiving a welcome barely less wild than the one afforded local hero Darren Clarke at the start of the day. A lovely moment. Meanwhile birdie for another popular Englishman, Eddie Pepperell, this time at 4. He joins Clarke and Langasque in the lead at -2. Lovely birdie for Shane Lowry at the par-three 3rd. He sends his tee shot over the flag, then guides in a right-to-left curler from 20 feet. Loud cheers as he joins the group at -1. Up on 8, the first backwards stumble by James Sugrue, the amateur left with a ten-footer to save his par. He strikes the putt with confidence, but it lips out on the right. He\u2019s back to -1. Meanwhile - apologies to Peter Hall (8.15am) for bearing bad news - Zander Lombard bogeys 5 to return to level par. -2: Clarke (8), Langasque (4) -1: Sugrue -a- (8), Hoffman (8), Levy (6), Harrington (4), Pepperell (3), Lowry (3), Noren (2) Dark clouds overhead. The wind picking up. But at least no rain at the moment. It\u2019s going to be one of those days. A cloud of similar hue will be following Emiliano Grillo around right now: he\u2019s run up a triple-bogey seven on 5, then followed it up with another dropped shot at 6. He\u2019s just completed the easiest portion of the course in +3. His postman can stand down. Clarke nearly escapes 7 with an outrageous par. He putts from off the green, an uphill 50-footer with a big right-to-left break. It stops just one turn shy of dropping. But he\u2019ll slip back to -2. Dreams are never meant to last. -2: Clarke (7), Sugrue -a- (7), Langasque (4) -1: Hoffman (7), Lombard (4), Harrington (3), Pepperell (2), Noren (1) He doesn\u2019t get one. He\u2019s forced to take an unplayable, and drops from knee height, as per the new rules. He slams his fourth towards the front of the green, and trudges towards it with both hands pushed low down in his pockets, another wry smile playing across his face as the rain begins to come down quite heavily. Birdie for Harrington at 3, though, as he knocks his tee shot to 20 feet and rolls in the straight putt he\u2019s left with. And Pepperell joins him at -1 with birdie at 2. \u201cIs Zander Lombard a possible dark horse?\u201d wonders Peter Hall. \u201cWhile he has had a generally poor season, he did well at Lahinch recently . . . and (little known fact). . . he was very narrowly beaten in the final of the Amateur Championship when it was held at Portrush a few years ago. So has good experience on these links.\u201d A rainbow streams across the sky. Not quite so pretty: Clarke\u2019s second at the par-five 7th, sliced into the dunes on the right. He allows himself a wry smile, then goes off in hope of finding a kind lie. Here\u2019s Shane Lowry, and he gets the home-hero treatment. He whips an iron down the middle of 1. He\u2019ll be going round with 2013 champion Phil Mickelson and Branden Grace, who shot that epochal 62 at Birkdale a couple of years ago. Meanwhile the amateur James Sugrue rattles in a straight 30-footer on 6 to make second place all his own ... ah scrub that, because 24-year-old Frenchman Romain Langasque, playing in only his second Open, has birdied 2 and 3. There are plenty of chances for birdies over the opening stretch. -3: Clarke (6) -2: Sugrue -a- (6), Langasque (3) Darren Clarke is making himself at home here. Well, to be fair, Darren Clarke is at home. The Royal Portrush GC member takes advantage of the short par-four 5th to card his third birdie of the day. This is quite something from the 2011 champ, who at 50 would become the oldest major champion in golfing history were he to continue in this manner for the next four days. The estate of Julius Boros (1968 PGA, 48 years) watches on with interest. -3: Clarke (5) -1: Sugrue -a- (5), Hoffman (5), Grillo (4), Lombard (2) Eddie Pepperell, who finished sixth last year after shooting a final-round 67 with a sore licensed-premises head, is greeted heartily by the Ulster crowd. He splits the fairway. No such luck for Bubba Watson, whose record at the Open is the inverse of his brilliance. He whistles an iron into the thick stuff down the left. But up on the green, there\u2019s hope, because Fitzpatrick, who was forced to take his medicine from the rough and hack out, gets up and down from 100 yards for a scrambled par. Harrington walks off happy with his par, too, having sunk his approach into thick oomska to the left of the green. A fine chip whipped through the lush rough to four feet saves the day. The rain has started to come down. It\u2019s already hammering away in Andy Sullivan\u2019s heart, as his nightmare start continues apace. A bogey at the par-five 2nd, the head scrambled, and he\u2019s +3 already. Meanwhile a display of local knowledge at 4 from Darren Clarke, who uses a hillock to the right of the green to send his ball sharp left, towards a pin tucked away behind a bank. He can\u2019t make the mid-range birdie putt he leaves himself, but had he hit his approach another few feet up the hillock, he\u2019d have set himself up with a proper birdie chance. A lot of players will be fast-forwarding through Clarke\u2019s round on the Sky planner this evening, taking copious notes. Here comes another Irish hero. Padraig Harrington, the 2007 and 2008 Champion Golfer, takes to the tee. Looking as intense as ever, he skelps an iron down the middle of the fairway. Meanwhile Matthew Fitzpatrick - who tied for 44th to win the silver medal for low amateur in 2013, a career-high finish he matched as a pro four years later - furrows his brow as he sends a hybrid into the thick stuff down the left. Emiliano Grillo\u2019s Open record isn\u2019t much to write home about. A tie for 12th at Troon, but missed cuts at Birkdale and Carnoustie. But the Argentinian postal service might have some work to do this weekend if the 26-year-old\u2019s antics down the par-five 2nd are anything to go by. A lovely second fired into the green to 20 feet, an eagle putt nearly dropping. He joins Clarke and Sugrue in the red at -1. In goes the birdie putt, and the early Open leaderboard has a breakfast flavour so Irish it could be served with a soda farl. Meanwhile that wild opening tee shot has cost Andy Sullivan at 1. The first dropped shots of the 148th Open: a double bogey. Of the nine players to have completed a hole so far, he\u2019s the only one over par. He\u2019s +2. -2: Clarke (3) -1: Sugrue -a- (1) Clarke sends his ball - a Titleist with a shamrock Sharpied onto it - to a couple of feet at the 177-yard par-three 3rd. Nearly a sensational hole-in-one, and he deserves another smoke. He turns his back to the wind, lights it, and then spins to face the camera with a smile nearly as wide as the one he flashed at Sandwich all those years ago. He\u2019s enjoying this, taking advantage of the mild early weather. They were expecting rain, but it hasn\u2019t arrived yet. It\u2019s coming later this morning, though, and the wind\u2019s likely to pick up a little too. Sunny spells in the afternoon. Changeable, in other words. Hey, this is the Open, all part of the charm. Clarke settles for par on 2, though he very nearly snaked in a birdie putt from the fringe at the back. He looks in the mood to cash in years of experience round here for tangible reward. He remains at -1. But he\u2019s joined in the early lead by James Sugrue, the 22-year-old Amateur Champion playing the par-five in textbook fashion, two long and straight shots to find the green, a couple of calm putts to make his birdie. And so the Open, for what it\u2019s worth at this infant stage, is now led by a former champion and an amateur. -1: Clarke (2), Sugrue -a- (2) E: Hoffman (2), Grillo (1), Kang (1), Thurloway -a- (1) Clarke\u2019s drive at the par-five 2nd dribbles into a bunker down the left, and he won\u2019t be able to go for the green with his second. After splashing back out onto the fairway, he takes a pensive draw from a delicious morning cigarette. But his stress levels will be nothing on poor Andy Sullivan: the 33-year-old from Nuneaton, who tied for 12th at Troon three years ago, hooks his opening drive out of bounds down the left. A horror start. He\u2019s the first to do so, but almost certainly won\u2019t be the last, as there\u2019s OB running down both sides of 1. If you\u2019re feeling tight, it\u2019s tight. The dream start! Hoffman and Sugrue have good looks at birdie from 30 feet or so, but both efforts stop just short of the hole. An opening par at the Open never to be sniffed at. But the Royal Portrush CG member Clarke, having sent his second pin high to 15 feet, guides a lovely right-to-left slider into the cup! Local knowledge could be priceless this week. The first birdie of the 148th Open Championship goes to the home hero. Darren Clarke leads the Open ... again! -1: Clarke (1) E: Sugrue -a- (1), Hoffman (1) \u201cThis is game number one. On the tee from Northern Ireland, Darren Clarke.\u201d Having received a spine-tingling ovation from the early-morning gallery - shades of the Ryder Cup at K-Club in 2006 - the 2011 champion finds the fairway with the first Open shot in Northern Ireland for 68 years. Just. \u201cLeft! Left!\u201d he orders his ball, as it toys with the semi-rough down the right. It obeys. The Cork amateur James Sugrue and Charley Hoffman follow him down. Relieved - because he\u2019ll have thought about that tee shot for quite a while - Clarke stops to enjoy a bit of on-air patter with Sky pundit Paul McGinley, reminding him that he\u2019d beaten him at Portrush in the final of a tournament back in the day. After all the waiting, we\u2019re under way! Bout ye ... and welcome to our coverage of the 148th Open Championship. To date, 96 Opens have been staged in Scotland; 50 have been held in England. But only one of the 147 previous tournaments has taken place in Northern Ireland, here at Royal Portrush way back in 1951. Well, it\u2019s back, baby! It\u2019s been a while, but it\u2019s back. And what a venue! Carnoustie might have the reputation as the toughest course on the Open rota, St Andrews the one most steeped in history. But Portrush - set among rolling dunes hugging the gorgeous Antrim coast, offering views of the Giant\u2019s Causeway, hilly Inishowen, peaty Islay, all that - is perhaps the prettiest. Not that it\u2019ll be a pushover. Back in 1951, only three players broke 70 during the entire tournament, although none of them went on to win. Max Faulkner lifted the auld Claret Jug after rounds of 71, 70, 70 and 74, his trendy long-shafted blade putter smoking hot, making up for the wild slice he\u2019d battled all week. The Dunluce Links course has changed a bit since then, in preparation of an Open for the modern era - a couple of new holes, extra length, more bunkers - but chances are we\u2019ll see a few more sub-70 rounds this time. Even so, let\u2019s bear in mind that two of the three closing holes are called Calamity and Purgatory. One way or another, we\u2019ll see some drama this week. So who\u2019ll follow Faulkner into the history books as an Open winner at Portrush? Local hero Rory McIlroy is the favourite, having held the old course record here (61) before the big redesign of 2015. He\u2019s looking for his fifth major title, as is Brooks Koepka, who paid his dues on the European Tour as a young man and knows full well what needs to be done on this sort of track. The usual suspects line up behind the two favourites: Dustin Johnson, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, the defending champ Francesco Molinari, Xander Schauffele, Tommy Fleetwood, Adam Scott, Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth and of course Tiger Woods. We could continue in this vein for a long, long time - the new US Open champ Gary Woodland? An overdue major breakthrough for Rickie Fowler? Late-career glory for that other local lad G-Mac? - but we\u2019ve got four days of hot golf action stretching out ahead of us, so let\u2019s immediately get down to business. Open fever is raging!

The new measure was passed by a hefty 41-vote majority, after a day of drama in Westminster which saw the resignation of one minister and abstentions from four rebellious cabinet ministers, who will soon be on the backbenches, as well as half a dozen others. Among ministers who defied the whip and did not vote on the complex backbench amendment were the chancellor, Philip Hammond; the justice secretary, David Gauke; the business secretary, Greg Clark; and Rory Stewart, the international development secretary.

The chancellor thinks that despite change at No 10, opposition in parliament means there is no more chance of a no-deal Brexit than there was before Theresa May announced she was stepping down. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and Johnson\u2019s rival for the Tory leadership, was also absent from the voting lists, and later admitted that he did so by accident after wrongly thinking he had been excused. Margot James, the digital industries minister, quit her job to vote in favour of the amendment from Hilary Benn and Alistair Burt attached to a bill about Northern Irish affairs, but there was no action taken against Hammond and the other frontbench abstainers. May\u2019s spokesman said she was \u201cobviously disappointed\u201d at the abstentions, but that it was now up to Johnson or Hunt to decide what to do with rebellious ministers once one of them becomes leader. \u201cNo doubt her successor will take this into account when forming their government,\u201d a Downing Street spokesman said, in a coded warning both to ministers about their futures, and to Johnson about the state of the rebellious parliament he is set to inherit. Should Johnson win the Tory leadership contest and become prime minister, ministers are likely to pre-emptively walk out, forming an instant and influential Conservative bloc opposing no-deal Brexit \u2013 one towards which other Tories, perhaps even May, might gravitate. Among the 17 Conservatives who backed the amendment on Thursday was Tory veteran Keith Simpson, who said it was the first time he had defied party whips during 22 years in parliament. \u201cThis is a huge national issue,\u201d he said. \u201cI said months ago to my local paper and my association that I was totally against no-deal. So this is the first time I have rebelled but you can get a taste for it.\u201d The success of the amendment by 315 votes to 274 also presents any Johnson government with a very practical obstacle, as well as serving as an example of the ingenuity of backbench rebels in thwarting his Brexit plans. While Johnson has said he is not overly keen on the idea of proroguing, or suspending parliament to prevent MPs blocking an overt no-deal policy, he has pointedly refused to rule this out. The amendment now makes this markedly more difficult, building on a series of amendments in the Commons and Lords to dictate that ministers must report regularly to the Commons up to and beyond the Brexit deadline. The host bill is a largely technical measure connected to elections and budgets for the long-suspended Northern Ireland government, and an initial attempt by Conservative remainer Dominic Grieve to attach an explicitly prorogation-blocking amendment was quashed by the Speaker, John Bercow. Bercow did, however, allow another Grieve-tabled amendment, requiring a minister to report to the Commons every two weeks until December on the progress of talks on restoring the Northern Ireland assembly, which was passed last week by a single vote. This was beefed-up by further amendments in the House of Lords. On Wednesday, peers added the condition that the fortnightly reports must be debated in the Commons. When the Lords amendments returned to the Commons, Bercow accepted the Benn-Burt amendment which then made explicit the requirement for the chamber to sit if it had been prorogued. While the combined amendment does make prorogation difficult, a no-deal departure is still the default option on the Brexit deadline of 31 October unless Johnson or Hunt are able to swiftly conclude a new departure deal, something the EU has dismissed as extremely unlikely. The vote came on the day the government\u2019s independent forecasting body predicted a no-deal Brexit would plunge Britain into a recession that would shrink the economy by 2%, push unemployment above 5% and send house prices tumbling by around 10%. The Office for Budget Responsibility said the result would be a year-long downturn that would increase borrowing by \u00a330bn a year, prompting a fresh warning from Hammond to MPs backing no-deal Brexit. After her resignation, James said the majority for the amendment had been emphatic because of the concerns of so many ministers and ex-ministers who rebelled or abstained. She hinted more resignations could follow if Johnson was confirmed as leader next Tuesday. \u201cI think we have to wait and see what happens next. Jeremy Hunt would behave in an appropriate way, he does not believe in proroguing parliament, which is just too extreme, so I don\u2019t expect people to resign until they know for sure what the outcome is next week,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is difficult for anyone to resign, yes, and very difficult for me.

Sir Jon Thompson announced he was quitting as chief executive after three years to take on a new role in Whitehall as head of the Financial Reporting Council. The straight-talking Thompson, who joined in 2016, was highly regarded in the civil service and was not afraid of telling inconvenient truths about the cost of Brexit at his numerous appearances at select committees. As early as September 2017 he was warning the government about Brexit fantasies, telling a select committee that border and tax checks after Brexit could require an extra 5,000 staff, with new customs checks costing the taxpayer up to \u00a3800m. Last year he revealed he received death threats after disclosing that the post-EU customs option preferred by Brexiters would cost up to \u00a320bn. His departure is the third blow to the government\u2019s Brexit planning, coming hot on the heels of the retirement of Karen Wheeler, who was in charge of Brexit border delivery at HMRC, and Tom Shinner, 33, who left his job in charge of no-deal planning at the Department for Exiting the European Union for a role in the private sector. Thompson was also credited with successive, record-breaking increases in the collection of tax revenues, reducing the gap between tax owed and received, and cementing the online business tax returns system with the Making Tax Digital reforms.

Stonegate, for all its expansion, has 772 outlets versus 4,000 properties in the Ei estate. This is a very big step up.</p> <p>It is also happening at a high price. Most UK pub chains are valued at about eight or nine times operating earnings, but Ei will be changing hands at 11.4 times. That is why the target\u2019s board said yes to a bid in cash: it\u2019s hard to refuse an offer at a 38% premium to Wednesday\u2019s share price.</p> <p>As for financial leverage, it looks as if the combined outfit will start life at six times, as measured by net debt to top-line earnings. TDR could argue that\u2019s roughly where Ei stands today, so nothing much is changing. OK, but six times still looks intoxicating in a sector with an unlovely record of accidents with debt. The buyer is not leaving much room for error or recession.</p> <h2>Water nationalisation has changed the flow of debate</h2> <p>\u201cThese are seriously stretching goals for the sector,\u201d said Rachel Fletcher, chief executive of water regulator Ofwat, unveiling the latest five-year review. And, by Ofwat\u2019s much-criticised standards, perhaps she\u2019s right. Ignoring the effects of inflation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/18/regulator-orders-water-bills-in-england-and-wales-to-be-cut-by-50-pounds-ofwat\">bills will fall by an average of \u00a350 per household from April next year</a>, which does genuinely count as a tougher settlement than in the past.</p> <p>Do not, though, expect the Ofwat stance to lower the political temperature. The mere threat of nationalisation under Labour has changed the debate. Even the Tories know further corporate dividend bonanzas would land on their doorstep. The big-picture five-year outlook for water is political interference of some form.</p>",

TDR established Stonegate, the company behind Slug &amp; Lettuce, as long ago as 2010 and has doubled its original size through purchases while not stinting on organic investment. Very good, but it would be hard to describe this purchase of Ei as low-risk. Stonegate, for all its expansion, has 772 outlets versus 4,000 properties in the Ei estate. This is a very big step up. It is also happening at a high price. Most UK pub chains are valued at about eight or nine times operating earnings, but Ei will be changing hands at 11.4 times. That is why the target\u2019s board said yes to a bid in cash: it\u2019s hard to refuse an offer at a 38% premium to Wednesday\u2019s share price. As for financial leverage, it looks as if the combined outfit will start life at six times, as measured by net debt to top-line earnings. TDR could argue that\u2019s roughly where Ei stands today, so nothing much is changing. OK, but six times still looks intoxicating in a sector with an unlovely record of accidents with debt. The buyer is not leaving much room for error or recession. Water nationalisation has changed the flow of debate \u201cThese are seriously stretching goals for the sector,\u201d said Rachel Fletcher, chief executive of water regulator Ofwat, unveiling the latest five-year review. And, by Ofwat\u2019s much-criticised standards, perhaps she\u2019s right. Ignoring the effects of inflation, bills will fall by an average of \u00a350 per household from April next year, which does genuinely count as a tougher settlement than in the past. Do not, though, expect the Ofwat stance to lower the political temperature. The mere threat of nationalisation under Labour has changed the debate. Even the Tories know further corporate dividend bonanzas would land on their doorstep. The big-picture five-year outlook for water is political interference of some form.",

A two-day hearing due to take place on 30 and 31 July in the family division of the court relates to the couple\u2019s two children.

      "bodyText": "Waitrose is closing seven supermarkets as it undergoes its second round of store reductions this year, in a move that puts nearly 700 jobs at risk. Three supermarkets, in Bromley in London, Oadby in Leicestershire and Wollaton in Nottinghamshire, have been sold to Lidl in the latest sign of the changing grocery market being radically shaken up by fast-growing cut-price chains. Lidl and its fellow German discounter Aldi are drawing in middle-class bargain-hunters as well as those on a tight budget, overtaking Waitrose to become the UK\u2019s 5th and 7th largest grocers, controlling nearly 14% of the market, according to analysts at Kantar, up from about 10% only three years ago. As well as the sales to Lidl, Waitrose is selling a fourth store, in Sandhurst, Berkshire, to another unnamed buyer while the group\u2019s sites in Marlow in Buckinghamshire, Stevenage in Hertfordshire, and a convenience store at BA headquarters near Heathrow airport, will all close down in the autumn. A total of 677 staff are affected. The employees are being consulted on the changes, with options including potential redeployment within the group. No staff are expected to transfer to the new site owners. Mark Gifford, Waitrose\u2019s director of shop trade, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t taken this decision lightly but we have to do what\u2019s right for the business as a whole. Thanks to the hard work of all our partners we\u2019re making good progress and Waitrose &amp; Partners is on track for profit growth this year but, despite the best efforts of everyone involved, we haven\u2019t been able to find a way to make these shops profitable in the long term.\u201d The latest closures come after Waitrose sold off five unprofitable shops in March, with the loss of 440 jobs. Those supermarkets, in Torquay and Teignmouth in Devon, Barry in Glamorgan, Ashbourne in Derbyshire and Blaby in Leicestershire, closed last month. Five other shops were closed last year. Waitrose is cutting costs amid tough conditions on the high street. Earlier this year the supermarket\u2019s parent group, the John Lewis Partnership, slashed its staff bonus to the lowest level in 66 years after a disastrous year for its department stores, which resulted in a 45% slump in the group\u2019s annual profits. Waitrose profits rose 18% over the year, and the company expects profits to rise this year, but it is also being forced to invest heavily in its online grocery service as it prepares to end a long-term distribution deal with Ocado next year. Waitrose is aiming to treble the size of its online business to \u00a31bn annually following the end of its Ocado deal in October 2020, by teaming up with one of the grocery delivery specialist\u2019s co-founders, Jonathan Faiman. The retailer, which has 344 stores in the UK including 61 \u201cLittle Waitrose\u201d convenience stores, has said it will compete with bigger rivals by focusing on differentiation, adding better services and more innovative products, rather than trying to become bigger. Trading has been tough for supermarkets so far this year as they face rising costs and poor sales compared with 2018 when they were helped by a long spell of warm weather and a string of set-piece events including the Royal wedding and England\u2019s success in the football world cup. Sales have fallen by 0.5% in the first 24 weeks of Waitrose\u2019s financial year with both food and homewares affected. Bryan Roberts, insights director at grocery analysts TCC Global, said Waitrose\u2019s closures mirrored similar moves by traditional rivals including Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco in recent years as they tried to cut costs amid pressure on price from Aldi and Lidl. \u201cEverybody apart from Aldi and Lidl is having to be more rigorous in getting rid of the runts of the litter that are not pulling their weight because of local competition or just a bad location.

You\u2019re busy preaching love, harmony and laxative tea.

While I did gain a very photogenic selection of free protein powder, it was probably one of the most gruelling, confusing and miserable times of my life.</p> <p>It happened almost accidentally. A few years ago, I had freshly graduated from university and was busy bumming around my student flat when I got a call asking me to move to New Zealand and present on the flagship daily breakfast TV show. I was 21, it was my first real job, and I didn\u2019t even have an Instagram then let alone any aspirations of pastel filtered fame.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/09/byron-bay-influencers-broadcast-a-life-thats-too-good-to-be-true-because-it-is\">Byron Bay influencers broadcast a life that's too good to be true \u2013 because it is | Brigid Delaney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So I said yes, moved countries and started an account with a vague idea it\u2019d be good to have \u201cfor my brand\u201d. And by virtue of being on national TV every morning, I went from nothing to having over 8,000 combined followers across my \u201cchannels\u201d.</p> <p>I became a bonafide influencer, getting sent everything from fancy undies to cell phones, and curating every moment of my peachy life with painstakingly casual captions. It was awful.

It showers you with attention, making you feel as though you are incredibly important and interesting because all these people are paying attention to you.</p> <p>Instafame does all of this. I became convinced that I was <em>so</em> fascinating. If I was the centre of attention on my phone, that should translate into being the centre of attention in real life. It makes you the worst kind of dick: entitled, self obsessed, and <em>incredibly</em> dull because the only thing you think about is yourself. And it wasn\u2019t helped by being in my 20s and so naturally inclined to think the world revolves around me anyway.</p> <p>But it\u2019s also a particularly vicious type of fame because it\u2019s so insecure. Insta-fame is right at the bottom of the glitter hierarchy, widely acknowledged by the genuinely famous as the most fickle and unearned glory \u2013 even more than Love Island. You can see where they\u2019re coming from. Most real world famous people earn fame by doing their job really well. But for influencers, your butt shots are your business. So we\u2019re are constantly aware of the tenuousness of our fame, which makes us even more desperate to hold on to it.</p> <p>It\u2019s also the most numbly exhausting job I\u2019ve ever done. Normally it takes at least five hours to do a professional photo shoot. When you\u2019re an influencer, you need this level of quality but don\u2019t have a team behind you so it becomes<em> </em>incredibly time consuming.</p> <p>You get trapped in your own triviality, in the mind numbing packaging and distribution of the minutiae of your day. It\u2019s real joy killer. Normally you take a photo because you want to capture a great moment, right? But as an influencer you have to manufacture those moments, stripmining the fun out of coffee dates because you\u2019re managing the scene like Annie Leibovitz \u2013 if Annie Leibovitz was a basic bitch with a passion for latte art.</p> <p>But the very worst, most dangerous part of instafame in your 20s is that it totally messes up your character development. Not only did it make me self obsessed, but it indulged my very worst qualities.</p> <p>Social media feeds those darkest parts of every personality, encouraging you to rant on Twitter, brag on Facebook, or be vain on Insta. Vanity sells on the \u2018Gram. The hotter the pic, the better it does, so the more time you spend in the mirror creating them. Staying Instafamous relies on you mining the depths of your own narcissism.</p> <p>The problem is that your 20s you\u2019re busy working out who you want to be. A big part of that process is managing and squashing down the dark parts of yourself to make more room for your better parts. But Instafame fed my own vanity and insecurity until it became almost impossible to control them and make space for my better self.</p> <p>So I stopped. I\u2019ve still got Instagram, but I\u2019m officially an ex-influencer. I stopped posting as much and lost a lot of followers, and I deleted most of my classic influencer shots in a fit of self disgust.</p> <p>I realised in order to stay Insta-famous I\u2019d have had to nurture the most pathetic parts of my own psyche. And honestly, no amount of free ombre activewear is worth that.</p> <ul> <li><p>Verity Johnson is a freelance journalist, opinion columnist and TV presenter who moonlights as a part time comedic rapper, Verit$izle (the dollar sign is silent)</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Nothing messes you up quite so royally as becoming Insta-famous. It\u2019s just as bad as genuine fame, only without the public fawning or free Fendi sports bras to soften your descent into self obsession, insecurity and casual bitchiness. Of course you don\u2019t realise it. You\u2019re busy preaching love, harmony and laxative tea. Plus you\u2019re distracted by every brick wall or passing dog that you could drag in to your #candid shots of you laughing maniacally while holding a conveniently placed (and delicious!) protein shake. I used to be Insta-famous and it was one of the worst things to happen in my 20s. While I did gain a very photogenic selection of free protein powder, it was probably one of the most gruelling, confusing and miserable times of my life. It happened almost accidentally. A few years ago, I had freshly graduated from university and was busy bumming around my student flat when I got a call asking me to move to New Zealand and present on the flagship daily breakfast TV show. I was 21, it was my first real job, and I didn\u2019t even have an Instagram then let alone any aspirations of pastel filtered fame. So I said yes, moved countries and started an account with a vague idea it\u2019d be good to have \u201cfor my brand\u201d. And by virtue of being on national TV every morning, I went from nothing to having over 8,000 combined followers across my \u201cchannels\u201d. I became a bonafide influencer, getting sent everything from fancy undies to cell phones, and curating every moment of my peachy life with painstakingly casual captions. It was awful. Primarily because I was awful. Insta-fame has a phenomenal, if unsurprising, capacity to turn you into a dick. We all know that real fame is dangerous. It showers you with attention, making you feel as though you are incredibly important and interesting because all these people are paying attention to you. Instafame does all of this. I became convinced that I was so fascinating. If I was the centre of attention on my phone, that should translate into being the centre of attention in real life. It makes you the worst kind of dick: entitled, self obsessed, and incredibly dull because the only thing you think about is yourself. And it wasn\u2019t helped by being in my 20s and so naturally inclined to think the world revolves around me anyway. But it\u2019s also a particularly vicious type of fame because it\u2019s so insecure. Insta-fame is right at the bottom of the glitter hierarchy, widely acknowledged by the genuinely famous as the most fickle and unearned glory \u2013 even more than Love Island. You can see where they\u2019re coming from. Most real world famous people earn fame by doing their job really well. But for influencers, your butt shots are your business. So we\u2019re are constantly aware of the tenuousness of our fame, which makes us even more desperate to hold on to it. It\u2019s also the most numbly exhausting job I\u2019ve ever done. Normally it takes at least five hours to do a professional photo shoot. When you\u2019re an influencer, you need this level of quality but don\u2019t have a team behind you so it becomes incredibly time consuming. You get trapped in your own triviality, in the mind numbing packaging and distribution of the minutiae of your day. It\u2019s real joy killer. Normally you take a photo because you want to capture a great moment, right? But as an influencer you have to manufacture those moments, stripmining the fun out of coffee dates because you\u2019re managing the scene like Annie Leibovitz \u2013 if Annie Leibovitz was a basic bitch with a passion for latte art. But the very worst, most dangerous part of instafame in your 20s is that it totally messes up your character development. Not only did it make me self obsessed, but it indulged my very worst qualities. Social media feeds those darkest parts of every personality, encouraging you to rant on Twitter, brag on Facebook, or be vain on Insta. Vanity sells on the \u2018Gram. The hotter the pic, the better it does, so the more time you spend in the mirror creating them. Staying Instafamous relies on you mining the depths of your own narcissism. The problem is that your 20s you\u2019re busy working out who you want to be. A big part of that process is managing and squashing down the dark parts of yourself to make more room for your better parts. But Instafame fed my own vanity and insecurity until it became almost impossible to control them and make space for my better self. So I stopped. I\u2019ve still got Instagram, but I\u2019m officially an ex-influencer. I stopped posting as much and lost a lot of followers, and I deleted most of my classic influencer shots in a fit of self disgust. I realised in order to stay Insta-famous I\u2019d have had to nurture the most pathetic parts of my own psyche. And honestly, no amount of free ombre activewear is worth that.

      "bodyText": "The federal government is preparing to unveil \u201cambitious\u201d new targets that will require all states and territories to spend a portion of their procurement budgets on recycled materials for public projects. New waste reduction minister, Trevor Evans, who is the first person to hold the portfolio at a federal level, said he would seek agreement from state and territory environment ministers for the new target at their next meeting, expected before the end of the year. The move is aimed at kickstarting a domestic commercial market for Australian waste, responding to a growing crisis in the sector after China stopped importing plastic recyclables, and after other south-east Asian countries, including Indonesia, rejected shipments of Australian waste. Evans told Guardian Australia that the \u201cambitious\u201d procurement target would be backed up with financial support from the commonwealth to help support the burgeoning recycling manufacturing sector. \u201cI would like to see all of the states and the commonwealth agree that by X date, X percentage of their significant procurement programs will be made of recycled materials,\u201d Evans said. While he declined to nominate the target, he said it needed to be sufficient to kickstart the manufacturing sector and would likely deal with stockpiles of recyclables that have accumulated because there have been no willing buyers of the waste. The push comes as the federal government prepares to embark on a $100bn infrastructure program over the next decade, with about $42bn of that slated for the next four years. \u201cWe need a critical mass of demand in order to help business and innovators come up with the supply solution,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some significant stockpiling problems around Australia, where I think if we can create markets for demand, that would be our best possible chance of realising the value of those stockpiles. \u201cI am very ambitious when it comes to the targets I would like to see government adopt [and] I think there are some very big opportunities that will drive some big steps forward.\u201d Evans said that once a target was set, it would be left to state governments to determine which projects were best suited to use recyclables, suggesting roads, public transport and water infrastructure could all be contenders. New procurement targets have been backed by environmental and industry groups, who say a domestic recycling market would prevent recyclable material kept in Australia sitting in stockpiles or going to landfill. Currently about 90% of waste that does not go to landfill stays in Australia and 10% is exported. The Coalition went to the election promising a $167m Australian recycling investment package, which it said would increase recycling rates, tackle plastic waste and litter and halve food waste by 2030. Most of this funding \u2013 about $100m \u2013 is earmarked for recycling manufacturing. Evans said the government wanted to see progress made on the reduction of single-use plastic, but that the issue was \u201ccomplex\u201d and would require cooperation from states and industry. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a silver-bullet solution,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody has a role to play, and in some of these complex areas it is going to be critical to ensure that industry is a big part of the solution.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An Australian research team led by the renowned quantum physicist Prof Michelle Simmons has announced a major breakthrough in quantum computing, which researchers hope could lead to much greater computing power within a decade. Simmons, a former Australian of the Year, and her team at the University of New South Wales announced in a paper published in Nature journal on Thursday that they have been able to achieve the first two-qubit gate between atom qubits in silicon, allowing them to communicate with each other at a 200 times faster rate than previously achieved at 0.8 nanoseconds. A qubit is a quantum bit. In this design, it is built from single phosphorus atoms in silicon. In standard computing, a bit can exist in one of two states \u2013 1 or 0. For qubits, it can be 1 or 0 or both simultaneously, which is referred to as a superposition. By being able to exist in both states simultaneously, the qubit can solve problems much faster than bits. This allows for much faster processing than current computers, meaning complex problems can be solved much more quickly. A two-qubit gate operates like a logic gate in traditional computing, and the team at UNSW was able to achieve the faster operation by putting the two atom qubits closer together than ever before \u2013 just 13 nanometres \u2013 and in real-time controllably observing and measuring their spin states. A scanning tunnelling microscope was used to place the atoms in silicon after the optimal distance between the two qubits had been worked out. The research has been two decades in the making, after researchers in Australia opted to build a quantum computer on silicon material. Simmons told Guardian Australia it was \u201cquite a bold move\u201d to try to build a quantum computer on silicon, but was starting to pay off. The research is still not as far ahead as Google or IBM, which have built 72-qubit and 50-qubit processors, respectively. Reducing the error rate, however, is key before quantum computing can reach scale and what is being heralded as \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d where quantum computing can solve what can\u2019t be solved by computers today. In choosing silicon, Simmons said the research team had demonstrated that their atomic-scale circuitry has the lowest electrical noise of any system yet devised to connect to a semiconductor qubit. The next stage of research for the team will be to get to 10-qubit in the next five years, and hopefully within a decade to commercialising. Simmons said the work with the team of researchers at UNSW was \u201cruthlessly systematic\u201d with no room for errors, but very rewarding. \u201cWe do like to have fun. I think that\u2019s one of the key things: we work hard but we play hard.\u201d",

Ben Lindsay \u2013 the author of We Need To Talk About Race \u2013 which focuses on ethnicity and the church \u2013 and his publisher SPCK launched the book online on Thursday. Eddo-Lodge released a statement saying that neither Lindsay or SPCK had approached her before the book was announced, and said she felt it was \u201cdisappointingly derivative of both the title of my book and Greg Heinimann\u2019s award-winning cover design\u201d. Eddo-Lodge, who received an honourary degree from Exeter University this week, said that while she \u201crecognises that imitation and comparison title and covers are core to publishing\u2019s business model \u2026 this close imitation is a missed opportunity for what has the potential to be a fresh take on an old problem\u201d.

The Australian batting order is monstrous. That power, the clean hitting, the uncomplicated, clean (but not slogging), simple techniques that they have all down their middle and lower-middle order, that\u2019s where this game is likely to be set up and taken beyond England\u2019s reach over two innings. It also probably gives the top order that confidence to go about their work positively without worrying that what\u2019s to come behind them will fold. There seems so little in the Australian batting set-up, trigger movements and technique that can go awry. It clears the way for players to concentrate on judgement. I have a lot of fear. I can feel the fear. Also, it\u2019s already ragging for our orthodox spinners \u2013 heaven knows what it\u2019ll be doing by Sunday. At least Australia doesn\u2019t have a leggie in this side (am I right in thinking the spin options are all orthodox?). I\u2019m sure you try to be neutral when OBO-ing, but you must be so delighted to have this side represent Australia. As Rachael Haynes intimated recently when asked whether women should play more test cricket, the rest of the world has some catching up to do I fear. Yours with growing concern.\u201d</p> <p>You are right about the depth of Australia\u2019s batting. Jonassen\u2019s 99 on Test debut last time around four years ago was a bit of an outlier, in that, she struggled to make a run in the years since. However, during the ODIs of this comp she was outstanding. England agrees with her with both the ball and the bat. In terms of more Test cricket, take a look at Megan Schutt\u2019s piece overnight. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/18/why-womens-test-cricket-must-become-more-regular-and-widespread\">Why women's Test cricket must become more regular and widespread | Megan Schutt</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d305fec8f08cf92bb7723f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/adam-collins\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T12:07:49.353Z\">1.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Healy dominant; England hold their nerve. </strong>Striking 12 boundaries in her 58, Healy looked like she was on the cusp of doing something special.

The Australian captain should have followed her but Knight put her down just before lunch at extra cover. That could be costly in the context of what will more than likely be a low-scoring affair.

For England, Amy Jones and Kirstie Gordon are set to make their Test Match bows. </p> <p>For the visitors, it was a brilliant touch having Dan Christian on deck to present Gardner with the famous cap. Of course, the two of them captained the teams that toured England last summer to mark 150 years since the trailblazing Indigenous Australians visited this country to play in 1868. Mitch Starc welcomed Vlaeminck, a fellow speedster, to the fold while Belinda Clark, the interim boss of high performance and former dominant skipper, gave the speech for Molineux. </p> <p>The latter, a big turner of the ball with her left-arm orthodox, will like the look of the pitch. There has been some debate as to what constitutes a used surface, but the facts are that it was last played on for the Afghanistan vs New Zealand World Cup game on 8 June. There are some very helpful footmarks on show outside the off-stump for left-handers at the River End. We\u2019ll see how that all plays out. </p> <p>England do need a result well inside the four days with rain forecast tomorrow. A draw is enough for Australia to retain the trophy having swept the ODIs three-zip a couple of weeks ago, the third in spectacular fashion when Ellyse Perry took 7/22. </p> <p>I\u2019ll be back with the formal teams and toss shortly.

      "bodyText": "Our full match report from Taunton will follow, but here\u2019s a quick wires version until then: Ellyse Perry was again England\u2019s tormentor as Australia moved a step closer towards retaining the Women\u2019s Ashes by closing on 265 for three in the only Test between the sides. Perry took seven wickets for 22 as Australia clinched a whitewash victory in the one-day part of the multi-format series earlier this month, and the all-rounder\u2019s patient 84 not out with the bat put her side in the box seat at Taunton. On a sluggish pitch, where scoring became increasingly difficult, there were also half-centuries for Alyssa Healy, Australia captain Meg Lanning and Rachael Haynes, who put on an unbroken 105 alongside Perry. To compound matters for England, Tammy Beaumont was struck on the hand while fielding at short leg and was taken to hospital for an X-ray. Trailing 6-0 and needing all four points on offer for the Test win to stop Australia retaining the urn, England made a breakthrough in the seventh over after being asked to field when Nicole Bolton was bowled by Katherine Brunt. Fellow opener Healy, though, found the boundary rope with regularity as she advanced to 58 before being bowled around her legs by Kirstie Gordon, one of two England Test debutants alongside Amy Jones. Gordon was denied a second wicket in her next over shortly before lunch when England captain Heather Knight dropped her Australian counterpart Lanning on 26, spilling a relatively simple opportunity at short cover. Lanning eventually reached 57 before becoming the third Australian batter to be bowled when Sophie Ecclestone\u2019s quicker delivery skidded on to the stumps. Haynes, however, quickly settled into her task, racing to 21 off 26 balls before becoming more watchful alongside Perry, who reached her half-century shortly before the tea interval. The pair hunkered down in the final session, adding only 62 runs in 33 overs, and were there at the close, with Haynes becoming the fourth Australian to go past 50. Right, I\u2019m not sure England are going to chat right now - so I\u2019ll leave you with Ellyse Perry. Last time she played a Test, she scored a double-century. She sleeps on 84 not out, and England, who need to win this Test to win the Ashes, have to get rid of her early tomorrow. Thanks for all the messages everyone. Good night! England, who are waiting for X-ray news on Tammy Beaumont\u2019s thumb, haven\u2019t spoken yet. Some Breaking News courtesy of both twitter and OBO\u2019s very own twitter: Abhijato. Zimbabwe have been suspended by the ICC with immediate effect. A very happy Meg Lanning is talking: \u201cWe thought that the wicket would play as it did. England didn\u2019t make it easy for us, they bowled straight lines and to still have two good batters in at the end of the day is crucial. \u201cIt was nice to be able t0 build partnerships in the innings, England bowled well at times. We feel in a really strong position. \u201cIt\u2019s a different style, you need to be able to absorb periods of pressure, and I had to fight my instincts today. It was a different innings from me today but I really enjoyed it. I was keen to have pride in my defence. I really enjoyed the adjustment - it is not a format I\u2019ve had a lot of success in before. \u201c In the morning we will carry on for a little bit, there is a bit of weather around but we\u2019ll have to consolidate, first-innings runs are going to be crucial in this match.\u201d 100th over: Australia 265-3 (Haynes 54, Perry 84) England indulge in a bit of time-wasting to ensure they don\u2019t have to bowl another over. Anyway, this one from Ecclestone is smart and on the money. Australia scamper through for three and that\u2019s stumps! The Aussies look happy, and England, who never gave up, look relieved. A slow run-rate - 2. 65 - but the Aussies, ever-patient, are building a dominant position. Rain though, is forecast. 99th over: Australia 262-3 (Haynes 52, Perry 83) .Marsh bowls. Dot. Dot. Dot. Dot. Dot. and somewhere within a cheeky little single to add a little dazzle to the afternoon. I thought At-Ellyse-t you would understand that I love having a good Straw-Perry from the end of the garden! Tuvic, I hope your family are as tolerant as Australia\u2019s batters... 98th over: Australia 261-3 (Haynes 51, Perry 83) And with a drive through the covers, Perry brings up the hundred partnership off 264 balls (including only one extra.) Ecclestone keeps it tight for the remainder of the over. And spectators\u2019 minds turn to supper. We\u2019re having spaghetti, though I could do with some inspiration to be honest. A lovely tweet from Pakistan: 97th over: Australia 259-3 (Haynes 50, Perry 82) Another maiden from Laura Marsh. Just three overs to go in the day now. Can England make a late breakthrough? 96th over: Australia 259-3 (Haynes 50, Perry 82) Haynes considers a single, gets a third of the way down the pitch then changes her mind. She bats away four more balls before at last pulling Ecclestone for one. Well played! Off 145 balls, it started quickly but turned into a bit of a dirge. She\u2019s delighted, a huge smile under the helmet. Tuvic Tuslow writes: Ecclestone hasn\u2019t been at her best today, but neither has she been jeered. If she was, we would call her Hecklestone! Okay, I\u2019ll show myself out ... Through the back door and down the garden path Tuvic - and keep your hands off the strawberries at the end of the garden. 95th over: Australia 258-3 (Haynes 49, Perry 82) A four, a four, a palpable four! A flick off the hips by Perry from Marsh. We see Tammy Beaumont looking through the dressing-room glass darkly - that injured thumb is the last thing England need. And Haynes sits once more on 49. 94th over: Australia 251-3 (Haynes 49, Perry 76) The tireless Ecclestone reels in, pony tail swinging. And Haynes is stranded on 49 once more! OB has evidence of sandwich eating. If the players can eat sandwiches in the field Tanya, so can the umpires! 93rd over: Australia 251-3 (Haynes 49, Perry 76) Perry watches carefully through the bars of her helmet and turns Marsh off her hip for a single. Oh! And totally against the run of play, Perry is nearly run out as Haynes changes her mind mid-run after Brunt picks up and throws in the covers. If she\u2019d hit, it would have been close. I\u2019ll just leave this here: 92nd over: Australia 250-3 (Haynes 48, Perry 75) Knight calls it a day on the seamers from both ends - and calls up Ecclestone from the pavilion end. Haynes\u2019 eyes light up and she tip-toes down the pitch and lofts her over mid wicket for four. OB Jato knows what umpires carry in their pockets. The umpires carry a clipper (for seam-cutting purposes), a handkerchief, a bandage, a DLS sheet and a cheese sandwich in their backpocket. No, don\u2019t ask me why they need the DLS sheet . OB - are you sure? Surely, back in day, a packet of fags. And some mints. 91st over: Australia 244-3 (Haynes 42, Perry 75) I didn\u2019t see a ball of Marsh\u2019s over I\u2019m afraid. But four runs came from it. Australia - unleashed! 90th over: Australia 240-3 (Haynes 42, Perry 71) The Sky swingometer says that Shrubsole is getting more swing in this spell than she did in her last. Perhaps that is why Perry and Haynes are being so watchful. Perhaps it\u2019s the rain that is forecast over the next two days. Perhaps England\u2019s accuracy has dimmed their confidence for the bigger, more audacious strokes. Perry is getting close to the record number of runs scored in a Test before a dismissal Tat Wood, stretches, and taps on the keyboard: It\u2019s just gone noon in New England and, after the trouble I had on Sunday explaining why I was reading updates about a game I didn\u2019t entirely understand, I hope nobody asks why I\u2019m so on edge about an hour of not-much-happeningness. If anyone asks you can draw them into our web....but you\u2019re very loyal to be watching this at lunchtime in New England. I hope there is a pastrami on rye on hand? 89th over: Australia 240-3 (Haynes 42, Perry 71) Haynes scores her first run for 25 balls as Brunt keeps on the money. Is it ungallant to wish they\u2019d get on with it a bit? 88th over: Australia 239-3 (Haynes 41, Perry 71) Shrubsole has located her swing. The umpire cuts a bit of spare thread off the seam. I wonder what other tools an umpire carries in his back pocket? JP adds to my inbox\u2019s excitement. He has been thinking about the World Cup. Just some thoughts on the strange failure of England cricket to capitalise on the Women\u2019s World Cup win. My then 8 year old daughter was completely enthused by the whole tournament and signed up with a local club. We watched Australia play in the tournament, and all the Aussie players were unfailingly brilliant to all the kids who came to watch - signing autographs all day, while Meg Lanning came over to my daughter when she was looking a little glum and had a nice little chat. But there has never been so much as a highlights package of the final or any kind of souvenir publication released. Meanwhile, the KIA superleague team that my daughter started supporting on the back of the world cup is now to be folded in favour of the Hundred. Inexplicable. And such opportunities missed. JP I think there are lots of female county cricketers and fans who would agree with you. I guess we won\u2019t be able to judge properly on the folly or otherwise of the Hundred for a few years. The good thing is the investment - but I too wonder about the wisdom of doing away with the blossoming Super League. Interesting thoughts about the Final - was there really no glossy publication or DVD released? And I\u2019m so glad your daughter is a fan! 87th over: Australia 239-3 (Haynes 41, Perry 71) Brunt is cheesed off. Sarah Taylor enthuses from behind the stumps \u201cCome on girls\u201d- but it turns out Perry and Haynes, despite the lack of long-form cricket, have concentration to die for. Block. Block. Block. Block. 86th over: Australia 238-3 (Haynes 41, Perry 70) One run off Shrubsole\u2019s over. I do admire her effort. That\u2019s drinks. And another email - two in ten minutes! Thanks Andrew! Hi Tanya \u2013after the frantic and emotional World Cup (even once I know South Africa were eliminated), it is nice to have about two months of test cricket to watch/follow OBO where I can be completely neutral and a bit more relaxed- although what price another men\u2019s Ashes classic. I do wish there were more Women\u2019s tests as I do see it as the ultimate in cricket \u2013 is there any way that will happen give the numbers of women\u2019s tests seems to be in permanent decline? Hi Andrew, I agree that it is the pinnacle. And I feel for the players who are desperate to have more of a crack at the longer game. The boards seem to have bet the silver on short-form cricket working for the women and attracting the fans. A very interesting column by Megan Schutt (below) discusses the issues if you fancy a read. I didn\u2019t actually realise that only English and Australian women played Test cricket. 85th over: Australia 237-3 (Haynes 41, Perry 69) Brunt bustles in, but though no runs come off the over, Australia\u2019s batters are untroubled. England have nearly bowled their requisite overs but I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ve still got an hour left to play. The ever faithful OBO reader Abhijato Sensarma writes: I\u2018ve heard excellent things about Robin Smith\u2019s autobiography and will buy it as soon as it reaches the shelves in Kolkata. If what you say about his father is true, my mind turns to a recently-retired legend\u2019s father who behaved similarly - Yograj Singh, father of Yuvraj Singh. He was an international cricketer himself. Legend has it that he threw away Yuvi\u2019s medals and skates because he wanted his son to solely pursue and excel in cricket. \u2018Inhumane\u2019 is the only word which comes to my mind to describe his father\u2019s treatment, but Yuvraj did become the white-ball great for India. When it comes between what he achieved and what was the main well-documented torturous driving force which got him there, I can\u2019t humanely justify anyone suffering like he did irrespective of the results. Alas, this is another moral dilemma when it comes to maximising excellence in sports! Thanks Abhijato, I didn\u2019t know that about Yuvraj. I think there are many similar stories behind sporting excellence sadly - all the efforts make for very talented players, but perhaps not very happy human beings. 84th over: Australia 237-3 (Haynes 41, Perry 69) The shackles have broken! Perry hits two consecutive boundaries: a cut then a charming cover drive. Shrubsole strays slightly off target. Knight is still very enthusiastic, extolling her fielders with hand claps and bounces at cover. 83rd over: Australia 229-3 (Haynes 41, Perry 61) Brunt is Shrubsole\u2019s new ball partner the other end. Brunt is so fun to watch, every emotion she feels flashes across her face. And she has a wonderful fast bowler\u2019s physique, all powerful shoulders and backside. Haynes has slowed down markedly at the crease - she now has 41 off 108 balls, and she started off in some style. 82nd over: Australia 228-3 (Haynes 41, Perry 60) And now we take the new ball! England have a slip and Shrubsole is on target. No runs, no wickets. And that\u2019s the fifth maiden in the last seven over. 81st over: Australia 228-3 (Haynes 41, Perry 60) But England don\u2019t take it... Knight preferring to keep the pressure building with Laura Marsh. Haynes breaks her run-less hiatus via a misfield. The good news is that there are over 2000 at Taunton today! Hoping to get down there too before the end of the season, maybe (say it quietly) to see Somerset lift the Championship. 80th over: Australia 226-3 (Haynes 40, Perry 59) Elwiss\u2019 red heels flirt with the spectators as she starts her run-up. It\u2019s another maiden but the drama, could be about to start as the new ball is now available. 79th over: Australia 226-3 (Haynes 40, Perry 59) The pitch, last used on June 8 during that very wet spell during the world Cup, is sloooow. Australia waiting to pounce on the loose balls, happy to watch the others go by. 78th over: Australia 226-3 (Haynes 40, Perry 59) Elswiss again. Hallelujah! A boundary! Perry pulls a short ball and it beats the chasing fielder. Australia building ominously, if slowly. 77th over: Australia 220-3 (Haynes 40, Perry 54) Marsh rolls her arm over. Perry looks calms but cautious. Textbook defensive shot to finish the over - and that\u2019s another maiden. Time to go and make a cuppa if you can. 76th over: Australia 220-3 (Haynes 40, Perry 54) Elwiss gives Ecclestone a rest and we see a most gorgeous dog sitting on a bench in the sun. That\u2019s the lovely thing about Women\u2019s games - it is so relaxed you can bring your dog, your book, your toddler. A good over by Elwiss - a maiden. 75th over: Australia 220-3 (Haynes 37, Perry 53) Marsh replaces Gordon - four off the over. The new ball can be taken in five overs. I think Knight will bite the umpires\u2019 hands off! 74th over: Australia 216-3 (Haynes 37, Perry 53) Ecclestone starts her 21st over of the game. Haynes finds the gap and they knock off four. In other matters, has anyone read Rob Smyth\u2019s biography of Robin Smith yet? I\u2019ve read the first two chapters which are eye-opening to say the least about Smith\u2019s relationship with his father, whose desire to see his son succeed turn him into a bit of a monster. 73rd over: Australia 212-3 (Haynes 33, Perry 53) A slight breeze ruffles the trousers of Gordon as she skips in from the River End. Plenty of air and the Aussies knock just two from the overs. Soporific scones anyone? Brunt whirls her arms around, look at me Skip! 72nd over: Australia 210-3 (Haynes 32, Perry 52) Knight is still attacking, Ecclestone is bowling with a slip, a short leg and a backward short leg. And Australia watchfully play the ball back. Another maiden. 71st over: Australia 210-3 (Haynes 32, Perry 52) Haynes spots the chance of easy runs and totters down the pitch to thwack Gordon over mid-wicket for four. That eases the pressure. 70th over: Australia 203-3 (Haynes 26, Perry 512 Perry tips Ecclestone for the first runs of the session, Just two off the over including a bit of a misfield from Brunt who ends up flat on her belly. Katravath, you sent me an email, but it was blank! Do write again if you had things to say. 69th over: Australia 203-3 (Haynes 26, Perry 51) Gordon switches to over the wicket and Haynes swats a bit frustratedly, and then Gordon gets some turn out of the footholes that hits Haynes awkwardly on the pads. What powers of concentration do the Australians have, can they fight against the frustration of this stranglehold England are building? Two maidens in a row to start the evening session. 68th over: Australia 203-3 (Haynes 26, Perry 51) The first ball of the session produces an invigorated appeal from Ecclestone against Perry, but the umpire isn\u2019t interested - the replay shows that it was umpires\u2019s call. The cameras pan back and we see the hills of the Mendips rolling away behind. A maiden. 67th over: Australia 203-3 (Haynes 26, Perry 51) Gordon\u2019s action is quite distinctive. Her arm is high and wide, and she gives it a visible tweak. A maiden, and that\u2019s tea! Australia\u2019s session, with both Lanning and Perry reaching fifty and Haynes looking in no bother at all since she arrived. No great acceleration though... yet. My son has just brought me a cuppa, I\u2019m going to have a quick drink - see you all in twenty minutes. 66th over: Australia 203-3 (Haynes 26, Perry 51) Shrubsole again, bowling quite wide of the crease. Perry swivels and pulls her to the boundary and that\u2019s her fifty! She raises her bat, little white-blong ponytail poking out of the back of her helmet. It\u2019s her second fifty in her eighth Test. She\u2019s converted one of those to a hundred. A fifty per cent conversion rate, if that makes England feel any better.... 65th over: Australia 199-3 (Haynes 26, Perry 42) Knight gambles, and throws the ball to Gordon, on Test debut today. Her first ball is a full toss and Perry drives her through the covers for four to tip-toe on the edge of fifty. 64th over: Australia 194-3 (Haynes 26, Perry 42) The brains trust gather at the top of the over - England could do with another breakthrough if possible before tea. But Shrubsole\u2019s first ball is a bit of a loosener and Haynes drives her for four. But the run-rate this session is only just over two and a half. 63rd over: Australia 190-3 (Haynes 22, Perry 42) I wonder if the ground will be deluged with school kids tomorrow afternoon when the state schools break up for summer? Not a bad crowd even today - at least as far as the TV cameras are showing. Marsh again - Perry and Marsh watch carefully, play defensively. 62nd over: Australia 189-3 (Haynes 21, Perry 42) Shrubsole again, a better over. Perry plays and misses as Shrubsole keeps on a good length. Good bowling. A maiden. We watch all the Australian coaching in their matching green and gold enjoying the Somerset sunshine. 61st over: Australia 189-3 (Haynes 21, Perry 42) Haynes spots a legside ball from Marsh, gets down one knee and sweeps her behind short leg. The next ball drifts again, this time the other way, and Haynes drives, for another four. Haynes not having to work too hard for her runs at the moment. 60th over: Australia 180-3 (Haynes 13, Perry 41) Knight and Shrubsole have a good chat at the top of her mark. She charges in, Taylor, lithe behind the stumps, helmet on, is standing close. A tidy over from Shrubsole, no dramas. In case you were wondering the last time the first three wickets in a Women\u2019s Test series were bowled was India v New Zealand in 1995! 59th over: Australia 179-3 (Haynes 13, Perry 40) They\u2019ve just flashed up England\u2019s bowling figures on the telly - Shrubsole has only bowled five overs today - perhaps time for her to come out of pasture - actually here she goes, half-heartedly rolling her arms over in the outfield. Just one run off Marsh\u2019s over. 58th over: Australia 178-3 (Haynes 13, Perry 39) Ecclestone can\u2019t quire work out what the weather\u2019s doing. She\u2019s in long sleeves, a sleeve-less sweater and sunglasses. Long ponytail flowing characteristically down her back. An uncharacteristic misfield there from Blunt off Perry. And then Haynes tucks in to a shorter ball from Ecclestone, pulling it, hard, to the boundary. 57th over: Australia 171-3 (Haynes 8, Perry 37) Haynes has a high backlift and her bat looks heavy, but it flows smoothly. Just one off Marsh\u2019s over. 56th over: Australia 170-3 (Haynes 8, Perry 36) Haynes sweeps through an empty leg-side field for four, then as Knight rearranges her fielders, has another look around. Ecclestone causing trouble every over at the moment. Oooh, now we get a close-up of the pitch- all sorts of dips and ditches by left-handed Haynes\u2019s feet. 55th over: Australia 165-3 (Haynes 4, Perry 35) The long legged Marsh again. Perry uses her feet, chassez, plie, to drive Marsh for one. That LBW decision last over? It was umpires\u2019s call. 54th over: Australia 158-3 (Haynes 4, Perry 34) A vital wicket for England - Lanning had looked in lovely touch - and so deserved for Ecclestone who has caused lots of trouble since lunch, without reward. Haynes adds to the drama with a four off her first ball, and then Ecclestone roars an lbw appeal. The umpire shakes his head. Lanning is furious, turning on her heel. Ecclestone delighted! Lanning misreads a ball which she tries to cut, misses and it clips the top of off-stump. 53rd over: Australia 158-2 (Lanning 56, Perry 33) The Taunton sky is cornflower blue with little fluffy clouds resting their heads temporarily above the ground. A careful over from Marsh - just two off it. Do drop me a line and tell me what you\u2019re up to. 52nd over: Australia 158-2 (Lanning 56, Perry 33) And back to young Sophie Ecclestone, who doesn\u2019t seem to be feeling too much pain from the shoulder injury that knocked her off the field this morning. Perry\u2019s bat is lovely and straight, pushing, pushing, forward. A huge appeal for lbw off the last ball but it was outside the line. 51st over: Australia 156-2 (Lanning 55, Perry 32)Thank you Adam and welcome to the second half of the first day of the only Test of the Ashes. Laura Marsh pulls her hair into a bun and takes the ball. Lanning clocks the first, but pulls the second behind square just missing short leg. Eeek! 50th over: Australia 150-2 (Lanning 50, Perry 32) \u201cCakes\u201d and \u201cShetland\u201d seem to be Ecclestone\u2019s nicknames, both making sense given her surname and pony tail. Perry cuts the spinner for one, breaking the run of dots that spread over four overs from her end. Lanning\u2019s turn, taking one to cover to raise her half-century. 122 balls it has taken her to raise her bat for the first time in a Test Match. That dropped catch by Knight before lunch is going to hurt an awful lot, I suspect. Drinks! Thanks for your company throughout the first half of this opening day. I\u2019ll leave you with Tanya Aldred, who will take it from here. Bye for now! 49th over: Australia 147-2 (Lanning 48, Perry 30) Edge! Not to hand! Gordon does everything right but it flies wide of Taylor, moving Lanning to within a stroke of a half-century. She adds a couple around the corner before keeping out the rest. 48th over: Australia 141-2 (Lanning 42, Perry 30) \u201cMy word!\u201d says Sarah Taylor from behind the stumps when Ecclestone, for the umpteenth time since lunch, nearly gets through the gate. It is Perry this time around playing out a maiden, the interrogation including another shout for leg before on the front foot. So close. 47th over: Australia 141-2 (Lanning 42, Perry 30) The 50 stand is raised between the Aussie engine room pair via a Perry single to deep point, the first run for 21 balls. But it\u2019s another over where Gordon is asking all the right questions. 46th over: Australia 140-2 (Lanning 42, Perry 29) Ecclestone to Lanning, who has never looked comfortable against the spin of the left-armers. The taller of the two is looking the part again, completing another accurate maiden. That makes 17 dots in a row, the hosts finally starting building some pressure. A wicket must follow. 45th over: Australia 140-2 (Lanning 42, Perry 29) Gordon is back in the game now too, finding Perry\u2019s inside edge after she dances at her. Slipping through to Taylor, it isn\u2019t far away from the wicketkeeeper with the fastest hands in the game. That\u2019s her best over since lunch - a maiden. 44th over: Australia 140-2 (Lanning 42, Perry 29) Australia are transferring the pressure back on now after absorbing plenty of dot balls in the 45 minutes since lunch. Dropping a fraction short, Lanning is deep in the crease cutting with perfect placement for four more. BIG SHOUT AGAIN for leg before in response! Oooooh, given out on the ground but techology shows it was hitting leg stump halfway up! No DRS in this series means no chance to review. Granted, there have been many leg before shouts today but that was the best of them and Lanning survives. 43rd over: Australia 136-2 (Lanning 38, Perry 29) \u201cWhhhyyyy?\u201d we can hear Kirstie Gordon lament through the stump mic when giving a full toss to Perry, duly put away. She\u2019s bowled some lovely deliveries today but far too many of these. 42nd over: Australia 132-2 (Lanning 38, Perry 25) Top shot from Lanning, breaking up the string of Ecclestone dots with a compact cut shot into the gap just behind point for her sixth boundary. The left-arm spinner bounces straight back with her straighter one, inspiring another yet before shout. This time, though, it is hitting her front pad - with a big stride in - outside the line of the off stump. 41st over: Australia 128-2 (Lanning 34, Perry 25) As it was in the previous Gordon over, the only runs here when Perry has enough time to come down the track, this time grabbing a couple past mid-off. Just 21 taken from from the last ten overs. 40th over: Australia 126-2 (Lanning 34, Perry 23) Another top over from Ecclestone to Lanning, who is drawn onto the front foot in defence throughout. Another high-quality maiden. Lanning has faced 93 balls for her 34 but that won\u2019t bother her. She\u2019s been craving the chance to go big in a Test Match. 39th over: Australia 126-2 (Lanning 34, Perry 23) Gordon gives Perry enough flight to step down and clip her through midwicket on the full to move into the 20s. With those runs in the bank, she plays out the rest in watchful defence. \u201cCharlotte Edwards is essentially advocating giving Perry the classic \u201csh!t gets wickets\u201d treatment with wide long-hops, which works wonders up and down the land for 3rd XI village sides every Saturday,\u201d says Harkarn Sumal. \u201cIt\u2019s the bowling equivalent of Boycott\u2019s \u201cplay \u2018em from the umpire\u2019s end\u201d suggestion for facing the best bowlers. Bit of a worry that that\u2019s the only suggestion that anyone\u2019s offered, given she smoked us for 200* last time out. Mind you, on that pitch at the North Sydney Oval, she would still likely be batting now, the best part of two years into her innings.\u201d Yes, I also enjoyed that little segment before lunch. It was all accurate! 38th over: Australia 122-2 (Lanning 34, Perry 19) Another appeal for lbw, Ecclestone this time slipping past Perry\u2019s inside edge. It\u2019s clearly going down the legside and assessed accordingly by the umpire. In at Lanning later in the over, the spinner finds her inside edge on the front foot before pinning her to the crease. Top over. 37th over: Australia 121-2 (Lanning 34, Perry 18) Spin twins, Gordon now getting a chance from the River End. She doesn\u2019t quite find her length but the Australians don\u2019t capitalise. They are helped by a misfield at backward point, Sciver not picking up the spin off one of the worn wickets on the edge of the square. 36th over: Australia 118-2 (Lanning 33, Perry 16) There is plenty going on from our pavilion end, Ecclestone generating enough movement to keep Lanning pushing and prodding. It\u2019s the straight one again that causes the most trouble though, the captain beaten on the inside edge prompting another leg before appeal. It is turned down but the signs are good for England since the interval. 35th over: Australia 118-2 (Lanning 33, Perry 16) Shot! The pull shot has become a major feature of Perry\u2019s game in the last couple of years, leaning back to wallop Brunt in front of the square leg umpire with supreme control. She\u2019s back where she needs to be to finish, in the fourth-stump channel where she beat the Aussie all-rounder earlier in the set. 34th over: Australia 113-2 (Lanning 32, Perry 12) Interesting discussion from Charlotte Edwards on TV, observing how much pressure there must be on Ecclestone who was surely told told over and over that this would be a big turning pitch. To be fair, she\u2019s handling it well so far, giving the ball a chance to bounce with overspin rather than trying to locate that ragging side-spin. That\u2019ll come. 33rd over: Australia 112-2 (Lanning 31, Perry 12) Top start after lunch from Brunt, who I was surprised not to see before the break from that end to partner Kirstie Gordon while she was threatening Lanning. She\u2019s giving Perry nothing. Maiden. 32nd over: Australia 112-2 (Lanning 31, Perry 12) Good news with Ecclestone coming back onto the field having left the field after her 14 ball this morning with an arm injury picked up diving at square leg. She begins this fresh spell with two yorkers at Perry before drifting one away from Perry. They\u2019re up for an ambitious leg before shout on a pad/bat but well outside the line, Perry then taking one to cover. But the fine re-start is undone by a short ball to finish, Lanning leaning back and carving it through point into the gap for four. \u201cEngland just can\u2019t build that pressure at the moment,\u201d Lottie Edwards laments on TV. That was true of Gordon before lunch as well: plenty of excellent deliveries but too many balls that the experienced Australians could put away. 31st over: Australia 107-2 (Lanning 27, Perry 11) Brunt is hitting the deck hard, Perry taking the first behind square, Lanning defending the rest. Nothing wrong with that set; the sun coming out for the first time today as sends down the final delivery. \u201cShe has one of the best pairs of hands in the team,\u201d Charlotte Edwards says of Knight\u2019s dropped catch before lunch. \u201cIt has to be due to concentration.\u201d The players are back on the field. Always start a session with your best bowlers, so Katherine Brunt it is from the River End. Bowling to Perry. PLAY! \u201cAfternoon Adam, afternoon everyone.\u201d Hello Harkarn Sumal. \u201cIs it okay that I\u2019m frankly terrified by Jess Jonassen being listed to come in a number 9? The Australian batting order is monstrous. That power, the clean hitting, the uncomplicated, clean (but not slogging), simple techniques that they have all down their middle and lower-middle order, that\u2019s where this game is likely to be set up and taken beyond England\u2019s reach over two innings. It also probably gives the top order that confidence to go about their work positively without worrying that what\u2019s to come behind them will fold. There seems so little in the Australian batting set-up, trigger movements and technique that can go awry. It clears the way for players to concentrate on judgement. I have a lot of fear. I can feel the fear. Also, it\u2019s already ragging for our orthodox spinners \u2013 heaven knows what it\u2019ll be doing by Sunday. At least Australia doesn\u2019t have a leggie in this side (am I right in thinking the spin options are all orthodox?). I\u2019m sure you try to be neutral when OBO-ing, but you must be so delighted to have this side represent Australia. As Rachael Haynes intimated recently when asked whether women should play more test cricket, the rest of the world has some catching up to do I fear. Yours with growing concern.\u201d You are right about the depth of Australia\u2019s batting. Jonassen\u2019s 99 on Test debut last time around four years ago was a bit of an outlier, in that, she struggled to make a run in the years since. However, during the ODIs of this comp she was outstanding. England agrees with her with both the ball and the bat. In terms of more Test cricket, take a look at Megan Schutt\u2019s piece overnight. Healy dominant; England hold their nerve. Striking 12 boundaries in her 58, Healy looked like she was on the cusp of doing something special. But England\u2019s new spinner Kirstie Gordon found her range and after creating a couple of chances against Lanning, slipped by the opener\u2019s front pad with a straight one. The Australian captain should have followed her but Knight put her down just before lunch at extra cover. That could be costly in the context of what will more than likely be a low-scoring affair. Brunt was into the action early as well, castling Bolton (6), who was the first to fall. Between times, Ecclestone left the field in tears after landing heavily on her right shoulder, but the spinner is expected to bowl after lunch having returned following 20 minutes of treatment. I\u2019ll also be back with you for that middle session in about half an hour. I\u2019ll drop back in here after I\u2019ve had a bite to eat. How are you enjoying this first day? Where are you watching from? Ping me a line. 30th over: Australia 106-2 (Lanning 27, Perry 10) Lanning gets off strike first ball, which is advisable in the final over before lunch. Perry enjoys the full toss that follows, smashing her over mid-off for another easy boundary before taking one to mid-off that gives Lanning three balls to negotiate. She does so well, getting forward to play out the final deliveries of a most eventful session. 29th over: Australia 100-2 (Lanning 26, Perry 5) Not a lot going on at Marsh\u2019s end, Perry timing her behind in classic Perry fashion to bring up Australia\u2019s 100. Back to Gordon. Can she create another chance before they break for lunch? 28th over: Australia 96-2 (Lanning 26, Perry 1) KNIGHT DROPS LANNING! Oh, she\u2019ll be gutted with that. Gordon won the false stroke, the England skipper putting down her opposing number at cover. It\u2019s not a tough chance, to her left at waist heigh. She has such a good pair of hands too. What a moment that might be. 27th over: Australia 95-2 (Lanning 26, Perry 1) Marsh races through at Lanning initially then Perry, who is off the mark with a push to midwicket. Back to the real quiz now, which is Kirstie Gordon vs Meg Lanning. \u201cAs Steve Smith has shown us enough times in India,\u201d writes Tuvic Tuslow, \u201cthe only way to stay ahead on a dustbowl is by being agressive. Yes, the opposition might need to drop you six times along the way to allow you to score one of the greatest centuries of all time, but the point remains: gather as many runs as you can, because soon enough you won\u2019t have much time to get them on this pitch either ways.\u201d Quite right. Healy has played the right way here - early runs will be vital. 26th over: Australia 91-2 (Lanning 22, Perry 0) Perry gets forward to defend the one remaining delivery in the successful over. \u201cA shout out to Cricket Scotland,\u201d says Mel Jones on TV, \u201cfor developing Kirstie Gordon.\u201d England should be able to get four more overs in before the lunch interval. Gordon has her first Test wicket and what a massive one it is, bowling Healy around her front pad! Not the most conventional dismissal, the opener missing a ball on her leg stump when shuffling across. The end of a fine innings but one that could have gone on to define this match had she been there for two more hours. 25th over: Australia 91-1 (Healy 58, Lanning 22) With 25 minutes until lunch, veteran tweaker Laura Marsh gets her first chance, replacing Sciver at the River End. She wasn\u2019t expected to play here but with the track so dry, the home side went with her as a third specialist spinning option. She\u2019s too short to begin to the chagrin of Beaumont at short leg, Healy\u2019s pull smashing into his hand. The opener keeps the strike with a rare single for her today, moving to 58 from 76 balls. 24th over: Australia 88-1 (Healy 56, Lanning 21) BIG SHOUT for lbw turned down! After twice going beyond Lanning\u2019s outside edge in her previous over, Gordon beats her on the inside edge this time. Technology (which isn\u2019t available to the players for review) confirms that it is another good decision, the ball sliding down the legside. There\u2019s nearly a bat-pad from the next ball too; the ball could easily have landed with Beaumont at short leg. But Lanning is savvy enough to put away a lesser delivery later in the set to let the pressure off, carving it off the back foot through cover. She\u2019s into the 20s but Gordon is now very much in the game. 23rd over: Australia 84-1 (Healy 56, Lanning 17) Sciver is following her pattern from the Canterbury ODI, finding her groove after some nervous early offerings, now making it tough to hit her off the square. Has an important role to play. Word from the England camp on Ecclestone is that she landed on right shoulder in that dive - she is sore and bruised. Because it is an internal injury, she won\u2019t be permitted to bowl for the time she was off the field, which was about 20 mintues. rwhen she dived. Sore and bruised. Internal injury so she can\u2019t bowl for 22nd over: Australia 82-1 (Healy 55, Lanning 16) So close! Gordon sends down a beauty at Lanning, just beating her outside edge from around the wicket. There\u2019s a loud noise so they are up in the appeal but it was bat on pad rather than ball. Good decision. The tweaker beats her again to finish with one that really turns off this first morning surface. In another piece of good news for England as the over comes to a close, Sophie Ecclestone is back on the field. They hosts need something. \u201c\u2019That is Healy\u2019s first Test half-century.\u2019\u201d says OB Jato. \u201cThis statement literally defines everything wrong with women\u2019s Test cricket right now!\u201d 21st over: Australia 81-1 (Healy 54, Lanning 16) Nice fightback from Sciver, who gives Lanning nothing and gets through a rare maiden. There\u2019s a generous response for local Anya Shrubsole who makes a fine diving stop to her left at point. 20th over: Australia 81-1 (Healy 54, Lanning 16) You can\u2019t give Healy a full toss in this mood and you definitely can\u2019t give her two in an over. After a tidy start from Gordon the young spinner loses here way here. Healy moves to 50 from 61 deliveries from the first of those bas balls, lifting her over midwicket for her 11th fours. That makes just six runs in non-boundaries on the opening morning of a Test. Have that. She takes the second fully over mid-on to make it 12. Easy peasy. 19th over: Australia 73-1 (Healy 46, Lanning 16) Sciver has to get into the game after a poor first couple of overs. Lanning takes her down the ground for a couple but the all-rounder then finds her mark. She was very good at Canterbury picking up Healy, Perry and Lanning, which is easy to forget given the carnage that ensued there after the lunch break. 18th over: Australia 71-1 (Healy 46, Lanning 14) Good start this from Gordon, who bowls with a bit of extra pace than Ecclestone from her lower trajectory. She\u2019s good enough to locate Lanning\u2019s inside edge, spitting out behind square. If Ecclestone is in strife, the Scotish import will have loads of work to do today. 17th over: Australia 69-1 (Healy 45, Lanning 13) Sciver is struggling but isn\u2019t helped by Healy\u2019s class, deflecting her perfectly down to third man for yet another boundary. She doesn\u2019t help herself to finish, though, a half volley given the treatment by Lanning. These two are motoring, striking 40 runs in the ten overs they\u2019ve been out there together, dealing almost exclusively in boundaries. 16th over: Australia 60-1 (Healy 40, Lanning 9) Lanning helped an Ecclestone full toss on its way before she went off. How often has a bowler sent down their first over in Test cricket completing the set of another? That\u2019s what Gordon is tasked with doing, getting out of it with a nerveless four dots to the Aussie skipper. I\u2019m afraid to report that Brunt is also hobbling around between overs, looking to favour that right ankle she hurt when celebrating a wicket at Leicester. Uh oh. Bowling through tears, Ecclestone is off the ground after two deliveries. The right arm is causing her an enormous amount of pain. Kirstie Gordon, on debut, will complete the over. Disastrous for England if they\u2019ve lost their best spinner. 15th over: Australia 56-1 (Healy 40, Lanning 5) Good news: Ecclestone is staying out there. Four balls remaining in the Sciver over, on to replace Brunt, and she directs the first of those down the legside for four byes. Not good. Before the break, Healy already helped herself to a ninth boundary with that aforementioned clip past square leg. England have a real problem on their hands here. Two balls into the 15th over, drinks are called with Ecclestone getting looked at by the medical staff after diving unsucessfully to stop a Healy clip through square leg. She hit the deck and reached for her shoulder. She looks okay. Let\u2019s hope so. 14th over: Australia 47-1 (Healy 36, Lanning 4) Ecclestone has found her range immediately, forcing Healy forward from the get-go. She beats her on the inside edge half way through the over prompting a loud lbw shout but from the bowler only. But missing her length to finish, Healy rocks back to cut another four. They go upstairs to confirm that Marsh didn\u2019t keep it in, the fielder\u2019s leg on the sponge. 13th over: Australia 43-1 (Healy 32, Lanning 4) Shot! After watching 14 dot balls, Meg Lanning gets off the mark with a beautifully timed push off the back foot, racing down to the rope for four. Otherwise, Brunt is right where she needs to be, asking the right questions of the Australian captain. 12th over: Australia 39-1 (Healy 32, Lanning 0) Excellent first over from Ecclestone, spin for the first time in the Test in this 12th over. The tall left-arm tweaker, who was so impressive in her Test debut at Sydney two years ago, beats Healy first up with a full delivery that did plenty, nicely pouched by Taylor. She\u2019s giving it plenty of air, Healy defending the 20-year-old with full respect. She tries to score from the final delivery, uppishly to cover, but doesn\u2019t beat the field. I\u2019ve been arguing that Ecclestone is already the best spinner in the world. With England needing a win in this to stay alive, this is a huge four days for her. 11th over: Australia 39-1 (Healy 32, Lanning 0) I tell you what, Healy is on century-in-a-session pace here, taking on Brunt given the slightest width, slapping her through backward point for seventh boundary. Ooooooh, Brunt bites back with a beauty later in the set, once again able to cut past the inside edge; just over the woodwork. Healy finishes getting a long way forward to defend. Fantastic contest. 10th over: Australia 34-1 (Healy 27, Lanning 0) Shrubsole to the rampaging Healy and she would have another boundary here if not for Gordon\u2019s excellent diving stop at mid-off. The former Scotland international, on Test debut today, is a very impressive all-round cricketer. We\u2019ll see her at the bowling crease very soon. 9th over: Australia 33-1 (Healy 26, Lanning 0) Brunt to Lanning is box office. It is quite remarkable that the Australian captain, the greatest batter of all time in the women\u2019s 50-over format, averages 17 in her four Tests and has never reached 50. She\u2019s leaving, leaving, leaving then defending here. When a ball arrives on leg stump to finish, she picks out midwicket. Maiden it is. England must get her early. \u201cProposal off the top of my head,\u201d writes Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cAuthorities want T20s and women cricketers want Tests, while purists are most comfortable with the best of both worlds - ODIs. But why can\u2019t we have the best of three worlds by combining all three formats together to create a new one? In the true spirit of Men\u2019s WC knockouts, including the part of revenue-generation, have \u2018Two Day Cricket\u2019 ... On the first day, play 20 overs each; return the next day, and play a further 20 overs each. Four innings, ten wickets per innings, and endless fun all long (until the ODI-esque limit of 80 overs is reached, of course)!\u201d I like most out-of-the-box thinking but I\u2019d rather than just gave them more Tests. 8th over: Australia 33-1 (Healy 26, Lanning 0) It doesn\u2019t bother Healy that she has lost her opening partner, lashing the first ball of Shrubsole\u2019s new over through cover for her fifth boundary. Oh, make that six! A gorgeous square drive the best of the lot so far. She\u2019s 26 from 28 balls half an hour into a Test. As you do! The plan early on in any Test Match is to hit the top of off and that\u2019s precisely what Brunt has done, shaping away just enough to evade the opener\u2019s outside edge. Another single-digit return for the West Australian. And in walks Lanning. 7th over: Australia 25-1 (Healy 18) 6th over: Australia 19-0 (Healy 17, Bolton 1) This is an excellent start from Healy, slapping a wider Shrubsole delivery with perfect timing over backward point for four. To finish, an even better shot along the carpet the other side of point for another boundary. 5th over: Australia 11-0 (Healy 9, Bolton 1) Shot. Healy said that she wouldn\u2019t be curtailing her natural instints in Test cricket and it shows when Brunt goes short, the Australian taking her on with a punishing pull over midwicket. I like this elevation. If she\u2019s there at tea, for instance, she\u2019ll be well beyond 100. 4th over: Australia 6-0 (Healy 4, Bolton 1) Shrubsole is getting some lovely hoop early on, Bolton playing her very carefully. The Australian opener isn\u2019t in great nick but she four years ago, when making her Test debut, got through some very tough sessions against the new ball from these two. 3rd over: Australia 6-0 (Healy 4, Bolton 1) Brunt is on top, giving Bolton little and winning an early play and miss. After getting off the mark with a single to cover it\u2019s Healy\u2019s turn, Brunt repeating the first ball of the match to finish, jagging back off the seam to again cut her in half. Dangerous start this from the Barnsley Express. 2nd over: Australia 5-0 (Healy 4, Bolton 0) Shrubsole running away from us at the pavilion end, Bolton defending and leaving studiously. Just as there was from the river end, the carry is there through to Sarah Taylor. The left-hander gets Australia off the mark via a leg bye, giving Healy one chance from the final ball of the over and she uses it well to drive a classy boundary through cover for four. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (Healy 0, Bolton 0) Brunt cuts Healy in half with the first ball of the Test! A beauty, jagging back off the seam. The opener gets into her groove as the over continues, leaving and defending well. Nice carry from Brunt, which is encouraging. Two years ago, the two balls in Schutt\u2019s first over didn\u2019t make it through to the wicketkeeper the track was so dead. Fingers crossed. Oh, scrap that. Would you believe, there is a hole on the ground at backward point that the umpires want covered up by the groundsman. Odd. Try again: PLAY! Katherine Brunt has the ball in her hand. This will almost certainly be her final Test Match for England. What a warrior she has been. Healy is on strike. PLAY! Jerusalem is playing. The umpires are making their way to the middle, followed by Heather Knight and her team. The Australian openers, Nicole Bolton and Alyssa Healy, follow. The latter is at the top of the list for the first time in Test Match. England: Amy Jones, Tammy Beaumont, Heather Knight (c), Georgia Elwiss, Nat Sciver, Sarah Taylor (wk), Katherine Brunt, Anya Shrubsole, Laura Marsh, Sophie Ecclestone, Kirstie Gordon. Australia: Nicole Bolton, Alyssa Healy (wk), Meg Lanning (c), Ellyse Perry, Rachael Haynes, Beth Mooney, Ash Gardner, Sophie Molineux, Jess Jonassen, Megan Schutt, Tayla Vlaeminick. Let\u2019s be real: it is a dreadful toss to loss if this goes all Ciderabad. But at least England\u2019s spinners already have something to work with out there. Australia go with an extra bat, leaving out the leggie Wareham. England are playing three specialist spinners, overlooking seamer Cross. Full XIs shortly. Actually, read this before the toss. Megan Schutt has views and isn\u2019t afraid to voice them. Her latest column spells out why it is plainly wrong that only Australian and English women get to play Tests and how it isn\u2019t fair that they only get to do so every other year. Crucially, she also comes with ideas for the future. Good morning from Taunton! We are roughly ten minutes from the toss and I come with news off the top. Three Australians are winning their baggy greens today: Ash Gardner, Tayla Vlaeminck and Sophie Molineux. For England, Amy Jones and Kirstie Gordon are set to make their Test Match bows. For the visitors, it was a brilliant touch having Dan Christian on deck to present Gardner with the famous cap. Of course, the two of them captained the teams that toured England last summer to mark 150 years since the trailblazing Indigenous Australians visited this country to play in 1868. Mitch Starc welcomed Vlaeminck, a fellow speedster, to the fold while Belinda Clark, the interim boss of high performance and former dominant skipper, gave the speech for Molineux. The latter, a big turner of the ball with her left-arm orthodox, will like the look of the pitch. There has been some debate as to what constitutes a used surface, but the facts are that it was last played on for the Afghanistan vs New Zealand World Cup game on 8 June. There are some very helpful footmarks on show outside the off-stump for left-handers at the River End. We\u2019ll see how that all plays out. England do need a result well inside the four days with rain forecast tomorrow. A draw is enough for Australia to retain the trophy having swept the ODIs three-zip a couple of weeks ago, the third in spectacular fashion when Ellyse Perry took 7/22. I\u2019ll be back with the formal teams and toss shortly. I\u2019m looking forward to your company throughout the day - and week - in the usual way. Do drop me a line.",

      "bodyText": "Iran has offered a deal with the US in which it would formally and permanently accept enhanced inspections of its nuclear programme, in return for the permanent lifting of US sanctions. The offer was made by the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, on a visit to New York. But it is unlikely to be warmly received by the Trump administration, which is currently demanding Iran make a range of sweeping concessions, including cessation of uranium enrichment and support for proxies and allies in the region. Zarif insisted, however, that his offer was \u201ca substantial move\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not about photo ops. We are interested in substance,\u201d he told reporters at the Iranian mission to the UN in New York on Thursday. \u201cThere are other substantial moves that can be made.\u201d He said: \u201cIf they [the Trump administration] are putting their money where their mouth is, they are going to do it. They don\u2019t need a photo op. They don\u2019t need a two-page document with a big signature.\u201d Iran has faced an steadily tightening US-driven oil embargo and severe banking sanctions since May last year, when Donald Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal with Iran known as the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA). The embargo has triggered a standoff in the Gulf that has escalated dramatically in recent months:on Thursday, Trump said a US warship, the USS Boxer, had shot down an Iranian drone that had come within a kilometre of the vessel. \u201cThe drone was immediately destroyed,\u201d the president said. \u201cThis is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters. The United States reserves the right to defend our personnel, facilities, and interests.\u201d Earlier in the day, Iran said it had seized a foreign-owned vessel suspected of being used for oil smuggling out of Iran. Zarif dismissed the seizure as a routine marine policing matter. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a tanker. It\u2019s a small ship carrying a million litres, not a million barrels, of oil. We do it every other day. These are people who are smuggling our fuel. This is \u2026 one of the things that we do in the Persian Gulf, because of the heavy subsidies that we provide for our own fuel products.\u201d Zarif credited Trump with \u201cprudence\u201d for calling off missile attacks last month in reprisal for the downing of a US surveillance drone, and said that gave him confidence that diplomatic progress is possible. He said: \u201cI believe we were few minutes away from a war. Prudence prevailed and we\u2019re not fighting. So that gives reason for us to be optimists. If we work, if we are serious, then we can find a way forward.\u201d Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has rebuffed overtures for direct talks with Trump, citing US bad faith over the JCPOA, but Zarif signaled on Thursday that Iran was willing to do a deal that did not necessary involve the US returning to the JCPOA, Tehran\u2019s official position until now. Zarif noted that in 2023, under the JCPOA, Iran\u2019s parliament, the Majlis, was supposed to ratify the Additional Protocol of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a voluntary agreement that allows IAEA inspectors extensive access in Iran to ensure the country does not have a covert nuclear weapons programme. As part of the JCPOA, Iran already observes the Additional Protocol. Ratification by the Majlis would make it a more permanent commitment. At the same time, under the JCPOA, the US Congress was due to lift sanctions on Iran. Zarif proposed that the Iran and US take those steps immediately. \u201cIf Trump wants more for more, we can ratify the Additional Protocol and he can lift the sanctions he set,\u201d Zarif said. \u201cHe has said that he will take any measure to Congress \u2013 fine. Lift the sanctions and you\u2019ll have the Additional Protocol sooner than 2023.\u201d The state department has yet to respond to Zarif\u2019s proposal, but its official position is that Iran has to fulfil a wide-ranging list of 12 conditions, including curtailing its involvement in regional conflicts, in order to win sanctions relief. Iran has rejected those demands. Zarif also denounced the seizure of a tanker carrying Iranian oil by UK forces in Gibraltar, which said was carried out on behalf of the US. \u201cThat\u2019s a violation of international law,\u201d he said. The UK has said the tanker, the Grace 1, would be released if Iran could demonstrate it was not heading for Syria, which is banned by the EU. Zarif said it was not bound for Syria but he could not specify who the customer was, as the buyer would consequently be subject to US sanctions. He said: \u201cWe won\u2019t tell you, because if we told you where it was going, next time you wouldn\u2019t be able to sell our oil. We can\u2019t be transparent. We told you it wasn\u2019t going going to Syria \u2013 but the rest is none of your business. Because if we told you it would be less one less outlet to buy it to get money to feed our people.\u201d Zarif also shrugged off a report that Senator Rand Paul was seeking to become a secret emissary between Trump and the Iranian leadership, but would not confirm or deny he would be meeting Paul in his capacity as a member of Congress on his current visit to the US. \u201cI don\u2019t deal with [secret] emissaries,\u201d the foreign minister said. He added: \u201cI doubt that anybody will be designated as an emissary by President Trump.\u201d He said the report in Politico that Paul, a libertarian anti-war Republican, could carry out secret talks was \u201coverblown\u201d \u201cThis is media stuff. I mean, these may be good for a spy movie,\u201d Zarif said. But he also said: \u201cI\u2019d meet with members of Congress in their own personal capacity as influential members of American society and representatives of American people.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Barely heard of in Britain until it launched a spree of Premier League club sponsorships in 2016, the online gambling platform SportPesa has since spread its name across football, rugby, horseracing and Formula One, associating its branding with good works in Africa. At Everton, where SportPesa is the main sponsor, its name is prominent all over Goodison Park, the club have been in Kenya for a pre-season tour, and they promote SportPesa\u2019s \u201cKits for Africa\u201d initiative, with a donation bin in the club store. Everton\u2019s chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, wrote in the club\u2019s annual report: \u201cWe value our developing relationship with SportPesa, who have demonstrated a strong alignment with our values.\u201d A spokesperson for Everton, who describe themselves as \u201cthe people\u2019s club\u201d, said Barrett-Baxendale was referring to the sponsor\u2019s support for the club\u2019s extensive community work, which she herself pioneered in the deprived areas around Goodison Park. Founded in Nairobi as a partnership of wealthy, politically influential Kenyans with Bulgarian investors, SportPesa mined its huge fortune exploiting an online gambling craze in the east African country. Kenya\u2019s interior minister, Fred Matiang\u2019i, warned recently of rising addiction and suicides, adding that gambling will \u201cdestroy the moral fabric\u201d without strengthened regulation. In the UK, while SportPesa has promoted its brand through the Everton sponsorship and partnerships with Arsenal, Southampton and Hull City, it makes use of the \u201cwhite label\u201d system, allied to a company, TGP Europe, registered offshore in the Isle of Man, a tax haven. This structure, permitted by the UK government, means SportPesa does not require a licence from the Gambling Commission, UK bets are paid to the Isle of Man, and no SportPesa company appears to pay UK corporation tax on those revenues, nor contribute to UK gambling welfare programmes. Campaign groups including Gambling with Lives have criticised the English football establishment for selling its appeal so enormously to gambling, with many Premier League and Football League clubs \u2013 and the EFL divisions themselves \u2013 sponsored by betting companies, and concerns are escalating about problem gambling and the game\u2019s \u201cgamblification\u201d. SportPesa grew rapidly in Kenya to dominate online gambling by zealously exploiting the mass arrival of mobile phone technology from 2014, and sponsors the country\u2019s Premier League. With little regulation and no welfare or research similar to even the UK\u2019s limited industry-funded framework, serious problem gambling appears to have become entrenched among Kenyan young people, who are gambling and losing far more than elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. Matiang\u2019i, finally proposing new regulation in May, said $2bn was gambled annually in Kenya, mostly by low earners, and that 500,000 young people defaulted on loans to fund gambling. Last week SportPesa was among a number of gambling companies in Kenya whose licences were suspended because of reported concerns about non-compliance with regulations, although SportPesa said it did comply and is continuing to operate because of a court order. Ivaylo Bozoukov, SportPesa\u2019s director of global strategy, told the Guardian that SportPesa\u2019s expansion into the UK, which includes offices in Liverpool\u2019s Liver building where Everton are also based, was funded by the profits made in Africa. Well-placed sources have told the investigative website Finance Uncovered that SportPesa made more than $1bn revenues last year in Kenya, but the company does not make its revenues or profits, in Africa or the UK, public.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThe president\u2019s latest racist rant, offensive even in the context of his intentionally offensive tenure, has set a new low bar \u2026 I\u2019m stunned and disappointed by the nonchalance of my Republican colleagues,\u201d congressman Ra\u00fal M Grijalva wrote in the Guardian. A year and a half ago. Grijalva\u2019s expression of shock at Republican silence about Trump\u2019s racism came after Trump described El Salvador, Haiti and certain African nations as \u201cshithole countries\u201d. The insults in the president\u2019s mouth may have changed, but the Republican reaction has not. With few exceptions, elected Republican officials replied with silence \u2013 or feigned ignorance \u2013 the morning after a crowd at a Trump rally in Greenville, North Carolina, goaded by the president, chanted \u201cSend her back! Send her back!\u201d The chant was directed at congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a US citizen who arrived in America nearly 30 years ago as a child refugee of war. It echoed an attack Trump began last weekend, in which he said Omar and three fellow congresswomen of color \u2013 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2013 should \u201cgo back\u201d to other countries. All of the women are progressives within the Democratic party, and advocate for left-leaning policies. While he has stood behind his \u201cgo back\u201d tweet, Trump attempted to distance himself from the \u201csend her back\u201d chant in remarks to reporters at the White House on Thursday. Asked why he did not stop the chant, Trump said, \u201cI think I did\u201d \u2013 when in fact, as video of the moment shows, he did nothing to discourage the chant, instead pausing to give the chant room. \u201cI was not happy with it \u2013 I disagree with it,\u201d Trump told reporters about the chant. The claim was hard to credit given Trump\u2019s \u201cgo back\u201d tweet, his past attacks on immigrants and the fact that the chant was set off by a minutes-long attack personal attack on Omar by Trump. The Republican congressman Jim Jordan, a Trump loyalist from Ohio, told CNN he had missed the \u201csend her back\u201d chants. \u201cI think Americans are frustrated by the fact that we haven\u2019t dealt with the crisis at the border,\u201d Jordan said. Another GOP representative, Tom Emmer, took a similar line at a breakfast with reporters: \u201cI didn\u2019t watch the rally but there is no place for that,\u201d he said. Interviewed on Fox Business Network on Thursday morning, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, was not asked about the \u201csend her back\u201d chant and he did not volunteer comment, although he repeated a bland call for civility he made on Tuesday, which the president and his Republican fans and followers have so dramatically ignored since. Two elected Republicans in the US Congress \u2013 out of 250 \u2013 had condemned the rally chant by Thursday morning. \u201cI deeply disagree with the extreme left &amp; have been disgusted by their tone,\u201d the Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger from Illinois tweeted. \u201cI woke up today equally disgusted \u2013 chants like \u2018send her back\u2019 are ugly, wrong, &amp; would send chills down the spines of our Founding Fathers. This ugliness must end, or we risk our great union.\u201d Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina, whose district is north of Greenville, tweeted: \u201cThough it was brief, I struggled with the \u2018send her back\u2019 chant tonight referencing Rep Omar.

I don\u2019t think a Somali refugee embracing Trump would have been asked to go back.\u201d Trump seems to regard divisive and nativist rhetoric as his best chance of clinging on to the White House next year. Analysts say he may be right. Even among non-elected Republicans who condemned the chant, Omar-bashing was a staple. \u201cHer views are awful,\u201d tweeted Jeb Bush, the failed 2016 presidential candidate. \u201cShe is an American citizen. She has the right to express her awful views.\u201d \u201c\u2018Send her back\u2019 conservatism is not a conservatism worth defending,\u201d tweeted Bill Kristol, the conservative commentator. The former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who is running a token primary campaign against Trump, tweeted: \u201cI challenge every Republican to watch @realDonaldTrump\u2019s rally last night, complete with chants of \u201cSend her back\u201d, and ask if that is the Party of Lincoln and Reagan we signed up for. We are in a fight for the soul of the GOP, and silence is not an option. #AmericaDeservesBetter.\u201d The price of criticizing Trump as a Republican was meanwhile highlighted in Florida, where the county Republican party in Palm Beach \u2013 home to Mar-a-Lago \u2013 disinvited Anthony Scaramucci, the former White House communications director, from speaking at an annual fundraiser after Scaramucci criticized Trump on CNN. \u201cThe President calls himself a stable genius,\u201d Scaramucci said. \u201cThat tweet is unstable, it\u2019s racist, it\u2019s obnoxious \u2026 and you should apologize.\u201d Michael A Barnett, the party chairman in the county, told Politico that Scaramucci\u2019s remarks were over the line and \u201cinfuriated\u201d Republicans. At least one conservative commentator, David Frum, predicted \u2013 however wishfully \u2013 a time when the fear of crossing Trump would be replaced by fear of association with Trump and Trumpism. Frum tweeted: \u201cWhen this is all over, nobody will admit to ever having supported it.\u201d",

Five years ago, a devastating outbreak of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola\" title=\"\">Ebola</a> in west Africa claimed more than 11,000 lives, and sparked an international panic as it reached the US and Europe. The experience led to the vaccine and experimental treatments now being used in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The fear and distrust of outsiders has been compounded by Ebola\u2019s high fatality rates. Vaccines cannot protect those who have already contracted the disease, and though people are more likely to survive with proper treatment, many delay because they do not trust those offering help: by the time they are finally seen, it is far harder to help them.

The report, published on Thursday, shows that the number of energy efficiency upgrades undertaken each month has fallen to 10,000 on average for the six months to the end of May. This compares with an average of 65,000 a month in 2014. The latest figures show that in May about 10,000 properties benefited from energy efficiency measures, such as loft insulation or boiler upgrades, down sharply from about 30,000 in the same month in 2015 and 2016. At this rate it would take 96 years for the government to reach its own targets to reduce fuel poverty, according to the charity National Energy Action. Peter Smith, a director at the fuel-poverty campaign group, said the progress was \u201ca fraction\u201d of what was required to ensure 1.2m homes are renovated each year until 2035 . \u201cThis is exceptionally disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on this dire progress, it would take over 96 years to help all the fuel-poor households who currently live in homes with solid walls.\u201d The report has emerged following a stark warning from MPs last week that the UK has \u201cno chance\u201d of meeting its climate-crisis targets without a major overhaul of energy-efficiency programmes. A select committee report found that public investment in energy efficiency has shrunk in recent years, even though it is the cheapest way to cut carbon emissions. It said the government risks undermining its own climate targets unless it treats energy efficiency as a national infrastructure priority. Rachel Reeves, the chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, said ministers have \u201ccontinued to sit on their hands\u201d despite the consensus support for energy efficiency. \u201cIf the government lacks the political will to deliver energy efficiency improvements, how can we expect it to get on with the costlier actions needed to tackle climate change?\u201d she said. The report blamed a lack of public spending for the falling number of home insulation installations, which have plummeted by 95% from 2012. Households in England have been hardest hit since the former prime minister David Cameron reportedly told aides in 2013 to \u201cget rid of all the green crap\u201d levied on energy bills. Energy efficiency is \u201cnot only crucial for tackling climate change but are vital for lowering customers\u2019 energy bills and lifting people out of fuel poverty\u201d, Reeves said. The committee said ministers must urgently establish a central national fund to help low-income, vulnerable and fuel-poor households insulate their homes. Ed Matthew, from climate-crisis thinktank E3G, said energy efficiency must be \u201cmission critical\u201d for the next prime minister. \u201cThe UK has no hope of reaching net-zero emissions unless the government, including the Treasury, makes energy efficiency an infrastructure investment priority,\u201d he added.

The club is so exclusive that apparently some <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/london-private-members-clubs-ranked-by-price-2019-3?r=US&amp;IR=T#5-hertford-street-mayfair-undisclosed-34\" title=\"\">billionaires don\u2019t make the cut</a> when they apply for membership. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-5-hertford-street-london-2017-8?r=US&amp;IR=T#fahionistas-favour-the-venue-for-launch-parties-and-events-below-supermodel-bella-hadid-attended-a-marc-jacobs-event-at-loulous-13\" title=\"\">Exotic chandeliers</a>, Parisian bohemian decor, luxurious dining rooms hung with exquisite art; it even has its own cigar shop. But while royals and Hollywood A-listers party, kitchen porters spend hours scrubbing pots and pans and cleaning kitchens on poverty pay. Until a <a href=\"https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/5cf8f67de9521/iwgb-demands-end-to-poverty\" title=\"\">campaign began</a>, the porters were paid a derisory \u00a38.65 an hour, nearly \u00a32 below the London living wage \u2013 as set by the independent <a href=\"https://www.livingwage.org.uk/calculation\" title=\"\">Living Wage Foundation</a> \u2013 of \u00a310.55 an hour. Under pressure, the club was forced to offer a 35p hike, but it is still far short. Lacking occupational sick pay, staff are paid nothing for the first three days of illness, and just \u00a394.25 a week thereafter: ill workers with families to feed and rent to pay are often faced with no choice but to turn up to work regardless. As one kitchen porter tells me \u2013 a clause in his contract forbids him from speaking to the media without permission, so he must remain anonymous \u2013 \u201cthe wages we are paid are not enough for us to live in this country, even just to pay rent, which is very expensive\u201d. He has children to feed, and the nine hours a day he works at the club isn\u2019t enough, so he\u2019s forced to take at a second job. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have time to rest,\u201d he says: they are allowed an unpaid 20-minute break, but even that can be impossible when the club is busy and dirty pots are piling up. He fears repercussions from management, and has considered leaving the job but is determined to fight \u201cnot just to improve working conditions, but improve the life of my family too\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bf59eb7ca730c56992de11833ca4a94d8e819d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bf59eb7ca730c56992de11833ca4a94d8e819d3/8_113_1971_1182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robin Birley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Robin Birley, a multimillionaire businessman who once championed the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Davidson/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the club recently outsourced its kitchen porters to <a href=\"http://www.act-clean.com/\" title=\"\">ACT Clean</a> \u2013 which has refused to comment \u2013 staff were threatened with dismissal if they didn\u2019t sign a contract undermining already measly terms and conditions. Five resigned. But nearly half of the 19 kitchen porters joined the IWGB, which has played a critical role in organising migrant workers in particular in precarious work and is determined to fight outsourcing and win a genuine living wage, occupational sick pay and union recognition.</p> <p>The club tells me it is \u201cproud that all of our employees, including our kitchen porters, are paid well above the government\u2019s minimum wage and, indeed, well above the industry average\u201d and that workers have \u201caccess to a range of other benefits\u201d (none of which they specify). It accuses the IWGB of not bothering to seek recognition and of \u201chypocrisy\u201d for not focusing on lower wages elsewhere, and says that the club conducts its \u201cbusiness in an entirely legal manner\u201d. But the porters are no longer employees \u2013 the club has outsourced them. Yes, they are paid above the minimum wage, but this is well below the living wage; the union has sought recognition from ACT Clean, but 5 Hertford Street must pay the increased costs. Whatever the industry average is, and it is undoubtedly bad, the kitchen porters toil on wages this affluent club can afford to raise. \u201cWe have not suggested they are acting unlawfully,\u201d the IWGB\u2019s general secretary, Jason Moyer-Lee, says, \u201cjust immorally.\u201d</p> <p>The owner of this club is Robin Birley, a multimillionaire businessman who once <a href=\"https://life.spectator.co.uk/articles/club-ties/\" title=\"\">championed the former Chilean dictator</a> Augusto Pinochet; he has long funded Eurosceptic causes, including donating large sums <a href=\"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2015/02/club-wars-robin-birley-gives-50000-to-ukip-while-annabels-give-20000-to-the-tories/\" title=\"\">to U</a><a href=\"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2015/02/club-wars-robin-birley-gives-50000-to-ukip-while-annabels-give-20000-to-the-tories/\" title=\"\">kip</a> and the two official Leave campaigns in the referendum. He is now helping to <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-donations/boris-johnson-smashes-record-for-most-money-raised-by-uk-politician-idUKKCN1UC1U7\" title=\"\">bankroll Boris Johnson\u2019s mission</a> to become Tory leader. Here is a man who has used his vast wealth to back campaigns against freedom of movement which have vilified migrants as the source of Britain\u2019s ills. Yet most of his exploited kitchen porters are Latin Americans with EU passports because they have dual Spanish or Portuguese citizenship. \u201cIt just highlights the hypocrisy of the whole Brexit movement,\u201d says Moyer-Lee. \u201cThe Brexit xenophobia was sold to people with the idea that it was good for workers, but the root cause of exploitation and low pay is employers, not migrants. Robin Burley is no friend of workers.\u201d</p> <p>For years, media moguls and campaigns bankrolled by the rich have fed the lie that migrants are the cause of injustices propagated by the powerful: the failure to build housing, the strain on public services by cuts, the lack of secure jobs, the decline in real wages. This poison has sought to deflect blame from bosses like Birley who won\u2019t pay wages on which workers can live. Far from undercutting wages, migrant workers are fighting to raise them. It is a story we have seen time and again, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/25/lse-striking-cleaners-outsourced-university-injustice\" title=\"\">cleaners at the London School of Economics</a> \u2013 many of them migrants \u2013 who <a href=\"https://www.uvwunion.org.uk/news/2017/6/20/victory-to-lse-cleaners\" title=\"\">won a </a><a href=\"https://www.uvwunion.org.uk/news/2017/6/20/victory-to-lse-cleaners\" title=\"\">struggle</a> against outsourcing two years ago.</p> <p>Quietly, below the radar, anti-migrant sentiment has been falling, despite <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2019/01/04/thermostatic-public-opinion-why-uk-anti-immigrant-sentiments-rise-and-then-fall/\" title=\"\">continued migrant-bashing</a> by the Tories and their media allies. Yet the case for migrants and freedom of movement has been sorely missing since the referendum result \u2013 even within Labour, despite the pro-migrant records of the party\u2019s leading lights. As Labour pivots towards a remain posture, that must surely change. The saga of 5 Hertford Street is a microcosm, after all: migrants exploited to sustain the luxurious lifestyle of a shameless elite who blame migrants for injustices they themselves are responsible for. When the champagne is flowing, I wonder if the beneficiaries of our crumbling social order realise that a reckoning is surely overdue. </p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

If you want an insight into Britain\u2019s decadent social order, this is a good place to start. The club is so exclusive that apparently some billionaires don\u2019t make the cut when they apply for membership. Exotic chandeliers, Parisian bohemian decor, luxurious dining rooms hung with exquisite art; it even has its own cigar shop. But while royals and Hollywood A-listers party, kitchen porters spend hours scrubbing pots and pans and cleaning kitchens on poverty pay. Until a campaign began, the porters were paid a derisory \u00a38.65 an hour, nearly \u00a32 below the London living wage \u2013 as set by the independent Living Wage Foundation \u2013 of \u00a310.55 an hour. Under pressure, the club was forced to offer a 35p hike, but it is still far short. Lacking occupational sick pay, staff are paid nothing for the first three days of illness, and just \u00a394.25 a week thereafter: ill workers with families to feed and rent to pay are often faced with no choice but to turn up to work regardless. As one kitchen porter tells me \u2013 a clause in his contract forbids him from speaking to the media without permission, so he must remain anonymous \u2013 \u201cthe wages we are paid are not enough for us to live in this country, even just to pay rent, which is very expensive\u201d. He has children to feed, and the nine hours a day he works at the club isn\u2019t enough, so he\u2019s forced to take at a second job. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have time to rest,\u201d he says: they are allowed an unpaid 20-minute break, but even that can be impossible when the club is busy and dirty pots are piling up. He fears repercussions from management, and has considered leaving the job but is determined to fight \u201cnot just to improve working conditions, but improve the life of my family too\u201d. When the club recently outsourced its kitchen porters to ACT Clean \u2013 which has refused to comment \u2013 staff were threatened with dismissal if they didn\u2019t sign a contract undermining already measly terms and conditions. Five resigned. But nearly half of the 19 kitchen porters joined the IWGB, which has played a critical role in organising migrant workers in particular in precarious work and is determined to fight outsourcing and win a genuine living wage, occupational sick pay and union recognition. The club tells me it is \u201cproud that all of our employees, including our kitchen porters, are paid well above the government\u2019s minimum wage and, indeed, well above the industry average\u201d and that workers have \u201caccess to a range of other benefits\u201d (none of which they specify). It accuses the IWGB of not bothering to seek recognition and of \u201chypocrisy\u201d for not focusing on lower wages elsewhere, and says that the club conducts its \u201cbusiness in an entirely legal manner\u201d. But the porters are no longer employees \u2013 the club has outsourced them. Yes, they are paid above the minimum wage, but this is well below the living wage; the union has sought recognition from ACT Clean, but 5 Hertford Street must pay the increased costs. Whatever the industry average is, and it is undoubtedly bad, the kitchen porters toil on wages this affluent club can afford to raise. \u201cWe have not suggested they are acting unlawfully,\u201d the IWGB\u2019s general secretary, Jason Moyer-Lee, says, \u201cjust immorally.\u201d The owner of this club is Robin Birley, a multimillionaire businessman who once championed the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet; he has long funded Eurosceptic causes, including donating large sums to Ukip and the two official Leave campaigns in the referendum. He is now helping to bankroll Boris Johnson\u2019s mission to become Tory leader. Here is a man who has used his vast wealth to back campaigns against freedom of movement which have vilified migrants as the source of Britain\u2019s ills. Yet most of his exploited kitchen porters are Latin Americans with EU passports because they have dual Spanish or Portuguese citizenship. \u201cIt just highlights the hypocrisy of the whole Brexit movement,\u201d says Moyer-Lee. \u201cThe Brexit xenophobia was sold to people with the idea that it was good for workers, but the root cause of exploitation and low pay is employers, not migrants. Robin Burley is no friend of workers.\u201d For years, media moguls and campaigns bankrolled by the rich have fed the lie that migrants are the cause of injustices propagated by the powerful: the failure to build housing, the strain on public services by cuts, the lack of secure jobs, the decline in real wages. This poison has sought to deflect blame from bosses like Birley who won\u2019t pay wages on which workers can live. Far from undercutting wages, migrant workers are fighting to raise them. It is a story we have seen time and again, like the cleaners at the London School of Economics \u2013 many of them migrants \u2013 who won a struggle against outsourcing two years ago. Quietly, below the radar, anti-migrant sentiment has been falling, despite continued migrant-bashing by the Tories and their media allies. Yet the case for migrants and freedom of movement has been sorely missing since the referendum result \u2013 even within Labour, despite the pro-migrant records of the party\u2019s leading lights. As Labour pivots towards a remain posture, that must surely change. The saga of 5 Hertford Street is a microcosm, after all: migrants exploited to sustain the luxurious lifestyle of a shameless elite who blame migrants for injustices they themselves are responsible for. When the champagne is flowing, I wonder if the beneficiaries of our crumbling social order realise that a reckoning is surely overdue. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

His inclusion in the side after almost two years in the wilderness is one of Belmadi\u2019s triumphs as he has revelled in a conservative role protecting the back four.</p> <p>\u201cHe was really unfairly criticised \u2013 irrationally,\u201d Belmadi said. \u201cI insisted he\u2019s at the press conference today, because I wanted to credit him in front of everyone.

That was a problem for them in the quarter-final two years ago, when Cameroon sat deep, denied them space, frustrated them and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/28/cameroon-senegal-sadio-mane-burkina-faso-tunisia-africa-cup-of-nations\" title=\"\">eventually won on penalties</a>, and it is likely to be a problem on Friday given how efficiently Algeria closed down the space available to Nigeria\u2019s wingers in the semi-final.</p> <p>Sadio Man\u00e9 will operate on one flank but through the tournament Ciss\u00e9 has not settled on who plays on the other wing: it could be Keita Bald\u00e9, it could be Isma\u00efla Sarr, it could be Kr\u00e9pin Diatta. Or he may do what he did at times in qualifying, seek to sidestep whatever plans Belmadi has put in place for his wide men and abandon the 4-3-3 for a more direct 4-4-2.</p> <p>A bigger issue than who plays wide, though, is what Ciss\u00e9 does at the heart of his defence. Already without Salif San\u00e9 who was injured in Senegal\u2019s first game, he must now also find cover for the Napoli centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly who is suspended after collecting an extremely harsh yellow card in the semi-final, after he failed to get his arm out of the way of a shot in conceding the penalty Tunisia missed. The centre-forward Baghdad Bounedjah, another surprise Belmadi selection who has thrived at this tournament, has just the sort of streetwise awkwardness to take advantage of a makeshift back four.</p> <p>Belmadi and Ciss\u00e9 feel like part of a new generation of coaches, African with significant European experience, who represent the future. Both have had a significant impact on their sides, sufficient that this feels like a battle between them more than it does between, say, Sadio Man\u00e9 and Riyad Mahrez, or Gu\u00e9dioura and Idrissa Gueye.</p> <p>History looms for both sides \u2013 Senegal have never won the Cup of Nations; Algeria have not won it for 29 years; Champigny will win either way.</p>",

For the Nottingham Forest midfielder Adl\u00e8ne Gu\u00e9dioura, the development is primarily attributable to Belmadi, who took over last August. \u201cHe really knows the players and really knows what he wants, and the good thing as well is he knows how to pass that on to the players,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important because if you don\u2019t have a good cook you won\u2019t have a good meal.\u201d Rohr has spoken enthusiastically of the tactical progress made by les Fennecs. Algeria in recent years had developed a reputation for attractive football undermined by indiscipline, a lack of steel, and, at times, the absence of a tactical plan. \u201cWe used to have good individuals but now we feel very strong as a team,\u201d Gu\u00e9dioura said. His inclusion in the side after almost two years in the wilderness is one of Belmadi\u2019s triumphs as he has revelled in a conservative role protecting the back four. \u201cHe was really unfairly criticised \u2013 irrationally,\u201d Belmadi said. \u201cI insisted he\u2019s at the press conference today, because I wanted to credit him in front of everyone. We spoke like men before the Cup of Nations. I would even say he\u2019s undroppable now.\u201d In their way stand a Senegal side who are undeniably talented, but talented in one particular area: pace out wide. That was a problem for them in the quarter-final two years ago, when Cameroon sat deep, denied them space, frustrated them and eventually won on penalties, and it is likely to be a problem on Friday given how efficiently Algeria closed down the space available to Nigeria\u2019s wingers in the semi-final. Sadio Man\u00e9 will operate on one flank but through the tournament Ciss\u00e9 has not settled on who plays on the other wing: it could be Keita Bald\u00e9, it could be Isma\u00efla Sarr, it could be Kr\u00e9pin Diatta. Or he may do what he did at times in qualifying, seek to sidestep whatever plans Belmadi has put in place for his wide men and abandon the 4-3-3 for a more direct 4-4-2. A bigger issue than who plays wide, though, is what Ciss\u00e9 does at the heart of his defence. Already without Salif San\u00e9 who was injured in Senegal\u2019s first game, he must now also find cover for the Napoli centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly who is suspended after collecting an extremely harsh yellow card in the semi-final, after he failed to get his arm out of the way of a shot in conceding the penalty Tunisia missed. The centre-forward Baghdad Bounedjah, another surprise Belmadi selection who has thrived at this tournament, has just the sort of streetwise awkwardness to take advantage of a makeshift back four. Belmadi and Ciss\u00e9 feel like part of a new generation of coaches, African with significant European experience, who represent the future. Both have had a significant impact on their sides, sufficient that this feels like a battle between them more than it does between, say, Sadio Man\u00e9 and Riyad Mahrez, or Gu\u00e9dioura and Idrissa Gueye. History looms for both sides \u2013 Senegal have never won the Cup of Nations; Algeria have not won it for 29 years; Champigny will win either way.",

Discipline is the responsibility of the National Constitutional Committee (NCC), and Jeremy is not part of this at all. The party\u2019s rules are not imposed, dictated by or changed by the leader.</p> <p>After a period when the governance unit was under-resourced, and the NEC singularly failed to address the problem, and ignored recommendations which would have helped, contrary to the peers\u2019 view, the party structures in relation to complaints have been strengthened in the last year. The NCC has been expanded, legal representation increased. In February, general secretary Jennie Formby reported that since April 2018 the party had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47203397\" title=\"\">investigated 673 complaints against members and gave details of progress</a>. It would be helpful for Formby\u2019s deputy now to give an update so we can see exactly what has been done to address the party\u2019s antisemitism problem, and what remains to be done.<br><strong>Phil Tate</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 It was a famous Jewish singer, Bob Dylan, who coined the lyric \u201cMoney doesn\u2019t talk, it swears\u201d, which seems quite apt for the minority of Labour peers who have paid for an advert to subvert the democratically expressed wishes of Labour members who have twice voted overwhelmingly for Jeremy Corbyn to lead the party.</p> <p>In those leadership elections of 2015 and 2016, thousands of Labour members \u2013 overwhelmingly Corbyn supporters \u2013 many with decades of commitment to the party, and including a significant number of Jews, were told they were definitely unwelcome in the most brutal way, when they were summarily suspended and excluded from participating in those elections with little or no explanation.</p> <p>I know the toll that had on individuals, whose reputations, social networks and self-esteem were seriously damaged overnight by unfounded allegations or none at all. Who was overseeing that process? Iain McNicol, the party\u2019s general secretary until 2018, who is one of the signatories of this advert.</p> <p>As an elected officer of my constituency Labour party I have never felt at all unwelcome as a Jew in the party, where I am surrounded by people who have fought racism and bigotry all their lives, including other Jews. The worst I have felt is great embarrassment at the reactionary interventions and policy positions put forward by some of the same Labour peers who signed that advert, such as Peter Mandelson, John Reid and Michael Levy.<br><strong>David Rosenberg</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Full-page Guardian adverts won\u2019t come cheap, of course, even between 67 people. I find myself asking why they\u2019ve done it? I note the names like Mandelson in there, whose hostility to Corbyn is very well documented, but it does appear to me that people who have never accepted Corbyn as leader of the party have now decided that losing a possible forthcoming general election to the Tories is a price worth paying to rid the party of him. Interesting to note, too, that Donald Trump is now using the same kind of language against \u201cthe squad\u201d of four female Democrats, that they too are antisemitic. The 67 Labour peers now find themselves sharing the same kind of ideology that Trump does.

      "bodyText": "The advertisement from Labour peers (Peers tell Corbyn he has \u2018failed test of leadership\u2019, 17 July) does a fine job in spelling out accusations against Jeremy Corbyn (saying he is \u201cpresiding over the most shaming period in Labour\u2019s history\u201d shows peers still in denial over Iraq, never mind 1931), but unhelpfully they say nothing about what should be done next. Labour leaders, Jeremy Corbyn included, are not responsible for enforcing the rules and constitution of the party. That is the responsibility of the National Executive Committee (NEC), of which the leader is only one member. Discipline is the responsibility of the National Constitutional Committee (NCC), and Jeremy is not part of this at all. The party\u2019s rules are not imposed, dictated by or changed by the leader. After a period when the governance unit was under-resourced, and the NEC singularly failed to address the problem, and ignored recommendations which would have helped, contrary to the peers\u2019 view, the party structures in relation to complaints have been strengthened in the last year. The NCC has been expanded, legal representation increased. In February, general secretary Jennie Formby reported that since April 2018 the party had investigated 673 complaints against members and gave details of progress. It would be helpful for Formby\u2019s deputy now to give an update so we can see exactly what has been done to address the party\u2019s antisemitism problem, and what remains to be done. Phil Tate Edinburgh \u2022 It was a famous Jewish singer, Bob Dylan, who coined the lyric \u201cMoney doesn\u2019t talk, it swears\u201d, which seems quite apt for the minority of Labour peers who have paid for an advert to subvert the democratically expressed wishes of Labour members who have twice voted overwhelmingly for Jeremy Corbyn to lead the party. In those leadership elections of 2015 and 2016, thousands of Labour members \u2013 overwhelmingly Corbyn supporters \u2013 many with decades of commitment to the party, and including a significant number of Jews, were told they were definitely unwelcome in the most brutal way, when they were summarily suspended and excluded from participating in those elections with little or no explanation. I know the toll that had on individuals, whose reputations, social networks and self-esteem were seriously damaged overnight by unfounded allegations or none at all. Who was overseeing that process? Iain McNicol, the party\u2019s general secretary until 2018, who is one of the signatories of this advert. As an elected officer of my constituency Labour party I have never felt at all unwelcome as a Jew in the party, where I am surrounded by people who have fought racism and bigotry all their lives, including other Jews. The worst I have felt is great embarrassment at the reactionary interventions and policy positions put forward by some of the same Labour peers who signed that advert, such as Peter Mandelson, John Reid and Michael Levy. David Rosenberg London \u2022 Full-page Guardian adverts won\u2019t come cheap, of course, even between 67 people. I find myself asking why they\u2019ve done it? I note the names like Mandelson in there, whose hostility to Corbyn is very well documented, but it does appear to me that people who have never accepted Corbyn as leader of the party have now decided that losing a possible forthcoming general election to the Tories is a price worth paying to rid the party of him. Interesting to note, too, that Donald Trump is now using the same kind of language against \u201cthe squad\u201d of four female Democrats, that they too are antisemitic. The 67 Labour peers now find themselves sharing the same kind of ideology that Trump does. I also find that disheartening, and unsurprising, sadly. John Holroyd Thornhill, Dumfries \u2022 With Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s swift action in sacking his Brexit spokesperson in the Lords (Corbyn sacks senior peer over \u2018Hitler bunker\u2019 remark, 18 July), I hope the 67 fellow Labour peers who attacked Mr Corbyn in an advert in the Guardian on 17 July for not taking leadership on controversial comments by Labour members will be happy that they have had a quick impact. Dr David Lowry Stoneleigh, Surrey \u2022 I actually drew some limited comfort from reading the names of former Commons colleagues \u2013 now peers \u2013 in their advert attacking the conduct of the party leader. I had genuinely been under the impression that several of them were dead. David Hinchliffe Labour MP for Wakefield, 1987-2005 \u2022 The Labour peers who signed an advert in Wednesday\u2019s Guardian would be most welcome to come to our constituency Labour party and explain to the many Jewish members, including our immediate past chair, why they are apparently no longer welcome in the party. Professor Emeritus Nick Spencer Leamington Spa, Warwickshire \u2022 John Harris (Labour can effect positive change despite its discord, 15 July) seems to have let his enthusiasm for linking anti-imperialism and antisemitism run away with him. In particular he tries to show a connection between Jeremy Corbyn, some of his advisers and the political forces who \u201ceventually formed the deeply inconsistent and compromised Stop the War coalition\u201d. We have always been consistent in opposing our government\u2019s military interventions, and \u2013 far from being compromised \u2013 the Chilcot inquiry vindicated our criticisms, as do the continued failed wars from Libya to Afghanistan. We opposed bombing by Russia in Syria, but argued that intervention by the US and UK would lead to further misery for ordinary Syrians. We currently oppose Trump\u2019s dangerous escalation of conflict with Iran. The latest attempt to blame the left for antisemitism is turning reality on its head. Those fighting imperialism have long been champions of anti-racism, including antisemitism, and we are proud that some of those most able and consistent at doing so have been Jewish. Lindsey German Convener, Stop the War Coalition \u2022 There is no doubt that there is antisemitism in the Labour party, as everywhere, and it has been badly handled, not least by its equivocating leader, but I would like to ask MPs who have submitted dossiers of complaints just how many turned out to be members of the party, and how many were vile, troublemaking trolls?

If the figures have been exaggerated, they have unnecessarily alarmed the Jewish population and made the Labour party seem far more antisemitic than it really is.

He stayed abroad, and spent the rest of his life working out, as a historian, how it was that the decades he had lived in China had led to the Communist conquest. He pioneered the study of the Republic of China (1911-49), especially of the rise of the military and later of the Communists.</p> <p>This was often painful work. The events that engulfed China brought great suffering to his family and friends, and cut him off from his native country. Though they started life in a traditional society, his brilliant generation of Chinese intellectuals came of age in warfare and revolution, and were later persecuted or exiled.</p> <p>Jerome\u2019s books included Yuan Shih-k\u2019ai (1961), about the dynastic moderniser and first president of the republic; Mao and the Chinese Revolution (1965); China and the West, and The Military-Gentry Coalition: China Under the Warlords (both 1979); State Economic Policies of the Ch\u2019ing Government (1980); and The Highlanders of China (1992). He rewrote The Military-Gentry Coalition in Chinese. Perhaps his favourite book was his first, Poems of Solitude (1961), an anthology translated from Chinese poems, edited with Michael Bullock. </p> <p>Born Chen Zhirang in Chengdu, Sichuan, in western China, Jerome came from a literature-loving family. His father, Chen Keda, passed the imperial examinations just before the system was abolished in 1905; the official career that would have followed vanished. His mother, Ma Huizhi, was married to his father in her mid-teens, after his first wife had died, leaving two sons. She had eight children; four did not survive.</p> <p>Chen Keda scraped together an income to support the family until 1929, when he went bankrupt. Ma Huizhi died, the family lost its home, and Jerome was sent to a missionary school, where he learnt English. The Japanese invasion had forced the flight of China\u2019s great northern universities to the remote southwest. In 1939 Jerome went to the distinguished but very poor Southwest United University, combining the faculty and students of several institutions. </p> <p>In late 1945, after the defeat of the Japanese, he took a six-day journey by lorry to Beijing, where he taught economics at Yen-ching University. In 1946 he won a scholarship to study under <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/F-A-Hayek\" title=\"\">Friedrich Hayek</a>, the liberal critic of JM Keynes, at the London School of Economics. When Hayek decamped to Arkansas in 1949, Jerome moved to the School of Oriental and African Studies.</p> <p>By the time he finished his thesis in 1952, the Communist party was in control in China. The last letter he received from his older brother warned him not to come home. The new order was hostile to someone trained in western liberal economics.</p> <p>Jerome worked for the Chinese Service of the BBC, and played for the BBC\u2019s bridge team. This was not a long-term career; being Chinese he was not considered suitable for promotion. He went to Leeds University, as reader in history. The years there were not unhappy. He had many friends but he was an outsider; it was made clear to him, in a kindly way, that as a Chinese person he could not expect to get a chair in Chinese history. In 1971 he was recruited as a professor by York University in Toronto, where he stayed until retiring in 1987. </p> <p>For almost three decades Jerome had no contact with China or his family there. When he did go back in 1978 he learned that his fellow intellectuals had been persecuted, banished and imprisoned, or had taken their own lives, in the Cultural Revolution. As China entered the Reform era in the late 1970s, he regained some of the hope for a better China that he had embraced so passionately in his youth.</p> <p>In October 1981, at the conference for the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Revolution (the first time the revolution had been celebrated for four decades), Jerome gave a fluent, impassioned speech on \u201cseeking truth from facts\u201d and academic independence. He was cheered for many minutes by Chinese colleagues.</p> <p>His hope faded as it became clear that the Communist party would remain in complete charge of China; there was no hope for the rule of law.

She said</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Over the course of the last few months I\u2019ve been increasingly uncomfortable about the way the rhetoric is developing on Brexit. My constituents voted to leave in Stourbridge by 70 percent, so I\u2019ve honoured that commitment, voted for the prime minister\u2019s deal three times, but when that didn\u2019t get through parliament I became more and more worried that there is the potential to crash out with no-deal at the end of October. The fact that Boris Johnson - and he hasn\u2019t won yet by the way but obviously he may - is not ruling out proroguing parliament, I felt that this time that rather than just abstain I would vote for the amendments that will make it more difficult ...</p> \n   <p>I think a lot of people would be prepared to serve under Jeremy Hunt if he gets in. If we do end up with Boris as our prime minister, then I think quite a number of people who would have always been voting with the government will leave the government and will be doing everything they can with myself and others to make sure we leave with a deal, or we carry on negotiating or we look for another outcome.</p> \n   <p>You have to remember that democracy isn\u2019t just about the majority wins and has everything its way \u2013 especially when the minority is as big as 48%, and also when a majority actually voted to remain in Scotland and Northern Ireland. So I think we have to treat the minority with more respect than proroguing parliament and clearing off without a deal \u2013 leaving us very exposed as an economy and a society and reliant on the United States at a very bad time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20e1c5f3e6f8c64f4f8dee5f1a3e4a82bf1427d8\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20e1c5f3e6f8c64f4f8dee5f1a3e4a82bf1427d8/129_481_3573_2144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margot James,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margot James,</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d3081818f08cf92bb7725cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T14:28:38.658Z\">3.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As my colleagues<strong> Peter Walker </strong>and <strong>Jessica Elgot </strong>report <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/18/mps-pass-amendment-seeking-to-thwart-no-deal-prorogation\">in their story on the prorogation vote,</a> the 17 Tory rebels included<strong> Keith Simpson</strong>, who was voting against his party for the first time in his long career as an MP.

This afternoon\u2019s vote relating to a no-deal Brexit is important, but probably not decisive. Here are some thought on what it means.</p> \n  <p><strong>1) Boris Johnson has suffered his first Commons defeat - before even becoming prime minister. </strong>Jeremy Hunt, his rival for the Tory leadership, has ruled out proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit, but Johnson pointedly hasn\u2019t. Over the last two days peers and MPs have voted to tie his hands on this point. Coming after the resignation of Sir Kim Darroch as ambassador to Washington in response to comments from Johnson, this is fresh evidence that the Westminster machine already regards him as PM.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) This vote probably means proroguing parliament in the autumn to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit is now closed as an option for Johnson.</strong> The Benn amendment says, if parliament were prorogued or adjourned in this timescale, it would have to be recalled. But a tiny window of uncertainty remains because a) if the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland were to revive, the Benn amendment would become redundant; and b) there is always the faint chance of a rogue PM trying to ignore this law.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) Stopping parliament being prorogued is not the same as stopping a no-deal Brexit. </strong>It remains the case that, if Johnson were to opt for a no-deal Brexit<strong>, </strong>MPs sitting in the Commons in September or October would have no obvious means of stopping him. <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/new-prime-minister-intent-no-deal-brexit-cant-be-stopped-mps-0?gclid=EAIaIQobChMInfiqy7--4wIVgrHtCh32cAe9EAAYASAAEgKtN_D_BwE\">An <strong>Institute for Government </strong>report</a> said, under the rules as they are now, it would be \u201calmost impossible\u201d for MPs to stop no-deal without using a no confidence vote to bring down the government. Even if Johnson did lose a no confidence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/16/tory-leadership-latest-news-johnson-will-bring-down-government-if-he-goes-for-no-deal-brexit-says-top-tory-live-news?page=with:block-5d2dce148f0845f89e30e24e#block-5d2dce148f0845f89e30e24e\">there is no guarantee he would pause Brexit to allow the electorate to have its say.</a> But the IfG report also says the situation might be different if the Speaker were to be more \u201cflexible\u201d in his interpretation of Commons procedure, and John Bercow has repeatedly hinted that he would be willing to bend the rules to help MPs vote against no-deal (as he did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/20/brexit-latest-news-letter-article-50-extension-pmqs-theresa-may-bends-to-pressure-from-tory-brexiters-and-rules-out-asking-for-long-article-extension-politics-live?page=with:block-5c9218cce4b0480f6c022620#block-5c9218cce4b0480f6c022620\">here, </a>referring to standing order 24).</p> \n  <p><strong>4) But Tory opposition to no-deal is looking a bit more robust this afternoon than it was. </strong>As I mentioned this morning, in recent weeks MPs trying to use parliamentary process to block no-deal have suffered a series of defeats. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/18/brexit-latest-newst-commons-vote-no-deal-gauke-hints-he-may-rebel-ahead-of-knife-edge-vote-intended-to-stop-no-deal-prorogation-live-news?page=with:block-5d3020838f0845f89e30f5a5#block-5d3020838f0845f89e30f5a5\"> 9.09am.) </a>Today they won a handsome victory. Some 17 Conservative MPs voted against the government, and five ministers seem to have abstained deliberately; by this time next week those five will probably be on the back benches, making a \u201cGauke-ward squad\u201d of 20-plus. If Johnson sacks more ministers in a reshuffle, that could get even bigger. Most of these MPs would probably not vote against the government on no confidence motion to stop a no-deal Brexit, but with the government\u2019s working majority set to fall to just three after the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection, the rebels probably have enough muscle to bring Johnson down.</p> \n  <p><strong>5) An early election looks ever more likely. </strong>Johnson would want to avoid an early election until he has delivered Brexit, but these numbers mean that he might not be left with any choice. Here is an assessment from <strong>Mujtaba Rahman</strong>, who does Brexit analysis for the Eurasia Group consultancy. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Mij_Europe/status/1151771425818185728\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our revised, short term <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a> probabilities:-<br><br>40% Early election* (basecase); <br>25% No-deal; <br>20% Tweaked deal*; <br>10% Referendum*; <br>5% Other scenarios - clean A50 extension, no strings attached; caretaker Govt*; revoking A50; proroguing Parliament <br><br>*Accompanied w A50 ext <a href=\"https://t.co/FIKHl4ygGp\">pic.twitter.com/FIKHl4ygGp</a></p>\u2014 Mujtaba Rahman (@Mij_Europe) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mij_Europe/status/1151771425818185728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 18, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T14:36:31.815Z\">at 3.36pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d3073d38f08d0b6ca533196\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T13:35:15.056Z\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">May refuses to punish ministers who abstained - but suggests her successor will sack them</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Downing Street has put out this statement about the vote.

In a clip broadcast by Sky, Hammond said that a no-deal Brexit of the kind being considered by some prominent Brexiters (he meant Boris Johnson) would hit the economy much harder. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The report that the OBR have published this morning shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy, a very significant reduction in tax revenues and a big increase in our national debt - a recession caused by a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n   <p>But that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiters. They are talking about a much harder version, which would cause much more disruption to our economy. And the OBR is clear that in that less benign version of no-deal the hit would be much greater, the impact would be much harder, the recession would be bigger. </p> \n   <p>So I greatly fear the impact on our economy and our public finances of the kind of no deal Brexit that is realistically being discussed now.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In his press conference <strong>Robert Chote,</strong> the head of the OBR, explained the difference between the more benign no-deal that on which the OBR stress test was based, and a more disruptive no-deal. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve looked at the fiscal implications of the less severe of the two no-deal, no-transition scenarios set out by the International Monetary Fund in its World Economic Outlook. This scenario is not necessarily the most likely outcome, and it is relatively benign compared to some, for example, assuming no major short-term border disruptions.

While it is a scenario, rather than a forecast, it is nevertheless useful for exploring the channels through which the public finances might respond in the case of a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n   <p>Heightened uncertainty and declining confidence deter investment, while higher trade barriers with the EU weigh on exports. Together, these push the economy into recession, with asset prices and the pound falling sharply. Real GDP falls by 2% by the end of 2020 and is 4% below our March forecast by that point. Higher trade barriers also slow growth in potential productivity, while lower net inward migration reduces labour force growth, so potential output is lower than the baseline throughout the scenario (and beyond). The imposition of tariffs and the sterling depreciation raise inflation and squeeze real household incomes, but the monetary policy committee is able to cut bank rate to support demand, helping to bring output back towards potential and inflation back towards target. </p> \n   <p>Borrowing is around \u00a330bn a year higher than our March forecast from 2020-21 onwards. Lower receipts \u2013 in particular income tax and NICs (due to the recession) and capital taxes (due to weaker asset prices) \u2013 explain most of the deterioration. These are partly offset by lower debt interest spending (thanks to lower interest rates and RPI inflation) and the revenue raised customs duties (which are treated as EU rather than UK taxes in the baseline). Higher borrowing and the assumed rollover of Term Funding Scheme loans leave public sector net debt around 12% of GDP higher than our March forecast by 2023-24.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The OBR also says this stress test is \u201cby no means a worst-case scenario under a no-deal, no-transition Brexit\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d302fea8f0845f89e30f615\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T08:38:21.947Z\">9.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s 300-page Fiscal Risks Report is <a href=\"https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/Fiscalrisksreport2019.pdf\">here (pdf).</a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d302f298f08d0b6ca532dc9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T08:36:46.208Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">OBR warns no-deal Brexit could leave \u00a330bn hole in public finances</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>My colleague <strong>Graeme Wearden </strong>is covering the publication of the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s Fiscal Risks Report on his business live blog here.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/jul/18/no-deal-brexit-uk-recession-obr-fiscal-risks-retail-sales-business-live\">No-deal Brexit 'would send UK into recession', forecasters fear - business live</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>The blog also has a link to a live feed from the OBR\u2019s press conference.</p> \n  <p>This is from Sky\u2019s <strong>Ed Conway.</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/1151771506667638786\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Breaking: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OBR_UK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@OBR_UK</a> warns that a no deal Brexit could cause leave a \u00a330bn hole in the public finances</p>\u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/1151771506667638786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 18, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d3020838f0845f89e30f5a5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T08:09:25.830Z\">9.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Gauke hints he may rebel ahead of knife-edge vote intended to stop no-deal prorogation</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>MPs trying to use parliamentary votes to stop a no-deal Brexit have not had much luck recently. Last month <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48613921\">the government comfortably defeated a Labour attempt to allow backbenchers to take control of the Commons timetable </a>which, if passed, might have allowed a bill opposing no-deal to be passed.

But even this relatively anaemic amendment only passed by one vote, and that was just because <a href=\"https://www.buryfreepress.co.uk/news/jo-churchill-mp-forgot-to-cast-vote-on-key-no-deal-brexit-amendment-9076209/\">a government whip, Jo Churchill, forgot to cast her vote.</a></p> \n  <p>Last night the House of Lords did beef up the original Grieve proposal, by passing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/17/brexit-tory-leadership-pmqs-boris-johnson-theresa-may-mcdonnell-sets-out-labours-three-strategies-for-ending-in-work-poverty-live-news?page=with:block-5d2f422e8f08d0b6ca5327db#block-5d2f422e8f08d0b6ca5327db\">an amendment saying there would have to be debates on those fortnightly reports mandated by Grieve. </a>Whether this would stop a new PM proroguing parliament is a matter of debate, but at the very least it would provide stronger legal grounds for a court challenge against a decision to prorogue.</p> \n  <p>Today the government will try to reverse that decision in the Commons.

      "bodyText": "MPs have easily passed a backbench amendment seeking to block any attempt by a future government to prorogue parliament to ensure a no-deal Brexit, in what is likely to be seen as a pre-emptive strike against Boris Johnson\u2019s authority. A no-deal Brexit would plunge Britain into a recession that would shrink the economy by 2%, push unemployment above 5% and send house prices tumbling by around 10%, according to the government\u2019s independent forecasting body. Claims by Boris Johnson that regulations imposed by \u201cBrussels bureaucrats\u201d were damaging the trade in kippers have been debunked by the European commission, which said that the food safety obligations criticised by him were due to rules set by Britain. Boris Johnson could be the UK\u2019s last prime minister, Gordon Brown has warned, after the Conservative leadership frontrunner met Scottish MPs to reassure them of his desire to bolster the union. Jeremy Corbyn faces a new front of internal dissent over his handling of antisemitism in the party, with Labour peers potentially set to hold a vote of no-confidence in him next week, it has emerged. Conservative former ministers and human rights groups have accused the government of failing to outlaw torture as it published fresh guidance on the treatment of detainees abroad and refused to launch a judge-led inquiry into post-9/11 rendition cases. Leading British politicians including Jeremy Corbyn and Sadiq Khan are among thousands of people who have signed a letter of support f the four US congresswomen of colour who were targeted by Donald Trump in a series of racist tweets this week. The mayors of London, Greater Manchester and other English cities have written to the government urging faster implementation of \u201cdesperately needed\u201d changes to gender recognition legislation. Civil servants working for the Department for Exiting the European Union have been awarded nearly \u00a31.3m in bonuses, new figures show. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is my colleague Rafael Behr on what today\u2019s vote means. And this is how his column starts. It is a measure of how far British politics has passed through the looking glass that MPs feel compelled to put in law that prime ministers should govern with the consent of parliament. There was a time, not too long ago, when that sort of thing was understood as a convention underpinning democracy. The imminent arrival of Boris Johnson in Downing Street has made it prudent to get implicit constitutional principles down in writing. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has been explaining why he did not vote with the government against the Hilary Benn amendment intended to stop Boris Johnson proroguing parliament. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Newsnight Margot James, who resigned as a culture minister today so that she could vote against the government for the anti-prorogation amendment, said \u201cquite a number\u201d of ministers would leave the government if Boris Johnson becomes PM and join the campaign to block a no-deal Brexit. She said Over the course of the last few months I\u2019ve been increasingly uncomfortable about the way the rhetoric is developing on Brexit. My constituents voted to leave in Stourbridge by 70 percent, so I\u2019ve honoured that commitment, voted for the prime minister\u2019s deal three times, but when that didn\u2019t get through parliament I became more and more worried that there is the potential to crash out with no-deal at the end of October. The fact that Boris Johnson - and he hasn\u2019t won yet by the way but obviously he may - is not ruling out proroguing parliament, I felt that this time that rather than just abstain I would vote for the amendments that will make it more difficult ... I think a lot of people would be prepared to serve under Jeremy Hunt if he gets in. If we do end up with Boris as our prime minister, then I think quite a number of people who would have always been voting with the government will leave the government and will be doing everything they can with myself and others to make sure we leave with a deal, or we carry on negotiating or we look for another outcome. You have to remember that democracy isn\u2019t just about the majority wins and has everything its way \u2013 especially when the minority is as big as 48%, and also when a majority actually voted to remain in Scotland and Northern Ireland. So I think we have to treat the minority with more respect than proroguing parliament and clearing off without a deal \u2013 leaving us very exposed as an economy and a society and reliant on the United States at a very bad time. As my colleagues Peter Walker and Jessica Elgot report in their story on the prorogation vote, the 17 Tory rebels included Keith Simpson, who was voting against his party for the first time in his long career as an MP. Simpson said: This is the first time I have rebelled against my party in 22 years in parliament. This is a huge national issue, I said months ago to my local paper and my association that I was totally against no deal. So this is the first time I have rebelled but you can get a taste for it. The Tory leadership candidate Jeremy Hunt has apologised after revealing that he missed today\u2019s vote by accident. He would have voted with the government, he says. Votes in the House of Commons can have legislative consequences and political consequences, and sometimes it is not entirely obvious what either of them will be. This afternoon\u2019s vote relating to a no-deal Brexit is important, but probably not decisive. Here are some thought on what it means. 1) Boris Johnson has suffered his first Commons defeat - before even becoming prime minister. Jeremy Hunt, his rival for the Tory leadership, has ruled out proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit, but Johnson pointedly hasn\u2019t. Over the last two days peers and MPs have voted to tie his hands on this point. Coming after the resignation of Sir Kim Darroch as ambassador to Washington in response to comments from Johnson, this is fresh evidence that the Westminster machine already regards him as PM. 2) This vote probably means proroguing parliament in the autumn to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit is now closed as an option for Johnson. The Benn amendment says, if parliament were prorogued or adjourned in this timescale, it would have to be recalled. But a tiny window of uncertainty remains because a) if the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland were to revive, the Benn amendment would become redundant; and b) there is always the faint chance of a rogue PM trying to ignore this law. 3) Stopping parliament being prorogued is not the same as stopping a no-deal Brexit. It remains the case that, if Johnson were to opt for a no-deal Brexit, MPs sitting in the Commons in September or October would have no obvious means of stopping him. An Institute for Government report said, under the rules as they are now, it would be \u201calmost impossible\u201d for MPs to stop no-deal without using a no confidence vote to bring down the government. Even if Johnson did lose a no confidence, there is no guarantee he would pause Brexit to allow the electorate to have its say. But the IfG report also says the situation might be different if the Speaker were to be more \u201cflexible\u201d in his interpretation of Commons procedure, and John Bercow has repeatedly hinted that he would be willing to bend the rules to help MPs vote against no-deal (as he did here, referring to standing order 24). 4) But Tory opposition to no-deal is looking a bit more robust this afternoon than it was. As I mentioned this morning, in recent weeks MPs trying to use parliamentary process to block no-deal have suffered a series of defeats. (See 9.09am.) Today they won a handsome victory. Some 17 Conservative MPs voted against the government, and five ministers seem to have abstained deliberately; by this time next week those five will probably be on the back benches, making a \u201cGauke-ward squad\u201d of 20-plus. If Johnson sacks more ministers in a reshuffle, that could get even bigger. Most of these MPs would probably not vote against the government on no confidence motion to stop a no-deal Brexit, but with the government\u2019s working majority set to fall to just three after the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection, the rebels probably have enough muscle to bring Johnson down. 5) An early election looks ever more likely. Johnson would want to avoid an early election until he has delivered Brexit, but these numbers mean that he might not be left with any choice. Here is an assessment from Mujtaba Rahman, who does Brexit analysis for the Eurasia Group consultancy. Downing Street has put out this statement about the vote. A spokesman said: The prime minister is obviously disappointed that a number of ministers failed to vote in this afternoon\u2019s division. No doubt her successor will take this into account when forming their government. This is probably less aggressive than it sounds. If you look at the list of ministers who abstained (see 2.11pm) - Greg Clark, Sir Alan Duncan, David Gauke, Philip Hammond and Rory Stewart - they are all people who were never expected to serve in government with Boris Johnson anyway. Theresa May could have chosen to sack them now, but with only a week to go before the new PM forms a government, that would have been a bit pointless. Tony Lloyd, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, rises to make a point of order. He says by the time a bill has got this far, it is the property of the house, not the government. He says there have been rumours that the government might drop the bill at this late stage to stop it becoming law. Can the Speaker rule that out? The Speaker, John Bercow, says he has not heard that suggestion. But he says the chief whip, Julian Smith, and the Northern Ireland minister, John Penrose, are both on the front bench now indicating that that will not happen. Penrose rises himself and confirms this. MPs have backed the rest of the Lords amendments by 328 votes to 65. From the Times\u2019 Stephen Swinford Earlier I featured a tweet saying Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, abstained. But she voted with the government. And here is the list of MPs who voted against the Benn amendment. Only one Labour MP, Kate Hoey, voted with the Tories and the DUP against it and only one independent, Ian Austin. Here is the division list with all the MPs who voted for the Benn amendment in the first vote. There were 17 Conservatives voting for it. MPs are now voting on whether or not the accept the other Lords amendments, from two to 18. MPs have now voted to accept the Lords amendment as amended (see 1.48pm) by 315 votes to 273 - a majority of 42. This is from the Labour peer Andrew Adonis, one of the strongest advocates in the party of a second referendum. From the Times\u2019 Francis Elliott From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth MPs are now voting on the Lords amendment to the bill passed last night, as amended by the Benn amendment. Broadly speaking, this should be a re-run of the previous vote. The government lost that vote by a much bigger margin than people were expecting. Although opinion is split as to whether or not the Commons could block a no-deal Brexit - as this Institute for Government briefing argued, under current procedure it is \u201cnear impossible\u201d, but it might be possible because this Speaker has hinted he would bend the rules - the size of this victory will embolden those who think parliament does have the muscle to block a no-deal Brexit. MPs have voted to stop Boris Johnson proroguing parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit by 315 votes to 274 - a majority of 41. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From CityAM\u2019s Owen Bennett From the Telegraph\u2019s Gordon Rayner These are from Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt. UPDATE: In fact, Caroline Nokes did vote with the government. See 2.11pm. From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth This is from @PoliticalPics, a photographer specialising in the Number 10 beat. Perhaps it is coincidence. Or perhaps Philip Hammond wants people to know he is not voting. What we don\u2019t know is whether he has permission from the whips to abstain (because they have paired him with a non-voting Labour MP), or whether he is abstaining unilaterally. Only seven Tory MPs rebelled on the last comparable vote on prorogation - the vote last week on the Dominic Grieve amendment saying the government should have to produce fortnightly reports in the autumn on progress towards restoring the power-sharing executive. It would not have stopped a new PM proroguing parliament, but Grieve argued it was a step in the right direction. As the voting list shows, the seven Tory rebels were: Guto Bebb, Ken Clarke, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Sam Gyimah, Phillip Lee and Sir Oliver Letwin. From the Daily Mail\u2019s John Stevens From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby MPs are now voting on the Benn amendment. (See 12.34pm.) John Penrose is making a broader point. He says he voted remain. But he accepts the democratic decision of the public. Brexit must be implemented, he says. MPs are \u201crunning out of road\u201d. Voters\u2019 patience is running out. He says this amendment is about trying to prevent Brexit happening. MPs shout \u201crubbish\u201d at him. John Penrose, the Northern Ireland minister, is winding up the debate now. He says too many additional issues have been added to this bill. He says he has two narrow criticisms of the Benn amendment. Parts of this amendment were defeated in the Commons, he says, and parts were ruled out of scope. He says MPs should reject the amendment on those grounds. John Baron, a Tory Brexiter, claims the rebels are \u201ctilting at windmills\u201d. The Conservatives would never allow parliament to be prorogued. Penrose goes on. He says his other criticism of the Benn amendment is that it does not have anything to do with Northern Ireland. If the Stormont assembly restarts before the bill gets royal assent, it will never become law, he says. He says passing the amendment would set an unwelcome constitutional precedent. This is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. In theory David Gauke, the justice secretary, and Greg Clark, the business secretary, could be sacked for abstaining. If Tory MPs are being whipped to vote against the Benn amendment (as they are), an abstention counts as an act of dissent - although obviously it is not as serious as voting in favour. But, in practice, Number 10 is more likely to turn a blind eye - not least because, in private, Theresa May would probably not consider it the end of the world if MPs did vote for a mechanism to stop Boris Johnson proroguing parliament. The SNP\u2019s Gavin Newlands says the default assumption, if parliament is deadlocked, should be revoking article 50, not proroguing parliament to allow a no-deal Brexit to happen. He says the fact that Boris Johnson won\u2019t rule out prorogation shows he is not fit for office. The DUP\u2019s Emma Little-Pengelly says the Northern Ireland assembly has never voted to relax abortion laws in Northern Ireland. If you want to know more about what prorogation actually involves, this is worth a read. The DUP\u2019s Ian Paisley complains about how the bill has been hijacked for other purposes. And he says the bill will make the restoration of the power-sharing executive less likely (because those who want abortion laws relaxed and same-sex marriage allowed in Northern Ireland now have no incentive to back the resumption of the executive). Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, says he has some sympathy for the points made by Fiona Bruce and Nigel Dodds. But MPs are responding to a power vacuum in Northern Ireland. Referring to the Benn amendment, Grieve says it is extraordinary to suggest that MPs might not be allowed to sit when they need to consider important matters. Sir Oliver Letwin asks Grieve to confirm this this amendment is designed to block the use of prerogative powers to prorogue parliament. Grieve confirms that. Grieve says, if MPs do not back this amendment, their role as a protector of democracy will have been \u201cshot to pieces\u201d. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, says Boris Johnson\u2019s threat to prorogue parliament to push through a no-deal Brexit would shame a dictator in a banana republic. Now in the debate Fiona Bruce, a Conservative, is also complaining about how this bill have been extended beyond its original intent, as a result of the abortion amendment passed when it was in the Commons last week. She says Northern Ireland should decide its own abortion law. She says MPs talk about what it means to be colonial. She suggests that this is what new colonialism looks like (Westminster legislating for Northern Ireland). The Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes thinks Nigel Dodds has a point about new abortion laws for Northern Ireland being rushed through. (See 12.50pm.) Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, also complains that this Northern Ireland bill is being hijacked for alternative purposes. He says the abortion amendments added to the bill, particularly one added in the Lords, would leave Northern Ireland in \u201climbo\u201d for a period of months without an effective abortion law. Justine Greening, the Tory former education secretary, says MPs should back this \u201ccommon sense\u2019 amendment. She says, if this amendment does not pass, \u201cwe will have crossed a rubicon\u201d. If it is defeated, it will establish the precedent that if a government is running into trouble, it can just shut parliament down. Sir Oliver Letwin, a Conservative, says in future people will look back and think it was extraordinary that there was ever any controversy about ensuring the Commons is sitting at a time when a major national decision needs to be taken. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle agrees. She says any proper Conservative, unlike Boris Johnson, would have ruled out the idea of proroguing parliament to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. The DUP\u2019s Ian Paisley complains that a bill that was supposed to be about the Northern Ireland executive has been hijacked and turned into a bill about Brexit. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle says she understands Paisley\u2019s point. But it\u2019s a case of \u201cneeds must\u201d, she says. She says this has been the longest session of parliament since the civil war. That is because the government daren\u2019t prorogue parliament and have a new Queen\u2019s speech in case that gets voted down, she says. She says MPs are amending this bill because it is the legislative vehicle that is available. Here is the full text of the Benn amendment. Page 1, line 16, at end insert\u2014 \u201c(2C) If, as a result of parliament standing prorogued or adjourned, a minister of the crown cannot comply with the obligations in subsection (2A) or (2B), a proclamation under the Meeting of Parliament Act 1797 (c. 127) shall require parliament to meet on a specified day within the period within which compliance with subsection (2B) is required and to meet on the five following days (other than Saturdays, Sundays or a day which is a bank holiday in the United Kingdom or in any part of the United Kingdom) to allow for compliance with subsection (2B).\u201d Alistair Burt, the Conservative former Foreign Office minister who has also signed the Benn amendment (see 11.26am), says this proposal would not force the Commons to vote in any given way on a no-deal Brexit in the autumn. It would just ensure that the Commons was sitting, so that MPs could take a decision, he says. MPs are now debating the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill. The bill has already gone through the Commons and the Lords, and this debate is what\u2019s known as \u201cconsideration of Lords amendments\u201d. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, goes first. He is moving his amendment 1. (See 11am.) He says his amendment would ensure that, if parliament is prorogued in the autumn, it would get recalled under the terms of this bill. He says the amendment does not create a new constitutional principle. It just ensure that parliament would be sitting when it needs to be sitting, in line with existing legislation. Jeremy Corbyn faces a new front in internal dissent over his handling of antisemitism in the party, with Labour peers set to hold a vote of no-confidence in the leader next week, it has emerged. The plan is for Labour peers to hold an emergency meeting on Monday afternoon to consider the idea. If it is taken forward, the ballot would take place over Tuesday and Wednesday, with the result soon afterwards, it is understood. If the no-confidence motion was passed it would have no formal effect, but would be a blow to the authority of Corbyn. Earlier this week more than 60 took out an advertisement in the Guardian accusing Corbyn of having \u201cfailed the test of leadership\u201d over his handling of antisemitism complaints within the party. The latest move follows the decision by Corbyn\u2019s office to sack Baroness Hayter as a Brexit minister in the Lords after she accused Corbyn of having a \u201cbunker mentality\u201d similar to the final days of Hitler. The European commission has now itself debunked Boris Johnson\u2019s claim about kipper food safety regulations, the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp reports. At the last Tory leadership hustings last night Boris Johnson brandished a kipper from the Isle of Man, and claimed that it exemplified why EU rules were so damaging. He said that the producer was complaining that, because of new EU regulations, he now has to send kippers through the post with a plastic ice pillow, making the whole process much more expensive. As is often the case when Johnson is talking about EU regulations, it turns out that he was not being accurate. The Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp explains why here. Turning back to Brexit, Nick Robinson has written a very thorough summary of the revelations in his Panorama programme tonight here, under the title \u201c10 things that stopped Brexit happening\u201d. In the programme Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiate, and Martin Selmayr, the European commission\u2019s secretary general, both say Theresa May never explicitly threatened to leave without a deal in their private talks. Barnier told the programme: I think that the UK side, which is well informed and competent and knows the way we work on the EU side, knew from the very beginning that we\u2019ve never been impressed by such a threat. It\u2019s not useful to use it. May\u2019s remaining time in No 10 might be so short that it can now safely be measured in hours, but it seems she is not above still getting furiously annoyed by political foes \u2013 and at this morning\u2019s lobby briefing we got a clue as to how she feels about Barnier. Asked about Barnier\u2019s claim, May\u2019s spokesman not only denied this, but gave a reply dripping with sarcasm. Can I begin by saying how nice it was to hear from Michel Barnier again this morning, and how generous it was of the BBC to give him a platform to share his views with us all. On that specific point, the prime minister was clear, both in public and in private that the UK was prepared to leave without a deal. No love lost, it would seem. In the Commons David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, is making a statement now about covering rendition and the treatment of detainees. He says the UK does not practice or condone torture. There is already guidance for the security services setting out the rules for detainees who are interrogated overseas. He says that new guidance is being issued. Theresa May has set out details in a written statement today, he says. Lidington says, after 9/11, it took the British intelligence agencies too long to appreciate the extent to which other countries were using torture (or unacceptable practices, as Lidingon puts it). He says lessons have been learnt. Three separate reports into this have been published, he says. He says better guidance is now coupled with a world-leading oversight regime. The intelligence and security committee has new powers to oversee the intelligence services, he says. He says the rules make it clear that ministers must be consulted if there is a real risk of detainees being mistreated by others. Addressing calls for a further public inquiry, Lidington says in 2013 the government said it would consider the case for a further judicial inquiry after other investigations were over. Lidington says the government has ruled out a further judicial inquiry. There is no policy need for one, he says. And there is no judicial need for one. He says mistreatment allegations have been investigated by the police. Lidington rules out further judicial inquiry into British collusion with rendition and the torture of terrorist suspects. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, and Alistair Burt, the the former Foreign Office minister, have joined up to table a new amendment to the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill that would categorically stop a new prime minister proroguing parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit, Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby reports. She says it has been selected. Knife crime in England and Wales hit a record high in 2018/19, up 8% on the previous year, the Press Association reports. Police recorded 43,516 offences involving knives or sharp objects in the year to March 2019, the highest since comparable records began in 2011. The figures released this morning by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) do not include Greater Manchester Police, which records data differently. There was a rise of 3,301 knife crime offences from 2017/18, with the volume of offences up 42% since the year ending March 2011. The total number of homicides in 2018/19 increased slightly to 701 offences from 693 in the previous 12 months, excluding terror attacks. Mark Bangs, from the ONS Centre for Crime and Justice, said: The picture of crime is a complex one. Overall levels of crime have remained steady, but this is not the case for all types of crime. For example, overall levels of violence have remained steady but we have seen increases in violent crimes involving knives and sharp instruments. We have seen increases in fraud and overall theft, but decreases in burglary following recent rises. The RAF is heading into space, Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, told a conference this morning. As the Press Association reports, the UK is joining Operation Olympic Defender, a US-led international unit aimed at strengthening deterrence against hostile actors in space and at stopping the spread of debris in orbit. Mordaunt told the Air and Space Power Conference in central London that an RAF pilot is set to be seconded to the Virgin Orbit small satellite programme. She noted that Virgin Orbit already has pilots with astronaut training and it is carrying out research into launching small satellites into space from the wing of a Boeing 747. She said: Science fiction is becoming science fact. One day I want to see RAF pilots earning their space wings and flying beyond the stratosphere. So, today I can announce we\u2019re making a giant leap in that direction by working towards placing a test pilot into the Virgin Orbit programme. Here is my colleague Larry Elliott\u2019s story about what the Office for Budget Responsiblity is saying about the impact of a no-deal Brexit. As mentioned earlier (see 9.45am), the OBR say itself that it\u2019s no-deal stress test is not based on a worst-case scenario. And Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has just been making this point too. In a clip broadcast by Sky, Hammond said that a no-deal Brexit of the kind being considered by some prominent Brexiters (he meant Boris Johnson) would hit the economy much harder. He explained: The report that the OBR have published this morning shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy, a very significant reduction in tax revenues and a big increase in our national debt - a recession caused by a no-deal Brexit. But that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiters. They are talking about a much harder version, which would cause much more disruption to our economy. And the OBR is clear that in that less benign version of no-deal the hit would be much greater, the impact would be much harder, the recession would be bigger. So I greatly fear the impact on our economy and our public finances of the kind of no deal Brexit that is realistically being discussed now. In his press conference Robert Chote, the head of the OBR, explained the difference between the more benign no-deal that on which the OBR stress test was based, and a more disruptive no-deal. He said: We\u2019ve looked at the fiscal implications of the less severe of the two no-deal, no-transition scenarios set out by the International Monetary Fund in its World Economic Outlook. This scenario is not necessarily the most likely outcome, and it is relatively benign compared to some, for example, assuming no major short-term border disruptions. A more disruptive outcome, closer to the Bank of England scenario that we used for our stress test two years ago, would have more severe consequences. As Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, told MPs yesterday, the government\u2019s no-deal planning does assume delays at the border. Tonight the BBC is showing a Panorama programme made by Nick Robinson exploring why the Brexit talks failed. Among the people he interviewed was Frans Timmermans, the first vice president of the European commission. As Politico Europe reports, Timmermans said that before the negotiations started the EU assumed that the British team would be \u201cbrilliant\u201d because of the professionalism of their civil service. But the EU quickly realised this was not the case, Timmermans said. He went on: And then the first time I saw public utterances by David Davis and I saw him not coming [to Brussels], not negotiating, grandstanding elsewhere I thought: \u2018Oh my God, they haven\u2019t got a plan, they haven\u2019t got a plan\u2019. That was really shocking frankly, because the damage if you don\u2019t have a plan \u2014 you know, we see it \u2014 time\u2019s running out and you don\u2019t have a plan, it\u2019s like Lance Corporal Jones \u2014 you know, \u2018Don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t panic\u2019, running around like idiots. Lord Callanan, a Brexit minister, has responded with his own Dad\u2019s Army quote, my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports. And here is an extract from what the OBR report says about a no-deal Brexit. In Chapter 10 we carry out a fiscal \u2018stress test\u2019 that quantifies the impact on the public finances of a particular no-deal, no-transition Brexit scenario, namely the less disruptive of the two presented by the IMF in its April 2019 World Economic Outlook. While it is a scenario, rather than a forecast, it is nevertheless useful for exploring the channels through which the public finances might respond in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Heightened uncertainty and declining confidence deter investment, while higher trade barriers with the EU weigh on exports. Together, these push the economy into recession, with asset prices and the pound falling sharply. Real GDP falls by 2% by the end of 2020 and is 4% below our March forecast by that point. Higher trade barriers also slow growth in potential productivity, while lower net inward migration reduces labour force growth, so potential output is lower than the baseline throughout the scenario (and beyond). The imposition of tariffs and the sterling depreciation raise inflation and squeeze real household incomes, but the monetary policy committee is able to cut bank rate to support demand, helping to bring output back towards potential and inflation back towards target. Borrowing is around \u00a330bn a year higher than our March forecast from 2020-21 onwards. Lower receipts \u2013 in particular income tax and NICs (due to the recession) and capital taxes (due to weaker asset prices) \u2013 explain most of the deterioration. These are partly offset by lower debt interest spending (thanks to lower interest rates and RPI inflation) and the revenue raised customs duties (which are treated as EU rather than UK taxes in the baseline). Higher borrowing and the assumed rollover of Term Funding Scheme loans leave public sector net debt around 12% of GDP higher than our March forecast by 2023-24. The OBR also says this stress test is \u201cby no means a worst-case scenario under a no-deal, no-transition Brexit\u201d. The Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s 300-page Fiscal Risks Report is here (pdf). My colleague Graeme Wearden is covering the publication of the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s Fiscal Risks Report on his business live blog here. The blog also has a link to a live feed from the OBR\u2019s press conference. This is from Sky\u2019s Ed Conway. MPs trying to use parliamentary votes to stop a no-deal Brexit have not had much luck recently. Last month the government comfortably defeated a Labour attempt to allow backbenchers to take control of the Commons timetable which, if passed, might have allowed a bill opposing no-deal to be passed. Last week the Speaker refused to call a Dominic Grieve amendment that would definitely prevented the next prime minister proroguing parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. Grieve also lost votes on two other related amendments. But he did win a vote on a move saying the government would have to publish fortnightly reports in the autumn on progress towards restoring the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland. He acknowledged that this on its own would not necessarily stop an autumn prorogation, but he said he hoped peers would beef it up in the Lords. But even this relatively anaemic amendment only passed by one vote, and that was just because a government whip, Jo Churchill, forgot to cast her vote. Last night the House of Lords did beef up the original Grieve proposal, by passing an amendment saying there would have to be debates on those fortnightly reports mandated by Grieve. Whether this would stop a new PM proroguing parliament is a matter of debate, but at the very least it would provide stronger legal grounds for a court challenge against a decision to prorogue. Today the government will try to reverse that decision in the Commons. At one level it is just a dispute about a narrow procedural amendment, but of course this has become a contest about whether or not parliament should be willing to contemplate a no-deal Brexit. Based on how MPs voted last week, the government should have a decent chance of winning. But last night Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt reported that some pro-European cabinet ministers were considering resigning so that they could vote against the government. And this morning David Gauke, the justice secretary, refused to rule out rebelling over this issue. He did not say he definitely would resign (and on many occasions pro-Europeans ministers have threatened to quit over Brexit only to back down at the last minute). But instead of just saying that he would support the government, he told the Today programme that he had not yet made up his mind. This is what he said when asked how he would vote: I will have to see what the precise amendments are and we\u2019re hearing what the whipping will be and the arguments for that so I\u2019m not in a position to necessarily say. But what I would say is the idea that parliament should be suspended in October - a period where it always sits, parliament has always in recent years sat at that time of year - at a crucial point in this country\u2019s history, if you like, that parliament should not be able to sit, should not be able to express its opinion and its will, I think would be outrageous. I very much doubt that any prime minister would in fact suspend parliament in these circumstances but I can understand the concerns that a lot of my colleagues have. Gauke, of course, expects to be sacked by the new prime minister (almost certainly Boris Johnson) next week. So he does not really have much to lose. I will be covering the debate in full. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: David Gauke, the justice secretary, gives a speech on sentencing. 9.30am: Crime figures for England and Wales are published. 9.30am: The Office for Budget Responsibility publishes is Fiscal Risks Report. 10am: The Alternative Arrangements Commission, an independent body set up to look for alternatives to the Northern Ireland backstop, publishes its final report. Around 12pm: MPs debate the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill. As Jessica Elgot reports, the government will seek to overturn a vote in the Lords adding an amendment to the bill intended to make it harder for the next PM to prorogue parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news.

No other minister has wasted quite so much money while justice and transport secretary.</p> <p>At the latest count he has cost the country \u00a33bn in the past five years. That means we could have paid him \u00a31bn to stay at home, doing nothing but watch TV and mowing the lawn, and still have been \u00a32bn better off. Just by diligently turning up to work each day, Grayling has prevented two hospitals from being built.</p> <p>What makes Failing Grayling even more of a collector\u2019s item is that he hasn\u2019t just wasted \u00a33bn on one bad call. It wasn\u2019t just a rush of blood to bet the house on a no-deal Brexit. Rather he has worked assiduously to squander the money at regular intervals over a prolonged period: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/18/virgin-trains-east-coast-franchise-passengers\">\u00a32bn on the Virgin Trains East Coast franchise in 2018</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/22/part-privatisation-of-probation-sector-is-a-mess-mps-say\">\u00a3437m on a botched privatisation of the probation service in 2014</a>.</p> <p>Nor does he neglect to sweat the small stuff, pissing away \u00a372,000 on a failed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/05/prison-book-ban-unlawful-court-chris-grayling\">legal challenge to his plans to stop prisoners reading books</a>. Say what you like, Chris is a details man. A man who understands his job perfectly. To make all those around him look slightly less half-witted.</p> <p>But it\u2019s been Brexit that has brought out the best of Failing Grayling\u2019s incompetence. First he couldn\u2019t even managed to engineer a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/07/no-deal-brexit-rehearsal-tests-traffic-congestion-in-kent\">fake traffic jam on a Kent</a> airfield to prove his department wasn\u2019t ready for a no-deal Brexit and then he had to make an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/06/eurotunnel-payout-government-brexit-chris-grayling\">out-of-court settlement to Eurotunnel</a> for forgetting to put contracts out to tender in the appropriate manner.</p> <p>Yet all this paled into insignificance over his decision to offer a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/30/no-deal-brexit-ferry-company-owns-no-ships-and-has-never-run-ferry-service\">\u00a313m contract to a ferry company that didn\u2019t have any ferries</a> for services to ports that had no facilities to receive them. That was Inspector Clouseau levels of genius. An act of extreme stupidity to which no other minister would dare dream.</p> <p>All these past triumphs appeared to weigh heavily on Grayling\u2019s mind as he took his seat in the chamber. After a quick glower at all those around him, he slumped back, his mind focused on the eternity of imminent retirement. He rose briefly to reassure Conservative Geoffrey Clifton-Brown that all was on track with the improvements to the A417 in his constituency but then lapsed back into silence. As did Clifton-Brown. A promise from the transport secretary almost certainly meant nothing would be happening to the A417 in the near future.</p> <p>So it was left to junior transport minister Michael Ellis to defend his boss\u2019s honour. Shadow junior transport minister Karl Turner enquired whether Grayling might like to use his last outing at the dispatch box to apologise for having wasted so much money and whether there were any other crimes he would like taken into consideration. Ellis shook his head. His client would be pleading the fifth amendment.</p> <p>Lilian Greenwood, chair of the transport select committee, and Andy McDonald, shadow transport secretary, pressed a little further. It had long been clear Grayling had given up any pretence of running the railways and only the previous day he had said that he didn\u2019t do buses either. So what exactly did he do? Grayling\u2019s familiar cheek-twitch, that had hitherto been kept under control, began to pulse uncontrollably. The minister\u2019s track record spoke for itself, Ellis replied gravely. Under the circumstances not the most tactful defence.</p> <p>It was more than 50 minutes into the hour-long session that anyone thought to bring up Brexit. Not because no one cares about it any more, but because there\u2019s no point. The transport secretary knows even less about the practicalities of leaving the EU than Boris Johnson. Which is quite some achievement.</p> <p>Eventually, though, Labour\u2019s Clive Betts did mention that Rotterdam had brought in 100 extra vets to cope with a no-deal Brexit and wondered what measures the department was taking to to offset the costs and delays of leaving the EU without a deal.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving, <em>twitch,</em> with a, <em>twitch,</em> deal, <em>twitch</em>,\u201d Failing garbled. So everything, <em>twitch,</em> would be, <em>twitch,</em> OK. These were almost the last words he uttered as a minister. So it was entirely fitting that, like so many of his other pronouncements, they had been at best misconceived and at worst entirely inaccurate. Not even his loyalty could save him now.</p> <p>He left the Commons hastily, unnoticed and unmissed, before getting into his ministerial car for a last-chance powerdrive. To wind down the windows, feel the sun on his face and get the chauffeur to burn rubber round Parliament Square. In the distance, the bells of Westminster Abbey pealed. The requiem for a dunce. A man who had bizarrely managed to over-achieve and underachieve at the same time. He will be missed by me. If by no one else.</p>",

That means we could have paid him \u00a31bn to stay at home, doing nothing but watch TV and mowing the lawn, and still have been \u00a32bn better off. Just by diligently turning up to work each day, Grayling has prevented two hospitals from being built. What makes Failing Grayling even more of a collector\u2019s item is that he hasn\u2019t just wasted \u00a33bn on one bad call. It wasn\u2019t just a rush of blood to bet the house on a no-deal Brexit. Rather he has worked assiduously to squander the money at regular intervals over a prolonged period: \u00a32bn on the Virgin Trains East Coast franchise in 2018, \u00a3437m on a botched privatisation of the probation service in 2014. Nor does he neglect to sweat the small stuff, pissing away \u00a372,000 on a failed legal challenge to his plans to stop prisoners reading books. Say what you like, Chris is a details man. A man who understands his job perfectly. To make all those around him look slightly less half-witted. But it\u2019s been Brexit that has brought out the best of Failing Grayling\u2019s incompetence. First he couldn\u2019t even managed to engineer a fake traffic jam on a Kent airfield to prove his department wasn\u2019t ready for a no-deal Brexit and then he had to make an out-of-court settlement to Eurotunnel for forgetting to put contracts out to tender in the appropriate manner. Yet all this paled into insignificance over his decision to offer a \u00a313m contract to a ferry company that didn\u2019t have any ferries for services to ports that had no facilities to receive them. That was Inspector Clouseau levels of genius. An act of extreme stupidity to which no other minister would dare dream. All these past triumphs appeared to weigh heavily on Grayling\u2019s mind as he took his seat in the chamber. After a quick glower at all those around him, he slumped back, his mind focused on the eternity of imminent retirement. He rose briefly to reassure Conservative Geoffrey Clifton-Brown that all was on track with the improvements to the A417 in his constituency but then lapsed back into silence. As did Clifton-Brown. A promise from the transport secretary almost certainly meant nothing would be happening to the A417 in the near future. So it was left to junior transport minister Michael Ellis to defend his boss\u2019s honour. Shadow junior transport minister Karl Turner enquired whether Grayling might like to use his last outing at the dispatch box to apologise for having wasted so much money and whether there were any other crimes he would like taken into consideration. Ellis shook his head. His client would be pleading the fifth amendment. Lilian Greenwood, chair of the transport select committee, and Andy McDonald, shadow transport secretary, pressed a little further. It had long been clear Grayling had given up any pretence of running the railways and only the previous day he had said that he didn\u2019t do buses either. So what exactly did he do? Grayling\u2019s familiar cheek-twitch, that had hitherto been kept under control, began to pulse uncontrollably. The minister\u2019s track record spoke for itself, Ellis replied gravely. Under the circumstances not the most tactful defence. It was more than 50 minutes into the hour-long session that anyone thought to bring up Brexit. Not because no one cares about it any more, but because there\u2019s no point. The transport secretary knows even less about the practicalities of leaving the EU than Boris Johnson. Which is quite some achievement. Eventually, though, Labour\u2019s Clive Betts did mention that Rotterdam had brought in 100 extra vets to cope with a no-deal Brexit and wondered what measures the department was taking to to offset the costs and delays of leaving the EU without a deal. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving, twitch, with a, twitch, deal, twitch,\u201d Failing garbled. So everything, twitch, would be, twitch, OK. These were almost the last words he uttered as a minister. So it was entirely fitting that, like so many of his other pronouncements, they had been at best misconceived and at worst entirely inaccurate. Not even his loyalty could save him now. He left the Commons hastily, unnoticed and unmissed, before getting into his ministerial car for a last-chance powerdrive. To wind down the windows, feel the sun on his face and get the chauffeur to burn rubber round Parliament Square. In the distance, the bells of Westminster Abbey pealed. The requiem for a dunce. A man who had bizarrely managed to over-achieve and underachieve at the same time. He will be missed by me. If by no one else.",

We have a good withdrawal agreement,\u201d she said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian and four other European newspapers.</p> \n<p>Both of the contenders to succeed May, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, have vowed to renegotiate the exit deal with the EU, declaring that the most controversial component, the Northern Ireland backstop, is unacceptable.</p> \n<p>When asked about their position, Von der Leyen said the withdrawal agreement was \u201cnot dead\u201d. She said: \u201cNo, it is a good agreement, which was negotiated properly in accordance with the red lines drawn by the British government.\u201d</p> \n<p>She reiterated her view that the EU should consider extending the current Brexit deadline of 31 October if there were \u201cgood reasons\u201d to do so. \u201cA Brexit without a deal comes with massively negative consequences for both sides, not to mention what it means for Ireland. That\u2019s why we need to do everything to strive for an orderly Brexit. And that\u2019s why if there are good reasons for an extension coming from our British friends, I am open to listening to them.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cIt would be wrong to see Brexit only as the end of something. The way in which we carry out Brexit will determine our future relationship to our neighbour the United Kingdom. For both sides it is of the highest interest that there is an orderly and good beginning to our future relationships.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a wide-ranging interview conducted inside the defence ministry in Berlin that she presided over for six years, Von der Leyen told the Europa group of newspapers that the EU would show solidarity with member states hardest hit by a disorderly British exit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"72d32c84-3366-46a3-ab07-bd96ba63d4e2\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In 2012, six major European newspapers came together to launch joint editorial projects to dig deeper into pan-European issues, understand the EU better and investigative the good and bad things emerging from the continent. <br></p>\n    <p>Since then, we have jointly investigated the environment, youth unemployment, Brexit, immigration, euroscepticism, the eurozone the Brussels bureaucracy - and even the legacies of the first world war. <br></p>\n    <p>We have interviewed prime ministers and presidents, as well as a host of EU leaders, and will continue our efforts long after Britain has left the EU.</p>\n    <p>The six papers are The Guardian, Le Monde, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, La Vanguardia, La Stampa and Gazeta Wyborcza</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>She said a European unemployment benefit reinsurance scheme, modelled on measures put in place in Germany to cushion the blow of the world financial downturn a decade ago, could be rolled out across the bloc of 27 nations.</p> \n<p>In 2008 the German government prevented massive job cuts through a state-subsidised programme to finance reduced working hours. \u201cWe can apply this idea to the whole of Europe,\u201d said Von der Leyen. \u201cShould an external shock such as a disorderly Brexit hit two or three countries particularly hard, for example, the unemployment reinsurance scheme could come into force.\u201d</p> \n<p>One <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/09/irish-ministers-meet-to-discuss-dire-outcomes-of-no-deal-brexit\">recent report</a> said a no-deal Brexit could do massive harm, especially to the economy in Ireland where it could cost \u00a36bn and lead to an estimated increase in unemployment of 50,000 to 55,000.</p> \n<p>Asked whether Ireland could be one of the countries to benefit from such emergency help in the case of a no-deal Brexit, Von der Leyen said: \u201cI can\u2019t predict that. But it is right for Europe to help the member states who are hit hardest.\u201d</p> \n<p>A mother of seven who has held ministerial posts under the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, since 2005, Von der Leyen became the commission\u2019s first female president-elect on Tuesday, winning a vote in the European parliament with the support of 383 MEPs, only nine votes more than required to secure an absolute majority. Critics say the vote has left her at the mercy of nationalists and populists in Poland and Italy who supported her candidacy.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe work is only about to begin,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my debates with the political groups and national delegations I came across a lot of openness for constructive collaboration, also from the Green parties. Climate change, digitalisation, the economy, Brexit, security, trade, migration \u2013 we have work to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>In an effort to win votes from Green MEPs, Von der Leyen pledged to make fighting the climate crisis a priority under her presidency. Some have speculated that her ambitious promises on emissions targets may have led some members of the conservative EPP bloc to reject her in Tuesday\u2019s secret ballot. She proposed reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% on 1990 levels by 2030.<strong> </strong>The current target is 40%.</p> \n<p>Von der Leyen, a Christian Democrat, said she believed action on climate to be of the utmost urgency. \u201cThe worst-case scenario will come about if we don\u2019t act with determination, namely rapidly intensifying climate change with all its consequences. The clock is ticking, and we have to act.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cPolluting the environment has to come at a price, which will bring about a change in our behaviour and a lowering of CO2 emissions. If you compare it to the rest of the world, then our industry is already doing well at climate-friendly technology, but we have to get better.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut if industry modernises, we also have to protect it from cheap imports produced in environmentally harmful ways outside Europe\u2019s borders. In coal-heavy regions, especially in central and eastern Europe, we have to support the transition to new clean branches of the economy and protect jobs.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8f488fd5-49a1-48a2-96f2-0edc9ffce51e\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ursula von der Leyen, born in 1958, is the daughter of Heidi and Ernst Albrecht, the latter having been a senior politician in the centre-right Christian Democratic Union who rose to be governor of the state of Lower Saxony.</p>\n    <p>She spent the first 12 years of her life in Brussels, where her father was serving as a commission official. She studied economics at the universities of G\u00f6ttingen and M\u00fcnster before attending the London School of Economics where she used the pseudonym Rose Ladson because she was seen as a potential target for West German leftwing extremists.</p>\n    <p>Von der Leyen then read for a medical degree, becoming a gynaecologist, and only entered politics at 42. A mother of seven, she has held government positions as labour and family affairs minister, driving forward key policies on gender quotas for company boards and improved maternity and paternity pay and rights \u2013 policies that initially won her considerable popularity.</p>\n    <p>In 2011, Von der Leyen spoke of her desire for a \u201cUnited States of Europe along the lines of federal states like Switzerland,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a>&nbsp;or the US\u201d. She has since claimed that Brexit, and the loss of the \u201cpragmatism\u201d of the British in the EU, should propel the bloc towards further integration, and has voiced support for a European army.</p>\n    <p>She is a key ally of Angela Merkel, with whom she has worked since 2005. Like Merkel, she has championed the idea of a close relationship between the EU and UK after Brexit.<br></p>\n    <p>Von der Leyen, though, has been withering about those who campaigned for Brexit, Describing events since the referendum as a \u201cburst bubble of hollow promises \u2026 inflated by populists\u201d. She has cautioned that a no-deal Brexit would be the \u201cworst possible start\u201d to the close long-term EU-UK relationship that Berlin holds desirable.</p>\n    <p>The nicknames she has acquired over the course of her 29-year career in German politics tell their own story. During her time in charge of the family ministry, she was first called&nbsp;<em>Krippen-Ursel</em>&nbsp;(\u201ccr\u00e8che Ursel\u201d), a conservative closet feminist set on expanding nursery places, and then&nbsp;<em>Zensursula</em>, a control freak who wanted to shield German youth from the dark sides of the internet.</p>\n    <p>When she became Germany\u2019s first female defence minister in 2013, her (mostly male) detractors referred to her as&nbsp;<em>Flinten-Uschi&nbsp;</em>(\u201cshotgun Uschi\u201d), a caricature of the bossy career woman.</p>\n    <p>As commission president, Von der Leyen will represent the EU on the world stage, and a key task will be building a working relationship with Donald Trump\u2019s White House. She has previously criticised a lack of strategy in Trump\u2019s approach to Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and has suggested the US president\u2019s frosty relationship with Merkel is based on his outdated view of women.</p>\n    <p><b>Daniel Boffey</b> <i>in Brussels </i>and <b>Philip Oltermann </b><i>in Berlin</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>She indicated a more nuanced approach towards states such as Poland and Hungary, which have been brazenly challenging the EU consensus on issues such as migration, the rule of law and press freedom.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think we have to properly listen to the arguments. For example, the Poles make the justified point that they have taken in 1.5 million people from the Ukraine \u2013 a country that has for years been the site of a hybrid war in which people are still dying. We must not ignore that.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlso, the member states who want to go ahead [with a refugee distribution scheme] are already in the process of finding solutions. But it remains the case that in different areas every member state needs the solidarity of the others.

      "bodyText": "Civil servants working for the Department for Exiting the European Union have been awarded nearly \u00a31.3m in bonuses, new figures show. DExEU disclosed on Thursday that it had paid out \u00a3350,000 in bonuses in the year after the referendum. This is in addition to the revelation last month that it had paid out \u00a31m in performance-related awards for April 2017 to March 2018. It made the late disclosure on its first-year bonuses on Thursday in a bid for full transparency, it said. The department paid \u00a3343,650 to delegated graded civil servants, in amounts ranging from \u00a3700 to \u00a32,500, for the year 2016 to 2017. In its annual report for 2018-19 also published on Thursday, it revealed that the highest-paid official was the recently retired permanent secretary, Philip Rycroft, who earned between \u00a3225,000 and \u00a3230,000 including benefits in kind of \u00a317,900 and a pension of \u00a346,000. His benefits in kind included travel costs between home and work. About 16,000 civil servants have been working on Brexit at an estimated cost of \u00a31.5bn to date. While no-deal planning has continued across Whitehall, some staff working on emergency Operation Yellowhammer duties were stood down in April by the Cabinet Office when article 50 was extended until Halloween, after an estimated \u00a31.5bn had been spent including on recruits from the private sector. Now departments are expected to be ordered to ramp up no-deal planning immediately after the new prime minister, expected to be Boris Johnson, gets into No 10 next Wednesday. It is not known who is going to be on his Brexit team but the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, is being tipped, as is the pro-Brexit trade consultant Shanker Singham as an adviser. He is the leading force at the privately funded Alternative Arrangements Commission, which has sought to find solutions to the Irish border question. It is understood he has not been approached but would be willing to work on a Johnson or Hunt team. It is thought all big Whitehall departments have made Brexit bonuses but virtually all have refused Guardian freedom of information requests for disclosure. So far the House of Commons is the only other department to disclose its payments. Last month, it revealed it had made \u00a3700,000 in extra payments involving a \u00a3250 bonus to all 2,800 Commons administration and parliamentary Digital Service staff in recognition of their hard work sitting additional days and working into the night. The departments that did respond to freedom of information requests include the Ministry of Defence, which said it paid 19 staff \u201ca reward\u201d or gave them a \u201cthank you\u201d voucher for their work on Brexit up to April 2019. In March, the armed forces mobilised a special team in a 24-hour cover in a nuclear-proof bunker under their headquarters as part of the military\u2019s crisis management operation, dubbed Operation Redfold. They were due to direct 3,500 military personnel on standby if required in the case of chaos on the streets, which could have included congestion on the roads to Dover, disruption to medical supplies and aviation. The MoD said it had paid out a total of \u00a38,250: the highest award was \u00a32,000 and the smallest \u00a3100. The Food Standards Agency paid out almost \u00a330,000 to 64 staff in bonuses ranging from \u00a3250 per person to \u00a31,000, while the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency paid seven staff between \u00a3500 and \u00a3800 in a Brexit bonus. It is responsible for the safety of medicines and medical devices, many of which come from the EU. While virtually all the big departments refused to disclose Brexit bonus data, some did reveal what they had spent on Brexit so far. DExEU spent \u00a3101.6m in the year 2017-18. Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs spent \u00a3308m on Brexit: \u00a347m in 2017-18 and \u00a3261m for the financial year 2018-19. The Home Office, which was responsible for developing the settled status scheme for EU citizens, spent \u00a370m in the year 2017-18. The Ministry of Justice revealed it had spent \u00a39.7m on Brexit-related work in 2018-19. The Cabinet Office, the Environment Agency, and the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland said they did not award bonuses. The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council revealed that the International Crime Coordination Centre, which was set up to provide continuity for UK law enforcement following Brexit, said it spent \u00a318,000 in 2017-18 and \u00a31.75m in the year 2018-19.",

As someone who has watched every episode of the seminal 1980s holiday camp sitcom, it is a pleasure to see old castmates back together like this. Dear Su Pollard, who played hapless chambermaid Peggy Ollerenshaw, hasn\u2019t changed a bit. Indeed, to caption this photo, we may as well use a line from her amusingly exhaustive character biography on <a href=\"https://holidayrockhidehi.fandom.com/wiki/Holiday_Rock_-_The_Hi-De-Hi_Wiki\" title=\"\">Holiday Rock</a>, the Hi-de-Hi! fansite: \u201cPeggy had a rather vivid imagination and was often easily taken in by others\u2019 lies, particularly Ted\u2019s ridiculous tales when he needed a cover story.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"793067f010dc277ea9bc4a007f78f959106f3022\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/793067f010dc277ea9bc4a007f78f959106f3022/0_0_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Su Pollard, Arron Banks and Andrew Rosindell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Happy campers \u2026 Su Pollard, Arron Banks and Andrew Rosindell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @Arron_banks/Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Oh my dear me \u2026 I\u2019m so sorry. You must forgive me. Having looked a little closer, I can see that the roly-poly funnyman in the centre of the shot is not actually check-suited Maplins comedian Ted Bovis (played by Paul Shane). I had wondered, given that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/may/17/paul-shane\" title=\"\">he died in 2013</a>. Instead, it seems to be self-styled Brexit bad boy Arron Banks, who started out in an act called Mississippi Minstrels. Hang on: that was Ted. My apologies again: the character biographies section of Holiday Rock is rather difficult to tear yourself away from, once you become fully enmeshed in its bygone charms. Still, whatever Mississippi Minstrels may have been, I\u2019m sure it would make a popular skit for Arron to get up for his sort-of friend Donald Trump\u2019s next birthday party at the president\u2019s Floridian resort, Mar-a-Lago. Or Racist Xanadu, as I prefer to think of it.</p> <p>Where were we? Ah yes. To further clarify, the gentleman on Banks\u2019s left is not Ted\u2019s comedy sidekick Spike Dixon, described by Holiday Rock as \u201can incredibly honest and law-abiding man, and the only member of the entertainment staff who didn\u2019t run his own scheme to scam the campers for money\u201d. It is, in fact, Conservative MP for Romford, Andrew Rosindell, a longtime friend of Su. What can I tell you about Andrew? The MPs expenses investigation revealed he had claimed \u00a3125,000 in second home expenses for a flat in London, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5582209/MPs-expenses-Tory-MP-Andrew-Rosindell-has-childhood-home-as-main-address.html\" title=\"\">with his primary residence apparently being his childhood home</a>, 17 miles away, where his mother still lived.</p> <p>There have been various other disappointments, including <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/after-the-fiddles-come-the-freebies-1693494.html\" title=\"\">the Independent\u2019s revelation</a> that he had accepted \u00a325,000-worth of trips to the Cayman Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Switzerland, Taiwan and Uzbekistan. Andrew, of course, insisted he could justify every trip, and, anyway, part of that \u00a325,000 was a five-grand Virgin Atlantic upgrade. These days, he believes maroon EU passports have been \u201ca national humiliation\u201d. So don\u2019t ruin what\u2019s coming next with any spoilers for him.</p> <p>Mr Rosindell\u2019s other credits include always being described as a \u201cmaverick\u201d entirely by people who have never met one. He memorably once canvassed with his Staffordshire bull terrier, with the dog wearing a union jack waistcoat. As I say, this is eccentricity only for people who have never met anyone remotely intriguing or unusual, and who \u2013 if they did \u2013 would hang them for being probably foreign or gay.</p> <p>As for the nature of the soiree featuring Andrew, Su and Arron, it seems to have been a Tory fundraiser/Caribbean event, at which Su featured alongside erstwhile \u2019Allo \u2019Allo! waitress, Vicki Michelle. Forgotten Celebrity Conservative Patti Boulaye was also in attendance, and there was also a speech by Jeremy Hunt. Yup, I know what you\u2019re thinking: there literally isn\u2019t enough heroin in London to get me through that. Or, as Banks judged: \u201cIt was a great evening. Andrew Rosindell is a patriotic Tory MP and a model one at that.\u201d Slightly selective swamp-draining there, given the expenses unpleasantness, but at this stage in our descent down the rabbit hole, we hardly expect coherence or consistency from our bad boys. Arron concluded: \u201cGreat evening with people from all of the world.\u201d</p> <p>Regarding the evening\u2019s major star \u2013 Su, obviously \u2013 this episode is chiefly welcomed for drawing my attention to a frankly majestic Mail on Sunday report, which I somehow seem to have missed back in January of this year. The <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6585705/Hi-di-hi-di-Theresa-Sitcom-star-Su-Pollard-causes-havoc-Number-10-berates-PM.html\" title=\"\">headline alone</a> is an indication of the veritable treasure trove therein. So here we go: \u201cHi-de-Hi!, Theresa! Sitcom star Su Pollard causes havoc at Number 10 as she wolf-whistles and berates PM and demands that she speeds up Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>Well now. We lay our scene at some Downing Street drinks reception in early January, intended to bring warring Tory MPs together. For reasons that may for ever remain opaque, Mr Rosindell seems to have bought along Ms Pollard. We will let the Mail on Sunday report take over for a bit: \u201cThe 69-year-old comedy actress left No 10 aides speechless after putting two fingers in her mouth for her signature comedy whistle to get the prime minister\u2019s attention at a reception held for Tory MPs and their spouses on Wednesday evening.\u201d Go on. \u201cMs Pollard, who shot to fame as holiday camp cleaner Peggy Ollerenshaw in the BBC series Hi-de-Hi! was a guest of maverick Essex MP Andrew Rosindell.\u201d Ah yes. There it is.</p> <p>Anyway, how did the prime minister react to this, one of the many indignities visited upon her per week in 2019, only 90% of which were of her own making? \u201cBreaking off a conversation with energy minister Claire Perry,\u201d we learn, \u201cMrs May said: \u2018Hello there, Su.\u2019 The actress and singer shouted back: \u2018Hi-de-hi!, Theresa!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Yup, well, that\u2019s why you\u2019re on the guestlist, Su. And at one level, fair play to her. There is a nice line in the first Bridget Jones movie where Bridget is describing her friend Tom. \u201cTom, 80s pop icon who only wrote one hit record then retired because he found that one record was quite enough to get him laid for the whole of the 90s.\u201d And so with Su, who played Peggy in Hi-de-Hi! in the 80s, and found that was quite enough to get her invited to several envelope openings a week for the 90s, the 00s, the 2010s, and will doubtless see her right for most of the 2020s, too.</p> <p>As for how the May-Pollard bilateral proceeded from there, a fellow guest tells the paper: \u201cThe prime minister is not great at the small talk at the best of times, so it looked pretty painful. Su just kept saying: \u2018We want Brexit\u2019 and, \u2018What\u2019s happening with Brexit, why is it taking so long?\u2019 and, \u2018We want Brexit now.\u2019\u201d Yet worse was to come. Not only was Downing Street approached by the Mail on Sunday for a quote on the prime minister\u2019s lively discussion with Su, but it actually obliged, describing May as \u201ca huge fan\u201d of Ms Pollard\u2019s work.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure we\u2019re all fans of a highfalutin reference to someone\u2019s \u201cwork\u201d, calling to mind as it does the literary oeuvre of a Jane Austen or the canvas stylings of a Jackson Pollock, as opposed to someone whose Wikipedia entry for the past couple of decades is best summarised in the line: \u201cIn pantomime, Su appears mainly as the Wicked Queen in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, appearing in recent years at Sunderland, Blackpool, Tunbridge Wells, Aylesbury and Malvern.\u201d</p> <p>Still, if one version of Brexit is about restoring Britain to the comforting and largely imagined certainties of yesteryear, could panto or even sitcom bookers do much better than the glittering lineup featured in this picture? Then again, perhaps the production to harness Su, Arron and Andrew\u2019s collective gifts has already been found, and we shall spend the next few years watching the show play out.</p>",

Following the calls with Trump and Hicks, Cohen embarked on a flurry of calls and texts with executives at American Media, the publisher of the National Enquirer, which later admitted helping Trump cover up hush-money payments. Numerous additional text messages, calls and frantic discussions between Cohen and others about the payoff to Daniels were detailed in the filings. Cohen \u201cspoke to Trump for approximately five minutes\u201d on 28 October, the day the payment was finalised, according to the FBI.

There was nothing,\u201d she said, accusing Rossell\u00f3 of failing the US territory during beleaguered recovery efforts led by the Trump administration. \u201cHe was a puppet of the president,\u201d she said. Just days before the text message scandal, referred to locally as RickyLeaks, the FBI arrested a number of administration officials and contractors, including Rossell\u00f3\u2019s former education secretary, over allegations of corruption and misappropriation of $15.5m (\u00a312.5m) in federal funds apportioned to Puerto Rico after Maria. The island, an unincorporated US territory, is also in the midst of a multibillion-dollar debt crisis now managed, along with much of the island\u2019s economic affairs, by an unelected oversight board appointed in Washington. Further austerity and privatisation measures were imposed after Hurricane Maria hit the island. As protesters marched along the cobbled streets of San Juan\u2019s historic district towards the governor\u2019s mansion, many held signs with the number 4,645, the estimated death toll in the wake of Maria, according to a Harvard University research paper. Rossell\u00f3\u2019s administration had for months sought to downplay the number of deaths tied to Maria until the number was revised last year. As night fell on Wednesday, thousands lined the streets outside the governor\u2019s mansion, with police dressed in riot gear initially taking a lenient approach to protesters. The crowds danced to drumbeats and chanted in Spanish: \u201cThere\u2019s more of us and we are not afraid.\u201d But as the numbers continued to grow in the sweltering heat some protesters broke through the barricades, leading to initial skirmishes with officers who used riot shields to beat back the crowd. Shortly before midnight protesters began letting off fireworks, with video suggesting some were aimed at police. Officers responded almost instantly with rounds of teargas and rubber bullets, sending thousands of protesters running back down the crammed streets. Hundreds continued to clash with police throwing rocks and lighting fires in a nearby plaza as officers fired numerous rounds of teargas into the crowd. By about 2am police appeared to have regained control of the streets, but the significant escalation in violence during one of the largest protests in Puerto Rico\u2019s history will undoubtedly place more pressure on the governor to consider resignation. At a news conference in the early hours of Thursday morning the police commissioner, Henry Escalera, told local news that his officers had been attacked with screwdrivers, and bottles with a \u201cliquid that caused a reaction\u201d. Sister demonstrations took place in cities across the US, including New York, Orlando and Miami, all with sizable Puerto Rican populations.",

      "bodyText": "Russian film director Alexander Sokurov has shut down his film foundation citing hostility from Russia\u2019s ministry of culture. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax (via the Hollywood Reporter), Sokurov said the ministry\u2019s \u201cunfriendliness and aggressiveness\u201d was behind his decision to close Primer Inotnatsii (Example of Intonation). Sokurov, who is best known for Russian Ark, a single-take film about the history of the Hermitage museum in St Petersburg, as well as his tetralogy of films about the corrupting effects of power, which includes Moloch and The Sun, established his foundation in 2013 with the intention to \u201csupport young authors, who are making their first steps in [the] film-making industry\u201d. Police previously opened an investigation into Primer Inotnatsii in December 2018 after allegations of embezzlement; the probe ended with a police statement that \u201cno wrongdoing was discovered\u201d. Another high-profile director, Kirill Serebrennikov, was placed under house arrest after accusations of embezzlement in 2017 (dismissed as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d by his supporters). His trial is still to take place after repeated delays. Sokurov has been a high-profile critic of the imprisonment of Ukrainian director Oleg Sentsov, who was convicted of plotting terrorist acts in 2015 and sentenced to 20 years in jail after a trial that was described by Amnesty International as \u201cfatally flawed\u201d and \u201credolent of Stalinist-era show trials\u201d. In 2018, Russian president Vladimir Putin rejected a request from Sokurov to intervene in Sentsov\u2019s case.",

      "bodyText": "Our man in Bagnere-de-Bigorre has all the latest on Simon Yates\u2019s first Tour de France stage win and the mysterious abandonment of Rohan Dennis. Yellow jersey: Julian Alaphilippe will wear the yellow jersey for his eighth day on this Tour tomorrow. He continues to lead Geraint Thomas by 1min 12sec. Egan Bernal is a further four seconds back. Jeremy Whittle: Pau, the city that hosts Friday\u2019s time trial has been on a doping ley line, a focal point for scandal, for almost two decades. Read on ... The yellow jersey group crosses the line: Having conserved their energy ahead of tomorrow\u2019s ITT, the main GC contenders have just rolled over the finish line. It\u2019s a mystery: Simon Yates\u2019s win aside, the big story of the day has yet to be told. Ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Individual Time Trial, the hot favourite for the stage, Rohan Dennis abandoned the race today and nobody seems to know why. The yellow jersey group: The GC contenders have another 3.6km to cover and there are unlikely to be any changes in the top 10, unless anyone crashes outside the 3km accident \u201cexclusion zone\u201d. Mitchelton Scott win their second stage of this Tour. Adding a Tour de France stage win to the stages he has previously won in the Giro and Vuelta, Simon Yates joins Darryl Impey in winning an instalment of this year\u2019s Tour. He out-sprinted Pello Bilbao and Gregor Muhlberger to win by a narrow margin. The British Mitchelton Scott rider launches his sprint going into the aforementioned corner and wins the sprint to the line. 300m to go: Three riders, a Tour de France stage up for grabs. 500km to go: Pello Bilbao leads, but the three riders are looking at each other, waiting for somebody to make a move. 1.3km to go: The leading trio keep working together as they approach the finish line. There\u2019s a tricky corner 200 metres from the line, where positioning going into it could be crucial. Do they know about it? One imagines their team directors will have told them over the radio. 3km to go: Our trio swing a right and there\u2019s a tight left to come. Yates leads them into it, before flicking his left elbow. Muhlberger takes over at the front. 4.5km to go: Simon Yates, Gregor Muhlberger and Pello Bilbao continue working well together. Muhlberger, a rider with Bora Hansgrohe, is looking for his first Grand Tour stage victory. 8km to go: Muhlberger, Bilbao and Yates have completed their descent and are back on the flat and have a lead of 1min 37sec over the Roche group. Unless our leading trio start playing silly buggers with each other, one of them will win the stage. 16km to go: Everyone is on the descent of the Hourquette D\u2019Ancizan. Muhlberger, Bilbao and Yates are 1min 14sec clear of the Nicolas Roche group. 18km to go: Mystifying, even ... 19km to go: And curiouser ... 21km to go: Rohan Dennis update. Eurosport say that Bahrain-Merida have not released a statement regarding the subject of the Australian\u2019s abandonment. He stepped off his bike at the feed zone and is now back at the finish line, where he has been spotted near his team bus. He has not, however, spoken to reporters. Curiouser and curiouser. 24km to go: On the descent of the final climb of the day, our trio of leaders are 1min 08sec clear of the Roche group that is chasing them. The yellow jersey group are 8min 02sec behind Messrs Yates, Bilbao and Muhlberger. 28km to go: The yellow jersey is, in turn, 7min 37sec behind the leaders. I need to pull into the roadside to water the shrubbery - back in five. 30km to go: Yates leads Muhlberger over the top, the pair closely followed by Pello Bilbao. Roche, Trentin, Frank, Schachmann, Gallopin and Pauwels are a minute behind them. 31km to go: Muhlberger and Yates are less than half a kilometre from the summit of Hourquette D\u2019Ancizan. Pello Bilbao is struggling to stay in touch. 32km to go: Gregor Muhlberger (Bora-Hansgrohe) and Simon Yates (Mitchelton Scott) have taken over in the lead. Astana rider Pello Bilbao is just behind them. Well, not quite. A naked man is just behind them, running along the roadside, then Pello Bilbao. The gap to the yellow jersey group is 6min 45sec. 35.5km: Simon Clarke continues his ascent, but has just been caught by Matteo Trentin. They have 4.5km of the climb to go and then it\u2019s all downhill to the finish. Nicolas Roche, Matias Frank, Gregor Muhlberger, Tony Gallopin and Simon Yates are just 15 seconds behind. 36km to go: There\u2019s a crash at the back of the peloton, but it\u2019s nothing too serious. An AG2R rider - I know not who, but can confirm it isn\u2019t Romain Bardet \u2013 needs a new bike. 37km to go: Simon Yates, Nicolas Roche, Mathias Frank and Gregor Muhlberger have broken away from what used to be the breakaway and are in hot pursuit of Matteo Trentin, who is in hot pursuit of Simon Clarke, who leads the stage. Confused? You should be. Meanwhile back at the peloton, Vincenzo Nibali, who is suffering from intestinal issues, has been dropped. 38km to go: It\u2019s onwards and upwards for Simon Clarke, who is 44 seconds ahead of Matteo Trentin. Back in the yellow jersey group, Team Ineos are lined up at the front, dictating the pace in their inimitable and slightly depressing way. 39.5km to go: Clarke continues his ascent, while Matteo Trentin has attacked off the front of the breakaway. 42km to go: Birthday boy Simon Clarke, who will be blowing out 33 candles later, if he can find the energy, is out in front. He\u2019s 1min 23sec clear of the Wellens group and all of 6min 09sec clear of the yellow jersey group. The man in the pink and blue EF Education First jersey is about to begin his ascent of Hourquette D\u2019Ancizen. It\u2019s 10 kilometres long, 1,564m high and has a gradient of 7.5%. An email: \u201cThe Tour passing through Luchon today brought back memories of a few of us staying there for some riding back in 2014,\u201d writes Simon Williams. \u201cStayed at a place called Villa Portillon \u2013 wonderful place, which I\u2019d highly recommend. The owner was a proper character called Mike Jones. Hails from Peterborough and is on the town/city Council (or at least he was back then). Regaled stories of riding in Prudi\u2019s car, sorting the sandbags when there were floods and didn\u2019t think highly of the extended French lunch break. One of life\u2019s great alpha males. Don\u2019t think he spoke a word of French.\u201d 49km to go: Simon Clarke continues his descent of the Peyresourde, having opened a gap of almost a minute on the Wellens group behind him. 63km to go: In the polka dot jersey, Tim Wellens comes with a perfectly timed run to crest the summit of the Peyrosourde and take maximum King of the Mountains points. There\u2019s a terrifying 13-kilometre descent ahead of him now. EF Education First rider Simon Clarke is tearing down at an incredible speed. 63km to go: Calmejane is 19 seconds clear of the breakaway he was once part of and 6min 28sec of the yellow jersey peloton. 64km to go: The state of play less than two minutes ago. Name that breakaway: \u201cInitially predicted to be the world\u2019s most successful law firm after a spectacular mega merger, Sagan, M\u00fchlberger, Oss, Schachmann, Morkov. Naesen, Gallopin, Fr\u00e4nk, Colbrelli, Garc\u00eda Cortina, Teuns, Erviti, Bilbao, Groenewegen, Teunissen, Bettiol, Clarke, Scully, Trentin, Yates, Avermaet, Pauwels, Rui Costa, Kristoff, Felline, Stuyven, Matthews, Arndt, Bol, Roche, P\u00e9richon, Simon, Benoot, Kluge, Wellens, Calmejane, Pasqualon, Boasson Hagen, Valgren, and L\u00e9danois unexpectedly failed after they were unable to fit any actual legal advice under the gigantic masthead,\u201d writes Paul Griffin. \u201cAn eleventh-hour rescue attempt involving an ampersand was not enough.\u201d 69km to go: Calmejane is about halfway up the Col de Peyresourde, the summit of which is 1,569m above sea level. Meanwhile back in the peloton, a backroom staff member from some team or other has just been knocked down by \u2013 I think \u2013 Greg Van Avermaet. That or he was trying to hand a bidon to Van Avermaet and got knocked down by somebody else. He went down quite hard and looked to have hit his head on the road, but hopefully he is OK. That was a masterclass in how not to hand over a bidon from the roadside, which makes me suspect he may be an inexperienced volunteer rather than a full-time staff member. If he\u2019d stood still, the rider who hit him could have gone around him, but instead he tried to dash back to to the side of the road after the handover. 70km to go: Lilian Calmejane has pulled clear of Sonny Colbrelli, who sounds more like a fictional Mafia hitman than a cyclist. The gap from Calmejane to the peloton is 6min 14sec. An email: \u201cWe live 180 miles from the \u2018best bike shop in the world\u2019 but were happy to contribute towards its recent enforced relocation,\u201d writes Steve Rowley of Brixton Cycles. |Local bike shops keep the wheels turning, get yourself there!\u201d I\u2019m not so sure local bike shops do keep the wheels turning, Steve. They certainly don\u2019t keep my wheels turning. I\u2019ll bring my bike down there in the next few days and tell them: \u201cHello, I bought this here almost four years ago to the day and have finally decided to start riding it. Lots of people I don\u2019t know have told me the gears need \u2018indexing\u2019.\u201d Name that breakaway: \u201cThe Muhlberger Collective are a critically-acclaimed ballet troupe based in Luxembourg whose avant-garde interpretations of 19th and 20th century classical pieces earned them fame and notoriety across Europe,\u201d writes Thomas Atkins. \u201cThey faced accusations of selling out from some quarters when they opened the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury in 2016.\u201d A nod there, to Bora-Hansgrohe\u2019s Austrian rider Gregor Muhlberger, who would have to be considered among the favourites for today\u2019s stage. 74km to go: Sonny Colbrelli, Alexander Kristoff and Lilian Calmejane are at the front of the race, 25 seconds clear of their former travelling companions in the breakaway. Quite what sprinters Colbrelli and Kristoff are doing up there, I don\u2019t really know. Meanwhile on Eurosport, commentator Carlton Kirby says that mystery surrounds the abandonment of Rohan Dennis and no reason has yet been given for the Australian\u2019s decision to quit. 75km to go: Sonny Colbrelli has kept going Forrest Gump style following the intermediate sprint and has put some time between himself and most of the 40-man breakaway. He\u2019s currently leading the race up the climb to the category 1 Col de Peyresourde. Peter Sagan, meanwhile, has done his work for the day and has dropped out the back of The Sagan Agreement, which Nick Honeywell points out, sounds more like the title of a Robert Ludlum novel than a breakaway. Abandonment: Bahrain-Merida rider Rohan Dennis has quit the race. The world time trial champion steps off his bike ahead of tomorrow\u2019s ITT, for which he was favourite. Intermediate sprint: Peter Sagan takes maximum points, increasing his lead in the Green Jersey standings. He\u2019s followed over the line by Sonny Colbrelli. Name that breakaway: \u201cThe Sagan Agreement,\u201d writes Tim Smith. I like that one. An email: \u201cLet me be the first (one) of 458 pedants to tell you that you shouldn\u2019t put your bike upside down for maintenance,\u201d writes Daniel Ro\u00dfbach. Fair enough Daniel, although I would argue that simply peering at and gently poking a derailleur does not exactly qualify as \u201cmaintenance\u201d. Abandonment: Having taken a heavy fall yesterday, Team Dimension Data rider Giacomo Nizzolo has been struggling at the back all day today. He has finally decided enough is enough, summoned his team car, stepped off his bike and removed his race number. Following the controversial decision to drop Mark Cavendish from this year\u2019s Tour line-up, the Dimension Data sprinter who was called up to replace him has been forced out of the race through injury. 89.5km to go: \u201cDon\u2019t you think the Tour would be more exciting if the riders didn\u2019t have radios?\u201d asks Alan Cooper. \u201cIt would force riders to think for themselves more, and the potential for confusion would make every stage more interesting. I\u2019m all for chaos in sports!\u201d I wouldn\u2019t disagree with that. 97km to go: Before the riders hit the intermediate sprint and subsequent big climbs, I\u2019m going to roll through the feed zone. Back in 10. An email: \u201cNow that the cycling has returned to its true procession form whilst you are live-reporting, is this an opportune time to give us an update on how your cycling exploits have gone since last week?\u201d asks John O\u2019G. It probably is, John. Having discovered last week that I probably need to get my gears \u201cindexed\u201d, I have gone into the spare room, turned the bike upside-down, peered intently at what I believe is known as the derailleur and poked at it a bit. Small steps, eh? One of the best bike shops in London - if not the world - is a 10-minute walk from my home, so once I get my own ass into gear, I\u2019ll take my machine down there and get it into gear. Everyone\u2019s a critic: \u201cMy new favourite expression is the clam before the storm,\u201d writes Lizz Poulter, referring to my entry at 117km to go. 110km to go: Bora Hansgrohe rider Daniel Oss is doing most of the donkey work at the front of the breakaway, with UAE Team Emirates rider UAE Team Emirates on his wheel. The gap is 4min 07sec. Today\u2019s intermediate sprint: Located 78.6 kilometres from the finish, Bagneres-de-Luchon is the venue for today\u2019s intermediate sprint. Interesting fact: he commune has been awarded three flowers by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom. At least that what Wikipedia says. 117km to go: Following today\u2019s seriously frenetic start, the race has settled and we\u2019re in the clam before today\u2019s inevitable storm. The gap from the 40-man breakaway to the peloton is 4min 14sec. Name that breakaway: \u201cI think Kevin Davey was mistakenly naming the 120 odd riders in the peloton as the Chelsea FC players out on loan, not the 40 in the breakaway,\u201d writes Paul Fox. Jasper Philipsen The Belgian rider did not sign on for today\u2019s stage and it has emerged that while he is not injured or ill, his UAE-Team Emirates overlords simply decided that doing half of the Tour was enough for the 21-year-old. He\u2019ll benefit from the experience, without having to bury himself as the race hits the mountains. Name that breakaway: \u201cThe Brexit Party MEPs?\u201d suggests John Cox. \u201cToo soon?| Name that breakaway: \u201cNot sure you\u2019re doing this with such an enormous group, but the breakaway is all of the Chelsea FC\u2019s players who are currently out on loan,\u201d writes Kevin Davey. 134km to go: Our 40 (forty) man-breakaway has opened a gap of 3min 12sec on the bunch, where all the main GC contenders are safely ensconced. They\u2019re being towed along by Julian Alaphilippe\u2019s Deuceuninck-Quick Step team, who are keeping the gap down. Perhaps the winner won\u2019t come from the breakaway after all ... 145km to go: Tim Wellens adds another point to his King of the Mountains collection as first man over the Category 4 Cote de Montoulieu-Saint-Bernard. WIth the race finally settled down, I\u2019m off to grab a coffee. Back in five or so. Correction: Dan Martin is not in the breakaway, as originally (and erroneously) stated. 151km to go: The gap is 3min 21sec and such is the quality of many of the riders in our breakaway that our stage winner is certain to come from it. Behind them, the GC contenders will be providing a fascinating \u201csecond\u201d race of the day when they hit the lumpy stuff. 152km to go: An official census has been taken and there are 40 men in today\u2019s breakaway. They are ... Peter Sagan, Gregor M\u00fchlberger, Daniel Oss and Max Schachmann (Bora-Hansgrohe), Michael Morkov (Deceuninck-Quick Step), Oliver Naesen, Tony Gallopin and Matthias Fr\u00e4nk (Ag2r La Mondiale), Sonny Colbrelli, Iv\u00e1n Garc\u00eda Cortina and Dylan Teuns (Bahrain-Merida), Imanol Erviti (Movistar Team), Pello Bilbao (Astana), Dylan Groenewegen and Mike Teunissen (Jumbo-Visma), Alberto Bettiol, Simon Clarke and Tom Scully (EF Education First), Matteo Trentin and Simon Yates (Mitchelton-Scott), Greg Van Avermaet and Serge Pauwels (CCC Team), Rui Costa and Alexander Kristoff (UAE Team Emirates), Fabio Felline and Jasper Stuyven (Trek-Segafredo), Michael Matthews, Nikias Arndt, Cees Bol and Nicolas Roche (Team Sunweb), Pierre-Luc P\u00e9richon and Julien Simon (Cofidis), Tiesj Benoot, Roger Kluge and Tim Wellens (Lotto-Soudal), Lilian Calmejane (Total Direct Energie), Andrea Pasqualon (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Edvald Boasson Hagen and Michael Valgren (Dimension Data) and K\u00e9vin L\u00e9danois (Ark\u00e9a-Samsic). 156km to go: Peter Sagan has gone a few seconds clear of the breakaway group and seems very perky today. His Bora Hansgrohe team, Sunweb and AG2R have four riders each in the breakaway. Team Ineos, Groupama-FDJ and Katusha-Alpecin are the only three teams not represented. Ineos won\u2019t care, while the other two teams just seem to have missed it. 160km to go: Michael Matthews, Alexander Kristoff, Sonny Colbrelli, Matteo Trentin, Peter Sagan and Dylan Groenewegen are among the cream of the sprinting talent in the breakaway, while there are plenty of good climbers alongside them, including Dan Martin, Nicolas Roche, Simon Yates and Tim Wellens, in his polka dot jersey. 164km to go: The escape party has been let go and they have opened a gap of 1min 52sec. It\u2019s an enormous breakaway, comprising 42 riders. Dan Martin is in it, Nicolas Roche is there. Peter Sagan and Michael Matthews are present. Greg van Avermaet is the best placed escapee on GC, in 28th position at 14min 25sec. 166km to go: A group of about 40 riders get away and Team Ineos form a barrier across the the front of the peloton. They\u2019ll be eager to find out who is in the escape party, just in case there\u2019s anyone they need to worry about and chase down. Crikey! The riders have been barreling along at an average speed of more than 50km per hour since racing commenced. The intermediate sprint is 78 kilometres from the finish of today\u2019s stage, just before the riders take on the Category 1 Col De Peyresourde. There are 167km to go in this stage and a breakaway has yet to be formed. 172km to go: \u201cA lot of riders have made a lot of effort here and they\u2019re going to be feeling it,\u201d says Sean Kelly on Eurosport, as Thomas De Gendt puts the hammer down at the front of the bunch in the latest escape bid. Mitchelton Scott\u2019s stage 11 diary The Australian team had a slightly tougher time than expected on a largely uneventful day. 180km to go: With almost 30 kilometres behind them, the riders have yet to settle. Bora Hangrohe\u2019s Max Schachmann goes on the attack again and is joined by Mitchelton Scott\u2019s Matteo Trentin and several others. Their efforts, like those of all before them, come to naught. 181km to go: Lennard Kamna (Sunweb) puts some distance between himself and the bunch and is joined by Pello Bilbao (Astana) and two others. The peloton are not having it and shut down the attack. 188km to go: Sagan is still out in front, but only leads by a couple of seconds. He looks around, wondering why nobody is joining him, then shakes his head as the the bunch catches him. Or he lets them catch him. 191km to go: The peloton continues to motor along, with the green, yellow and polka-dot jerseys all prominent near the front. The green won, covering the torso of Peter Sagan, shoots out of the pack again, the man occupying it looking behind him to see if anyone is up for joining him. There are no volunteers, but his knees keep pumping. 195km to go: The latest breakaway attempt is caught and this stage has yet to settle. 198km to go: A group of six riders launch an escape attempt, including Bora Hansgrohe\u2019s Daniel Oss and Max Schachmann. They\u2019re pedalling at a ferocious lick, but have yet to get away. 199km to go: The peloton put an abrupt stop to Caruso\u2019s gallop and the bunch is back together again. No breakaway formed yet. 202km to go: The peloton reels in Sagan and his cronies, prompting Bahrain\u2013Merida rider Damiano Caruso to attack off the front off the bunch. 204km to go: Peter Sagan attacks off the front of the bunch and is joined by three other riders, but behind them, the peloton is keeping them on a very tight rein. They\u2019re racing in stage 12: Christian Prudhomme sends them on their way with an extravagant wave of his yellow flag. Thomas De Gendt, Edvald Boasson Hagen are among no end of riders who appear interested in getting in a breakaway, but with so much at stake nobody is being allowed to escape. \u201cStay around the front and just be there when a good group of riders tries to get away.\u201d says Eurosport co-comms man Sean Kelly, who says every team will want somebody in the breakaway, whenever it forms. More withdrawals: Suffering from illness, Rick Zabel from Katusha-Alpecin did not start yesterday\u2019s stage, while Total Direct Energie\u2019s Niki Terpstra was forced to abandon after suffering a double fracture of his shoulder with 30 kilometres to go in yesterday\u2019s stage. UAE team Emirates rider Philipsen Jasper did not start this morning. With eight men gone over 11 stages, the field has been reduced from 176 riders to 168. Christian Prudhomme on today\u2019s stage: \u201cThe Pyrenean part of the Tour will start in the valley and that should motivate the usual breakaway suspects to give it a go but it\u2019ll carry on with climbs up Peyresourde and La Hourquette d\u2019Ancizan,\u201d says the race director. \u201cOnly the best climbers among them will be in a position to triumph as they head down to Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre.\u201d Currently leading the peloton along in his red Skoda, Prudhomme will give the signal to start racing once the riders have covered another five kilometres or so. \u201c\u201dIt\u2019s going to be frantic from the start,\u201d muses Eurosport commentator Carlton Kirby. The roll-out has begun: The riders are currently wending their way through the streets of Toulouse, with aerial shots showcasing the picturesque terracotta slates and bricks from which many of the locale\u2019s buildings are constructed. The Pink City, they call it and it\u2019s not difficult to see why. Stage three review Australia\u2019s Caleb Ewan silenced a few doubters as he entered the pantheon of great sprinters able to combine technical ability and raw speed in a cauldron of pressure From William Fotheringham\u2019s stage-by-stage guide: A relatively gentle introduction to the Pyrenees: two first category climbs with long run-in to the opener, the Col de Peyresourde. There is 130km for the break to build a lead so expect someone from the early move to win; the overall contenders may well end up watching each other for signs of weakness over the Peyresourde and Hourquette d\u2019Ancizan while saving strength for the coming days. Not the toughest mountain climbing, so the stage winner could be a breakaway specialist who isn\u2019t one of the very best climbers. Britain\u2019s Steve Cummings could be one to watch.",

      "bodyText": "Environmental groups are demanding one of Britain\u2019s biggest water companies be made to pay tens of millions of pounds to restore the damage to habitats and wildlife caused by thousands of pollution spills into the rivers and beaches across the south-east of England. As details of the scale of the criminal inquiry into the allegedly deliberate misreporting of data and cover-up of thousands of pollution spills by Southern Water emerge, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are calling on the regulator, Ofwat, to review a penalty of \u00a3126m imposed on the company last month. The groups, led by the Angling Trust, have condemned the decision to reduce a fine of \u00a337.7m \u2013 as part of the penalty \u2013 to just \u00a33m as a lost opportunity. In a letter to the Guardian and in submissions to Ofwat, they are calling for the reduction to be diverted to environmental restoration caused by years of unauthorised pollution spills of raw or partially treated sewage by the privatised water company. Ofwat has put its decision on the penalty it plans to impose on Southern Water, which operates in Kent, Sussex and Hampshire, out for a consultation that ends on Friday. In a letter to the Guardian, the Angling Trust and nine other environmental NGOs are calling on Ofwat to redirect the \u00a334.7m reduction in the fine into efforts to restore the environment damaged by the company. Stuart Singleton-White, head of campaigns at the Angling Trust, said it was the environment, not customers, who were the victims of the company\u2019s practices over many years. \u201cIf Ofwat is going to reduce the fine Southern Water pays from \u00a337m to \u00a33m, then the difference must be used to compensate the victim: the environment, our rivers and coasts, and the fish and wildlife that call these places home,\u201d said Singleton-White. A criminal investigation by the Environment Agency into thousands of pollution spills into the rivers and beaches across south-east England and a suspected cover-up by senior and middle managers is said by sources to be unprecedented in its scale and nature. Documents submitted to Ofwat reveal that employees at the water company would routinely drive tanker loads of sewage from one waste treatment plant to another to dodge water-quality inspections by Environment Agency officials as part of deliberate manipulation of data to avoid millions of pounds in fines. Southern Water \u2013 like other water companies \u2013 is allowed to self-report pollution incidents following a change made by the Environment Agency 10 years ago. The company has not revealed where the pollution incidents took place across its region, which includes some of the south coast\u2019s most visited beaches, saying: \u201cFor legal reasons it would not be appropriate for us to share that information at this time; however, we will as soon as we\u2019re able to.\u201d But the scale of the multiple leaks of raw and untreated sewage is likely to amount to several thousand spills over many years. In documents submitted to Ofwat, Southern Water said that 991 pollution leak incidents or cases where data was deliberately manipulated could have occurred in 245 out of 300 of its wastewater treatment plants.

Southern Water has said it is difficult to estimate the impact of historic spills, or determine the severity of the leaks, or their impact on fish and habitats in the waterways.

Singleton-White said he feared many of the pollution incidents might never be brought to court \u201cdue to the obvious lack of data caused by wilful misreporting\u201d. \u201cThis only strengthens the case for the imposition of an environmental payment in reparation for damage caused,\u201d he said.

Asked after Thursday\u2019s stage if there were any other issues that may have led to Dennis\u2019s sudden withdrawal, Stangelj said: \u201cCome on, don\u2019t put words in my mouth.\u201d With five mountain stages still to come in this year\u2019s Tour, the stage 13 individual time trial centred on Pau will prove pivotal to Geraint Thomas\u2019s hopes of a successful defence. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to tomorrow,\u201d he said of the time trial. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the course a few times and I\u2019ll see it again in the morning.\u201d Thomas admitted he had been biding his time until the \u201crace of truth\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite hard, waiting and waiting, but tomorrow I\u2019ll get to go all in,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve ridden it already three times and I like it. It\u2019s fast and it should be hard. It\u2019s going to be a big day.\u201d",

Detectives believe Nicholson carefully plotted the murder, characterised in court as an \u201cexecution\u201d, to silence Lucy, and meticulously planned his attempt to get away with it.

In 2017, Nicholson became a lodger at the Southampton home of Lucy, her mother, Stacey White, and stepfather, Richard Elmes, who was Nicholson\u2019s best friend. The prosecution at Winchester crown court said that by this time he had already sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl in 2012, when he was an 18-year-old door-to-door salesman, after she asked him for a tattoo. Diary entries from Lucy reveal that he began abusing her in May 2017, when she was 12, after they had played the video game Call of Duty: Zombies.

It would be highly unusual for a senior cabinet minister to travel alone, particularly one in such a sensitive post. Last April Johnson was dealing with aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/26/skripal-poisonings-bungled-assassination-kremlin-putin-salisbury\">nerve agent poisonings</a> in Salisbury, which had led to rancorous exchanges between the British government and the Kremlin.</p> \n<p>Neither the Foreign Office or the police were prepared to say whether Johnson had gone against protocol and travelled to Italy without security.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c48fed1b6a019333c468be98e92db85e61f01f1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c48fed1b6a019333c468be98e92db85e61f01f1/0_432_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Evgeny Lebedev, owner of the London Evening Standard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evgeny Lebedev, owner of the London Evening Standard.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lebedev, 40, was also in the spotlight at the time, having sold a 30% holdings in his newspapers to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/27/government-investigate-sale-evening-standard-independent-stakes-saudi\">investor with strong links to Saudi Arabia</a>. The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jun/13/evening-standard-could-face-inquiry-over-saudi-investment\">has ordered</a> the competition and media regulator to investigate the sale. The inquiry is ongoing.</p> \n<p>Asked about the visit, Lebedev\u2019s office confirmed Johnson had been there for the weekend and that he was among a number of guests. \u201cMr Johnson joined Mr Lebedev at his residence in Perugia for the weekend 27-29 April 2018,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cUnlike some of the other guests, Mr Johnson did not use Mr Lebedev\u2019s private plane for either his outbound or return flight to/from Italy but arranged his own flights.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lebedev\u2019s office declined to give any further details about the weekend or about another trip Johnson is <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/revealed-boris-russian-oligarch-and-page-3-model/\">reported to have made to Palazzo Terranova</a>, in October 2016.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is refusing to give details of a trip he made to Italy when he was foreign secretary for a weekend-long party held at a restored castle owned by the media billionaire and socialite Evgeny Lebedev. The Guardian has learned that the likely next prime minister went to Palazzo Terranova in Perugia in April 2018 at the invitation of Lebedev, the owner of the London Evening Standard and the Independent who is renowned for hosting glamorous events for the world\u2019s rich and famous. In a brief entry of ministerial interests on the Foreign Office website, Johnson declared he had an \u201covernight stay\u201d with Lebedev on 28 April, travelling \u201caccompanied by a spouse, family member or friend\u201d. Johnson did not give any further details of where he had been, who he was with or the reason for the visit \u2013 reportedly his fourth to Lebedev\u2019s Italian home in recent years. The Guardian has repeatedly asked Johnson to explain the trip and whether he took his official security team with him \u2013 the foreign secretary is one of a handful of senior government posts that are given 24/7 protection from the Metropolitan police. Johnson has declined to do so. The Guardian has spoken to a number of senior diplomats and officials who say Johnson\u2019s tenure as foreign secretary showed he was too indisciplined, wayward and unfocused to be a good potential prime minister. One said his lack of preparation during meetings marginalised the UK\u2019s voice during important discussions about events in Syria and Libya, and that he often attempted \u201cto substitute conviviality for competence\u201d. \u201cBoris had a reputation for winging it,\u201d said the official. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough. You have to do more than that.\u201d Another source said: \u201cBoris will not be able to run a government.\u201d Johnson chose to travel to Italy last year at time when he was under great scrutiny. It would be highly unusual for a senior cabinet minister to travel alone, particularly one in such a sensitive post. Last April Johnson was dealing with aftermath of the nerve agent poisonings in Salisbury, which had led to rancorous exchanges between the British government and the Kremlin. Neither the Foreign Office or the police were prepared to say whether Johnson had gone against protocol and travelled to Italy without security. Lebedev, 40, was also in the spotlight at the time, having sold a 30% holdings in his newspapers to an investor with strong links to Saudi Arabia. The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, has ordered the competition and media regulator to investigate the sale. The inquiry is ongoing. Asked about the visit, Lebedev\u2019s office confirmed Johnson had been there for the weekend and that he was among a number of guests. \u201cMr Johnson joined Mr Lebedev at his residence in Perugia for the weekend 27-29 April 2018,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cUnlike some of the other guests, Mr Johnson did not use Mr Lebedev\u2019s private plane for either his outbound or return flight to/from Italy but arranged his own flights.\u201d Lebedev\u2019s office declined to give any further details about the weekend or about another trip Johnson is reported to have made to Palazzo Terranova, in October 2016. On that occasion the party is said to have been attended by the celebrity Katie Price and the actor Joan Collins, among others. The former Labour cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw said Johnson\u2019s unwillingness to be drawn on any questions about last year\u2019s visit was untenable. \u201cBoris Johnson cannot hide from scrutiny over this matter. If he visited the home of Evgeny Lebedev without his security detail \u2026 it would be recklessness of the very highest order. \u201cIt would add to the concerns over his fitness to be prime minister and oversee our national security. Johnson should explain why he went to this party and whether his protection officers were with him that night.\u201d One person with knowledge of previous parties in Italy said Lebedev liked to invite people who would \u201ccreate a spectacle by behaving in an outrageous way \u2026 There was always that bacchanalian aspect to those trips \u2026 it was all about having very important people reduced to doing very silly things.\u201d Lebedev has a dog called Boris, which has led to speculation that it was named after Johnson. The two men are understood to be friends who bonded during Johnson\u2019s time time in City Hall. Records show Johnson twice went to Lebedev\u2019s Italian home when he was mayor of London. He went in early October 2014, staying for two nights. Lebedev paid for his flights and a taxi for him on his return to Luton airport. He also went two years earlier. On that occasion Johnson said he had travelled to Italy for \u201cpurely personal\u201d reasons and \u201cnot in his capacity as the mayor of London\u201d. When asked about that trip, a spokesperson for the then mayor insisted it was \u201can opportunity to relentlessly promote his vision for London\u201d. In a 2012 interview with the Guardian, Lebedev said it was \u201cunreasonable to expect individuals to spend millions on newspapers and not have access to politicians\u201d. In 2015 Johnson and Lebedev spent a night on London\u2019s streets together to highlight the issues of homelessness and rough sleeping in the capital. The Met said it could not discuss Johnson\u2019s security arrangements when he was foreign secretary. \u201cWe simply do not discuss matters of protective security of this nature. If we confirm or deny that officers went on certain trips with certain people, then it could impact or undermine our security stance and operations in the future.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson could not have got off to a better start.</p> \n<p>Shortly after Johnson was appointed foreign secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, the head of the diplomatic service, organised an all-staff meeting for him in the main hall at King Charles Street. This was Johnson\u2019s chance to address the troops and set out his stall. After two years of Philip Hammond, whose ice-cool efficiency has a way of freezing hearts across Whitehall, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office needed to hear some joy. And that afternoon in July 2016, Johnson had an abundance of it.</p> \n<p>He told his audience how brilliant they were. He agreed they were underpaid and said he would press the Treasury to look at their salaries. The climax came when he took questions and was asked if he would allow the department and UK embassies to fly the rainbow flag during gay pride events. Hammond had banned this. Would Johnson? Of course he wouldn\u2019t.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"881dd92e-5c29-4d58-83ef-9006534df7e2\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(January 1, 1987)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Fired by the Times after landing a job at the newspaper through his family connections.

The Foreign Office remained marginalised, morale sank further \u2013 and, with some notable exceptions, Johnson reverted to type.</p> \n<p>By the time he had gone, many of those who had seen him at work had become frustrated by his inconsistency and compared him unfavourably with every other foreign secretary from the recent era. \u201cNobody was sad to see him go,\u201d said one official.</p> \n<p>If this didn\u2019t entirely surprise those who knew him, it did disappoint foreign ministers from other countries, and undermine Britain\u2019s voice at the top table, according to one senior EU diplomat.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Boris\u2019s reputation is for winging it.

People like Sergei Lavrov [Russia] and Frank-Walter Steinmeier [Germany]. They have years of experience and competence. Not withstanding his enthusiasm, Johnson did not have competence.\u201d</p> \n<p>This became most evident during discussions over the situations in Libya and Syria, he said. \u201cIf you are dealing with the Libyan affair, it is very complicated; the Syrian story is very sad and dramatic. If you discuss them, you have to know what you are talking about.</p> \n<p>\u201cI could not say that Boris was an irrelevance at these meetings. But if you only have good words and enthusiasm, that is not what you want from a British foreign secretary. I wouldn\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t serious, he just wasn\u2019t prepared. Evidently being foreign secretary was not Boris Johnson\u2019s cup of tea.\u201d</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not that Johnson made enemies. \u201cHe is a celebrity because of the way he does things. People recognise him, not just in the UK but in other countries. I think he is in love with this \u2026 He likes to be liked,\u201d the diplomat said.</p> \n<p>And that was part of the problem. \u201cMy impression is that he is very interested in pleasing the audience. I never saw an aggressive attitude in these multilateral meetings or in our bilateral meetings. His predecessor [Hammond] was frequently more aggressive and more demanding. He was very sharp and precise in his requests and positions, and not so interested in pleasing his interlocutors and the audience.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2267938172de21d18a2da098042d1de57437f36\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2267938172de21d18a2da098042d1de57437f36/0_88_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson at a cricket match between England and India at the Oval, London, September 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson at a cricket match between England and India at the Oval, London, September 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Kington/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In particular, EU foreign ministers had expected Johnson to speak up firmly for British interests in the foreign affairs council. Apparently, it didn\u2019t happen. \u201cI would say our relations were very easy. I frankly don\u2019t remember any occasion in which he took an aggressive position. So apparently [Johnson] is not a political leader with a great and sharp position, repeating it continuously and clearly, but more a political leader with a very flexible attitude. Is this a good thing to lead a government? Well, I leave that to you draw a conclusion.\u201d</p> \n<p>Other sources said Johnson convened small working groups on some issues, such as the war in Yemen, but that overall, \u201che was limited in the briefings he was prepared to take\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cBoris\u2019s reputation is for winging it. It\u2019s not enough. You have to do more than that. Foreign ministers are a pretty serious bunch. There is no margin for error. In some countries, if you make an error you are a dead man.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another Whitehall veteran said submissions to Johnson had to be brief and the point or risk being ignored or misunderstood.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll foreign secretaries have different ways of working. Jack Straw was across his brief. He was there for a long time. Submissions to David Miliband had to be more detailed. He always had a \u2018top six\u2019 questions on everything.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson could not have got off to a better start. Shortly after Johnson was appointed foreign secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, the head of the diplomatic service, organised an all-staff meeting for him in the main hall at King Charles Street. This was Johnson\u2019s chance to address the troops and set out his stall. After two years of Philip Hammond, whose ice-cool efficiency has a way of freezing hearts across Whitehall, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office needed to hear some joy. And that afternoon in July 2016, Johnson had an abundance of it. He told his audience how brilliant they were. He agreed they were underpaid and said he would press the Treasury to look at their salaries. The climax came when he took questions and was asked if he would allow the department and UK embassies to fly the rainbow flag during gay pride events. Hammond had banned this. Would Johnson? Of course he wouldn\u2019t. \u201cBoris said the FCO would fly the flag. He got quite a rousing round of applause and cheers for that. He said all the right things,\u201d said one source. In part, it is a reflection on Hammond that so many at the FCO were initially relieved to have Johnson in charge, despite the widespread incredulity at his appointment in diplomatic circles, accusations about his lack of political gravitas, and concerns about his levels of genuine interest in foreign affairs. After all, this was a man who had once used a newspaper column to describe \u201cVlad\u201d Putin as \u201clooking a bit like Dobby the House Elf\u201d \u2013 a character from the Harry Potter stories. Setting that aside, here was a chance for Johnson to prove his mettle in one of the great offices of state, and inject some colour and energy back into British foreign policy at a time of international turbulence \u2013 and Brexit. But over the nearly two years he was in post, all these early hopes faded, according to several sources who spoke to the Guardian. The Foreign Office remained marginalised, morale sank further \u2013 and, with some notable exceptions, Johnson reverted to type. By the time he had gone, many of those who had seen him at work had become frustrated by his inconsistency and compared him unfavourably with every other foreign secretary from the recent era. \u201cNobody was sad to see him go,\u201d said one official. If this didn\u2019t entirely surprise those who knew him, it did disappoint foreign ministers from other countries, and undermine Britain\u2019s voice at the top table, according to one senior EU diplomat. \u201cThe club of foreign ministers is composed of experienced members. People like Sergei Lavrov [Russia] and Frank-Walter Steinmeier [Germany]. They have years of experience and competence. Not withstanding his enthusiasm, Johnson did not have competence.\u201d This became most evident during discussions over the situations in Libya and Syria, he said. \u201cIf you are dealing with the Libyan affair, it is very complicated; the Syrian story is very sad and dramatic. If you discuss them, you have to know what you are talking about. \u201cI could not say that Boris was an irrelevance at these meetings. But if you only have good words and enthusiasm, that is not what you want from a British foreign secretary. I wouldn\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t serious, he just wasn\u2019t prepared. Evidently being foreign secretary was not Boris Johnson\u2019s cup of tea.\u201d It\u2019s not that Johnson made enemies. \u201cHe is a celebrity because of the way he does things. People recognise him, not just in the UK but in other countries. I think he is in love with this \u2026 He likes to be liked,\u201d the diplomat said. And that was part of the problem. \u201cMy impression is that he is very interested in pleasing the audience. I never saw an aggressive attitude in these multilateral meetings or in our bilateral meetings. His predecessor [Hammond] was frequently more aggressive and more demanding. He was very sharp and precise in his requests and positions, and not so interested in pleasing his interlocutors and the audience.\u201d In particular, EU foreign ministers had expected Johnson to speak up firmly for British interests in the foreign affairs council. Apparently, it didn\u2019t happen. \u201cI would say our relations were very easy. I frankly don\u2019t remember any occasion in which he took an aggressive position. So apparently [Johnson] is not a political leader with a great and sharp position, repeating it continuously and clearly, but more a political leader with a very flexible attitude. Is this a good thing to lead a government? Well, I leave that to you draw a conclusion.\u201d Other sources said Johnson convened small working groups on some issues, such as the war in Yemen, but that overall, \u201che was limited in the briefings he was prepared to take\u201d. \u201cBoris\u2019s reputation is for winging it. It\u2019s not enough. You have to do more than that. Foreign ministers are a pretty serious bunch. There is no margin for error. In some countries, if you make an error you are a dead man.\u201d Another Whitehall veteran said submissions to Johnson had to be brief and the point or risk being ignored or misunderstood. \u201cAll foreign secretaries have different ways of working. Jack Straw was across his brief. He was there for a long time. Submissions to David Miliband had to be more detailed. He always had a \u2018top six\u2019 questions on everything. He really got into the minutiae of things. \u201cIf anything, Hague was even more detailed. Submissions to him were mammoth tasks. But with Boris, submissions needed to be short, and they needed to clear about what he was being asked to do.\u201d Loud complaints about being asked to focus on a subject, or give a speech on a subject he had no interest in, happened frequently, insiders say. One official was brutal in her assessment: \u201cHe was smart, but he had the attention span of a gnat.\u201d It was this casual approach that led to his biggest gaffe as foreign secretary.

Her family had always insisted she was on holiday visiting members of her family. Johnson apologised and corrected his statement to MPs. But it was too late. His remarks were seized upon by the Iranian authorities, who had accused her of being a spy. Three days after Johnson spoke, she was summoned before an unscheduled court hearing, where the foreign secretary\u2019s comments were cited as proof that she was engaged in \u201cpropaganda against the regime\u201d. A source said this typified Johnson\u2019s lack of attention to detail. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have said what he said. These things have consequences. She is still in jail.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the case for everyone, or everything.

Whether intelligence chiefs were entirely open with him during their one-to-one meetings is another matter. \u201cThat would be down to the instincts of the individuals involved,\u201d said a source. After the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March last year, Johnson impressed some in government with his willingness to push back against Russia. Bill Browder, the anti-corruption campaigner and prominent critic of Vladimir Putin, said he had found Johnson an ally in his drive to get a \u201cMagnitsky Act\u201d passed in the UK. This allows the sanctioning of corrupt Russian officials and seizure of their assets \u2013 a response to the murder of Browder\u2019s then lawyer in Moscow, Sergei Magnitsky. \u201cI see everything through the prism of the Magnitsky Act,\u201d said Browder. \u201cBoris was one of the early supporters of the initiative when he was London mayor.

Little April Shower (Bambi, 1942)</h2> \n<p>It is not clear if Little April Shower is supposed to sound as sinister and hallucinatory as it does \u2013 the middle section of the song, with its wordless, seasick vocal chorus and surging orchestration seems to cast a pall over its cuter moments. In a certain light, it sounds like the kind of thing the acid-addled Brian Wilson dreamed up for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/14/beach-boys-smile\" title=\"\">Beach Boys\u2019 Smile</a> album.</p> \n<h2>29. Why Should I Worry? (Oliver &amp; Company, 1988)</h2> \n<p>A lost song from Disney\u2019s 80s doldrums. The music is very much of its era, but Billy Joel seems to have interpreted his brief as \u201cwrite lyrics in the style of Lou Reed\u201d, with references to the Bowery, St Mark\u2019s Place and the Chelsea hotel. And the deadpan \u201cWhy should I care? / Even when I cross the line, I got street savoir-faire.\u201d</p> \n<h2>28. I 2 I (A Goofy Movie, 1995)</h2> \n<p>An overlooked film released to a lukewarm critical response, A Goofy Movie nevertheless contained one hidden smash in the Tevin Campbell and Rosie Gaines-sung I 2 I, heavy on the breakbeats and synth stabs, and audibly constructed as a homage to Gaines\u2019 sometime collaborator Prince.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d099580b999408ab82349091c27d010f77edc9cf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d099580b999408ab82349091c27d010f77edc9cf/0_0_5066_3040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traditional Broadway \u2026 Tangled.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traditional Broadway \u2026 Tangled.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image from film company</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>27. Mother Knows Best (Tangled, 2010)</h2> \n<p>For all Disney\u2019s increasing interest in commissioning songs rooted in mainstream pop, its films can still feature stuff that sounds like traditional Broadway, such as this fabulously hammy inventory of the world\u2019s ills, from violence and disease to \u201clarge bugs\u201d.</p> \n<h2>26. Friends on the Other Side (The Princess and the Frog, 2009)</h2> \n<p>Randy Newman\u2019s soundtrack for The Princess and the Frog offered up a series of wonderful pastiches of New Orleans music, from R&amp;B to zydeco, but its greatest moment may be this paean to voodoo. Dr John appeared elsewhere on the soundtrack, but, produced differently, Friends on the Other Side wouldn\u2019t have sounded out of place on his dark 1968 debut album <a href=\"https://musicaficionado.blog/2017/11/08/gris-gris-by-dr-john/\" title=\"\">Gris Gris</a>.</p> \n<h2>25. Under the Sea (The Little Mermaid, 1989)</h2> \n<p>The film that kicked off the \u201cDisney renaissance\u201d, The Little Mermaid was more knowing than the organisation\u2019s previous work, complete with a villain inspired by the drag queen Divine and Under the Sea, on which jaunty calypso masked social comment and the thought-provoking lyric: \u201cDarling it\u2019s better, down where it\u2019s wetter.\u201d</p> \n<h2>24. Be Prepared (The Lion King, 1994)</h2> \n<p>The big ballads and comedy songs garnered most of the attention, but one of The Lion King\u2019s greatest moments is this alternately witty and chilling evocation of evil, the music\u2019s darkly militaristic take on a tango underlined by the distinct hint of the Nuremberg rally about the scene in the film it scores.</p> \n<h2>23. Be Our Guest (Beauty and the Beast, 1991)</h2> \n<p>Sometimes, Disney songs work because they hit their emotional target, and sometimes they work because they\u2019re just infernally catchy, lodging in your brain whether you want them to our not: a cod-Gallic ode to gluttony sung by a candlestick, Be Our Guest fits into the once-heard-never-forgotten-without-extensive-therapy category.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"143e1efc1a157c88d76fae5b269b46a67a595178\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/143e1efc1a157c88d76fae5b269b46a67a595178/0_36_2091_1255/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shady beneath the breeziness \u2026 Moana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shady beneath the breeziness \u2026 Moana.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Walt Disney Pictures</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>22. You\u2019re Welcome (Moana, 2016)</h2> \n<p>The writer of Hamilton, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/dec/01/lin-manuel-miranda-trump-musical-dont-know-how-score\" title=\"\">Lin-Manuel Miranda</a>, came up with this homage to the 60s sunshine pop of the Turtles or the Association. And, like the best 60s sunshine pop, something shady lurks beneath the carefree breeziness of its tune: lyrics that offer a masterclass in passive-aggression.</p> \n<h2>21. A Whole New World (Aladdin, 1992)</h2> \n<p>A song that can survive being <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLRKdB7orn0\" title=\"\">performed</a> a d<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLRKdB7orn0\" title=\"\">eux by Peter Andre and Katie Price</a> is clearly a song that is exceptionally well constructed. More winningly rerecorded by Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle, Aladdin\u2019s big ballad knocked Whitney Houston\u2019s I Will Always Love You off the top of the US charts \u2013 incredibly, the only Disney song ever to make No 1 in the US.</p> \n<h2>20. Oogie Boogie\u2019s Song (The Nightmare Before Christmas, 1993)</h2> \n<p>Tom Waits memorably turned Heigh-Ho from Snow White into <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71gI8xMfJO0\" title=\"\">the stuff of nightmares</a> on the Disney-themed compilation Stay Awake. Meanwhile, Waits in jazz-influenced beatnik mode sounds like an inspiration for this song, from the film that launched a thousand teenage goth backpacks.</p> \n<h2>19. Gaston (Beauty and the Beast, 1991)</h2> \n<p>A comic tour de force, Gaston offers a thick bully making a parade of increasingly crazed public boasts \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m especially good at expectorating\u201d \u2013 backed up by a fawning chorus of admirers: by the time of the 2017 live-action version, it sounded remarkably like political satire.</p> \n<h2>18. In a World of My Own (Alice in Wonderland, 1951)</h2> \n<p>It seems amazing that some lysergically informed late 60s band didn\u2019t cover this. The music is pre-rock\u2019n\u2019roll pop, but the cut-glass voice of Kathryn Beaumont and the lyrics \u2013 \u201cAll the flowers would have very extra special powers / They would sit and talk to me for hours\u201d \u2013 are pure, unwitting psychedelia before their time.</p> \n<h2>17. Goodbye, So Soon (Basil and the Great Mouse Detective, 1986)</h2> \n<p>The film it came from is frequently held up as an example of Disney\u2019s wilderness years, when their movies seldom clicked, but Goodbye, So Soon \u2013 sung with hammy relish by Vincent Price \u2013 is a lost gem. It works on two levels: as a villain wishing death on his enemies and as an up-yours kiss-off to a former partner.</p> \n<h2>16. Oo-De-Lally (Robin Hood, 1973)</h2> \n<p>At least something of the 60s pop revolution seemed to have touched Disney by the time it made Robin Hood: Roger Miller\u2019s lovely acoustic song has a distinct hint of the coffeehouse folkie about it, the melody oddly reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz9n9GMBdJM\" title=\"\">Neil Young\u2019s Dance Dance Dance</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b01a73e144c404e2f4d11fa7b7339876e4cdd4ad\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b01a73e144c404e2f4d11fa7b7339876e4cdd4ad/0_46_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Poppins \u2026 gets under the listener\u2019s skin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Poppins \u2026 gets under the listener\u2019s skin.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Disney</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>15. Stay Awake (Mary Poppins, 1964)</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s a split decision as to whether Feed the Birds or Stay Awake is Mary Poppins\u2019 greatest song, but Stay Awake just edges it. Less sentimental than Feed the Birds, from its a cappella intro on, the Julie Andrews-sung lullaby has something indefinably creepy about it, which gets under the listener\u2019s skin.</p> \n<h2>14. You\u2019ve Got a Friend in Me (Toy Story, 1996)</h2> \n<p>The very adult, and occasionally controversial, singer-songwriter Randy Newman may have seemed an odd fit for Disney, but he has scored nine of its films (although, admittedly, Toy Story\u2019s maker, Pixar, did not become a part of Disney until 2006). The most celebrated of his contributions You\u2019ve Got a Friend in Me is a simple, timeless paean to undying fealty, lent further charm by Newman\u2019s gruff delivery; in subsequent Toy Story films, its use became increasingly ironised.</p> \n<h2>13. Trust in Me (The Jungle Book, 1967)</h2> \n<p>Subsequently given a p<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbytZCT4Cy4\" title=\"\">sychy goth makeover by Siouxsie and the Banshees</a>, who correctly identified that the song had a curiously erotic undercurrent, Trust in Me is The Jungle Book\u2019s weirdest moment. Its simple, suitably hypnotic melody \u2013 and suitably serpentine flute \u2013 makes evil sound strangely appealing.</p> \n<h2>12. Baby Mine (Dumbo, 1941)</h2> \n<p>Authentically traumatic and upsetting, the first half of Dumbo tells you a lot about how ideas about kids\u2019 entertainment have changed over the decades. Its loveliest moment is the heartbreaking Baby Mine, which sets its saga of unconditional parental love against a spectacularly grim backdrop: an imprisoned parent attempting to comfort a bullied child.</p> \n<h2>11. The Bare Necessities (The Jungle Book, 1967)</h2> \n<p>Originally soundtracked by a set of folky country songs \u2013 and a parody of the Beatles \u2013 The Jungle Book ended up with what, song-for-song, may be the greatest Disney soundtrack of all. The Bare Necessities pulls off the difficult task of promoting a carefree, don\u2019t-worry-be-happy approach to life without making you want to repeatedly punch whoever wrote it.</p> \n<h2>10. The Age of Not Believing (Bedknobs and Broomsticks, 1971)</h2> \n<p>A moving and incisive song about the fading of childhood and the loss of innocence, The Age of Not Believing is almost unbearably sad. It sounds less like something aimed at kids than an existential crisis set to music: \u201cYour dreams are lost up on a shelf / And worst of all, you doubt yourself\u201d.</p> \n<h2>9. Remember Me (Coco, 2017)</h2> \n<p>Coco is a film that tackles tough themes, including death and dementia. Its tear-jerking central song could be about either. Written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/18/robert-lopez-kristen-anderson-lopez-frozen-chardonnay-coco\" title=\"\">Roberto Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez</a>, the same team behind Let It Go, it is far more subtle than their biggest hit: its melody \u2013 inspired by Chopin \u2013 is strong enough to withstand being performed umpteen times in the film.</p> \n<h2>8. Someday My Prince Will Come (Snow White, 1937)</h2> \n<p>One of the first Disney songs to cross over into \u201cadult\u201d music, the gorgeous, swooning melody of Someday My Prince Will Come became a jazz standard, apparently first performed as such by the Ghetto Swingers, the jazz band formed in Theresienstadt ghetto/concentration camp, and subsequently by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBq87dbKyHQ\" title=\"\">Miles Davis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlRk2y72lUo\" title=\"\">Dave Brubeck</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"87040c2a099d31c679280c628dcc0edfd9f9fd3a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87040c2a099d31c679280c628dcc0edfd9f9fd3a/0_0_1980_1188/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the greats \u2026 Cinderella.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the greats \u2026 Cinderella.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>7. A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes (Cinderella, 1950)</h2> \n<p>Less schlocky than you might have imagined a song sung to a crowd of helpful, anthropomorphic birds and mice to be, A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes may be When You Wish Upon a Star\u2019s closest competitor for the title of early Disney\u2019s greatest ballad, subsequently covered by everyone from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUskgz1N4is\" title=\"\">Brian Wilson</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLsOYJ4zFPA\" title=\"\">Jessie Ware</a>.</p> \n<h2>6. Jessie\u2019s Song (Toy Story 2, 1999)</h2> \n<p>With its accompanying visuals, Jessie\u2019s Song was the latest in a line of Disney songs that acutely skewer the sadness of childhood ending. Without them, Randy Newman had written something even more universal: a poignant, emotionally affecting piano ballad about a lost love affair or friendship, mourned by only one participant.</p> \n<h2>5. Ev\u2019rybody Wants to Be a Cat (The Aristocats, 1970)</h2> \n<p>Still not yet hip to pop music \u2013 the crows visibly based on the Beatles in The Jungle Book sing barbershop \u2013 Disney was on a firmer footing with jazz. Punning on the slang use of the word \u201ccat\u201d, Scatman Crothers\u2019 star turn \u2013 complete with a vaguely Eartha Kitt-esque interlude from Eva Gabor \u2013 remains irresistible.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e36d642184f70b8390fa54ab6948a0e2d4ea9c90\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e36d642184f70b8390fa54ab6948a0e2d4ea9c90/213_0_1297_778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Best-written power ballad in years \u2026 Frozen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Best-written power ballad in years \u2026 Frozen.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>4. Let It Go (Frozen, 2013)</h2> \n<p>Overfamiliarity has dimmed its impact, but there\u2019s a reason Let It Go became so huge. It is, by some distance, the best-written power ballad in years \u2013 stitch that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/dec/09/artsfeatures.popandrock\" title=\"\">Linda Perry</a>. The lyrics twist the usual self-help platitudes into something darker, a perfect fixing of adolescent angst, with all its accompanying screw-you impetuousness intact: \u201cNo right, no wrong, no rules for me.\u201d</p> \n<h2>3. I Wanna Be Like You (The Jungle Book, 1967)</h2> \n<p>There\u2019s an argument that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Brothers\" title=\"\">Robert and Richard Sherman</a> should be mentioned in the same breath as Lennon and McCartney or Bacharach and David. I Wanna Be Like You is prime evidence: a beautifully written burst of age-defying joy, it was also quietly subversive in its depiction of evolution at a time when teaching it was still illegal in some US states.</p> \n<h2>2. Circle of Life (The Lion King, 1994)</h2> \n<p>Can You Feel the Love Tonight? won an Oscar, but it should have been this. No Disney film has a more spectacular opening than The Lion King, which Elton John and Tim Rice\u2019s song matches: the weird hint of melodic and lyrical melancholy that undercuts its epic soar \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s more to do than can ever be done\u201d \u2013 gives it a real emotional pull.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pguMUFyJ3_U\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pguMUFyJ3_U?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  When You Wish Upon a Star.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>1. When You Wish Upon a Star (Pinocchio, 1940)</h2> \n<p>Disney\u2019s theme tune is the studio\u2019s equivalent of Over the Rainbow: a song from a children\u2019s film that went beyond its intended audience and ended up part of the great American songbook. Understandably so: nothing about When You Wish Upon a Star itself suggests that it is aimed at kids. Certainly, you couldn\u2019t accuse the lyrics \u2013 by Ned Washington, also responsible for The Nearness of You and Wild Is the Wind \u2013 of talking down to their audience: \u201cFate is kind \u2013 she brings to those that love the sweet fulfilment of your secret longing.\u201d A song about yearning and hope \u2013 it could be read as being an allegory for prayer \u2013 When You Wish Upon a Star set the gold standard for Disney songs that transcended the reason they were commissioned, and the context in which they were intended to be heard.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "30. Little April Shower (Bambi, 1942) It is not clear if Little April Shower is supposed to sound as sinister and hallucinatory as it does \u2013 the middle section of the song, with its wordless, seasick vocal chorus and surging orchestration seems to cast a pall over its cuter moments. In a certain light, it sounds like the kind of thing the acid-addled Brian Wilson dreamed up for the Beach Boys\u2019 Smile album. 29. Why Should I Worry? (Oliver &amp; Company, 1988) A lost song from Disney\u2019s 80s doldrums. The music is very much of its era, but Billy Joel seems to have interpreted his brief as \u201cwrite lyrics in the style of Lou Reed\u201d, with references to the Bowery, St Mark\u2019s Place and the Chelsea hotel. And the deadpan \u201cWhy should I care? / Even when I cross the line, I got street savoir-faire.\u201d 28. I 2 I (A Goofy Movie, 1995) An overlooked film released to a lukewarm critical response, A Goofy Movie nevertheless contained one hidden smash in the Tevin Campbell and Rosie Gaines-sung I 2 I, heavy on the breakbeats and synth stabs, and audibly constructed as a homage to Gaines\u2019 sometime collaborator Prince. 27. Mother Knows Best (Tangled, 2010) For all Disney\u2019s increasing interest in commissioning songs rooted in mainstream pop, its films can still feature stuff that sounds like traditional Broadway, such as this fabulously hammy inventory of the world\u2019s ills, from violence and disease to \u201clarge bugs\u201d. 26. Friends on the Other Side (The Princess and the Frog, 2009) Randy Newman\u2019s soundtrack for The Princess and the Frog offered up a series of wonderful pastiches of New Orleans music, from R&amp;B to zydeco, but its greatest moment may be this paean to voodoo. Dr John appeared elsewhere on the soundtrack, but, produced differently, Friends on the Other Side wouldn\u2019t have sounded out of place on his dark 1968 debut album Gris Gris. 25. Under the Sea (The Little Mermaid, 1989) The film that kicked off the \u201cDisney renaissance\u201d, The Little Mermaid was more knowing than the organisation\u2019s previous work, complete with a villain inspired by the drag queen Divine and Under the Sea, on which jaunty calypso masked social comment and the thought-provoking lyric: \u201cDarling it\u2019s better, down where it\u2019s wetter.\u201d 24. Be Prepared (The Lion King, 1994) The big ballads and comedy songs garnered most of the attention, but one of The Lion King\u2019s greatest moments is this alternately witty and chilling evocation of evil, the music\u2019s darkly militaristic take on a tango underlined by the distinct hint of the Nuremberg rally about the scene in the film it scores. 23. Be Our Guest (Beauty and the Beast, 1991) Sometimes, Disney songs work because they hit their emotional target, and sometimes they work because they\u2019re just infernally catchy, lodging in your brain whether you want them to our not: a cod-Gallic ode to gluttony sung by a candlestick, Be Our Guest fits into the once-heard-never-forgotten-without-extensive-therapy category. 22. You\u2019re Welcome (Moana, 2016) The writer of Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda, came up with this homage to the 60s sunshine pop of the Turtles or the Association. And, like the best 60s sunshine pop, something shady lurks beneath the carefree breeziness of its tune: lyrics that offer a masterclass in passive-aggression. 21. A Whole New World (Aladdin, 1992) A song that can survive being performed a deux by Peter Andre and Katie Price is clearly a song that is exceptionally well constructed. More winningly rerecorded by Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle, Aladdin\u2019s big ballad knocked Whitney Houston\u2019s I Will Always Love You off the top of the US charts \u2013 incredibly, the only Disney song ever to make No 1 in the US. 20. Oogie Boogie\u2019s Song (The Nightmare Before Christmas, 1993) Tom Waits memorably turned Heigh-Ho from Snow White into the stuff of nightmares on the Disney-themed compilation Stay Awake. Meanwhile, Waits in jazz-influenced beatnik mode sounds like an inspiration for this song, from the film that launched a thousand teenage goth backpacks. 19. Gaston (Beauty and the Beast, 1991) A comic tour de force, Gaston offers a thick bully making a parade of increasingly crazed public boasts \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m especially good at expectorating\u201d \u2013 backed up by a fawning chorus of admirers: by the time of the 2017 live-action version, it sounded remarkably like political satire. 18. In a World of My Own (Alice in Wonderland, 1951) It seems amazing that some lysergically informed late 60s band didn\u2019t cover this. The music is pre-rock\u2019n\u2019roll pop, but the cut-glass voice of Kathryn Beaumont and the lyrics \u2013 \u201cAll the flowers would have very extra special powers / They would sit and talk to me for hours\u201d \u2013 are pure, unwitting psychedelia before their time. 17. Goodbye, So Soon (Basil and the Great Mouse Detective, 1986) The film it came from is frequently held up as an example of Disney\u2019s wilderness years, when their movies seldom clicked, but Goodbye, So Soon \u2013 sung with hammy relish by Vincent Price \u2013 is a lost gem. It works on two levels: as a villain wishing death on his enemies and as an up-yours kiss-off to a former partner. 16. Oo-De-Lally (Robin Hood, 1973) At least something of the 60s pop revolution seemed to have touched Disney by the time it made Robin Hood: Roger Miller\u2019s lovely acoustic song has a distinct hint of the coffeehouse folkie about it, the melody oddly reminiscent of Neil Young\u2019s Dance Dance Dance. 15. Stay Awake (Mary Poppins, 1964) It\u2019s a split decision as to whether Feed the Birds or Stay Awake is Mary Poppins\u2019 greatest song, but Stay Awake just edges it. Less sentimental than Feed the Birds, from its a cappella intro on, the Julie Andrews-sung lullaby has something indefinably creepy about it, which gets under the listener\u2019s skin. 14. You\u2019ve Got a Friend in Me (Toy Story, 1996) The very adult, and occasionally controversial, singer-songwriter Randy Newman may have seemed an odd fit for Disney, but he has scored nine of its films (although, admittedly, Toy Story\u2019s maker, Pixar, did not become a part of Disney until 2006). The most celebrated of his contributions You\u2019ve Got a Friend in Me is a simple, timeless paean to undying fealty, lent further charm by Newman\u2019s gruff delivery; in subsequent Toy Story films, its use became increasingly ironised. 13. Trust in Me (The Jungle Book, 1967) Subsequently given a psychy goth makeover by Siouxsie and the Banshees, who correctly identified that the song had a curiously erotic undercurrent, Trust in Me is The Jungle Book\u2019s weirdest moment. Its simple, suitably hypnotic melody \u2013 and suitably serpentine flute \u2013 makes evil sound strangely appealing. 12. Baby Mine (Dumbo, 1941) Authentically traumatic and upsetting, the first half of Dumbo tells you a lot about how ideas about kids\u2019 entertainment have changed over the decades. Its loveliest moment is the heartbreaking Baby Mine, which sets its saga of unconditional parental love against a spectacularly grim backdrop: an imprisoned parent attempting to comfort a bullied child. 11. The Bare Necessities (The Jungle Book, 1967) Originally soundtracked by a set of folky country songs \u2013 and a parody of the Beatles \u2013 The Jungle Book ended up with what, song-for-song, may be the greatest Disney soundtrack of all. The Bare Necessities pulls off the difficult task of promoting a carefree, don\u2019t-worry-be-happy approach to life without making you want to repeatedly punch whoever wrote it. 10. The Age of Not Believing (Bedknobs and Broomsticks, 1971) A moving and incisive song about the fading of childhood and the loss of innocence, The Age of Not Believing is almost unbearably sad. It sounds less like something aimed at kids than an existential crisis set to music: \u201cYour dreams are lost up on a shelf / And worst of all, you doubt yourself\u201d. 9. Remember Me (Coco, 2017) Coco is a film that tackles tough themes, including death and dementia. Its tear-jerking central song could be about either. Written by Roberto Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the same team behind Let It Go, it is far more subtle than their biggest hit: its melody \u2013 inspired by Chopin \u2013 is strong enough to withstand being performed umpteen times in the film. 8. Someday My Prince Will Come (Snow White, 1937) One of the first Disney songs to cross over into \u201cadult\u201d music, the gorgeous, swooning melody of Someday My Prince Will Come became a jazz standard, apparently first performed as such by the Ghetto Swingers, the jazz band formed in Theresienstadt ghetto/concentration camp, and subsequently by Miles Davis and Dave Brubeck. 7. A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes (Cinderella, 1950) Less schlocky than you might have imagined a song sung to a crowd of helpful, anthropomorphic birds and mice to be, A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes may be When You Wish Upon a Star\u2019s closest competitor for the title of early Disney\u2019s greatest ballad, subsequently covered by everyone from Brian Wilson to Jessie Ware. 6. Jessie\u2019s Song (Toy Story 2, 1999) With its accompanying visuals, Jessie\u2019s Song was the latest in a line of Disney songs that acutely skewer the sadness of childhood ending. Without them, Randy Newman had written something even more universal: a poignant, emotionally affecting piano ballad about a lost love affair or friendship, mourned by only one participant. 5. Ev\u2019rybody Wants to Be a Cat (The Aristocats, 1970) Still not yet hip to pop music \u2013 the crows visibly based on the Beatles in The Jungle Book sing barbershop \u2013 Disney was on a firmer footing with jazz. Punning on the slang use of the word \u201ccat\u201d, Scatman Crothers\u2019 star turn \u2013 complete with a vaguely Eartha Kitt-esque interlude from Eva Gabor \u2013 remains irresistible. 4. Let It Go (Frozen, 2013) Overfamiliarity has dimmed its impact, but there\u2019s a reason Let It Go became so huge. It is, by some distance, the best-written power ballad in years \u2013 stitch that, Linda Perry. The lyrics twist the usual self-help platitudes into something darker, a perfect fixing of adolescent angst, with all its accompanying screw-you impetuousness intact: \u201cNo right, no wrong, no rules for me.\u201d 3. I Wanna Be Like You (The Jungle Book, 1967) There\u2019s an argument that Robert and Richard Sherman should be mentioned in the same breath as Lennon and McCartney or Bacharach and David. I Wanna Be Like You is prime evidence: a beautifully written burst of age-defying joy, it was also quietly subversive in its depiction of evolution at a time when teaching it was still illegal in some US states. 2. Circle of Life (The Lion King, 1994) Can You Feel the Love Tonight? won an Oscar, but it should have been this. No Disney film has a more spectacular opening than The Lion King, which Elton John and Tim Rice\u2019s song matches: the weird hint of melodic and lyrical melancholy that undercuts its epic soar \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s more to do than can ever be done\u201d \u2013 gives it a real emotional pull. 1. When You Wish Upon a Star (Pinocchio, 1940) Disney\u2019s theme tune is the studio\u2019s equivalent of Over the Rainbow: a song from a children\u2019s film that went beyond its intended audience and ended up part of the great American songbook. Understandably so: nothing about When You Wish Upon a Star itself suggests that it is aimed at kids. Certainly, you couldn\u2019t accuse the lyrics \u2013 by Ned Washington, also responsible for The Nearness of You and Wild Is the Wind \u2013 of talking down to their audience: \u201cFate is kind \u2013 she brings to those that love the sweet fulfilment of your secret longing.\u201d A song about yearning and hope \u2013 it could be read as being an allegory for prayer \u2013 When You Wish Upon a Star set the gold standard for Disney songs that transcended the reason they were commissioned, and the context in which they were intended to be heard.",

      "body": "<h2>SKY ROCKETS IN FLIGHT \u2026</h2> <p>Back in the day, Serie A attracted the best players in the world. From Diego Maradona and Michel Platini to Ruud Gullit and Paul Rideout, all the stars flocked to Italy, lured by big salaries, high-brow competition and the prospect of tucking into ice-cream with James Richardson. To an impressionable young Fiver it seemed like a ball had not truly hit a net unless a commentator screamed \u201cGooolaazo!\u201d, and the Milan derby could take the edge off a Purple Tin hangover. Heady days.</p> <p>Italian football\u2019s golden age soon faded; money and players moved elsewhere, conspiracies got busted. Many of the world\u2019s top players and coaches, plus R\u00e9mi Garde, began heading to England and European trophies went to Spain. But recently Juventus, winners of 43 Italian titles on the trot, have re-emerged as a European force, an ambition they have asserted loud and clear by completing the signing of one of the most coveted young players on the planet [don\u2019t you dare do the Theo Walcott gag \u2013 Fiver Ed] Jesse Lingar \u2026 sorry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/18/matthijs-de-ligt-joins-juventus-from-ajax-75m-deal\">Matthijs de Ligt</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/18/matthijs-de-ligt-joins-juventus-from-ajax-75m-deal\">Matthijs de Ligt joins Juventus from Ajax in \u20ac75m deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, Juve already signalled their lofty intent last season by splurging around \u20ac100m on Late Career Ronaldo, but even he cannot carry a team that has a big gap in its midfield and, as it were, a hole in its rear (though he brought a lot of success to Real Madrid when Pepe was there). De Ligt should solve the latter of those problems and will also increase Juve\u2019s threat from set pieces, a point he made well last season by scoring the goal that booted the Old Lady out of Big Cup.</p> <p>Juve have paid Ajax an initial fee of \u00a368m for the defender \u2013 potentially rising to around double that amount \u2013 and will give the teenager a salary to which The Fiver cannot count for fear of aggravating another hangover. But by beating off competition for the Dutchman from some of Europe\u2019s most admired clubs and Paris Saint-Germain, Juve have shown they mean serious business. And the prospect has drawn closer of Aaron Ramsey lifting Big Cup next year a matter of weeks after Arsenal\u2019s relegation.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cIt is the first block of toilets I have opened.

Newcarsenal? Imagine the combined might of both sets of fans sending a particularly harshly worded open letter to the joint CEOs of Mike Ashley and Stan Kroenke. Or the awesome threat of 100,000 supporters not turning up to games but deciding on the day that, ah well we\u2019ve paid for our season tickets so might as well go anyway\u201d \u2013 Paul Buller.</p> <p>\u201cThe lead-in link to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jul/16/jimmy-greaves-fun-football-broadcasting-saint-and-greavsie\">John Brewin\u2019s excellent piece</a> about Saint and Greavsie on Big Website (yesterday\u2019s Still Want More?) presents an important linguistic distinction: the legendary striker suggests that life in the football media \u2018should be fun\u2019.

      "bodyText": "SKY ROCKETS IN FLIGHT \u2026 Back in the day, Serie A attracted the best players in the world. From Diego Maradona and Michel Platini to Ruud Gullit and Paul Rideout, all the stars flocked to Italy, lured by big salaries, high-brow competition and the prospect of tucking into ice-cream with James Richardson. To an impressionable young Fiver it seemed like a ball had not truly hit a net unless a commentator screamed \u201cGooolaazo!\u201d, and the Milan derby could take the edge off a Purple Tin hangover. Heady days. Italian football\u2019s golden age soon faded; money and players moved elsewhere, conspiracies got busted. Many of the world\u2019s top players and coaches, plus R\u00e9mi Garde, began heading to England and European trophies went to Spain. But recently Juventus, winners of 43 Italian titles on the trot, have re-emerged as a European force, an ambition they have asserted loud and clear by completing the signing of one of the most coveted young players on the planet [don\u2019t you dare do the Theo Walcott gag \u2013 Fiver Ed] Jesse Lingar \u2026 sorry, Matthijs de Ligt. Of course, Juve already signalled their lofty intent last season by splurging around \u20ac100m on Late Career Ronaldo, but even he cannot carry a team that has a big gap in its midfield and, as it were, a hole in its rear (though he brought a lot of success to Real Madrid when Pepe was there). De Ligt should solve the latter of those problems and will also increase Juve\u2019s threat from set pieces, a point he made well last season by scoring the goal that booted the Old Lady out of Big Cup. Juve have paid Ajax an initial fee of \u00a368m for the defender \u2013 potentially rising to around double that amount \u2013 and will give the teenager a salary to which The Fiver cannot count for fear of aggravating another hangover. But by beating off competition for the Dutchman from some of Europe\u2019s most admired clubs and Paris Saint-Germain, Juve have shown they mean serious business. And the prospect has drawn closer of Aaron Ramsey lifting Big Cup next year a matter of weeks after Arsenal\u2019s relegation. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cIt is the first block of toilets I have opened. I was at 10 Downing Street on Monday talking about helping young people and the problems we have on the streets and then here on Wednesday, so it has been an interesting week\u201d \u2013 social housing\u2019s \u2018Arry Redknapp cuts the ribbon on a reopened lavatory in Hamworthy near his home in Poole. It\u2019s quiet. FIVER LETTERS \u201cI can\u2019t help feeling that perennial fan disappointments Newcastle and Arsenal should get together and be one giant super-whinge of a club. Newcarsenal? Imagine the combined might of both sets of fans sending a particularly harshly worded open letter to the joint CEOs of Mike Ashley and Stan Kroenke. Or the awesome threat of 100,000 supporters not turning up to games but deciding on the day that, ah well we\u2019ve paid for our season tickets so might as well go anyway\u201d \u2013 Paul Buller. \u201cThe lead-in link to John Brewin\u2019s excellent piece about Saint and Greavsie on Big Website (yesterday\u2019s Still Want More?) presents an important linguistic distinction: the legendary striker suggests that life in the football media \u2018should be fun\u2019. Crucially, this is different to suggesting the football media \u2018should be funny\u2019, which is a naive expectation to project on to tea-timely emails across the country\u201d \u2013 Ed Taylor. \u201cSo I took the bait, and Googled HHAGTFABM (Fiver letters passim) and, to my surprise, there were not three, but five references.

In 2012 Fr\u00e4nk Schleck left the Tour there after a positive test, while Juan Jos\u00e9 Cobo, winner in the 2008 Tour\u2019s stage from Pau to Hautacam, was on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/18/cycling-chris-froome-awarded-2011-vuelta-title-after-cobo-doping-ban\" title=\"\">stripped of his own overall victory</a> in the 2011 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, in favour of Chris Froome. But 20 years after Armstrong\u2019s first win, where does cycling stand now? Rasmussen is not alone in his continuing scepticism. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s the possibility to get an advantage, somebody will be doing it, and the possibilities are there.\u201d</p> <p>In July 1999, when Armstrong took the first of his seven Tour titles, a French rider called Christophe Bassons raised his voice in protest, one of the few to be heard in a submissive peloton. The Texan, riled by Bassons\u2019 outspokenness, rounded on him, telling him to shut his mouth or go home.</p> <p>\u201cThe omert\u00e0 still exists in cycling,\u201d Bassons, who now works in anti-doping in the Nouvelle Aquitaine region, says. \u201cNobody wants to speak out but that\u2019s normal. They all have their secrets and most of the riders hope to move to working for TV or radio or driving a VIP guest car when they retire. I don\u2019t think things have changed that much. The will to cheat is still present, it\u2019s just harder to pull it off than before.\u201d</p> <p>Rasmussen admits that anti-doping in cycling is still lagging behind where it needs to be. \u201cI do believe that things are better but not that doping has gone away. It\u2019s not in the nature of sport. When you know that you have more Olympic medals won by asthmatics, it shows, it would be nice to think healthy people can beat sick people, but that\u2019s not the case at the Olympic Games.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c542a3467d2fa711aa3549458a38a97d2d4aa5c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c542a3467d2fa711aa3549458a38a97d2d4aa5c5/0_18_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Rasmussen in the yellow jersey on his way to victory on the Col d\u2019Aubisque in 2007.

Anti-doping controls and the work by the police and customs limits the spread of doping. If that wasn\u2019t in place there\u2019d be a lot more doping.</p> <p>\u201cAs for the governing bodies, I\u2019m not always sure they are motivated to fight doping. Some want to preserve their positions and prefer to look the other way. We will only be really able to fight doping when we change that way of thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Rasmussen is not alone in thinking that Armstrong\u2019s lifetime suspension was a judgment on him as a human being, rather than as an athlete.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that just because you think he\u2019s a bastard. There are no rules in cycling against that, in fact, the bastards are the ones that win.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is the hypocrisy. His teammates got six months\u2019 suspension for doing the same thing in the same team, in the same team bus, yet he got a lifetime suspension.\u201d</p> <p>While Bassons has turned his back on the sport, watching the Tour only occasionally out of \u201cprofessional interest\u201d, Rasmussen is working on this year\u2019s race for the Danish media. \u201cI love cycling and, if you love cycling, this is the place to be.</p> <p>\u201cI was eight years old when I told my local newspaper that I wanted to ride the Tour de France. I\u2019d been pursuing that for 25 years but I know that I will always be better known for what I didn\u2019t win than for what I won. It\u2019s something that I will take to my grave, a wound that won\u2019t ever heal.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Yellow Jersey by Peter Cossins, is published by Yellow Jersey Press</em></p>",

They all have their secrets and most of the riders hope to move to working for TV or radio or driving a VIP guest car when they retire. I don\u2019t think things have changed that much. The will to cheat is still present, it\u2019s just harder to pull it off than before.\u201d Rasmussen admits that anti-doping in cycling is still lagging behind where it needs to be. \u201cI do believe that things are better but not that doping has gone away. It\u2019s not in the nature of sport. When you know that you have more Olympic medals won by asthmatics, it shows, it would be nice to think healthy people can beat sick people, but that\u2019s not the case at the Olympic Games.\u201d Despite that, Bassons, bullied out of the 1999 Tour by Armstrong and seen as damaged goods for the rest of his racing career, insists he is optimistic. \u201cPeople often focus on what doesn\u2019t work, rather than what does work. Anti-doping controls and the work by the police and customs limits the spread of doping. If that wasn\u2019t in place there\u2019d be a lot more doping. \u201cAs for the governing bodies, I\u2019m not always sure they are motivated to fight doping. Some want to preserve their positions and prefer to look the other way. We will only be really able to fight doping when we change that way of thinking.\u201d Yet Rasmussen is not alone in thinking that Armstrong\u2019s lifetime suspension was a judgment on him as a human being, rather than as an athlete. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that just because you think he\u2019s a bastard. There are no rules in cycling against that, in fact, the bastards are the ones that win. \u201cThe problem is the hypocrisy. His teammates got six months\u2019 suspension for doing the same thing in the same team, in the same team bus, yet he got a lifetime suspension.\u201d While Bassons has turned his back on the sport, watching the Tour only occasionally out of \u201cprofessional interest\u201d, Rasmussen is working on this year\u2019s race for the Danish media. \u201cI love cycling and, if you love cycling, this is the place to be. \u201cI was eight years old when I told my local newspaper that I wanted to ride the Tour de France. I\u2019d been pursuing that for 25 years but I know that I will always be better known for what I didn\u2019t win than for what I won. It\u2019s something that I will take to my grave, a wound that won\u2019t ever heal.\u201d The Yellow Jersey by Peter Cossins, is published by Yellow Jersey Press",

      "bodyText": "Two environmental protesters campaigning against the HS2 high-speed rail link have walked free from court after a prosecution against them collapsed. Sarah Green, 63, a Green party member, and Laura Hughes, 37, of Extinction Rebellion, were both charged with aggravated trespass for protesting against work HS2 was carrying out in the Colne Valley nature reserve in Hillingdon, London, home to a variety of fauna and flora including bats, owls and osprey. Both of the accused repeatedly raised concerns about the destruction of wildlife habitats and damage to 22% of London\u2019s water supply caused by HS2 workers pile-driving into an aquifer on the site. At an earlier hearing, both women pleaded not guilty to charges in relation to obstructing a digger. The HS2 development has generated huge controversy about cost, usefulness and possible environmental damage. Environmental protesters have established a camp close to the Colne Valley HS2 works site and protesters have staged various demonstrations there in recent months. The prosecution at Uxbridge magistrates court related to a protest at the Colne Valley site on 11 December 2018. Green was alleged to have climbed on top of an HS2 digger and Hughes was alleged to have locked herself to the digger. The district judge presiding over the case, Deborah Wright, dismissed the case after she said it was not possible to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the protesters were trespassing on land in the possession of HS2. HS2 had previously admitted that a map it provided to the Crown Prosecution Service outlining which part of the site was covered by a high court injunction against protesters was incorrectly labeled. Two prosecution witnesses who were part of HS2\u2019s security team provided different accounts to the court on Wednesday of exactly where the two protesters were on the site at the time of the alleged offences. Various maps of land possessed by HS2 and the boundary of the high court injunction were submitted as part of the prosecution case. But there was confusion about exactly what land was and was not owned by HS2. Wright said: \u201cI would have a reasonable doubt about whether the ladies concerned were trespassing at the time of the alleged offence.\u201d The court looked at three separate pieces of land. The judge said: \u201cI\u2019m satisfied that two of these pieces of land were in possession of HS2. However, there\u2019s a narrow strip, the third piece of land, about which I have heard no evidence. It is the vicinity of the area where Ms Green and Ms Hughes are said to have trespassed on. This is an area, effectively, of fields. I cannot be sure beyond reasonable doubt that these offences occurred on land that was in the possession of HS2. The defendants are entitled to the benefit of the doubt. I\u2019m going to dismiss the case against them.\u201d Sailesh Mehta, the counsel for Green, said after the hearing: \u201cThese protestors are safeguarding future generations\u2019 right to a valuable resource. An attempt to curtail that has failed today in court. This is a case that should never have been brought before a court.\u201d Both Green and Hughes said their victory was bittersweet because their concerns about the damage HS2 is causing to the environment remained valid. Hughes said: \u201cAlthough I\u2019m happy that this weight has been lifted from me and my children, the weight of climate change and the destruction of my children\u2019s future remains.\u201d Green said: \u201cThe CPS relied on evidence from HS2 which was not accepted by the judge. On one level I feel relieved about today\u2019s outcome, but on another level I\u2019m not at all relieved because our drinking water is still under threat.\u201d Joe Rukin, of Stop HS2, said: \u201cThis is absolutely terrible news for HS2.

Viagogo said it was \u201cdelighted\u201d after a judge ruled it had complied with a court order obtained by the Competition and Markets Authority last year, ordering it to display clear information on its website about the face value of its tickets, typically sold at large mark-ups. The verdict appeared to be a boost for the company, a day after Google suspended its adverts in the light of claims by regulators and campaigners about persistent breaches of consumer law. However, the CMA said the ruling only related to a small element of its legal case against Viagogo, claiming that the firm was still not complying with much of the order. The order contains a litany of demands, including: that the website display clear information about touts selling tickets on the site; to stop pressure-selling tactics; and publish seat details, so that consumers can see what they are buying. \u201cToday\u2019s judgment does not mean that Viagogo is compliant with the court order the CMA secured against it,\u201d the regulator said. \u201cWe still think that Viagogo is breaching parts of the order and so continue to move forward with legal proceedings for contempt of court against the site in relation to those concerns. Viagogo said that its victory on one point of dispute with the CMA undermined the regulator\u2019s credibility on the court order\u2019s other details. The ticket resale site had earlier celebrated a judge\u2019s verdict that permits it to give information about the face value of seats by using \u201chover-over\u201d text, where price details appear when a web user moves their cursor over the ticket listing. Viagogo\u2019s managing director, Cris Miller said the court hearing \u201cdemonstrates that there are matters of interpretation of the order on which the CMA should not and cannot be relied upon to make the final determination\u201d. \u201cIt is clear there remains continued, yet unfounded, resistance from the CMA to our role in the market.\u201d But the CMA said Viagogo, which has been accused of exploiting fans of popular artists such as Arctic Monkeys and Adele, was overstating the judge\u2019s verdict. \u201cImportantly, today\u2019s judgment confirms that Viagogo cannot use \u2018hover-over text\u2019 unless specifically allowed by the order and it needs to stop displaying important information about deadlines under its guarantee in this way,\u201d the regulator said. \u201cAlthough the court found that information about face-value prices can be displayed with \u2018hover-over\u2019 text on one page of the site, Viagogo must still display this information on two other separate places on the face of its website.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "MPs have voted by a margin of 41 to approve an amendment intended to block a future government from proroguing parliament. Here\u2019s what we know. What does the amendment do? It seeks to make it very difficult for the next government (most likely led by Boris Johnson) to prorogue, or suspend, parliament as a means of blocking MPs from intervening to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Thursday\u2019s amendment, led by Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn and the Conservatives\u2019 Alistair Burt, adds to measures introduced in earlier amendments. How would it do this? The process of tacking amendments on to an otherwise technical bill about the long-suspended devolved Northern Ireland government began last week when MPs approved by one vote an amendment tabled by the Tory remainer Dominic Grieve that would require a minister to report to the Commons every two weeks until December on the progress of talks on restoring the Northern Ireland assembly. This was beefed up in the Lords with an amendment that would require the reports to be debated in the Commons within five calendar days. The amendment passed on Thursday added that if this could not happen because the Commons was prorogued or adjourned, parliament would have to meet on the day necessary to comply with the obligation and for the following five weekdays. Does this stop no deal? Not necessarily. It makes the final gambit of a Johnson government in proroguing parliament \u2013 something he has talked down but never ruled out \u2013 much more difficult, but a no-deal departure remains the default position on 31 October and will happen unless a new deal with the EU is struck or another option is imposed. A new concord with Brussels seems very unlikely after Johnson (and his leadership rival, Jeremy Hunt) committed to scrapping the entire Northern Ireland backstop insurance plan, and so for MPs to stop no deal they would need to either impose a deal, force another delay or block Brexit altogether. The first seems almost impossible and the others are politically very fraught. It very much remains to be seen what will happen. What does all this mean for Johnson? Not good news.

They are talking about a much harder version which would cause much more disruption to our economy and the OBR is clear that in that less benign version of no deal the hit would be much greater, the impact would be much harder, the recession would be bigger. So I greatly fear the impact on our economy and our public finances of the kind of no-deal Brexit that is realistically being discussed now.\u201d</p> <p>The OBR estimated that the recession \u2013 caused by the impact of increased uncertainty and falling confidence on investment and trade \u2013 would be as bad as that suffered in the 1990s but only a third as bad as the slump at the time of the financial crisis of the late 2000s.</p> <p>In its fiscal risks report, the OBR said its assessment was \u201crelatively benign\u201d because it was based on the less gloomy of two scenarios produced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/09/imf-no-deal-brexit-risks-two-year-recession-uk-economic\">International Monetary Fund</a> earlier this year.

      "bodyText": "Finally, here\u2019s our updated news story on the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s fiscal risks report, and its concerns about Brexit. A no-deal Brexit would plunge Britain into a recession that would shrink the economy by 2%, push unemployment above 5% and send house prices tumbling by around 10%, according to the government\u2019s independent forecasting body. In an assessment of the impact of Britain leaving the EU without a deal at the end of October, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the result would be a year-long downturn that would increase borrowing by \u00a330bn a year. The assessment prompted a fresh warning from the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to Brexiters calling for a \u201charder\u201d exit from the EU. \u201cThe report that the OBR have published this morning shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy, a very significant reduction in tax revenues and a big increase in our national debt \u2013 a recession caused by a no-deal Brexit,\u201d Hammond said in a Reuters interview. \u201cBut that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiteers. They are talking about a much harder version which would cause much more disruption to our economy and the OBR is clear that in that less benign version of no deal the hit would be much greater, the impact would be much harder, the recession would be bigger. So I greatly fear the impact on our economy and our public finances of the kind of no-deal Brexit that is realistically being discussed now.\u201d The OBR estimated that the recession \u2013 caused by the impact of increased uncertainty and falling confidence on investment and trade \u2013 would be as bad as that suffered in the 1990s but only a third as bad as the slump at the time of the financial crisis of the late 2000s. In its fiscal risks report, the OBR said its assessment was \u201crelatively benign\u201d because it was based on the less gloomy of two scenarios produced by the International Monetary Fund earlier this year. A worst-case scenario sketched out by the Bank of England last November estimated that the economy could shrink by as much as 8% in an even deeper recession than that of 2008-09. Full story here Over in New York, shares in Netflix have plunged by 10% in early trading. Netflix disappointed Wall Street last night by reporting a drop in US-based subscribers, for the first time in eight years. It also missed its target for international subscriber growth, putting some blame on recent price increases. Netflix has been spending $15bn per year on new content, driving up its debt pile, so a slowdown in growth is obviously worrying. There\u2019s not much market reaction to that vote, even though it underlines that MPs won\u2019t accept a no-deal Brexit. The pound is still up almost half a cent today at $1.247, and up half a eurocent at \u20ac1.112. Newsflash: MPs have backed an amendment that would try to stop Boris Johnson shutting down parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit by 315 votes to 274. That\u2019s a majority of 41, rather larger than expected. Several cabinet ministers are thought to have abstained, including chancellor Philip Hammond (who was spotted on Downing Street while the voting took place). Andy Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has all the action: Consumers appear to be shaking off Brexit uncertainty, by driving retail sales up last month. Retail spending jumped by 1% in June, partly due to Brits having a good old rummage through the local antique shop or charity chain. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: Retail sales in the UK were unexpectedly strong in June, boosted by sales of secondhand goods at charity shops and antique dealers, although department stores continued to struggle. The quantity of goods bought in June rose 1% from May, according to the Office for National Statistics. City economists had forecast a 0.3% drop in sales, following May\u2019s 0.6% fall. The figures boosted the pound by half a cent to $1.2480. However, there was a sharp slowdown in retail sales growth in the three months to June. Sales rose 0.7%, down from 1.6% in the previous three months \u2013 marking the weakest growth rate since the three months to February. More here: The Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s Brexit analysis certainly paint a worrying picture of life in Britain after a no-deal exit from the EU. Even though it uses the least severe of the IMF\u2019s two no-deal Brexit forecasts, the OBR assumes: Net migration into the UK is lower by 25,000 a year out to 2030. The UK enters a year-long recession in the fourth quarter of 2019. The pound immediately plunges by 10%, towards $1.1 against the US dollar Unemployment rises, peaking at just over 5 per cent in 2021 (compared with 3.8% today) Inflation rises, and wage growth slows, meaning real wages are \u201csignificantly lower\u201d \u2013 by 2.5 per cent by the start of 2024. House prices fall by almost 10% between the start of 2019 and mid-2021. The Bank of England cuts interest rates to around 0.2% by the end of 2020. Business investment falls a cumulative 15 per cent below the OBR\u2019s March forecast by the end of 2021 This all adds up to higher borrowing, up around \u00a330bn a year higher on average from 2020-21 onwards. That\u2019s because: Income tax and national insurance receipts fall, pushing up borrowing by around \u00a316.5bn a year Capital tax receipts fall sharply thanks to the falls in asset prices, especially in the housing market, adding around \u00a310 billion a year from 2020-21 onwards VAT falls by \u00a33bn a year, due to lower consumer spending Lower profits take around \u00a33bn off onshore corporation tax receipts Labour MP Chris Leslie is also concerned: John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor has seized on the OBR\u2019s warnings, urging fellow MPs to vote against a no-deal Brexit today. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s obvious the Conservative Party constitutes a clear and present danger to the economy and the wellbeing of everyone in the UK. \u201cWe know that a No Deal Brexit would devastate the UK economy and the public finances, and it comes on top of the failed economic approach for the last nine years. \u201cThis warning makes it even more imperative MPs from across Parliament back today\u2019s amendments to try and block the next Prime Minister from shutting down Parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit. \u201cThe OBR says that the current Chancellor has \u2018all but given up\u2019 on his borrowing targets, with the Treasury having lost its grip on spending just as the Chancellor has lost control over the Brexit argument in the Conservative Party. MPs will vote on an amendment passed by the House of Lords, which would prevent parliament being shut down, or \u2018prorogued\u2019, ahead of the 31st October Brexit deadline. The OBR\u2019s report has been published as many firms grapple with the threat of no-deal Brexit chaos. Clare Francis, head of Brexit advisory at law firm Pinsent Masons, says firms face \u2018shock waves\u2019 from a disorderly Brexit. \u201cThe OBR report brings the negative impact of a no-deal Brexit into sharp focus. For many this will send shockwaves through their business as they attempt to prepare for the very real possibility of a no-deal Brexit at the end of October. She warns that crashing out of the EU in late October is actually worse than exiting back in March: \u201cFor Industries that are exposed to a seasonal flow of goods, such as food and retail, a winter time EU exit creates a more extreme economic risk compared to the original spring time date. This means that those businesses exposed to seasonal fluctuations must step up plans to hedge against a no-deal Brexit. Streamlining supply chains, switching to UK suppliers and realigning the workforce could all bolster the foundations of businesses grappling with Brexit risk.\u201d Here\u2019s a clip of Philip Hammond warning against a no-deal Brexit: Philip Hammond, UK chancellor (for a few more days, anyway) has weighed in -- saying that a no-deal Brexit could be even more severe than the OBR has suggested. He told Sky News: The report that the OBR have published this morning shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy, a very significant reduction in tax revenues and a big increase in our national debt - a recession caused by a no-deal Brexit. But that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiters. They are talking about a much harder version, which would cause much more disruption to our economy. And the OBR is clear that in that less benign version of no-deal the hit would be much greater, the impact would be much harder, the recession would be bigger. So I greatly fear the impact on our economy and our public finances of the kind of no deal Brexit that is realistically being discussed now. Andrew Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has all the details. The OBR has also cautioned Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt against making extravagant pledges -- warning that there\u2019s no money for a \u2018free lunch\u2019. Today\u2019s fiscal risks report says: It must be understood that additional tax cuts or spending increases would push government borrowing and debt up from the levels expected in our forecasts and that there is no war-chest or pot of money set aside that would make them a free lunch. The Government does have room for manoeuvre against its \u2018fiscal mandate\u2019 for structural borrowing next year, but that does not provide an anchor for medium term tax and spending decisions. Both Johnson and Hunt have made expensive pledges during their battle to become Conservative Party leader, often based on the Brexit \u2018war chest\u2019 set aside by chancellor Philip Hammond. That, though, is simply extra borrowing not a wodge of cash - and it won\u2019t be free if Britain crashes out of the EU. The OBR are now taking questions from journalists at the fiscal risks press conference. Unfortunately they\u2019ve turned the live feed off. Fortunately the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam is tweeting. Sky\u2019s Ed Conway also points out that the OBR could have taken a more pessimistic view (but didn\u2019t): In conclusion, Robert Chote says that many of the shocks, pressures and risks \u201ctaken on by choice\u201d by the EU referendum are largely the same as two years ago. However, he warns that recent developments make no-deal a larger threat, warning: Brexit risks feel more prominent than two years ago, with no deal being countenanced at the highest levels, amid considerable uncertainty about what that would mean in practice. OBR chairman Chote also points out that the government appears to be losing its enthusiasm for balanced budgets. He says the risks from austerity fatigue have \u201cpartly crystallised\u201d, through higher health spending, while others are forming through the \u201cshopping lists\u201d of tax cuts and spending rises drawn up by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt Finally, there is an \u201copen discussion\u201d about how the goal of achieving a balanced budget by the mid-2020s might be replaced by something loose, he concludes. That\u2019s the end of his statement. Robert Chote adds that a no-deal Brexit would drive up inflation, due to new tariffs and the plunging pound But the OBR predicts that the Bank of England could choose to cut interest rates, tolerating higher prices in the shops, to prop up the economy and bring output back to its potential. The economic shock of no-deal would push up government borrowing would rise by around \u00a330bn a year, Chote add. Income tax and national insurance would fall (because jobs would be lost) Capital tax receipts fall sharply due to falling house prices and fewer transactions Debt spending would fall, though, due to lower interest rates This chart shows the details (anything above the x-axis is an extra cost, below the line are savings). Chote adds that the OBR assumes that the UK\u2019s current payments into the EU budget are simply \u201crecycled into domestic spending, including the divorce bill\u201d. Onto Brexit! Robert Chote says the OBR\u2019s economics have crunched the fiscal impact of a no-deal Brexit, and concluded that it would push the UK economy into recession. In a timely warning to Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, he says: The big picture is that heightened uncertainty and declining confidence deter investment, higher trade barriers with the EU weigh on domestic and foreign demand, while the pound and other asset prices fall sharply. These factors combine to push the economy into recession. These charts (based on the IMF\u2019s latest work) show the scale of the damage: The OBR has also looked at the risk that climate change poses to the UK\u2019s finances. OBR chief Robert Chote tells the press conference that the scale of the risks depends hugely on the extent to which global temperatures rise (fair enough!). If the targets outlined in the Paris Agreement are met, then climate change could be less costly than other threats, Chote suggests. However... But if global mitigation fails, and temperature rises are more significant, the risks could be greater and harder to assess. This would make mass international migration and induced period of conflict more likely. OBR chief Robert Chote is now outlining a list of spending risks that could threaten the UK. Medium term risks include: austerity fatigue, health spending and welfare reforms. Long-term risks include social care costs, Britain\u2019s ageing population, and the pensions \u2018triple-lock\u2019 (under which pensions rise by inflation, wage growth, or at least 2%). On social care, Chote says it would be \u201cnice\u201d to present some new analysis, but as the government\u2019s response to the Dilnot Review has been languishing in Whitehall for years, the OBR can\u2019t crunch the numbers. He also tacitly criticises the decision to remove free TV licences from over-75s, saying it is \u201cunusual\u201d to delegate decisions about welfare benefits to a broadcasting company [the BBC]. Our economics editor Larry Elliott has swiftly analysed the OBR\u2019s Brexit forecasts, and reports: A no-deal Brexit would plunge Britain into a recession that would shrink the economy by two per cent by the end of next year, according to the Government\u2019s independent forecasting body. The Office for Budget Responsibility said increased uncertainty and falling confidence would deter investment and hit trade. In its latest Fiscal Risks Report the OBR said: \u201cTogether, these push the economy into recession, with asset prices and the pound falling sharply.\u201c Real GDP falls by 2% by the end of 2020 and is 4% below our March forecast by that point.\u201d Up until now the OBR has been assuming a smooth Brexit when coming up with its forecasts but it said the willingness of both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt to contemplate a no deal departure meant it was stress testing alternative scenarios. The OBR said leaving without a deal would add \u00a330bn a year to borrowing from 2020-1 onwards and lift the net debt by 12% of GDP by 2023-4. \u201cA more disruptive or disorderly scenario could hit the public finances much harder\u201d the OBR said. The OBR used the IMF model of the economy to make its forecasts. OBR chief Robert Chote says that the UK economy may have shrunk in the last quarter, partly because of Brexit stockpiling earlier in 2019. This dragged activity forwards into January-March, as firms tried to hoard raw materials, parts, and finished goods in case of disruption at the ports. The OBR\u2019s fiscal risks report is out, and as predicted it warns that Britain would be dragged into recession after a no-deal Brexit. Worryingly, Britain\u2019s fiscal watchdog says that weak business surveys from June suggest that Britain may already be entering a \u201cfull-blown recession\u201d. It warns: Surveys were particularly weak in June, suggesting that the pace of growth is likely to remain weak. This raises the risk that the economy may be entering a full-blown recession. The fiscal risks posed by recessions depend on their depth and persistence, the sectors most deeply affected, and the pace at which the economy subsequently recovers If Britain leaves the EU without a deal, the OBR explains that UK tax revenues would shrink, pushing up government borrowing. The OBR estimates that UK government borrowing would be around \u00a330bn a year higher than planner in 2020-21, based on the International Monetary Fund\u2019s analysis from April (explained at 8.23am). However, the OBR also warns that the IMF\u2019s forecasts are \u2018more benign\u2019 than other views, and \u2018by no means a worst-case scenario\u2019. That suggests that a no-deal Brexit could be even worse than thought.... The report is online here. More to follow.... The Office for Budget Responsibility will release its Fiscal risks report 2019 in a few minutes, followed by a press conference which will be streamed here: Some relief for UK holidaymakers heading abroad this summer - the pound is rising this morning. Sterling has gained a third of a cent to $1.2467 against the US dollar, having hit a 27-month low below $1.24 on Wednesday. It\u2019s also slightly higher against the euro at \u20ac1.109, having hit a six-month low this week amid no-deal Brexit fears. On Wednesday, investment bank Morgan Stanley warned that the pound could plunge towards parity with the dollar - for the first time since the 1980s. \u201cThe pound has come under intense selling pressure since Prime Minister May withdrew from her party leadership position, leaving markets with increased concern that the UK may be heading towards a harder Brexit. Should this scenario materialise, pound-dollar could fall into the $1.00-$1.10 range.\u201d Conservative MP Rishi Sunak, a Boris Johnson supporter, thinks we should be sceptical about the OBR\u2019s Brexit warnings: True, employment is at a record high - although recent gains have been driven by more people taking self-employed, part-time roles. Plus, business investment has actually been weak since the 2016 referendum, as this chart from the Bank of England shows. Here\u2019s some reaction to the OBR\u2019s no-deal Brexit warning (even though it\u2019s not been published yet). Neil Foster of the GMB Union hopes it will concentrate minds in Westminster: Asset manager Trevor Greetham points out that leaving with a deal is expected to also slow the UK economy (although not by as much as a no-deal shock). Today\u2019s OBR fiscal risks report will also analyse possible risks to the public finances from climate change. This may tackle the \u201ctragedy of the horizon\u201d - basically, once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability, it may already be too late [Bank of England governor Mark Carney gave a good speech on this recently] Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt is discussing Brexit on Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme now, and admitted that No-Dealt could be a \u2018short-term\u2019 economic shock Q: Will a no-deal Brexit be disastrous? Hunt argues that the 2016 referendum must be implemented, despite economic costs, saying: I don\u2019t think anyone should minimise the fact there will be economic consequences to no deal. but we should also recognise that we are a democracy. We must do what we are committed to do in the referendum, Q: Democracy doesn\u2019t pay for new schools and hospitals, money does. The chancellor says there is a \u00a390bn cost from a no-deal Brexit over five years. [Brexiter Conservative MP] Jacob Rees-Mogg says we\u2019d be richer. Who\u2019s right? Hunt argues that Britain could ride out the \u2018shock\u2019 of leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement. Even with the shock of a no-deal Brexit, over time we could make it work and we could flourish and prosper and we could indeed become richer as a country. [But] I wouldn\u2019t minimise the fact there could be a short-term shock. Hunt also warned \u201cEuropean friends\u201d that they would be blamed if Britain couldn\u2019t get an acceptable deal, and crashed out of the EU: We would have European neighbours that had deliberately chosen to make the UK poorer, and that would change and harden British attitudes to Europe for a generation. That\u2019s not something that wiser heads in Europe actually want. The OBR\u2019s no-deal Brexit analysis will be based on work released by the International Monetary Fund in April. The IMF outlined a scenario under which there was no border disruption after a no-deal Brexit, but some new trade barriers were created by customs and regulatory border controls. Under this Scenario A, import costs rise (although the government sets tariffs at zero to limit the impact), immigration is restricted, and financial conditions tightened (making credit more expensive, say). The IMF calculated that this means UK GDP would be around 3.5% smaller in 2021 than if the country left with a deal. The Fund also modelled a second scenario (B) in which there are \u201csignificant border disruptions that increase import costs for UK firms and households\u201d. That creates a much deeper recession, as this charts hows: This chart also shows that even after leaving with a deal (the yellow line), the UK economy is smaller than if the EU referendum had never happened. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial crisis, the eurozone and business. A new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s economy is expected to warn today that a no-deal Brexit would plunge the country into recession. The Office for Budget Responsibility (the fiscal watchdog) will outline how the UK economy would suffer if Britain fell out of the EU without a deal. Under the OBR\u2019s no-deal scenario, the UK economy would contract in 2020, and end up 3% smaller in five years time than if it left with a deal. The warning will come in the OBR\u2019s new Fiscal Risks Report for 2019, released today. This is a serious, weighty report, looking at the strength and weaknesses of the UK public finances, and the threats which could undermine them in the future. It will include a fiscal \u2018stress test\u2019, measuring if the UK is really prepared to handle a wide range of topics including: macroeconomic and financial sector risks, specific revenue and spending risks, and balance sheet risks. The report is due at 9.30am, but The Times has already had a sniff of it. It reports: Britain will slip into recession next year and the economy will be 3 per cent smaller if there is a no-deal Brexit, the UK\u2019s official economic forecaster is expected to say today. The Office for Budget Responsibility is due to give its first assessment of the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit, including how it may affect household incomes, wages, employment and house prices. The five-year forecast predicts that the economy will contract in 2020 as the UK officially enters into a recession, The Times understands. The economy is forecast to recover the following year, but GDP is still likely to be at least 3 per cent lower under a no-deal than if the UK leaves the EU with a deal. The warning is well timed, with the two contenders to replace Theresa May both insisting that they would take the UK out without a deal if they become prime minister. Boris Johnson even waved an Isle of Man kipper at Tory members last night, in an odd attack on the burden which the European Union places on producers [But....the Isle of Man isn\u2019t in the EU, but is following its food rules so it can trade, just like the UK would have to....] With the pound already wallowing at a 27-month low this week, Brexit concerns are mounting. We\u2019ll have full coverage of the OBR\u2019s report from 9.30am. Also coming up today UK consumers have kept the economy motoring along since the Brexit vote. New retail sales figures will show whether people are cutting back, or still spending thanks to rising wages. Economists predict a small drop in spending compared to May. A larger decline might intensify concerns about a recession. The agenda 9.30am BST: OBR publishes UK Fiscal Risks Report 2019 9.30am BST: UK retail sales for June (expected to drop by 0.3%, including fuel). 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless figures",

No doubt her successor will take this into account when forming their government.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson, the clear favourite to be declared winner of the Conservative leadership contest against Jeremy Hunt next week and thus replace May as prime minister, has repeatedly refused to rule out using prorogation to ensure a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8155cfc9-4f92-4da0-8485-66257baf0e4f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Prorogation is the official term that marks the end of a parliamentary session. After being advised to do so by the prime minister, the Queen formally prorogues parliament. This takes the form of an announcement in the House of Lords on the Queen\u2019s behalf. It is a speech, written by the government, which usually describes the bills that have been passed during that session and summarises what has been achieved.</p>\n    <p>It means that all work on existing legislation stops, and MPs and Lords stop sitting. Prorogation also automatically kills any bills, early day motions or questions to ministers going through parliament.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Parliament can then be reopened a few days later with a fresh slate of legislation intentions, set out in a new Queen\u2019s speech at the formal state opening of parliament.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The scale of the victory highlights the struggle he will have to impose his will on Brexit or other subjects over a Commons without a Tory majority and where Conservative internal discipline has broken down.</p> \n<p>James said after the vote the majority was emphatic because of the concerns of so many ministers and ex-ministers who rebelled or abstained. She hinted more resignations could come after Johnson was confirmed as leader.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think we have to wait and see what happens next. Jeremy Hunt would behave in an appropriate way, he does not believe in proroguing parliament, which is just too extreme, so I don\u2019t expect people to resign until they know for sure what the outcome is next week,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is difficult for anyone to resign, yes, and very difficult for me. I love my job and I felt I still had lot more to do. Unless you are completely sure, it is very hard. And I\u2019ve been through the lobby to support the PM\u2019s deal three times. It\u2019s not been easy for me. My constituents voted emphatically to leave and I will honour that. But when it comes to protecting the right of parliament, that is really important.\u201d</p> \n<p>Keith Simpson, a Tory veteran, said he planned to toast his first ever rebellion with a glass of wine. \u201cThis is the first time I have rebelled against my party in 22 years in parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a huge national issue. I said months ago to my local paper and my association that I was totally against no deal.

      "bodyText": "MPs have easily passed a backbench amendment seeking to block any attempt by a future government to prorogue parliament to ensure a no-deal Brexit, in what is likely to be seen as a pre-emptive strike against Boris Johnson\u2019s authority. The amendment, tabled by a cross-party group led by Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn and the Conservatives\u2019 Alistair Burt, passed by an unexpectedly large margin of 41 votes, with 315 MPs backing it and 274 opposed. One of those to support the measure was the culture, media and sport minister Margot James, who resigned from her post to do so. Among a series of other ministers who did not vote and who are understood not to have had permission to miss it were the chancellor, Philip Hammond; the justice secretary, David Gauke; the business secretary, Greg Clark; and Rory Stewart, the international development secretary. It is understood they were not paired with an opposition absentee and so were expected by Theresa May to obey the three-line whip. In a pointed statement afterwards, a spokesman for May said: \u201cThe prime minister is obviously disappointed that a number of ministers failed to vote in this afternoon\u2019s division. No doubt her successor will take this into account when forming their government.\u201d Johnson, the clear favourite to be declared winner of the Conservative leadership contest against Jeremy Hunt next week and thus replace May as prime minister, has repeatedly refused to rule out using prorogation to ensure a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. The scale of the victory highlights the struggle he will have to impose his will on Brexit or other subjects over a Commons without a Tory majority and where Conservative internal discipline has broken down. James said after the vote the majority was emphatic because of the concerns of so many ministers and ex-ministers who rebelled or abstained. She hinted more resignations could come after Johnson was confirmed as leader. \u201cI think we have to wait and see what happens next. Jeremy Hunt would behave in an appropriate way, he does not believe in proroguing parliament, which is just too extreme, so I don\u2019t expect people to resign until they know for sure what the outcome is next week,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is difficult for anyone to resign, yes, and very difficult for me. I love my job and I felt I still had lot more to do. Unless you are completely sure, it is very hard. And I\u2019ve been through the lobby to support the PM\u2019s deal three times. It\u2019s not been easy for me. My constituents voted emphatically to leave and I will honour that. But when it comes to protecting the right of parliament, that is really important.\u201d Keith Simpson, a Tory veteran, said he planned to toast his first ever rebellion with a glass of wine. \u201cThis is the first time I have rebelled against my party in 22 years in parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a huge national issue. I said months ago to my local paper and my association that I was totally against no deal. So this is the first time I have rebelled but you can get a taste for it.\u201d The Benn-Burt plan beefs up earlier amendments made to an otherwise technical Northern Ireland bill. It is designed to thwart prorogation, though experts remain split over whether MPs can definitively block this. When the bill was first considered by the Commons, MPs passed by a single vote an earlier amendment by Dominic Grieve intended to make it more difficult for a future government to prorogue parliament. Grieve\u2019s first amendment required a minister to report to the Commons every two weeks until December on the progress of talks on restoring the Northern Ireland assembly \u2013 though it remained unclear whether this could be done as a written report, meaning the chamber would not necessarily have to sit. This was later changed via another amendment in the Lords, tabled by David Anderson, a former independent reviewer of terror legislation, with support from Labour and the Liberal Democrats. This said the fortnightly reports demanded by Grieve\u2019s amendments would have to be debated within five calendar days of being produced, thus necessitating that the Commons sits. When the bill returned to the Commons Grieve then added another tweak via a last-minute amendment, intending to increase the power to block prorogation even more. It specified that if ministers could not meet the obligation to update the Commons because it was prorogued or adjourned, parliament would have to meet on the day necessary to comply with the obligation and for the following five weekdays. The bill to which all these were attached was initially a simple one intended to delay elections and budgets for the long-suspended Northern Ireland assembly and executive.

      "body": "<p>One of the most significant fiction writers in English is retiring, to the greatest fanfare of his singular and titanically influential career. Alan Moore has promised that the (extremely late) final issue of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen will be his last comic, and his final contribution to an art form he utterly transformed, sometimes to his chagrin. His work in the 1980s on Miracleman, a deconstruction of the superhero myth, inspired so many imitators to darken formerly kid-friendly heroes that Moore has apologised more than once for it.</p> \n<p>A brainy pop writer whose style veers between Stephen King and John le Carr\u00e9, Moore\u2019s influence can be felt everywhere \u2013 in our literature, on our screens, in our politics.

Those can run to hundreds of pages, describing every layer of background and every tertiary character. The scripts themselves, occasionally enclosed in deluxe editions of his work, are as detailed as David Foster Wallace novels. Describing Batman\u2019s home city to artist Brian Bolland in the script for The Killing Joke, Moore wrote: \u201cThe lower and seedier levels of Gotham are more inclined towards a territory somewhere between David Lynch and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, all patches of rust and mould and hissing steam and damp, glistening alleyways. I imagine this strip as having an oppressively dark film noir feel to it, with a lot of unpleasantly tangible textures, such as you habitually render so delightfully, to give the whole thing a really intense feeling of palpable unease and craziness.\u201d And Moore\u2019s collaborators have always risen to his challenges, turning this overwriting into eye-popping set pieces.</p> \n<p>Before Moore, and the likes of Frank Miller, Dave Sim and the Hernandez brothers, the idea that serialised comics could amount to literature was laughable, and that adults could enjoy them without irony creepy. But Moore has had a preternatural grasp of the intricacies of a genre \u2013 superheroes \u2013 widely considered to be devoid of them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5885fdc0fea33d3f3d21fea35a35e16433bb008f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5885fdc0fea33d3f3d21fea35a35e16433bb008f/133_0_1333_800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Joker in Alan Moore\u2019s The Killing Joke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Joker in Alan Moore\u2019s The Killing Joke.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DC Comics</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He asked troubling questions of superheroes, who had always appeared in stories that retroactively rewrote themselves and seemed to go on forever. Where was the end of these stories? Had we fully understood their beginnings? Was heroism even possible? The fates of silly costumed heroes became urgent in his hands: Krypto the Super-Dog, the shambling bog-monster Swamp Thing, a kid flying ace named Jetlad \u2013 each of these characters has moved me to tears.</p> \n<p>Moore can be tiresome \u2013 his digressions into the minutiae of Kabbalah in his Wonder Woman-style fantasy comic Promethea are insufferable \u2013 but he could also be delightful. Top 10, his affectionate send-up of cop shows, was a riot of sight gags, rendered by artists Gene Ha and Zander Cannon. Parody and melodrama keep close company in his work, especially in what is arguably his masterpiece: The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, created with the brilliant artist Kevin O\u2019Neill. One character murders another with his magic penis at one point. It\u2019s quite moving.</p> \n<p>This lurid streak can make Moore a tough sell. One Swamp Thing features an issue-length sex scene in which one participant is a plant; yet the books\u2019 central relationship hinges on the idea that Swamp Thing is the best man a woman could hope for, despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 his plant-ness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ded5026fa04ca330b324a4091afa62e59d363638\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ded5026fa04ca330b324a4091afa62e59d363638/0_692_5310_3187/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anonymous protestors at a demonstration in Paris, 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anonymous protestors at a demonstration in Paris, 2012.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khanh Renaud/SIPA/Rex Features</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Moore as the saviour of superheroes is ironic in many ways.

      "bodyText": "One of the most significant fiction writers in English is retiring, to the greatest fanfare of his singular and titanically influential career. Alan Moore has promised that the (extremely late) final issue of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen will be his last comic, and his final contribution to an art form he utterly transformed, sometimes to his chagrin. His work in the 1980s on Miracleman, a deconstruction of the superhero myth, inspired so many imitators to darken formerly kid-friendly heroes that Moore has apologised more than once for it. A brainy pop writer whose style veers between Stephen King and John le Carr\u00e9, Moore\u2019s influence can be felt everywhere \u2013 in our literature, on our screens, in our politics. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, quoted Watchmen\u2019s Rorschach on Twitter, in response to reports that she was agitating the Democrats. (\u201cI\u2019m not locked up in here with YOU. You\u2019re locked up in here with ME.\u201d) Writers as diverse as China Mi\u00e9ville and Ta-Nehisi Coates have cited him as inspiration. HBO\u2019s great post-Game of Thrones hope is yet another adaptation of Moore\u2019s most popular book, Watchmen, which (co-authored with illustrator Dave Gibbons) has sold millions of copies since it was first published in 1987. He\u2019s played himself on The Simpsons, seen his work adapted into a number of films \u2013 none very good \u2013 and even inspired an activist collective: the Anonymous group wear Guy Fawkes masks as a tribute to V, the anarchist hero of Moore\u2019s and illustrator David Lloyd\u2019s V for Vendetta. Moore draws very rarely, instead he writes comics scripts, and at punishing length. Those can run to hundreds of pages, describing every layer of background and every tertiary character. The scripts themselves, occasionally enclosed in deluxe editions of his work, are as detailed as David Foster Wallace novels. Describing Batman\u2019s home city to artist Brian Bolland in the script for The Killing Joke, Moore wrote: \u201cThe lower and seedier levels of Gotham are more inclined towards a territory somewhere between David Lynch and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, all patches of rust and mould and hissing steam and damp, glistening alleyways. I imagine this strip as having an oppressively dark film noir feel to it, with a lot of unpleasantly tangible textures, such as you habitually render so delightfully, to give the whole thing a really intense feeling of palpable unease and craziness.\u201d And Moore\u2019s collaborators have always risen to his challenges, turning this overwriting into eye-popping set pieces. Before Moore, and the likes of Frank Miller, Dave Sim and the Hernandez brothers, the idea that serialised comics could amount to literature was laughable, and that adults could enjoy them without irony creepy. But Moore has had a preternatural grasp of the intricacies of a genre \u2013 superheroes \u2013 widely considered to be devoid of them. He asked troubling questions of superheroes, who had always appeared in stories that retroactively rewrote themselves and seemed to go on forever. Where was the end of these stories? Had we fully understood their beginnings? Was heroism even possible? The fates of silly costumed heroes became urgent in his hands: Krypto the Super-Dog, the shambling bog-monster Swamp Thing, a kid flying ace named Jetlad \u2013 each of these characters has moved me to tears. Moore can be tiresome \u2013 his digressions into the minutiae of Kabbalah in his Wonder Woman-style fantasy comic Promethea are insufferable \u2013 but he could also be delightful. Top 10, his affectionate send-up of cop shows, was a riot of sight gags, rendered by artists Gene Ha and Zander Cannon. Parody and melodrama keep close company in his work, especially in what is arguably his masterpiece: The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, created with the brilliant artist Kevin O\u2019Neill. One character murders another with his magic penis at one point. It\u2019s quite moving. This lurid streak can make Moore a tough sell. One Swamp Thing features an issue-length sex scene in which one participant is a plant; yet the books\u2019 central relationship hinges on the idea that Swamp Thing is the best man a woman could hope for, despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 his plant-ness. Moore as the saviour of superheroes is ironic in many ways. For one, his work suggests that they are at best feckless and at worst possibly fascis. For another, the process of working with DC Comics, which published his work during his two great fertile periods in the mid-80s and late 90s, so embittered him to the industry that he has often repudiated his own work on corporate superheroes, just as it acquired pop cultural success: video games, action figures, spin-offs.

The commission chair, Mary Ann Glendon, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/trump-administration-s-new-human-rights-commission-alarms-lgbtq-advocates-n1028276\">opposes</a> reproductive rights and marriage equality.</p> <p>While the Trump administration seeks to redefine human rights, it is clearly ignoring the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which itself built on the fundamental freedoms enshrined in America\u2019s own bill of rights.

And there has long been a debate about the best way to secure human rights at home and abroad. But the arc of American history has trended towards increased protection for human rights at home and a growing recognition of supporting human rights around the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump administration has been actively attempting to undermine human rights at home and abroad</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the Trump team doesn\u2019t appear to want to participate in these debates in good faith. Trump has a very clear anti-human rights agenda, and the Trump administration has been actively attempting to undermine human rights at home and abroad. The administration has worked to roll back protections for LGBTQ individuals. It has attacked the reproductive rights of women. It has treated \u2013 and spoken about \u2013 migrants and refugees as less than human. It is trying to revoke protections for those who want to apply for asylum in the US. It launches dangerous attacks on the media and free speech. Trump personally defends the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un\u2019s brutal repression. The list goes on and on and on.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, the Trump administration wants to gaslight Americans into believing that this new commission is necessary because the fight to expand rights protections somehow gives cover to other countries to abuse the language of human rights to defend their repression. Pompeo speciously said: \u201cRights claims are often aimed more at rewarding interest groups and dividing humanity into subgroups. Oppressive regimes like Iran and Cuba have taken advantage of this cacophonous call for \u2018rights\u2019, even pretending to be avatars of freedom.\u201d You read that right: the secretary of state is blaming people who work to protect human rights for supposedly helping authoritarian regimes.</p> <p>And this is the Orwellian goal of the Trump administration. They want everyone to believe that what they are doing is in support of laudable goals \u2013 freedom, democracy, security, choose your own lofty noun. They make racist and antisemitic <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-ilhan-omar-anti-semitism-hypocrisy_n_5c63358de4b08da0ec7fbfd1\">comments</a> against others while claiming that they are somehow fighting antisemitism and defending Israel. They tear away children from their parents and place them in cages and claim that it is all a deterrent to protect those same migrants from the dangers of the journey to the United States.</p> <p>In his novel about a fictional totalitarian regime, 1984, George Orwell memorably wrote that one of the regime\u2019s mottos is: \u201cWar is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.\u201d The Trump administration is doing its best to make this kind of gaslighting a reality in America. Don\u2019t be surprised if one of the conclusions of this new commission is \u201chuman rights is repression\u201d.</p>",

But the arc of American history has trended towards increased protection for human rights at home and a growing recognition of supporting human rights around the world. But the Trump team doesn\u2019t appear to want to participate in these debates in good faith. Trump has a very clear anti-human rights agenda, and the Trump administration has been actively attempting to undermine human rights at home and abroad. The administration has worked to roll back protections for LGBTQ individuals. It has attacked the reproductive rights of women. It has treated \u2013 and spoken about \u2013 migrants and refugees as less than human. It is trying to revoke protections for those who want to apply for asylum in the US. It launches dangerous attacks on the media and free speech. Trump personally defends the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un\u2019s brutal repression. The list goes on and on and on. What\u2019s more, the Trump administration wants to gaslight Americans into believing that this new commission is necessary because the fight to expand rights protections somehow gives cover to other countries to abuse the language of human rights to defend their repression. Pompeo speciously said: \u201cRights claims are often aimed more at rewarding interest groups and dividing humanity into subgroups. Oppressive regimes like Iran and Cuba have taken advantage of this cacophonous call for \u2018rights\u2019, even pretending to be avatars of freedom.\u201d You read that right: the secretary of state is blaming people who work to protect human rights for supposedly helping authoritarian regimes. And this is the Orwellian goal of the Trump administration. They want everyone to believe that what they are doing is in support of laudable goals \u2013 freedom, democracy, security, choose your own lofty noun. They make racist and antisemitic comments against others while claiming that they are somehow fighting antisemitism and defending Israel. They tear away children from their parents and place them in cages and claim that it is all a deterrent to protect those same migrants from the dangers of the journey to the United States. In his novel about a fictional totalitarian regime, 1984, George Orwell memorably wrote that one of the regime\u2019s mottos is: \u201cWar is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.\u201d The Trump administration is doing its best to make this kind of gaslighting a reality in America. Don\u2019t be surprised if one of the conclusions of this new commission is \u201chuman rights is repression\u201d.",

That\u2019s worth keeping in mind when trying to understand why Donald Trump Twitter-trolled four progressive, first-term congresswomen of color \u2013 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2013 in his now-infamous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/14/trump-squad-tlaib-omar-pressley-ocasio-cortez\">\u201cgo back\u201d tweet</a>.

And their greatest obstacle is the Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/17/trump-attacks-squad-scared-politics\">Here's the real reason Trump is attacking 'the squad': he's scared | Joshua Leifer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Squad have welcomed and sought out public attention because they want to use their celebrity to push the party to the left, just as the conservative movement pushed the Republican party to the right in decades past. They believe that this transformation not only will lead to progressive legislative victories, it will also win elections. As Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp/2019/07/10/feature/how-saikat-chakrabarti-became-aocs-chief-of-change/?utm_term=.afe913e8707d\">recently told</a> the Washington Post:</p> <p>\u201cThe whole theory of change for the current Democratic party is that to win this country we need to tack to the hypothetical middle. What I think that means is, you don\u2019t take unnecessary risks, which translates to: you don\u2019t really do anything. Whereas we\u2019ve got a completely different theory of change, which is: you do the biggest, most badass thing you possibly can \u2013 and that\u2019s going to excite people, and then they\u2019re going to go vote.\u201d</p> <p>One implication of this approach, obviously, is that progressives should advance ambitious leftwing policies \u2013 like Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal, pulled directly from the <a href=\"https://www.dsausa.org/strategy/where_we_stand/\">demands</a> of the Democratic Socialists of America \u2013 without negotiating or compromising with moderate Democrats, let alone Republicans. Another is that moderate Democrats who object to progressive policies have to be shamed and pressured into getting with the program \u2013 as Chakrabarti tried to do by <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/politics/aoc-chief-of-staff-compares-moderate-dems-to-southern-racists/\">comparing</a> moderates to segregationists \u2013 or removed through primary election challenges from the left, as Ocasio-Cortez has <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/mar/1/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-threatens-primary-challen/\">threatened</a>. These policies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/01/herbal-tea-party-left-wing-trump-resistance\">worked for the Tea Party</a> on the Republican side, so the thinking goes, so why shouldn\u2019t they work for progressives?</p> <p>Yet another implication of this approach is that progressives shouldn\u2019t attempt to win over swing voters \u2013 particularly white voters \u2013 but instead should maximize turnout from minorities, who lean Democratic by wide margins but typically <a href=\"https://news.iu.edu/stories/2018/10/iub/releases/22-turnout-gap-book-racial-inequality-voting.html\">don\u2019t vote at the same rates</a> as whites. The model here is Stacey Abrams, who in her 2018 Georgia gubernatorial campaign nearly became the first African American woman to be elected governor of any state, largely on the strength of her success in getting minorities to the polls and driving voter turnout to <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/midterm-voter-turnout-surges-georgia/P51TgGVyRJxwcKufdXKncM/\">record highs</a>. According to this theory, the rising prominence of Ocasio-Cortez and her cohort, who embody the Democrats\u2019 growing diversity and progressivism, can excite minority turnout to such a level that the country\u2019s move toward <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/03/14/the-us-will-become-minority-white-in-2045-census-projects/\">majority minority</a> demographics finally translates to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/the-emerging-democratic-majority-turns-10/265005/\">Democratic political dominance</a>.</p> <p>For all these reasons, progressives want the Squad to be the new face of the Democratic party. Pelosi, however, disagrees. The San Franciscan is a progressive herself but also an adept political calculator, who understands that Democrats regained the House in 2018 by <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-house-will-have-just-as-many-moderate-democrats-as-progressives-next-year/\">running moderate candidates</a> in Republican-held districts.

She fears that the majority making districts \u2013 and the Democratic House majority \u2013 will revert to Republican control if their college-educated, mostly suburban and mostly white swing voters who were repelled by Trump in 2018 turn out to be even more repelled by the Democrats\u2019 most extreme members in 2020.</p> <p>Pelosi is also well aware that while the Squad have an intense following among leftwing activists and on social media, overall they are some of the most unpopular politicians in America. A recent <a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/FMfcgxwChmJVbBZVpRwqsJWRRCpPTTdM\">poll</a> of swing district voters found that Ocasio-Cortez was recognized by nearly three-quarters of voters but viewed favorably by only 22%. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s self-proclaimed ideology of socialism was viewed favorably by only 18% of those surveyed \u2013 which still made it twice as popular as Omar, who was viewed favorably by only 9%. Those are toxic levels of unpopularity.

      "bodyText": "It is hardly a science but for a rough indication of how promoted clubs can best make a fist of staying up, perhaps it is best to examine some of the more disastrous recent attempts. Derby\u2019s record-low points tally in 2008 sticks in the memory, as does Queens Park Rangers\u2019 feeble effort, largely under Harry Redknapp, four years ago, in which they finished bottom of the pile. But it was the manner in which Fulham spectacularly failed to avoid the drop last season \u2013 bulldozing all the hard work that helped them to the Premier League in the first place \u2013 that struck a chord with Stuart Webber, the sporting director at Norwich City, who won the Championship in May. \u201cI don\u2019t know the ins and outs at Fulham this past year but it is a great reminder for clubs like ourselves that you can spend \u00a3100m and look what happens,\u201d Webber, who claims Norwich will operate with the lowest budget in the top flight this season, told the Eastern Daily Press. \u201cWe\u2019re custodians of this place and we have to make sure that we leave it in a better place than we found it.

We made In This World a long time ago. Just recently I\u2019ve been working with refugees - this time Syrian refugees still living in Greece. I think people obviously become refugees because they feel they have no choice - they are forced to leave their home. None of them want to leave their home. In the case of In this World we made it with two real Afghan refugees: Enayatullah and Jamal. They were both living in Peshawar, in Pakistan when we met them. The idea was always that they would take part in the film and then go back to their families. In the case of Jamal he later returned as a refugee to England so his real story repeated the fictional story in the film. And it took many years for him to win the right to stay in this country. And for sure his life here has not been easy. But that was the choice he made. For him like for many refugees they come knowing it will be difficult for them but in the hope that later it will be easier for their families, either because they can send money back home or because they can bring their families to join them here. I was filming at a refugee camp on Lebos just a few weeks ago. There are still about 70,000 refugees living in Greece. I think Britain\u2019s reaction to the refugee crisis is shameful and I think it\u2019s outrageous that that we have accepted so few refugees into this country. If you think back to the 1930s it seemed terrible that we did so little then to help people fleeing Germany. Yet our record now is even worse. I think people will look back on this time and wonder how we were able to be so callous.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5888ab336316682acb1a720330e19c9c7592eb02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5888ab336316682acb1a720330e19c9c7592eb02/0_112_1772_1063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamal Udin Torabi, left, and Enayatullah.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In This World \u2026 Jamal Udin Torabi, left, and Enayatullah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T12:47:38.446Z\">at 1.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d3067328f08d0b6ca5330e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T12:35:08.582Z\">1.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4002396\">darrenlollipopman</a> says: </p> <p>The Killer Inside Me was one of the best adaptations of Jim Thompson, but was mostly shot down by the critics.

I'm a big fan of Jim Thompson and when we made the film we tried to make as literal a version of his book as possible. It was sort of the opposite approach to how I'd worked on films like Tristam Shandy or Jude. On set Casey Affleck and I would often have copies of the book, debating whether his or my version was more accurate to Jim's vision. His novel was a kind of bible for our filming. Obviously his novels are dark and in the case of The Killer Inside Me it's a first person narration by a madman about his violence towards people and women in particular. For me the worlds Thompson creates are a highly artificial form of melodrama that explores the darker area of people\u2019s behaviour in the real world. <br>I was surprised by the reaction to the film. Especially when we first showed it at Sundance, when people seemed to see it as a naturalistic almost documentary version of the world today. It was never intended as that. Maybe somehow we failed to clarify in the film the idea that Casey's character is crazy and that the story is seen through his eyes. However one reaction I strongly disagree with is that because the violence against women in the film was shocking the film was morally wrong. Violence against women should always be shocking. In fact all violence should be shocking, Plenty of films show violence against women and in general as a form of entertainment. I think that is morally wrong.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I4rDHxzeCg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1I4rDHxzeCg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>A trailer for The Killer Inside Me.</figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T12:37:16.564Z\">at 1.37pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d3065c98f0845f89e30f92c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T12:29:06.634Z\">1.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11807941\">KHarvest</a> asks:</p> <p><em>Hollywood is more and more obsessed about \u2018tentpole\u2019 movies and sequels that can be spun off until the end of time.

It's funny you remember Alan Parker saying I should make fewer films - that was a long time ago and to be honest I think after he said it he never made a film again. You also mention Lean and Malick as examples of the other type of director who makes far fewer films. Interestingly, Malick didn't made a film for decades but recently has been bashing them out like nobody's business. It's sad but true that his repuation was higher when he wasn't making films than it is now. I'm not sure that's necessarily because the films he's making now are worse but people love the idea of somebody taking 10 years to make a film rather than 10 months. For me a lot of my favourite film-makers have been incredibly prolific. And their best films have been made when they've been most prolific. Think about French New Wave directors in the early 60s or Fassbinder or Herzog in the 70s. Or all the mainstream Hollywood directors in the 50s. Or Bergman all through his career. All of them made one or two films a year - in Bergman's case at the same time as running a theatre company and writing the scripts for his films. Film-making like painting or writing or playing music is an activity which you hope you get better at the more you practice. But it's certainly true that marketing loves a rare product rather than one of which there's plenty.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d3061c88f0845f89e30f908\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T12:11:45.261Z\">1.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15503970\">kjmsisa</a> asks:</p> <p><em>As the article indicates, there is tremendous variety in your projects.

The first, Ocean Siren, due to open in December 2019, is on the Strand in Townsville. The solar-powered sculpture of a young indigenous girl will change colour as a visual warning of critical warming, using live water-temperature data from the Australian Institute of Marine Science. It will be exposed at low tide and underwater at high tide.</p> <p>\u201cThe Australian Institute of Marine Science has a series of temperature loggers around the reef. It will compile this data and feed it into the sculpture, so that changes in temperature will be seen in real time,\u201d said deCaires Taylor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bcadec10d35c86c19429c4d4ae93a01e298456f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bcadec10d35c86c19429c4d4ae93a01e298456f/0_99_2719_1631/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artist\u2019s image of the Ocean Siren installation on the Strand in Townsville, Queensland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artist\u2019s image of the Ocean Siren installation on the Strand in Townsville, Queensland</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As with much of his previous work, <a href=\"https://www.underwatersculpture.com/\">deCaires Taylor</a> hopes the museum will help to shape public debate and inform environmental policy.</p> <p>\u201cOur oceans are going through rapid change, and there are huge threats, from rising sea temperatures to acidification, and a large amount of pollution entering the system,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of creating an underwater museum is about changing our value systems \u2013 thinking about the sea floor as something sacred, something that we should be protecting and not taking for granted.\u201d</p> <p>Combining his skills as a sculptor, marine conservationist, underwater photographer and scuba-diving instructor, deCaires Taylor has been making underwater sculptures for over a decade. In 2006 he created the world\u2019s first underwater sculpture park, in Grenada \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.puregrenada.com/index.php/explore/scuba-diving/underwater-sculpture-park/\">Molinere Underwater sculpture park and museum</a> \u2013 and has since made sculpture parks around the world, including Canc\u00fan, Lanzarote and the Bahamas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"481811e5f0ec1eedbd39eb9037879a800aa4c53e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/481811e5f0ec1eedbd39eb9037879a800aa4c53e/0_376_7952_4771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An underwater sculpture, part of Jason deCaires Taylor\u2019s Museo Atlantico off the coast of Lanzarote.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An underwater sculpture, part of Jason deCaires Taylor\u2019s Museo Atlantico off the coast of Lanzarote</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other installations as part of the new museum will include the large-scale Coral Greenhouse (at John Brewer Reef), expected to open shortly after Ocean Siren. This will be planted with more than 2,000 coral fragments from marine nurseries, to help it generate a marine ecosystem.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be installed just prior to coral spawning so will provide a new clean surface area for coral larvae to attach to,\u201d said deCaires Taylor. \u201cNew species are being trialled including a range of temperature-resilient strains. The sculptures themselves are all made from a ph-neutral marine cement with a textured surface to help settlement. From past experience, works have begun to be colonised within a matter of days.\u201d</p> <p>Plans for the Geoffrey Bay site on Magnetic Island include art telling the story of reef science, which should be completed by January 2021. Close to Palm Island, an installation is being created in consultation with the local indigenous community with the aim of increasing tourism to help bring a much-needed economic boost to the area. This site, in Coolgaree Bay, is due to open in August 2020, and is likely to be accessible only with official tour guides.</p> <p>\u201cWe spent 12 days with Jason surveying sites, looking for beautiful soft, sandy seabed where we can install the sculptures without doing any damage to the reef,\u201d said Paul Marshall, chief environment officer at Reef Ecologic, one of the project partners. \u201cWe\u2019ve also consulted with stakeholders, the community, businesses and government agencies, and spent time talking to indigenous communities, particularly those associated with Palm Island.\u201d</p> <p>More than <a href=\"http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/our-work/Managing-multiple-uses/tourism-on-the-great-barrier-reef/visitor-contributions/numbers\">two million people visit the Great Barrier Reef</a> each year. The aim is for the new museum to be educationally relevant to scientists, locals and tourists.</p> <p>\u201cWe all care about the reef, but to have fantastic sculptures \u2013 representing the reef, representing people \u2013 is a reminder just how fragile [the reef] is, and how we\u2019ve got to look after it and treat it like a museum,\u201d said Adam Smith, managing director at Reef Ecologic.</p> <p>Previous deCaires Taylor projects have helped boost tourism around their locations and the new museum is expected to create jobs. The section of the reef close to Townsville currently sees fewer tourists than more northerly areas, near Cairns, where bleaching is more prevalent.</p> <p>The project\u2019s collaborators have also considered the potentially negative consequences of an increase in tourism to the region, according to deCaires Taylor.</p> <p>\u201cMOUA is looking at many operational models, from encouraging local visitors more than overseas ones, to electric power boats and providing stationary pontoons at the site to reduce the amount of travel needed,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The new museum is a not-for-profit collaboration which has been in planning for two years. It is being funded by national and local government, and corporate partners including James Cook University, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, in association with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.</p> <p>Last year, Coralarium, an intertidal installation created by deCaires Taylor at a hotel resort in the Maldives was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/sep/24/maldives-authorities-destroy-marine-artwork-for-being-un-islamic\">demolished by authorities</a>, after a court ruled that the human forms depicted in the work were anti-Islamic.</p> <p><strong>Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "bodyText": "From a colour-changing figure warning of warming seas to a sunken skeletal greenhouse encrusted with coral, a new museum of underwater art in Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef marine park aims to raise awareness of the threatened ecosystem \u2013 and rehabilitate parts of the reef. Created by British sculptor and environmentalist Jason deCaires Taylor, the Museum of Underwater Art (MOUA) will feature partially and fully submerged installations and sculptures that will become sites for coral and marine life regeneration. The artworks will be at several locations along the Queensland coast, including the John Brewer Reef, and Magnetic Island, Palm Island and Townsville. The first, Ocean Siren, due to open in December 2019, is on the Strand in Townsville. The solar-powered sculpture of a young indigenous girl will change colour as a visual warning of critical warming, using live water-temperature data from the Australian Institute of Marine Science. It will be exposed at low tide and underwater at high tide. \u201cThe Australian Institute of Marine Science has a series of temperature loggers around the reef. It will compile this data and feed it into the sculpture, so that changes in temperature will be seen in real time,\u201d said deCaires Taylor. As with much of his previous work, deCaires Taylor hopes the museum will help to shape public debate and inform environmental policy. \u201cOur oceans are going through rapid change, and there are huge threats, from rising sea temperatures to acidification, and a large amount of pollution entering the system,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of creating an underwater museum is about changing our value systems \u2013 thinking about the sea floor as something sacred, something that we should be protecting and not taking for granted.\u201d Combining his skills as a sculptor, marine conservationist, underwater photographer and scuba-diving instructor, deCaires Taylor has been making underwater sculptures for over a decade. In 2006 he created the world\u2019s first underwater sculpture park, in Grenada \u2013 the Molinere Underwater sculpture park and museum \u2013 and has since made sculpture parks around the world, including Canc\u00fan, Lanzarote and the Bahamas. Other installations as part of the new museum will include the large-scale Coral Greenhouse (at John Brewer Reef), expected to open shortly after Ocean Siren. This will be planted with more than 2,000 coral fragments from marine nurseries, to help it generate a marine ecosystem. \u201cIt will be installed just prior to coral spawning so will provide a new clean surface area for coral larvae to attach to,\u201d said deCaires Taylor. \u201cNew species are being trialled including a range of temperature-resilient strains. The sculptures themselves are all made from a ph-neutral marine cement with a textured surface to help settlement. From past experience, works have begun to be colonised within a matter of days.\u201d Plans for the Geoffrey Bay site on Magnetic Island include art telling the story of reef science, which should be completed by January 2021. Close to Palm Island, an installation is being created in consultation with the local indigenous community with the aim of increasing tourism to help bring a much-needed economic boost to the area. This site, in Coolgaree Bay, is due to open in August 2020, and is likely to be accessible only with official tour guides. \u201cWe spent 12 days with Jason surveying sites, looking for beautiful soft, sandy seabed where we can install the sculptures without doing any damage to the reef,\u201d said Paul Marshall, chief environment officer at Reef Ecologic, one of the project partners. \u201cWe\u2019ve also consulted with stakeholders, the community, businesses and government agencies, and spent time talking to indigenous communities, particularly those associated with Palm Island.\u201d More than two million people visit the Great Barrier Reef each year. The aim is for the new museum to be educationally relevant to scientists, locals and tourists. \u201cWe all care about the reef, but to have fantastic sculptures \u2013 representing the reef, representing people \u2013 is a reminder just how fragile [the reef] is, and how we\u2019ve got to look after it and treat it like a museum,\u201d said Adam Smith, managing director at Reef Ecologic. Previous deCaires Taylor projects have helped boost tourism around their locations and the new museum is expected to create jobs. The section of the reef close to Townsville currently sees fewer tourists than more northerly areas, near Cairns, where bleaching is more prevalent. The project\u2019s collaborators have also considered the potentially negative consequences of an increase in tourism to the region, according to deCaires Taylor. \u201cMOUA is looking at many operational models, from encouraging local visitors more than overseas ones, to electric power boats and providing stationary pontoons at the site to reduce the amount of travel needed,\u201d he said. The new museum is a not-for-profit collaboration which has been in planning for two years. It is being funded by national and local government, and corporate partners including James Cook University, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, in association with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Last year, Coralarium, an intertidal installation created by deCaires Taylor at a hotel resort in the Maldives was demolished by authorities, after a court ruled that the human forms depicted in the work were anti-Islamic.

      "body": "<p>During the dark days of the military dictatorship in Argentina in the 1970s, there was only one newspaper that dared to publish the names of the \u201cdisappeared\u201d \u2013 let alone to put them every day on the front page, as Andrew Graham-Yooll did as news editor of the Buenos Aires Herald.</p> <p>Graham-Yooll, who has died aged 75, nearly paid with his life for such audacity. In 1976 he and his first wife, Micaela Meyer, got out just in time \u2013 \u201cout of the back door and straight to the airport\u201d, as he put it \u2013 as the men in the black Ford Falcons came looking for him. He never wanted to go into exile but had little choice other than to resettle in London until the generals \u2013 \u201cthose bastards\u201d as he referred to them \u2013 were removed from power by a combination of the Falklands war and economic incompetence.</p> <p>His best and most acclaimed book, A State of Fear: Memories of Argentina\u2019s Nightmare (1986), was about those years of the 1976-83 military dictatorship, and was described by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/grahamgreene\" title=\"\">Graham Greene</a> as a masterpiece. It is easy to see why Greene liked it so much. Over 12 discrete episodes Graham-Yooll captures the surreal nature of the conflict and the accommodations that a journalist has to make when there are no frontlines, only back rooms: tea with a rightwing torturer who made chilling confessions; a clandestine encounter with a leftwing guerrilla on the run. (She tells him, bitterly, while pointing a gun at him: \u201cYou\u2019re in the middle, but not neutral; you\u2019re right in the middle of this mess\u201d \u2013 and then takes her clothes off.)</p> <p>In London Graham-Yooll contributed to newspapers and then found he could reinvent himself as a writer, and the books started to flow.

      "bodyText": "During the dark days of the military dictatorship in Argentina in the 1970s, there was only one newspaper that dared to publish the names of the \u201cdisappeared\u201d \u2013 let alone to put them every day on the front page, as Andrew Graham-Yooll did as news editor of the Buenos Aires Herald. Graham-Yooll, who has died aged 75, nearly paid with his life for such audacity. In 1976 he and his first wife, Micaela Meyer, got out just in time \u2013 \u201cout of the back door and straight to the airport\u201d, as he put it \u2013 as the men in the black Ford Falcons came looking for him. He never wanted to go into exile but had little choice other than to resettle in London until the generals \u2013 \u201cthose bastards\u201d as he referred to them \u2013 were removed from power by a combination of the Falklands war and economic incompetence. His best and most acclaimed book, A State of Fear: Memories of Argentina\u2019s Nightmare (1986), was about those years of the 1976-83 military dictatorship, and was described by Graham Greene as a masterpiece. It is easy to see why Greene liked it so much. Over 12 discrete episodes Graham-Yooll captures the surreal nature of the conflict and the accommodations that a journalist has to make when there are no frontlines, only back rooms: tea with a rightwing torturer who made chilling confessions; a clandestine encounter with a leftwing guerrilla on the run. (She tells him, bitterly, while pointing a gun at him: \u201cYou\u2019re in the middle, but not neutral; you\u2019re right in the middle of this mess\u201d \u2013 and then takes her clothes off.) In London Graham-Yooll contributed to newspapers and then found he could reinvent himself as a writer, and the books started to flow. In 1994 he returned to Argentina, becoming editor-in-chief of his old paper. Graham-Yooll was born in Buenos Aires and grew up in the suburb of Ranelagh, as part of the English-speaking community, the son of an English mother, In\u00e9s (nee Tovar), and a Scottish father, Douglas Graham-Yooll, who had emigrated from Leith in 1928. After a turbulent childhood \u2013 In\u00e9s died when he was five and Douglas when he was 19, and at one point he ran away from home \u2013 Andrew joined the Buenos Aires Herald, Argentina\u2019s English-language newspaper, in 1966, achieving rapid promotion under the editorship of Bob Cox. After a military coup in 1976 brought the generals to power, both men came to the attention of the rightwing junta for their reporting of a growing wave of \u201cdisappeared\u201d \u2013 around 30,000 men and women of the left who went missing without notice during what became known as \u201cthe dirty war\u201d. As the military refused to give any account of these executions \u2013 the bodies were often dropped into the River Plate from planes \u2013 it needed courage and persistence to cut through the official version that many of these victims had gone into hiding or fled to Europe. But Graham-Yooll always played down the idea that he and his colleagues at the Herald had been fearless in putting names into print. \u201cOf course we were afraid,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s one thing to be afraid and another thing to be a coward.\u201d After escaping to London he was given a job by the Telegraph and then was able to return briefly to Buenos Aires in 1982 as a correspondent for the Guardian, covering the Falklands war.

The UK Foreign Office said it was seeking further information on the ship and insisted that freedom of navigation was paramount. The Iranian seizure could be seen as a tit-for-tat reaction to the seizure of the Iranian-owned and Indian-crewed Grace 1 tanker a fortnight ago by Royal Marines off Gibraltar. On Thursday, the British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and Boris Johnson, the expected new prime minister, held talks with Gibraltar\u2019s first minister, Fabian Picardo, to discuss what to do about the Grace 1. Picardo revealed he had met with Iranian officials in London to discuss how \u201cto de-escalate all issues arising\u201d. In telephone talks with Zarif at the weekend, Hunt offered to release the ship if there was an undertaking that the ship\u2019s oil would not be taken to Syria, a country that is subject to EU sanctions. The Iranians have said the ship was not bound for Syria, but has refused to name its planned destination. The UK is deeply sceptical of the Iranian explanation and is awaiting a clear undertaking that the ship will not be sailing to Syria. Unlike the US, the UK has no general policy of trying to block Iranian oil sales, but Tehran regards the British action as part of an attempt to support the US campaign to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero. The disputes over the ships are all part of wider manoeuvring between Iran, Europe and the US over the future of the Iran nuclear deal signed in 2015 and known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPA). Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal a year ago, saying its terms did not restrict Iran from acquiring a nuclear bomb, but the Europeans have continued to back the deal. Iran has started to lessen its commitments to JCPOA in the past month in protest at what it regards as the EU\u2019s failure to set up an effective mechanism between Iran and Europe to maintain trade. An increase in trade with Europe was always seen by Iran as a central benefit of signing up to the restrictions imposed in the nuclear deal. The seizure of the latest ship, following a series of attacks and interruptions of shipping over the last fortnight in the Gulf, will put the issue of maritime security in the strait of Hormuz back at the heart of international discussions. In the last months there have been six unattributed attacks on Gulf shipping as well as an attempt to intercept a British ship in the Gulf a fortnight ago. The US has sent advanced fighter jets and thousands of extra troops into the Middle East, while attacks on oil tankers and the shooting down of a US military surveillance drone by Iran have added to the fears of armed conflict. The US has been pushing for an internationally coordinated maritime force to accompany cargo through the strait, and Bahrain has agreed to hold a conference to develop these plans. The Bahrain conference is not due to be held until October and as many as 60 nations are expected to attend. Referring to the US plans to install surveillance and protection for ships passing through the Gulf, Brian Hook, the US special representative on Iran, said Washington had already sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the region, adding that \u201cthe move has disrupted and deterred much of what we feared\u201d with Iranian plots in the area. Hook said he would meet ambassadors on Friday to promote the US plan to build a maritime coalition to deter further attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf.",

This week more than 60 peers took out an advert in the Guardian accusing Corbyn of having \u201cfailed the test of leadership\u201d over his handling of antisemitism complaints within the party. Corbyn\u2019s office sacked Dianne Hayter as a Brexit minister in the Lords after she accused Corbyn of having a \u201cbunker mentality\u201d that she compared to the final days of Hitler.

She had deployed a somewhat tired old political metaphor, \u201cthe bunker mentality\u201d, comparing Corbyn\u2019s inner circle to the paranoid denial of disastrous reality that defined Hitler\u2019s last days. The same was said of Thatcher\u2019s final hours in power, in denial over her poll tax calamity.

It\u2019s never a good idea to use Hitler as a metaphor for anything else, but the claim by Corbyn\u2019s spokesman that her words were \u201cgrossly insensitive to Jewish staff\u201d would be laughable if it didn\u2019t look like such a pathetic attempt to divert criticism from the party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/12/labour-antisemitism-populist-left-jews-bankers-rothschild\" title=\"\">failure to deal with antisemitism</a>, which Corbyn should have scotched more than a year ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/17/labour-shadow-brexit-minister-sacked-over-corbyn-comments\">Corbyn sacks shadow Brexit minister for \u2018Hitler in the bunker\u2019 comment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The incestuously tight little McCluskeyite group who run Corbyn\u2019s office is responsible for fatally dilatory foot-dragging on this far-left Jew-baiting bile. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/11/bbc-panorama-antisemitism-labour-racism-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Panorama\u2019s evidence</a> of their interference was dismissed out of hand, with no pause for reflection. This cabal is to blame for Labour\u2019s catastrophic Brexit non-position. The only time the cabal acts fast is when their own position is personally threatened by critics: any new leader would dispense with their unhelpful services. Hayter may have taken the drop in revenge for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/16/tom-watson-backs-labour-motion-auto-exclude-racism\" title=\"\">advert in yesterday\u2019s Guardian</a> published by 64 Labour peers (whose number did not include Hayter), which attacked Corbyn over antisemitism.</p> <p>The result of these fatal errors on Brexit and antisemitism has been a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/corbyn-brexit-labour-party-late-eu-referendum-latest-update-a8891986.html\" title=\"\">flight of members</a>: you find grieving ex-Labour people everywhere. But they make a great mistake in leaving, as their votes and voices will be needed to haul Labour back from this exceptionally weak leadership: they should rejoin.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the real tragedy of making Labour less electable. Yesterday John McDonnell made an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/17/john-mcdonnell-to-promise-labour-will-end-in-work-poverty-by-end-of-first-term\" title=\"\">excellent speech pledging to end</a> \u201cthe modern-day scourge\u201d of in-work poverty within a five-year term. That is a mammoth task, one that has grown far greater in the past decade with the rapid increase in low-paid jobs. With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/04/four-million-british-workers-live-in-poverty-charity-says\" title=\"\">eight million people</a> living below the poverty threshold in working households, this will take the heaviest lifting. The proportion of children classified as poor is <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2019/07/Living-Standards-Audit-2019.pdf\" title=\"\">more than 30%</a>, and two-thirds of them are in working families. He lays out the path with three key elements: \u201ca structurally different economy, a social safety net of shared public service provision and a financial safety net\u201d. He has set out his goals as follows: \u201cAs chancellor in the next Labour government, I want you to judge me by how much we reduce poverty and how much we create a more equal society. By how much people\u2019s lives change for the better.\u201d</p> <p>There it is, in a nutshell, the reason why people vote Labour. Anything that gets in the way of that objective, anything making Labour less electable, betrays that primal mission.</p> <p>With eloquence, he expounded why \u201csocial mobility\u201d is the wrong target, rejecting the idea that \u201cpoverty is OK as long as some people are given the opportunity to climb out of it\u201d. That punctures what I heard one Tory minister at a conference fringe meeting calling for: the need to \u201cpick the diamonds from the rough\u201d. Social mobility is what happens in more equal societies, as in Scandinavia: it\u2019s a useless goal, just one measurement of a society\u2019s social success or failure.</p> <p>His tough new poverty-abolition is no impossibility: it was strongly backed yesterday by Claire Ainsley, executive director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. She said: \u201cThis significant ambition to eliminate in-work poverty is the right thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>Is it possible? Setting the highest targets is the best way: Tony Blair astounded a room full of poverty researchers in 1999 when he <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/298745.stm\" title=\"\">pledged to end child poverty by 2020</a>: at every budget that pledge forced the pace, adding to tax credits that eventually lifted a million children out of poverty. Would Labour have hit that target? Without doubt, had Labour been in power for the last decade, that progress would have continued, instead of going into screeching reverse. As with the Blair/Brown child poverty target, McDonnell has chosen a target with cunning political calculation: just as poor children touch the hearts, so poverty among the \u201chard-working\u201d arouses indignation, without the fear of the \u201cmoral hazard\u201d of rewarding the feckless.</p> <p>Other aspects of Labour\u2019s cleverly popular 2017 manifesto have rattled the government. Would Ofwat be delivering its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/18/regulator-orders-water-bills-in-england-and-wales-to-be-cut-by-50-pounds-ofwat\" title=\"\">severe punishment</a> today to the greedy, profit-sucking water companies without Labour\u2019s good commitment to take back the utilities? Yesterday Chris Grayling grovelled in front of the transport committee, promising to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/17/northern-rail-could-lose-franchise-after-year-of-passenger-misery\" title=\"\">rescind Northern Rail\u2019s franchise</a>, amid more radical talk of franchising \u201creform\u201d. Would student fees be up for cutting, without Labour\u2019s pledge? Or would Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party be <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/news/104948/nigel-farage-urges-tories-step-aside-let-brexit-party-beat\" title=\"\">pledging \u00a3200bn</a> to regenerate desolate towns without Labour\u2019s promise for an even larger regeneration bank for similar investment?

      "bodyText": "With dexterity, decisiveness and a thwack of firm leadership, Jeremy Corbyn sacked Dianne Hayter last night as shadow Brexit minister. (She can\u2019t be fired from her elected role as deputy leader of the Lords.) With just that same speed, he expelled Alastair Campbell from the Labour party in May, as a dead-cat distraction following Labour\u2019s disastrous European election results. What had Hayter done? She had deployed a somewhat tired old political metaphor, \u201cthe bunker mentality\u201d, comparing Corbyn\u2019s inner circle to the paranoid denial of disastrous reality that defined Hitler\u2019s last days. The same was said of Thatcher\u2019s final hours in power, in denial over her poll tax calamity. It was said of Gordon Brown in his telephone-hurling phase, of Tony Blair\u2019s secretive sofa government and of Harold Wilson\u2019s kitchen cabinet. It\u2019s never a good idea to use Hitler as a metaphor for anything else, but the claim by Corbyn\u2019s spokesman that her words were \u201cgrossly insensitive to Jewish staff\u201d would be laughable if it didn\u2019t look like such a pathetic attempt to divert criticism from the party\u2019s failure to deal with antisemitism, which Corbyn should have scotched more than a year ago. The incestuously tight little McCluskeyite group who run Corbyn\u2019s office is responsible for fatally dilatory foot-dragging on this far-left Jew-baiting bile. Panorama\u2019s evidence of their interference was dismissed out of hand, with no pause for reflection. This cabal is to blame for Labour\u2019s catastrophic Brexit non-position. The only time the cabal acts fast is when their own position is personally threatened by critics: any new leader would dispense with their unhelpful services. Hayter may have taken the drop in revenge for the advert in yesterday\u2019s Guardian published by 64 Labour peers (whose number did not include Hayter), which attacked Corbyn over antisemitism. The result of these fatal errors on Brexit and antisemitism has been a flight of members: you find grieving ex-Labour people everywhere. But they make a great mistake in leaving, as their votes and voices will be needed to haul Labour back from this exceptionally weak leadership: they should rejoin. Here\u2019s the real tragedy of making Labour less electable. Yesterday John McDonnell made an excellent speech pledging to end \u201cthe modern-day scourge\u201d of in-work poverty within a five-year term. That is a mammoth task, one that has grown far greater in the past decade with the rapid increase in low-paid jobs. With eight million people living below the poverty threshold in working households, this will take the heaviest lifting. The proportion of children classified as poor is more than 30%, and two-thirds of them are in working families. He lays out the path with three key elements: \u201ca structurally different economy, a social safety net of shared public service provision and a financial safety net\u201d. He has set out his goals as follows: \u201cAs chancellor in the next Labour government, I want you to judge me by how much we reduce poverty and how much we create a more equal society. By how much people\u2019s lives change for the better.\u201d There it is, in a nutshell, the reason why people vote Labour. Anything that gets in the way of that objective, anything making Labour less electable, betrays that primal mission. With eloquence, he expounded why \u201csocial mobility\u201d is the wrong target, rejecting the idea that \u201cpoverty is OK as long as some people are given the opportunity to climb out of it\u201d. That punctures what I heard one Tory minister at a conference fringe meeting calling for: the need to \u201cpick the diamonds from the rough\u201d. Social mobility is what happens in more equal societies, as in Scandinavia: it\u2019s a useless goal, just one measurement of a society\u2019s social success or failure. His tough new poverty-abolition is no impossibility: it was strongly backed yesterday by Claire Ainsley, executive director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. She said: \u201cThis significant ambition to eliminate in-work poverty is the right thing to do.\u201d Is it possible? Setting the highest targets is the best way: Tony Blair astounded a room full of poverty researchers in 1999 when he pledged to end child poverty by 2020: at every budget that pledge forced the pace, adding to tax credits that eventually lifted a million children out of poverty. Would Labour have hit that target? Without doubt, had Labour been in power for the last decade, that progress would have continued, instead of going into screeching reverse. As with the Blair/Brown child poverty target, McDonnell has chosen a target with cunning political calculation: just as poor children touch the hearts, so poverty among the \u201chard-working\u201d arouses indignation, without the fear of the \u201cmoral hazard\u201d of rewarding the feckless. Other aspects of Labour\u2019s cleverly popular 2017 manifesto have rattled the government. Would Ofwat be delivering its severe punishment today to the greedy, profit-sucking water companies without Labour\u2019s good commitment to take back the utilities? Yesterday Chris Grayling grovelled in front of the transport committee, promising to rescind Northern Rail\u2019s franchise, amid more radical talk of franchising \u201creform\u201d. Would student fees be up for cutting, without Labour\u2019s pledge? Or would Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party be pledging \u00a3200bn to regenerate desolate towns without Labour\u2019s promise for an even larger regeneration bank for similar investment? Even without power, Labour still has an impact. But being in power is what really matters. If Labour arrives in office McDonnell will have to choose between competing spending needs: what comes first, the urgent need to raise benefits, or abolition of fees mainly benefiting better-off students? Socialism is the language of priorities. But first comes actually winning an election. The strong sense is that McDonnell, along with much of the shadow cabinet, is infuriated by everything that gets in the way of that. Imagine the despair of losing an election to Boris Johnson and facing another five years of social destruction. Day after day it gets clearer that Corbyn is the chief obstacle: weak, vacillating, glum and scoring the lowest ever poll ratings for an opposition leader as he fails to grasp the severity of Labour\u2019s crisis over antisemitism and Brexit. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

Replacing the separation of city planning into different silos, the ministry was in charge of all things urban: housing, transport, sanitation and planning. It was a first-of-its-kind innovation in public policy for tackling cities writ large.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/31/boston-pizza-teenagers-budget-youth-lead-change\">participatory budgeting</a> champion Ol\u00edvio Dutra, former mayor of Porto Alegre, took the helm and flung open the doors to urban reformers with progressive ideas. These include the \u201cright to the city\u201d concept, which put the needs of poor urban dwellers on par with the rich, and the \u201csocial function of property\u201d, whereby land should not sit vacant if it can serve a public purpose.</p> <p>Over the last dozen years of the programme, between its general infrastructure programme (the PAC) and its My House My Life programme (<em>Minha Casa Minha Vida</em>, MCMV, in Portuguese), Brazil invested a staggering 780bn reais (\u00a3166bn) in housing alone. There were also sewage upgrades, transport improvements and huge renovations to Brazil\u2019s many favelas.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We spent 400 years as a predominantly rural society. Rapid urbanisation was overwhelming</p> <footer> <cite>Erm\u00ednia Maricato</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2006, the United Nations human settlements programme, UN-Habitat, awarded the ministry its scroll of honour for \u201cimpressive work in promoting the participation of ordinary people in urban policymaking\u201d. Indeed, on Dutra\u2019s second day, he invited the representatives of social movements from across Brazil into the ministry for discussions that aimed to make Bras\u00edlia more responsive to the needs of the country\u2019s far-flung cities.</p> <p>The honeymoon, however, was short-lived. Housing successes, such as the Silvas\u2019 experience, started to become the exception rather than the rule. As huge amounts of federal money poured into housing, the ministry found itself overwhelmed, struggling to exert any power over quality. The result was often shoddy housing estates and more urban sprawl than ever before.</p> <p>The results soured even the ministry\u2019s most ardent backers. One of them was an urbanism professor at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Erm\u00ednia Maricato, who had pitched the project to Lula personally. \u201cI don\u2019t want to use this word, but it\u2019s a tragedy,\u201d she now says.</p> <h2>\u2018A profound lack of knowledge about urban space in Brazil\u2019</h2> <p>What transformed this urbanist dream into a tragedy is money \u2013 a lot of it.</p> <p>In the early 2000s, Brazil\u2019s housing deficit was enormous. The country needed an estimated 7 million units, and nearly a fifth of the population lived in inadequate housing \u2013 families crammed into hillside favelas at risk of landslides, degraded tenements in big cities, or illegally subdivided lots lacking basic water and sewer connections, often located far from any jobs.</p> <p>On top of the housing shortage, navigating Brazilian cities ranged from infuriating to nightmarish. Metropolises such as S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro enjoyed a fraction of the metro service of comparably sized metropolises such as London and New York. The smaller cities, such as Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre and Fortaleza \u2013 which still clock in at more than a million people \u2013 relied almost exclusively on buses. Six Brazilian cities feature in the top 50 of the INRIX global scorecard for world\u2019s worst traffic congestion.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the house, it\u2019s the city outside the front door,\u201d Maricato recalls telling Lula when she pitched to him the idea of turning a housing plank in his 2003 campaign into a proposal for a fully-fledged city ministry.</p> <p>Lula liked the idea, which came from a national movement of urban reformers calling for urgent federal action to fix Brazil\u2019s increasingly chaotic metropolises. When he won the election and entered office, he made Maricato the new ministry\u2019s first executive secretary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7ab973a85e42a83734a5315323c4d423075012e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ab973a85e42a83734a5315323c4d423075012e2/0_34_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Commuters wait for the train at a subway station in downtown S\u00e3o Paulo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A packed subway platform in downtown S\u00e3o Paulo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nacho Doce/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Untangling the knot of Brazilian cities, where up to half of the urban population lives in self-built housing or illegal subdivisions, needed all hands on deck. As Maricato points out, Brazil had gone from being 10% urban in 1900 to 80% urban by 2000.</p> <p>\u201cWe spent 400 years as a predominantly rural society,\u201d she says. \u201cRapid urbanisation was an overwhelming experience, and frankly there existed a profound lack of knowledge about what urban space really was like in Brazil.\u201d</p> <p>Maricato and the ministry attempted three initiatives: build a lot of new housing, renovate existing housing stock, and upgrade favelas with paved roads, water and sewer hookups, parks, schools, health clinics and other amenities. Hundreds of new kilometres of subway and bus rapid transit (BRT) lines were also part of the equation, although the cities ministry shared that responsibility with other parts of the federal government.</p> <p>In 2008 new, massive amounts of money came down the pipe, as the chief of staff and finance ministry authorised huge public spending on construction in a bid to keep Brazil afloat in the global financial crisis, leaving implementation to the cities ministry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a26f4b54a3c0e837049f25e48e1410b670a50cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a26f4b54a3c0e837049f25e48e1410b670a50cc/0_71_4900_2940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The TransOlimpica highway, part of the bus rapid transit system, under construction in 2016.

A particular success was when social movements convinced the cities ministry to use part of MCMV\u2019s massive budget to transform <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/nov/27/resistance-sao-paulo-homeless-reclaim-city-occupations\">central S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s abandoned high-rises</a> into proper apartment buildings, where squatters successfully parlayed their activism into permanent homes, renovated with public money.</p> <p>\u201cWe sometimes hear parents joke with their children to \u2018be careful, this is a luxury condo\u2019,\u201d says Wemerson Silva, a 33-year-old former office administrator now working full-time to manage the 120-unit Edif\u00edcio Dandara, which used to be a squatter building. \u201cBut for us it <em>is </em>a luxury.

Many of the new residents had been used to paying up to half their income to rent sparsely furnished, cell-like rooms in tenements, where siblings or a mother and child crammed in together and the bathroom was shared by a dozen strangers.</p> <p>In their new building, the union applied to the government to finance a participatory renovation project through MCMV. Today, they are all owners of one- and two-bedroom flats in a building they helped lay out, and pay just 5% of their income for 10 years with no down payment.</p> <p>As building manager, Silva has faced a steep learning curve. The cities ministry literally handed over the keys: the residents would own the building, not rent it. The residents get the dream of homeownership, but also the responsibility of maintaining their new condominium complex.</p> <p>\u201cDuring carnival a street party passed right by the door, but I was busy taking care of the building,\u201d Silva says. \u201cEvery day there\u2019s a new problem.

While occupations continue apace, especially in S\u00e3o Paulo, the loss of a federal partner willing to invest in renovation has made the provocative strategy\u2019s end game less clear.</p> <p>As well as new and renovated housing, the third major plank of the ministry of cities programme was favela upgrading.</p> <p>Since the late 19th century, when the first favelas popped up to house poor Brazilians, most cities have at best ignored and at worst evicted favela dwellers. In the 1980s and 90s, Rio pioneered a different attitude that eventually became a national trend: investing public dollars in favela improvements.</p> <p>It provided land titles, paid favela residents cash for their \u201csweat equity\u201d investment, and went as far as designing and implementing infrastructure improvements outright, including sidewalks, paved roads and alleys, water and sewer lines and handrails for staircases. Historically, the federal government had left favela upgrading to state and city governments, but during the ministry\u2019s flush years, Bras\u00edlia got involved, too: it put 33.5bn reais into more than 3,500 favelas nationwide.</p> <p>Outside the gated entrance to Silva\u2019s council estate, Parais\u00f3polis now sports a paved avenue served by city buses connecting its tens of thousands of residents to the rest of the city. A new health clinic, school and job training centre flank the roadway. Inside Parais\u00f3polis\u2019s narrow streets and alleys, meanwhile, business is booming as banks, restaurants and shops vie for customers. In short, the former favela has become a neighbourhood \u2013 the ultimate goal of favela upgrading.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a545e81bc9bcfd60638477fb8ca737d567cd897\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a545e81bc9bcfd60638477fb8ca737d567cd897/639_52_3839_2303/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bus plies the main drag connecting the favela Parais\u00f3polis with the rest of the city \u2013 transit that only came about as a result of improvements overseen by the ministry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bus plies the main drag connecting the favela Parais\u00f3polis with the rest of the city \u2013 transit that only came about as a result of improvements overseen by the ministry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregory Scuggs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jos\u00e9 Maria Lacerda, 65, moved to Parais\u00f3polis in 1975, when he estimates there were about 10,000 shacks on an abandoned farm.

To achieve the 7m unit goal, the ministry allocated 94% of its housing budget to private construction companies, who worked with municipal governments to select sites. It agreed to pay up to 98,000 reais per unit, and set only basic parameters of minimum unit size and requirements for water and sewerage.</p> <p>The result was quantity over quality. Construction firms sought to maximise profit within the fixed sum and built inadequate housing on the edge of town where land was cheap, all abetted by local governments. \u201cCities zoned lots of farmland for urban development and MCMV projects ended up built in areas that a few years ago were rural,\u201d Maricato says. \u201cWe did some excellent projects, but a lot of sprawl came out of the ministry of cities. The money went to build roads out to empty land.\u201d</p> <p>The success of Parais\u00f3polis was an exception.

The money had already been slashed by former president Michel Temer, who took over after the 2016 impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, and new housing for Brazilians on the lowest incomes was effectively halted.</p> <p>With Brazil\u2019s cities in dire straits once again, the country\u2019s mayors joined forces in May to plead with Bolsonaro to reopen the ministry.

The only evidence of her past life is a faded photo of the home she lived in for 11 years, a shack she called Noah\u2019s Ark for its frequent floods. She moved in in 1996, pursuing the promise of a better life from Brazil\u2019s rural north-east to S\u00e3o Paulo, its largest city, where she settled in Parais\u00f3polis, the city\u2019s largest favela. The path to a better life, however, was bumpy. As a squatter, she faced a constant threat of eviction. It was a challenging place to raise her daughter, who has the developmental disorder Williams syndrome. \u201cThe government didn\u2019t treat us like citizens back then,\u201d she says, citing their inability to access regular water, electrical hookups or a health clinic for her daughter. In 2007, however, things suddenly changed. City officials declared that she and her daughter would be leaving their waterlogged hovel. For three years they received financial assistance that allowed them to rent a nearby house, before taking ownership in 2010 of a brand new two-bedroom flat, for the modest 10-year price of 86.90 reais (\u00a318.46) per month plus utilities \u2013 a sum she pays with cleaning jobs and her daughter\u2019s disability checks. \u201cIt was complicated but worth it. We have a better life,\u201d she said, gazing out from her balcony over the lush tropical landscaping that separates the blocks in this development. \u201cI keep that photo so that I never forget what God delivered me from.\u201d Silva and her daughter are among the 4 million Brazilian families in the last 15 years who were given a new roof over their heads in one of the most ambitious social housing and neighbourhood building schemes attempted in the 21st century. With a massive injection of public finance, Brazil built homes, renovated public spaces, and laid out new transport lines in cities large and small across the vast country. For their new lives, the Silvas can thank a distant bureaucracy: the ministry of cities. The creation of the former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the ministry was set up to tackle the urban chaos of Brazil\u2019s traffic-clogged megacities and prevent its intermediate cities from ballooning into nightmarish metropolises. Or at least, they could have thanked the ministry until January this year, when the new president, Jair Bolsonaro, closed it down, ending 15 remarkable but highly contentious years. \u201cThe ministry of cities is done,\u201d parliamentarian Luciano Bivar, a Bolsonaro ally, said in October about folding the cities remit into the ministry of regional development. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a direct line with the cities and states.\u201d It was a quiet end to a project that was opened in 2003 to great fanfare. Replacing the separation of city planning into different silos, the ministry was in charge of all things urban: housing, transport, sanitation and planning. It was a first-of-its-kind innovation in public policy for tackling cities writ large. The participatory budgeting champion Ol\u00edvio Dutra, former mayor of Porto Alegre, took the helm and flung open the doors to urban reformers with progressive ideas. These include the \u201cright to the city\u201d concept, which put the needs of poor urban dwellers on par with the rich, and the \u201csocial function of property\u201d, whereby land should not sit vacant if it can serve a public purpose. Over the last dozen years of the programme, between its general infrastructure programme (the PAC) and its My House My Life programme (Minha Casa Minha Vida, MCMV, in Portuguese), Brazil invested a staggering 780bn reais (\u00a3166bn) in housing alone. There were also sewage upgrades, transport improvements and huge renovations to Brazil\u2019s many favelas. In 2006, the United Nations human settlements programme, UN-Habitat, awarded the ministry its scroll of honour for \u201cimpressive work in promoting the participation of ordinary people in urban policymaking\u201d. Indeed, on Dutra\u2019s second day, he invited the representatives of social movements from across Brazil into the ministry for discussions that aimed to make Bras\u00edlia more responsive to the needs of the country\u2019s far-flung cities. The honeymoon, however, was short-lived. Housing successes, such as the Silvas\u2019 experience, started to become the exception rather than the rule. As huge amounts of federal money poured into housing, the ministry found itself overwhelmed, struggling to exert any power over quality. The result was often shoddy housing estates and more urban sprawl than ever before. The results soured even the ministry\u2019s most ardent backers. One of them was an urbanism professor at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Erm\u00ednia Maricato, who had pitched the project to Lula personally. \u201cI don\u2019t want to use this word, but it\u2019s a tragedy,\u201d she now says. \u2018A profound lack of knowledge about urban space in Brazil\u2019 What transformed this urbanist dream into a tragedy is money \u2013 a lot of it. In the early 2000s, Brazil\u2019s housing deficit was enormous. The country needed an estimated 7 million units, and nearly a fifth of the population lived in inadequate housing \u2013 families crammed into hillside favelas at risk of landslides, degraded tenements in big cities, or illegally subdivided lots lacking basic water and sewer connections, often located far from any jobs. On top of the housing shortage, navigating Brazilian cities ranged from infuriating to nightmarish. Metropolises such as S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro enjoyed a fraction of the metro service of comparably sized metropolises such as London and New York. The smaller cities, such as Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre and Fortaleza \u2013 which still clock in at more than a million people \u2013 relied almost exclusively on buses. Six Brazilian cities feature in the top 50 of the INRIX global scorecard for world\u2019s worst traffic congestion. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the house, it\u2019s the city outside the front door,\u201d Maricato recalls telling Lula when she pitched to him the idea of turning a housing plank in his 2003 campaign into a proposal for a fully-fledged city ministry. Lula liked the idea, which came from a national movement of urban reformers calling for urgent federal action to fix Brazil\u2019s increasingly chaotic metropolises. When he won the election and entered office, he made Maricato the new ministry\u2019s first executive secretary. Untangling the knot of Brazilian cities, where up to half of the urban population lives in self-built housing or illegal subdivisions, needed all hands on deck. As Maricato points out, Brazil had gone from being 10% urban in 1900 to 80% urban by 2000. \u201cWe spent 400 years as a predominantly rural society,\u201d she says. \u201cRapid urbanisation was an overwhelming experience, and frankly there existed a profound lack of knowledge about what urban space really was like in Brazil.\u201d Maricato and the ministry attempted three initiatives: build a lot of new housing, renovate existing housing stock, and upgrade favelas with paved roads, water and sewer hookups, parks, schools, health clinics and other amenities. Hundreds of new kilometres of subway and bus rapid transit (BRT) lines were also part of the equation, although the cities ministry shared that responsibility with other parts of the federal government. In 2008 new, massive amounts of money came down the pipe, as the chief of staff and finance ministry authorised huge public spending on construction in a bid to keep Brazil afloat in the global financial crisis, leaving implementation to the cities ministry. Some of the money went to new homes, where Silva\u2019s story represented an ideal outcome: a life-changing new home in the neighbourhood she already lived in. Some of the money went to rehabilitating existing buildings, typically to benefit homeless people or those paying exorbitant sums to live in shoddy rentals. A particular success was when social movements convinced the cities ministry to use part of MCMV\u2019s massive budget to transform central S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s abandoned high-rises into proper apartment buildings, where squatters successfully parlayed their activism into permanent homes, renovated with public money. \u201cWe sometimes hear parents joke with their children to \u2018be careful, this is a luxury condo\u2019,\u201d says Wemerson Silva, a 33-year-old former office administrator now working full-time to manage the 120-unit Edif\u00edcio Dandara, which used to be a squatter building. \u201cBut for us it is a luxury. I\u2019ve lived in a tenement \u2013 never again.\u201d The building once housed a justice ministry office but sat vacant for a decade until a tenement dwellers\u2019 union took it over. Many of the new residents had been used to paying up to half their income to rent sparsely furnished, cell-like rooms in tenements, where siblings or a mother and child crammed in together and the bathroom was shared by a dozen strangers. In their new building, the union applied to the government to finance a participatory renovation project through MCMV. Today, they are all owners of one- and two-bedroom flats in a building they helped lay out, and pay just 5% of their income for 10 years with no down payment. As building manager, Silva has faced a steep learning curve. The cities ministry literally handed over the keys: the residents would own the building, not rent it. The residents get the dream of homeownership, but also the responsibility of maintaining their new condominium complex. \u201cDuring carnival a street party passed right by the door, but I was busy taking care of the building,\u201d Silva says. \u201cEvery day there\u2019s a new problem. The front gate is always breaking.\u201d There were social habits to change, too. Visitors would often come to the front desk looking for a friend without knowing their last name. \u201cCome on, there are 500 residents,\u201d Silva says. \u201cIf the person doesn\u2019t come with the apartment number, they don\u2019t get in.\u201d Located in the middle of downtown, Edif\u00edcio Dandara is walking distance from jobs, prime subway service, museums, grocery stores, and the city\u2019s new top public cultural and recreation centre. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t sleep at night thinking about how surreal it is to own a flat in the centre of S\u00e3o Paulo,\u201d Silva says. \u201cI never could have afforded to buy here.\u201d But as successful as it has been, only 30 such downtown buildings were renovated in S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 and fewer in all other cities. \u201cEach building became artisanal and that\u2019s difficult to do at scale,\u201d acknowledges Evaniza Rodrigues of the Union of Housing Movements, UMM, which pushed the ministry of cities to rehabilitate abandoned buildings. While occupations continue apace, especially in S\u00e3o Paulo, the loss of a federal partner willing to invest in renovation has made the provocative strategy\u2019s end game less clear. As well as new and renovated housing, the third major plank of the ministry of cities programme was favela upgrading. Since the late 19th century, when the first favelas popped up to house poor Brazilians, most cities have at best ignored and at worst evicted favela dwellers. In the 1980s and 90s, Rio pioneered a different attitude that eventually became a national trend: investing public dollars in favela improvements. It provided land titles, paid favela residents cash for their \u201csweat equity\u201d investment, and went as far as designing and implementing infrastructure improvements outright, including sidewalks, paved roads and alleys, water and sewer lines and handrails for staircases. Historically, the federal government had left favela upgrading to state and city governments, but during the ministry\u2019s flush years, Bras\u00edlia got involved, too: it put 33.5bn reais into more than 3,500 favelas nationwide. Outside the gated entrance to Silva\u2019s council estate, Parais\u00f3polis now sports a paved avenue served by city buses connecting its tens of thousands of residents to the rest of the city. A new health clinic, school and job training centre flank the roadway. Inside Parais\u00f3polis\u2019s narrow streets and alleys, meanwhile, business is booming as banks, restaurants and shops vie for customers. In short, the former favela has become a neighbourhood \u2013 the ultimate goal of favela upgrading. Jos\u00e9 Maria Lacerda, 65, moved to Parais\u00f3polis in 1975, when he estimates there were about 10,000 shacks on an abandoned farm. Back then, the government provided no utilities or infrastructure whatsoever. \u201cWe used candles at night,\u201d he said. Today Lacerda and his wife run the residents\u2019 association, a busy job representing an estimated 100,000 people. \u201cI consider my neighbourhood to be a city,\u201d Lacerda says. The favela residents still face eviction pressure, particularly from their well-heeled neighbours, including a recent spate of suspicious arsons. But the decade of investment was a boon for Parais\u00f3polis. \u201cToday we have everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to live in Parais\u00f3polis.\u201d He is worried that the death of the ministry means the money has run out. There is more work to be done \u2013 more housing needed, a drainage project that never panned out. Without the ministry, he fears for the worst. \u201cThe city [alone] didn\u2019t have the capacity on its own to do all this,\u201d he says. If favela upgrading generally went well under the ministry, it was the colossal housing production that tarnished its reputation the most. To achieve the 7m unit goal, the ministry allocated 94% of its housing budget to private construction companies, who worked with municipal governments to select sites. It agreed to pay up to 98,000 reais per unit, and set only basic parameters of minimum unit size and requirements for water and sewerage. The result was quantity over quality. Construction firms sought to maximise profit within the fixed sum and built inadequate housing on the edge of town where land was cheap, all abetted by local governments. \u201cCities zoned lots of farmland for urban development and MCMV projects ended up built in areas that a few years ago were rural,\u201d Maricato says. \u201cWe did some excellent projects, but a lot of sprawl came out of the ministry of cities. The money went to build roads out to empty land.\u201d The success of Parais\u00f3polis was an exception. In most places there has been not improved density but vast new sprawl, from Recife to Florian\u00f3polis. Some residents abandoned their new homes and returned to their favelas. Journalists have documented serious abuses on the part of corner-cutting construction companies and lax city and federal oversight. On a former patch of Amazon rainforest on the northern edge of Manaus, 55,000 people live in a crumbling council estate that was the country\u2019s largest MCMV project, where falling roofs and constant leaks have rendered the estate\u2019s name, \u201cLiving Better\u201d, a cruel irony. Rio, meanwhile, used the programme as a pretext for forcibly evicting thousands of favela residents ahead of the World Cup and Olympics. And in the very first MCMV estate in Bahia, organised crime and paramilitaries rule the roost. Maricato blames collusion between the real estate industry and local elected officials for the disastrous results. \u201cAs soon as real money showed up in the cities, democratic forces lost out,\u201d she says. Worse, the federal government\u2019s injection of a huge subsidy into the housing market had another unintended consequence: rents shot up. As a result, millions of Brazilian renters now find themselves burdened. Today, despite the ministry building 4 million units, the country\u2019s housing deficit stands at 7.7 million units \u2013 higher than it was when the whole project started. \u201cWhat kind of math is this?\u201d Maricato asks in frustration. There is no longer any time to fix the worst mistakes. Bolsonaro, whose conservative populism has sought to undo many of his predecessor\u2019s legacies, folded the ministry on his first day in his office, as part of a sweeping cabinet reshuffle that also saw mainstay portfolios such as culture, sports and social policy folded into larger bureaucracies. The decision was the final nail in the coffin after two years of steep cuts to the flagship housing and infrastructure programmes that enabled the ministry to build so much and reshape Brazilian cities \u2013 for good and for ill. The money had already been slashed by former president Michel Temer, who took over after the 2016 impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, and new housing for Brazilians on the lowest incomes was effectively halted. With Brazil\u2019s cities in dire straits once again, the country\u2019s mayors joined forces in May to plead with Bolsonaro to reopen the ministry. He signalled he was open to the idea, though his conservative deputies insisted such a move would renege on the president\u2019s promise to shrink the size of Brazilian government. In the meantime, the cities may have to fend for themselves without a national champion. Many officials acknowledge the ministry\u2019s flaws but mourn its passing, such as Paulo Massoca, a civil engineer with the S\u00e3o Bernardo dos Campos housing office, a suburb outside S\u00e3o Paulo. Massoca presided over changes to Jardim Silvina, which won a prize for best favela-upgrading project in Brazil. Smaller favelas such as Silvina are more common than city-sized ones like Parais\u00f3polis, and under Massoca\u2019s watch the community saw thoughtful interventions \u2013 new water and sewer lines underneath newly paved walkways and stairwells, and the moving of residents who were living in areas at risk of flooding and landslides to a new housing estate just a few blocks away, instead of being forcibly evicted to the middle of nowhere. For public officials working in these smaller municipalities, which enjoy neither the institutional knowhow nor the inflated land values of big cities such as S\u00e3o Paulo, the guidance they received from Bras\u00edlia was welcome and will be sorely missed. \u201cThe ministry of cities shone a light for the country on how to plan and confront problems on the periphery,\u201d says Massoca. \u201cIt was a historic opportunity.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

Still, there was high excitement around the show\u2019s return. The previous series \u2013 in which a murder elegantly bled into a group portrait of five complicated women in Monterey, California \u2013 had been an award-winning slice of golden age TV, a show with the cast of a movie, led by Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon. Giddily, for season two, they would be joined by Meryl Streep. And there was another intriguing coup. The whole series was to be directed by the Oscar-winning British film-maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/09/andrea-arnold-interview-american-honey-shia-labeouf-sasha-lane\" title=\"\">Andrea Arnold</a>. Kidman spoke on behalf of the production. They were, she said, \u201cin the hands of [a] visionary\u201d.</p> <p>That was then. Now, the season finale will air this weekend only after an industry scandal: an <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/big-little-lies-season-2-andrea-arnold-lost-creative-control-jean-marc-vallee-1202156884/\" title=\"\">expos\u00e9</a> in IndieWire revealing that once the series had been shot, creative control was taken from Arnold by the producers and all seven episodes recut by Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e, the director of the first season. Reportedly, Arnold was informed Vall\u00e9e had always been due to resume his involvement; it was just that nobody had told her. When the re-edit was done, she had to spend 17 days reshooting under his \u201cextremely hands-on\u201d supervision. The experience is said to have left her devastated. A <a href=\"https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a28383984/big-little-lies-season-2-behind-the-scenes-disputes-hbo-responds/\" title=\"\">statement</a> was provided by HBO. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be a season two of Big Little Lies without Andrea Arnold,\u201d it read. There was no denial of the basic story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"882d7a15d7a525f1af8aaf0f5307f5594e9a69d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/882d7a15d7a525f1af8aaf0f5307f5594e9a69d6/0_374_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Big Little Lies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Episode one of Big Little Lies\u2019 second season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It at least solved a mystery. Many fans had found the second season oddly edited and padded with flashbacks. Even so, most episodes ran 10 minutes shorter than those of the first series. More generally, it was questioned how a director as singular as Arnold \u2013 the creator of such raw, lyrical films as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/10/fish-tank-review\" title=\"\">Fish Tank</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/13/american-honey-review-andrea-arnold\" title=\"\">American Honey</a> \u2013 could end up making something that felt so often like the beigely polite work of Vall\u00e9e?</p> <p>The answer was she had not. The proof, we assume, remains on whatever hard drive holds the show she made before Vall\u00e9e began his edit. (There is already a social media campaign to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/releasethearnoldcut?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag\" title=\"\">#ReleaseTheArnoldCut</a>.) Amid the many troubling details, it emerged that Arnold had been encouraged both to shoot as she saw fit and allowed to start her own edit in London before, predictably, her most distinctive sequences took the brunt of Vall\u00e9e\u2019s cuts.</p> <p>Arnold is a sharply intelligent woman with a gleeful sense of mischief; accepting the Oscar for her short film Wasp in 2005, she declared the feeling to be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CGR0T9-Qho\" title=\"\">\u201cthe dog\u2019s bollocks\u201d</a>. She does not like talking to the press at the best of times, and these are not those. (She did not respond to a request for a comment for this piece.) She is also no one\u2019s idea of a cautionary tale. While her films are rough, boundary-pushing beasts set in Tilbury (Fish Tank), working-class Glasgow (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/18/londonfilmfestival2006.londonfilmfestival1\" title=\"\">Red Road</a>), the wild midwest (American Honey) and 1840s Yorkshire (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/10/wuthering-heights-film-review\" title=\"\">Wuthering Heights</a>), she has also successfully done time in the mainstream. Before Big Little Lies, she had been in the US directing episodes of the shows I Love Dick and Transparent. The atmosphere she created on set in Monterey was, by all accounts, happy and productive. She is, put simply, a vastly experienced working director.</p> <p>And also one with a credibility that Big Little Lies quickly laid claim to. In modern, high-end TV \u2013 even with film directors flooding the market \u2013 to have a series overseen by someone with Arnold\u2019s history of Cannes prizes and art-cinema excellence was a status symbol. The same publicity push in which Kidman called Arnold a visionary saw HBO carefully namecheck her films, suggesting at least someone involved had actually seen them and wanted their style in the show.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We think of directors as gods with megaphones, the top of the food chain, when most are just anxious freelancers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Evidently, not really. In the future, no director will confuse such flutterings with actual power. What followed played like, were careers not involved, a slapstick workplace comedy: writer-producer David E Kelley drifting on set for the occasional hour, convinced that whatever weirdness Arnold was up to could be later squashed into familiar shape by Vall\u00e9e, Gareth to his David Brent.</p> <p>It also tells a grim story about the continued trials of women directors. According to IndieWire, Kelley had both planned to bring Vall\u00e9e back and failed to tell Arnold. If true, the male power axis is an ugly look for a show adapted from a novel by a woman, Liane Moriarty, and much praised as a home for robust female narratives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d799c6fba1ab2b6cc660c5c9320d857a7ef479e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d799c6fba1ab2b6cc660c5c9320d857a7ef479e6/174_309_4977_6789/733.jpg\" alt=\"Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e\" width=\"733\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e, brought back to re-edit season two.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Buckner/Deadline/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The picture is complicated by the roles as executive producers of Kidman and Witherspoon, each unlikely to have known nothing of Arnold\u2019s crisis. Neither has commented. (On the day the story broke, Witherspoon <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReeseW/status/1149738194721595392\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> a sun-bright snapshot of herself, Kidman and their co-stars on a Pacific beach with their children. \u201cFeeling extra grateful for this incredible cast and amazing crew,\u201d it was captioned.) Still, the gender dynamics at play feel clearer if you simply tweak the question asked in that first episode from What Have They Done? to Would They Have Done It to a Man?</p> <p>Broader still, the drama reminds us that directing is the original gig economy, and like every dodgy economic model, women get the worst of it.

      "bodyText": "The first episode in the second season of Big Little Lies was more tellingly titled than most of us could know: What Have They Done? Still, there was high excitement around the show\u2019s return. The previous series \u2013 in which a murder elegantly bled into a group portrait of five complicated women in Monterey, California \u2013 had been an award-winning slice of golden age TV, a show with the cast of a movie, led by Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon. Giddily, for season two, they would be joined by Meryl Streep. And there was another intriguing coup. The whole series was to be directed by the Oscar-winning British film-maker Andrea Arnold. Kidman spoke on behalf of the production. They were, she said, \u201cin the hands of [a] visionary\u201d. That was then. Now, the season finale will air this weekend only after an industry scandal: an expos\u00e9 in IndieWire revealing that once the series had been shot, creative control was taken from Arnold by the producers and all seven episodes recut by Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e, the director of the first season. Reportedly, Arnold was informed Vall\u00e9e had always been due to resume his involvement; it was just that nobody had told her. When the re-edit was done, she had to spend 17 days reshooting under his \u201cextremely hands-on\u201d supervision. The experience is said to have left her devastated. A statement was provided by HBO. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be a season two of Big Little Lies without Andrea Arnold,\u201d it read. There was no denial of the basic story. It at least solved a mystery. Many fans had found the second season oddly edited and padded with flashbacks. Even so, most episodes ran 10 minutes shorter than those of the first series. More generally, it was questioned how a director as singular as Arnold \u2013 the creator of such raw, lyrical films as Fish Tank and American Honey \u2013 could end up making something that felt so often like the beigely polite work of Vall\u00e9e? The answer was she had not. The proof, we assume, remains on whatever hard drive holds the show she made before Vall\u00e9e began his edit. (There is already a social media campaign to #ReleaseTheArnoldCut.) Amid the many troubling details, it emerged that Arnold had been encouraged both to shoot as she saw fit and allowed to start her own edit in London before, predictably, her most distinctive sequences took the brunt of Vall\u00e9e\u2019s cuts. Arnold is a sharply intelligent woman with a gleeful sense of mischief; accepting the Oscar for her short film Wasp in 2005, she declared the feeling to be \u201cthe dog\u2019s bollocks\u201d. She does not like talking to the press at the best of times, and these are not those. (She did not respond to a request for a comment for this piece.) She is also no one\u2019s idea of a cautionary tale. While her films are rough, boundary-pushing beasts set in Tilbury (Fish Tank), working-class Glasgow (Red Road), the wild midwest (American Honey) and 1840s Yorkshire (Wuthering Heights), she has also successfully done time in the mainstream. Before Big Little Lies, she had been in the US directing episodes of the shows I Love Dick and Transparent. The atmosphere she created on set in Monterey was, by all accounts, happy and productive. She is, put simply, a vastly experienced working director. And also one with a credibility that Big Little Lies quickly laid claim to. In modern, high-end TV \u2013 even with film directors flooding the market \u2013 to have a series overseen by someone with Arnold\u2019s history of Cannes prizes and art-cinema excellence was a status symbol. The same publicity push in which Kidman called Arnold a visionary saw HBO carefully namecheck her films, suggesting at least someone involved had actually seen them and wanted their style in the show. Evidently, not really. In the future, no director will confuse such flutterings with actual power. What followed played like, were careers not involved, a slapstick workplace comedy: writer-producer David E Kelley drifting on set for the occasional hour, convinced that whatever weirdness Arnold was up to could be later squashed into familiar shape by Vall\u00e9e, Gareth to his David Brent. It also tells a grim story about the continued trials of women directors. According to IndieWire, Kelley had both planned to bring Vall\u00e9e back and failed to tell Arnold. If true, the male power axis is an ugly look for a show adapted from a novel by a woman, Liane Moriarty, and much praised as a home for robust female narratives. The picture is complicated by the roles as executive producers of Kidman and Witherspoon, each unlikely to have known nothing of Arnold\u2019s crisis. Neither has commented. (On the day the story broke, Witherspoon tweeted a sun-bright snapshot of herself, Kidman and their co-stars on a Pacific beach with their children. \u201cFeeling extra grateful for this incredible cast and amazing crew,\u201d it was captioned.) Still, the gender dynamics at play feel clearer if you simply tweak the question asked in that first episode from What Have They Done? to Would They Have Done It to a Man? Broader still, the drama reminds us that directing is the original gig economy, and like every dodgy economic model, women get the worst of it. The revelations feel doubly shocking because we think of directors as gods with megaphones, the top of the food chain, when most are just more anxious freelancers. Which is why it would be a mistake to assume that the whistleblower came from Arnold\u2019s camp. Next month will see the director Pedro Almod\u00f3var release Pain and Glory, an autobiographical drama about an ageing grand auteur. A certain melancholy comes from knowing that this kind of near-extinct figure was a product of the cinema, a space that many directors have now left for TV. What they have learned is that golden age television is still television, a medium in which the role of creative final boss falls not to them but the showrunner, typically a writer-producer whose own relationship with directing may be as an occasional sideline or something that one of the staff does.

      "bodyText": "First there was the Beatles v the Rolling Stones. Then there was Blur v Oasis. Now the music industry is about to be plunged into a destructive new rivalry. That\u2019s right: Iggy Azalea v Peppa Pig. Last month, the Australian rapper announced that her forthcoming album, In My Defense \u2013 featuring cover art in which she sits beside a car while blood pours from her head \u2013 would be released this Friday. Chart domination looked set to be hers. But then, this week, the official Peppa Pig Twitter account announced that Peppa \u2013 a cartoon pig from a children\u2019s television series about a family of pigs \u2013 would also be dropping an album on Friday. \u201cYou can already listen to Bing Bong Zoo NOW!\u201d the account tweeted, knowing full well that this announcement would punch a crater-sized hole through popular culture as we know it. Or at least as Azalea knew it. She retweeted Peppa Pig, dismayed that a seemingly benign infant pig would think to ruin her shot at glory like this. Peppa Pig shot back with sass, tweeting a gif of her wearing a crown and dancing in front of a mirror, accompanied by lyrics from Azalea\u2019s biggest hit, Fancy. Things quickly tipped into physical threats, with Azalea tweeting: \u201cYou\u2019ll end up a breakfast special\u201d at her animated rival. It is, without any exaggeration at all, literal war. You can see why both sides feel threatened. Azalea and Peppa are fighting over the same demographic: Peppa with tracks such as Balloon Ride and Expert Daddy Pig, and Azalea with tracks such as Fuck It Up and Pussy Pop. How are children supposed to choose between such ideologically identical would-be role models? Who will win? It\u2019s hard to say. Azalea is by far the biggest social-media star of the pair, having 13.2 million Instagram followers to Peppa\u2019s 157,000. But at the same time, there\u2019s no disputing Peppa\u2019s empire. She\u2019s a \u00a31.4bn global brand; Azalea\u2019s net worth is thought to be a measly \u00a34.8m.

He described the past 15 months as \u201cvery tough\u201d and added: \u201cI am pleased that nine of the 11 charges were dismissed and that the panel found me to be an honest and credible witness, and that my actions on one particularly difficult day were out of character.\u201d The FA\u2019s findings do describe Sturridge as an \u201cimpressive and credible witness\u201d but also claim he gave a misleading account when first interviewed about his brother\u2019s betting and his knowledge of it. The FA\u2019s statement said: \u201cMr Sturridge faced 11 charges. Nine of those charges (1a, 1b, 2, 5, 6a, 6b and 7-9) concerned alleged breaches of the inside information rule, in that, it was said, Mr Sturridge had provided inside information to friends and family about his possible transfer moves in January 2018, which information had then been used for, or in relation to, betting. Those charges were dismissed by the regulatory commission. \u201cThe regulatory commission found proved charges 3 and 4, which alleged that, in that same transfer window, Mr Sturridge had instructed his brother, Leon, to bet on a possible move by him (Daniel) to Sevilla FC. In issuing that instruction, the regulatory commission found that, as a matter of fact, Mr Sturridge had provided his brother with inside information for that purpose.\u201d Sturridge has been training this summer in Los Angeles, where he has a home and a dog, Lucci. The former Chelsea and Manchester City striker has interest from clubs in the United States, China, several European teams and Premier League suitors including Aston Villa.",

      "body": "<p>On 20 July 1969, before an estimated television audience of 650 million, a lunar module named Eagle touched down on the moon\u2019s Sea of Tranquility. The tension of the landing and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/17/greatest-photos-ever-moon-landing-shots-artistic-masterpieces\">images of astronauts in futuristic spacesuits</a> striding over the moon\u2019s barren surface, Earth reflected in their oversized visors, would prove wildly influential to artists, writers and film-makers. </p> <p>Also watching were the soon-to-be proponents of another technological field populated by brilliant young geeks: computer games. It is perhaps no coincidence that during the early 1960s, when Nasa was working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Instrumentation Lab to develop the guidance and control systems for Apollo spacecraft, elsewhere on campus a programmer named Steve Russell was working with a small team to create one of the first true video game experiences.</p> <p>Inspired by the space race, and using the same DEC PDP-1 model of computer that generated spacecraft telemetry data for Nasa\u2019s Mariner programme, Russell wrote Spacewar!, a simple combat game in which two players controlled starships with limited fuel, duelling around the gravitational well of a nearby star. Although only playable in university research labs, SpaceWar! was hugely influential on the nascent games industry, inspiring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/feb/01/nolan-bushnell-atari-pioneer-award-game-developers-conference-san-francisco\">Atari founder Nolan Bushnell</a>\u2019s first coin-operated arcade game Computer Space and later the classic Asteroids, which also attempted to simulate the physics of gravity, thrust and inertia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f99734bff0560f6b2bc8f017d0ec9a78c4587ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f99734bff0560f6b2bc8f017d0ec9a78c4587ca/18_0_657_394/500.jpg\" alt=\"Gravity, thrust and inertia ...

Asteroids.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Atari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 70s, Bushnell and Atari were fascinated with the space programme. The fourth designer hired at the company, Dennis Koble, previously worked on biofeedback at the Nasa Ames Research Centre, while coder Steve Kitchen spent 18 months researching the STS-2 shuttle flight to write the Atari 2600 simulator game Space Shuttle: A Journey Into Space. Before its release in 1983, the authenticity of the game was tested by Dr Ed Gibson, an astronaut and physicist who worked on the development of the Skylab space station.</p> <p>The 1969 moon landing also directly inspired a genre of games known as lunar lander simulations, in which players had to fight against the limitations of their craft\u2019s technology \u2013 and Newtonian physics \u2013 to land safely on the cratered surface. Probably the first example was a text-based simulation, written in 1969 by teenage coder Jim Storer. Watching the Apollo missions on TV, he developed a fascination with the demanding logistics of space flight. At the time he was attending Lexington high school in Massachusetts, near the headquarters of Digital Equipment Corporation, and had access to a PDP-8 minicomputer.</p> <p>\u201cI was a science major and the idea that we were going to set foot on a surface that wasn\u2019t the Earth was exciting. But what I was most interested in were the computers,\u201d says Storer. It is amazing how they managed to get to the moon with such primitive technology. It had nothing approaching the power of an iPhone.\u201d</p> <p>The limitations of Nasa\u2019s computing power reflected the challenges all early programmers faced. As Storer recalls, \u201cThe computer we had at our school was a huge cabinet but all it had was 12kb of memory and 8kb of that was the operating system. So you had 4kb and that was shared between eight users. It was hard because you had to keep track of every line of code. If there had been one more line in my program, the computer couldn\u2019t have run it. So what I wrote was a question and answer game \u2013 at each stage of the landing you\u2019d find out your current velocity and then you had to enter in how much fuel to use.

      "bodyText": "On 20 July 1969, before an estimated television audience of 650 million, a lunar module named Eagle touched down on the moon\u2019s Sea of Tranquility. The tension of the landing and the images of astronauts in futuristic spacesuits striding over the moon\u2019s barren surface, Earth reflected in their oversized visors, would prove wildly influential to artists, writers and film-makers. Also watching were the soon-to-be proponents of another technological field populated by brilliant young geeks: computer games. It is perhaps no coincidence that during the early 1960s, when Nasa was working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Instrumentation Lab to develop the guidance and control systems for Apollo spacecraft, elsewhere on campus a programmer named Steve Russell was working with a small team to create one of the first true video game experiences. Inspired by the space race, and using the same DEC PDP-1 model of computer that generated spacecraft telemetry data for Nasa\u2019s Mariner programme, Russell wrote Spacewar!, a simple combat game in which two players controlled starships with limited fuel, duelling around the gravitational well of a nearby star. Although only playable in university research labs, SpaceWar! was hugely influential on the nascent games industry, inspiring Atari founder Nolan Bushnell\u2019s first coin-operated arcade game Computer Space and later the classic Asteroids, which also attempted to simulate the physics of gravity, thrust and inertia. In the 70s, Bushnell and Atari were fascinated with the space programme. The fourth designer hired at the company, Dennis Koble, previously worked on biofeedback at the Nasa Ames Research Centre, while coder Steve Kitchen spent 18 months researching the STS-2 shuttle flight to write the Atari 2600 simulator game Space Shuttle: A Journey Into Space. Before its release in 1983, the authenticity of the game was tested by Dr Ed Gibson, an astronaut and physicist who worked on the development of the Skylab space station. The 1969 moon landing also directly inspired a genre of games known as lunar lander simulations, in which players had to fight against the limitations of their craft\u2019s technology \u2013 and Newtonian physics \u2013 to land safely on the cratered surface. Probably the first example was a text-based simulation, written in 1969 by teenage coder Jim Storer. Watching the Apollo missions on TV, he developed a fascination with the demanding logistics of space flight. At the time he was attending Lexington high school in Massachusetts, near the headquarters of Digital Equipment Corporation, and had access to a PDP-8 minicomputer. \u201cI was a science major and the idea that we were going to set foot on a surface that wasn\u2019t the Earth was exciting. But what I was most interested in were the computers,\u201d says Storer. It is amazing how they managed to get to the moon with such primitive technology. It had nothing approaching the power of an iPhone.\u201d The limitations of Nasa\u2019s computing power reflected the challenges all early programmers faced. As Storer recalls, \u201cThe computer we had at our school was a huge cabinet but all it had was 12kb of memory and 8kb of that was the operating system. So you had 4kb and that was shared between eight users. It was hard because you had to keep track of every line of code. If there had been one more line in my program, the computer couldn\u2019t have run it. So what I wrote was a question and answer game \u2013 at each stage of the landing you\u2019d find out your current velocity and then you had to enter in how much fuel to use. If you burned fuel too early, you stopped too high and end up crashing to the ground \u2013 it\u2019s a delicate balance to make a graceful landing without hitting the moon too hard.\u201d A slew of other moon landing simulations followed, including Atari\u2019s 1979 arcade hit Lunar Lander and the early home-computer title Jupiter Lander, both requiring the player to employ deft joystick control and careful use of the thrust button to land on rocky surfaces.

Certainly that wasn\u2019t a complete performance from the Diamonds. It\u2019s very disappointing to let a lead like that slip and those little errors that they were able to win back in earlier games proved much more costly against tougher opposition. England and South Africa have both looked in better form than NZ to my mind, so the Diamonds will need to lift to another level in order to win through to the final. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d3051768f08d0b6ca532faa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T11:01:35.569Z\">12.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Liz Ellis doesn\u2019t agree however, she thought Bruce faded at the end of the match and would have brought Sarah Klau on at the end for some extra spark.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d3050eb8f08d0b6ca532fa3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T11:00:54.164Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Player of the match: Courtney Bruce</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cI think I could have done a bit more to be honest!\u201d says Bruce.

The key for him was to figure out how they can learn from a big win the way they learn from a close win or a loss. It will be fascinating to watch if they have figured that out this time.

Caitlin Bassett, while she\u2019s scored plenty of goals in the first five games, has not looked at her best. Plenty of fumbles, some easy missed shots and her timing has been a little off. The Diamonds will need her to be at her very best tonight.</p> <p>In the mid-court, Liz Watson is widely considered the world\u2019s best WA, yet she is playing in C. This seems to be to make space for Kelsey Browne to be paired up with her old Lightning teammates in Bassett and Steph Wood. This has been a solid combination so far and hopefully the gamble to move Watson out of position pays off.</p> <p>Jamie-Lee Price is fairly untested at this level and has not played much WD this season in Super Netball. The umpiring will also be a factor as Price has a tendency to get physical and it remains to be seen how much physicality the umpires will permit. If she is out of play too often, it will make the Ferns\u2019 passage to goal much easier.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d30372e8f08d0b6ca532e11\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T09:10:44.092Z\">10.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Erin Delahunty is live at the stadium and she tells me that there was a much bigger cheer for Australia than New Zealand when they entered the court. Interesting considering the usual animosity between English and Australian sporting fans. I wonder if it could have something to do with the fact that so many English players are in the Super Netball so English fans have been following the Australian competition and have warmed to some of the players? Or possibly there are just a lot of noisy Australians in the arena!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d3036158f0845f89e30f650\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T09:06:46.725Z\">10.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Of course the other big game tonight will be at 5am AEST when England take on South Africa.

While the Ferns were disappointing at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, causing barely a blip for the Diamonds, they look refreshed under new coach Noeline Taurua and certainly beat the Australians for experience. The question is whether they have the fitness to run out a game at this intensity for 60 minutes. With only Laura Langman and Maria Folau playing in the Super Netball, the majority of the Ferns play in the ANZ Premiership, which doesn\u2019t provide the same level of intensity.

      "bodyText": "Well that was a game and a half! Not literally of course, there is no extra time in round matches and even if there was, Folau didn\u2019t let us have the opportunity to play it. Lots to think about for both teams - which of the myriad NZ combinations worked best for them? How do the Diamonds address their less than brilliant final quarters? Are the umpires able to keep pace with the speed of these games? Hope you\u2019ve enjoyed watching along with me - we will have live blogs going for the semis on Saturday and the final on Sunday, so please join us again for those. In the meantime, rest up, get your massages and ice baths and get ready for a bruising weekend of netball finals! Geez, that Erin Delahunty is good. Even with keeping us updated with all the goss from the stadium she managed to get out this brilliant match report within minutes of the game ending. Relive the drama and enjoy! Otaj Ihba asks via email \u201cSo, are the Diamonds the favourites to win this World Cup even after that nervy match? Or will the winner of the other semi-final be the more confident team when it comes to lifting the trophy?\u201d It\u2019s hard to say! Certainly that wasn\u2019t a complete performance from the Diamonds. It\u2019s very disappointing to let a lead like that slip and those little errors that they were able to win back in earlier games proved much more costly against tougher opposition. England and South Africa have both looked in better form than NZ to my mind, so the Diamonds will need to lift to another level in order to win through to the final. Liz Ellis doesn\u2019t agree however, she thought Bruce faded at the end of the match and would have brought Sarah Klau on at the end for some extra spark. \u201cI think I could have done a bit more to be honest!\u201d says Bruce. Not sure she could have, she looks absolutely done! And with 7 gains, 3 intercepts, 5 deflections and 3 rebounds the stats agree that she had a good one. OB Jato on email notes \u201cNew Zealand and thrillers at sports World Cups, eh?\u201d I\u2019m not sure any Kiwis will have any fingernails left after the week they\u2019ve had! Kiwis, you all have my permission to call in sick tomorrow. You deserve a long weekend. Abhijato Sensarma asks via email \u201cHas this been the most exciting high-quality match at this World Cup?\u201d It\u2019s certainly been one of the most exciting! Not sure it will feel like a win for the Diamonds though after letting that lead fall away. This looked for all money like it was going to end in a draw but unbelievably Folau misses the final shot, just as she did for the Thunderbirds in the Super Netball just a few short weeks ago. Q4 14 mins: Australia 50-49 NZ The Diamonds play it around to eat up time and finally get it to Bassett who scores. Q4 14 mins: Australia 49-48 NZ Watson has an immediate impact with an intercept. The Ferns move it down court but miss an easy pass to Folau. They reset and finally she slots the goal. Q4 13 mins: Australia 49-47 NZ The Diamonds aren\u2019t going to make it easy to get a turnover. They are being very patient in attack, knowing they have the upper hand. Jane Watson comes back on for the Ferns, along with Folau to try to close this out. Q4 12 mins: Australia 48-46 NZ There is no easy passage to goal for either team right now. The Ferns are being very conservative in attack, but need to add some desperation in defence, as they need turnovers. Q4 10 mins: Australia 47-45 NZ English umpire Burgess is very strict on the obstruction, so the Diamonds will be pleased he is at their shooting end to finish the game. They are getting a lot of space for their shots. Q4 8 mins: Australia 46-43 NZ Bruce gets very close to her own incredible intercept, but misses by millimetres. It has made the Ferns more hesitant on the feed though. Q4 6 mins: Australia 44-42 NZ The crowd is very unhappy with some umpiring decisions! It\u2019s getting firey in there. Kopua comes within centimetres of another incredible intercept but can\u2019t quite get to this one. Q4 5 mins: Australia 42-41 NZ Casey Kopua with a sensational intercept to send the ball back to her shooters who nail the goal. Q4 4 mins: Australia 42-40 NZ Now it\u2019s the Diamonds who look a little flustered. I suspect they relaxed a little too much when they pushed the lead out and weren\u2019t expecting this fight back. They continue to get the ball into the circle, but not with the fluidity they had in the first three quarters. Q4 1 min: Australia 40-37 NZ I was wrong, Price comes back on for the Diamonds in WD. One of those concerning Bassett turnovers gives the Ferns the chance to close the gap further early. The Ferns win the quarter by two and despite looking very unsettled for most of that quarter, now finally look like a team that is able to compete with the Diamonds. The changes seem to be working for them. It will be interesting to see if Alexander makes any changes to the Diamonds line up, but I suspect she will stick with this line for now, with players ready on the bench if the lead shrinks any further in the first few minutes of the final quarter. Q3 14 mins: Australia 40-35 NZ A few cautions being handed out as the intensity lifts - Rore is the latest one to be called. Q3 13 mins: Australia 38-34 NZ The Ferns are fighting their way back into this despite - or maybe due to - the \u2018bibs in the air\u2019 approach to changes. Mes and Ekenasio are moving the ball better between them and Langman is the steadying influence through the middle. Q3 12 mins: Australia 38-33 NZ More changes in defence - Rore comes back on at GD but Watson wasn\u2019t able to get her bibs off in time so Kopua waits on the bench until the next goal is scored. Q3 11 mins: Australia 38-31 NZ Here comes that WD change - Browne has just had too much space on Rore. Karin Burger joins the game and Ekenasio has also come back on at GA for Folau. Q3 10 mins: Australia 36-30 NZ Bizarre moment with Bassett bending down to tie her shoelace while the ball was being thrown back on court. She stands up, finds it at her feet and shoots the goal. Q3 8 mins: Australia 34-27 NZ It\u2019s all looking too easy for the Diamonds at the moment. The Ferns don\u2019t look like they have the answers. They are forcing a few turnovers, but their attacking play is so static, they are really troubled by the Diamonds\u2019 defence. Q3 6 mins: Australia 32-26 NZ The crowd might join Erin in buying the umpires that stop watch. A lot of yelling when Folau holds on to her shots for 4-5 seconds. Q3 4 mins: Australia 32-24 NZ For some reason we have a commentary change for the second half? Did Sharni Layton pick up a voice injury during the break? We now get Dan Ryan in there \u2013 not sure how he\u2019s fitting it in with coaching Northern Ireland as well! I wouldn\u2019t have thought a head coach in a World Cup would have a second to think about anything else but coaching, but he\u2019s squeezing it in. Q3 1 min: Australia 29-24 NZ Quick goal to Australia to start. NZ have brought Shannon Saunders on at WA - interesting change, I would have expected a new WD instead? But Taurua knows what she\u2019s doing! Heading to some half-time analysis by three former Diamonds greats in Liz Ellis, Cath Cox and Kim Green. Cox notes that the feeders found Bassett much more easily in the second quarter. Green isn\u2019t too sure about the change from Price to Hadley in WD - she thought Price was generating some energy and isn\u2019t sure about playing Hadley out of position. Big quarter from the Diamonds who are edging out those individual battles all over the court. The new shooting combination of Mes and Folau has only had two minutes so far, so we\u2019ll have to keep an eye on the impact that may have as we get into the second half. Six goals is not much at all in a game like this, so the game could still go either way. Q2 14 mins: Australia 26-21 NZ Welcome to the game Bailey Mes! Here\u2019s a Bruce tackle to get you acclimatised! Q2 13 mins: Australia 25-20 NZ Bailey Mes is up off the bench with a GS bib on - looks like the Ferns are getting ready to make a change. Q2 12 mins: Australia 25-18 NZ Australia really pushing it out now. The Ferns look to be struggling with the speed of the attack and the suffocating nature of the defence. Meanwhile Erin has very generously offered to purchase a stop watch for the umpires to help them out with their held ball calls. So kind of her! Q2 10 mins: Australia 24-18 NZ Browne isn\u2019t bothered by the reach of Rore, she is outrunning her and hitting the circle edge so the arms don\u2019t get in her way. NZ may look to bring on a speedier WD option. Q2 8 mins: Australia 21-17 NZ Erin was right about Bassett - she is looking much more switched on this match than she has so far. Not so many of those little fumbles that were creeping into her game. Q2 7 mins: Australia 19-16 NZ Folau adjusts by holding space to run into, rather than space for the ball to be passed into which helps her get around Bruce at last. A footwork call on Price gives the Ferns the opportunity to get back into it. Q2 5 mins: Australia 19-14 NZ Another brilliant tip from Bruce - NZ will need to do something about their set up in the shooting circle. Q2 4 mins: Australia 18-14 NZ A held ball call on Folau gives the Diamonds the chance to extend their lead back out. Q2 3 mins: Australia 16-14 NZ The Ferns are showing hesitation in putting the ball into Folau with Bruce all over her. Bruce appears to have the upper hand in that battle so far. But at the other end of the court, Jane Watson is having some wins over Bassett as well. Q2 1 min: Australia 15-11 NZ No changes for the second quarter for either team and the Diamonds continue on their merry way, scoring with ease. What a first quarter! The lead and the ball swung wildly back and forth, but it was the Australians who settled when it mattered and finished with a few solid goals to take the vital first quarter lead. Q1 14 mins: Australia 12-10 NZ Two attacking contacts at either end of the court send the ball back and forth and then both WAs make some crucial errors with offside and replay calls. It\u2019s getting a bit scrappy out there. Q1 12 mins: Australia 11-9 NZ A huge tip by Bruce sends the ball into Weston\u2019s hands and the attackers are able to capitalise. These little moments will be make or break in this match. Q1 11 mins: Australia 9-9 NZ Erin tells me that fans in the stadium are showing obvious frustration at the inability of the umpires to keep pace with the play. Will keep an eye on how that plays out. Q1 10 mins: Australia 8-8 NZ Huge long shot from Folau just rolls out and gives the Diamonds the chance to equalise. Q1 8 mins: Australia 6-7 NZ It\u2019s a tough battle out there and neither team is giving an inch. The Ferns look frustrated with the tight one-on-one defence but are able to see through the mess at the moment. Q1 6 mins: Australia 4-2 NZ The first turnover of the game is forced by Courtney Bruce and is worked down court to Steph Wood to score with both defenders out. Australia leads 4-2. Q1 5 mins: Australia 3-2 NZ Australia definitely look the more settled at the start. The Ferns look rattled, passing backwards, quite hesitant on the feed. But none of that matters when Folau gets the ball in her hands and sinks the long bombs. Q1 3 mins: Australia 1-1 NZ Tougher passage to goal for New Zealand, but they patiently work it in to Folau. Q1 2 mins: Australia 0-1 NZ The first goal goes to Steph Wood and the Diamonds draw first blood on the night. Q1 1 min: Australia 0-0 NZ Here we go! Australia with the first centre pass. Erin has addressed my concerns on Caitlin Bassett, she tells me \u201cI reckon CBass looks set; relaxed but focused.\u201d Good news for Diamonds fans, hopefully she carries that into the game. Something I\u2019m looking forward to in this game is seeing how both teams respond to the pressure, having not felt it so far this world cup. It was interesting to talk to Diamonds\u2019 performance analyst Dr Mitch Mooney before the tournament about how they assessed the silver medal in last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games. The key for him was to figure out how they can learn from a big win the way they learn from a close win or a loss. It will be fascinating to watch if they have figured that out this time. More of Mitch\u2019s thoughts in here: Another update from Erin at the stadium. She just bumped into Collingwood Magpies coach Rob Wright and got his tip for the game. Rob is feeling pretty confident about the Diamonds\u2019 chances and thinks they will get the win by eight. Now Lisa Alexander says her part: \u201cThis is our test - this is what we play for and do all that training for.\u201d She cites her attacking combination as an \u201cexperienced and winning combination.\u201d Noeline Taurua talking to the commentators over in Liverpool now. \u201cAfter this game we\u2019ll definitely know where we are in the pecking order and what we need to improve on.\u201d Love seeing the love between the women\u2019s sporting teams - there were a few nice Twitter moments between the Diamonds and the Australian women\u2019s cricket team recently. Thinking back on that Australian line up and there is plenty to unpack there. Caitlin Bassett, while she\u2019s scored plenty of goals in the first five games, has not looked at her best. Plenty of fumbles, some easy missed shots and her timing has been a little off. The Diamonds will need her to be at her very best tonight. In the mid-court, Liz Watson is widely considered the world\u2019s best WA, yet she is playing in C. This seems to be to make space for Kelsey Browne to be paired up with her old Lightning teammates in Bassett and Steph Wood. This has been a solid combination so far and hopefully the gamble to move Watson out of position pays off. Jamie-Lee Price is fairly untested at this level and has not played much WD this season in Super Netball. The umpiring will also be a factor as Price has a tendency to get physical and it remains to be seen how much physicality the umpires will permit. If she is out of play too often, it will make the Ferns\u2019 passage to goal much easier. Erin Delahunty is live at the stadium and she tells me that there was a much bigger cheer for Australia than New Zealand when they entered the court. Interesting considering the usual animosity between English and Australian sporting fans. I wonder if it could have something to do with the fact that so many English players are in the Super Netball so English fans have been following the Australian competition and have warmed to some of the players? Or possibly there are just a lot of noisy Australians in the arena! Of course the other big game tonight will be at 5am AEST when England take on South Africa. The Norma Plummer coached South Africans are in sparkling form and without Layla Guscoth in defence, the Roses may be vulnerable. While both teams are still guaranteed to make the semi finals, it will be a fascinating test of where both teams are at before those important finals games. Earlier tonight, Northern Ireland just squeaked home over Barbados with a 46-43 victory. That sends Northern Ireland into the 9-10 play off and Barbados into the 11-12 play off. You can also refresh your memory with my team-by-team guide and laugh at how wrong some of my predictions were. They were simpler times - a week ago... Before we get into the match, let\u2019s catch up on what\u2019s happened most recently. Before their rest day yesterday, the Diamonds easily accounted for Malawi - beautifully analysed here by the always wonderful Erin Delahunty who is on the ground in Liverpool. Interesting to see who Taurua is running as her top line as well. They\u2019re going for height in WD, which may cause problems for the Diamonds\u2019 shortest player in Kelsey Browne at WA GS Maria Folau GA Ameliaranne Ekenasio WA Gina Crampton C Laura Langman WD Katrina Rore GD Casey Kopua GK Jane Watsom And the team list is in for Australia. Lisa Alexander has been pretty coy with her selections so far, so now we know what she considers her top 7. GS Caitlin Bassett GA Steph Wood WA Kelsey Brown C Liz Watson WD Jamie-Lee Price GD Jo Weston GK Courtney Bruce Well here we are, ready for the biggest game for the Diamonds so far. Neither team has really been tested yet \u2013 the Diamonds have an average winning margin of over 58 goals and while the Silver Ferns\u2019 is considerably less, none of that tends to matter once these two teams get on the court. While the Ferns were disappointing at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, causing barely a blip for the Diamonds, they look refreshed under new coach Noeline Taurua and certainly beat the Australians for experience. The question is whether they have the fitness to run out a game at this intensity for 60 minutes. With only Laura Langman and Maria Folau playing in the Super Netball, the majority of the Ferns play in the ANZ Premiership, which doesn\u2019t provide the same level of intensity. So many questions, soon time for some answers!",

In the second, Australia went on three three-goal runs, again on the back of defensive pressure and the Ferns started to make small errors, which the Diamonds capitalised on. A few minutes before the break, wanting to give Weston and Bruce something else to think about, Ferns coach Taurua sent the rangey Bailey Mes to replace Ameliaranne Ekenasio, who had only shot two, at goal attack. Hadley also replaced Price at wing defence for the Diamonds. At the main break the Diamonds led 28-22, with Bassett on 19/21 and Wood 9/11. The game got scrappy in third, as the Ferns clawed their way back into the match thanks to countless personnel changes and outscored Australia by two. Ekenasio came back on at GA and Mes went back to shooter. The Diamonds led 40-36 going into the last. The final quarter could have gone either way, but the Diamonds clung on, shooting just 10 more goals before being let off the hook by Folau\u2019s late miss. The win ensured Australia\u2019s place in Saturday\u2019s semi-finals where they will play South Africa, after their later defeat to England, who face New Zealand.",

      "body": "<p>Early in the spring of 1984, four years before Caroline Crampton was born, her parents embarked on a journey that would shape her life and lead, several decades later, to this book. In a boat they had built themselves over three years of snatched evenings and stolen weekends, they set sail from Cape Town and bobbed up the Atlantic. Using paper maps and taking only short breaks at Ascension Island and the Azores, they headed north until, at 3am on 17 September, they Scherzo arrived in the mudflats of the Thames. They spent that winter basking not in the azure warmth of South Africa but 8,000 miles away at St Katharine Docks, where the waters froze around their boat and ducks trotted on ice past their cabin. Yet they stayed.</p> <p>Growing up, Crampton knew the Thames estuary was \u201cthe place I loved best\u201d. Taken aboard the family boat at six weeks old, she went on to spend holidays travelling the North Sea and give directions not by road name, but by compass point (\u201cWalk north-north-east from the station and turn west at the war memorial\u201d). Even as a rebellious teenager doing the teenage thing of spurning all that her parents had given her, the Thames kept calling her back. When a student at Oxford, she \u201cwalked hundreds of miles up and down its banks, shivering in icy frosts and sweating in muggy dampness\u201d.</p> <p>Few stretches of water have been as hymned by the poets. In 1802, William Wordsworth composed a sonnet on Westminster Bridge that opens \u201cEarth has not any thing to show more fair\u201d and carries on oohing and aahing for the next 13 lines. This while the Thames was an open sewer in which, as scientist Michael Faraday later wrote, \u201cthe feculence rolled up in clouds so dense that they were visible at the surface\u201d.</p> <p>No such soft-focus sentimentalising for Crampton, whose book expresses a more precise love. Where other writers argue the Thames made London, she looks at how men and women have made the river. As she travels through this book from source to sea, covering much of the Thames\u2019s 215 miles by boat, the \u201cancient, dreaming quality\u201d of its upper reaches barely distracts her from Victorian pumping stations, cranes and containers, shipwrecks. Mercifully little time is spent on pretty Oxfordshire with its prosecco and punting, while William Morris lamenting the river\u2019s \u201ccockney-isation\u201d is waved aside as a nostalgia-monger.</p> <p>More than water flows along the Thames; for centuries, so has cash.

St Katharine Docks, where Crampton\u2019s parents spent their first British winter, was one of several built in the early 19th century to take in goods and people. That productive energy coursed through the Thames\u2019s tributaries too, with manufacturers, agriculturalists and distributors setting up on their banks.

      "body": "<p>Before we turn to the Flaming Lips\u2019 15th studio album, it\u2019s worth considering the extremely peculiar path that has brought the Oklahoma trio to this point. They began life as a minor psychedelic alt-rock band with seemingly zero mainstream commercial potential beyond hand-to-mouth survival, on the same US post-punk gig circuit that supported umpteen bands with zero mainstream commercial potential in the mid-80s. When they were signed to a major label in 1991, it looked like one of the grandest acts of folly yet in the crazed search to find the next Nirvana: their debut release under their new deal was an EP called Yeah I Know It\u2019s a Drag, But Wastin\u2019 Pigs Is Still Radical. Like a number of bands signed in the post-grunge goldrush, they had a minor novelty hit \u2013 1994\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvfxKbpoxRE\">She Don\u2019t Use Jelly</a> \u2013 and that appeared to be that.</p> <p>And then the damnedest thing happened: the Flaming Lips released the extraordinary 1999 album <a href=\"https://www.stereophile.com/musicrecordings/100flaming/index.html\">The Soft Bulletin</a>, developed an equally extraordinary live show and became something like a mainstream success. Its successor, 2002\u2019s <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3081-yoshimi-battles-the-pink-robots/\">Yoshimi Battles </a><a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3081-yoshimi-battles-the-pink-robots/\">the Pink Robots</a>, sold half a million copies in the US alone and won a Grammy, which the Flaming Lips seemed to take as a signal to let their imaginations run riot in the most confounding way. They released unwatchable Christmas films, 24-hour long songs, experimental double albums that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/apr/02/wayne-coyne-im-not-having-a-mid-life-crisis-im-having-fun-miley-cyrus\">frontman Wayne Coyne</a> promoted with the suggestion that it \u201cwould have made a better single album if only the artist could have focused themselves\u201d, a series of releases on which they covered The Dark Side of the Moon, Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band and the Stone Roses\u2019 eponymous debut in their entirety, a collaboration with Ke$ha that was pressed on vinyl containing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flaming_Lips_and_Heady_Fwends\">Ke$ha\u2019s menstrual blood</a>, etc.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcrkDm_IN4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aMcrkDm_IN4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>On the one hand, hooray for a band resolutely refusing to cave in to commercial pressure. On the other, a lot of this stuff has definitely muddied the water between \u201cfearless and unbridled artistic experimentation\u201d and \u201capparently just testing everyone\u2019s patience for the sake of it\u201d.</p> <p>It says something about their releases in the intervening years that King\u2019s Mouth has been greeted as a concise return to form: a concept album accompanied by an immersive art exhibition and a children\u2019s book, about a monarch with a giant head that contains galaxies and weather systems, narrated by former Clash guitarist Mick Jones. The latter\u2019s contributions are very much in the vein of <a href=\"http://www.stanleyunwin.com/unwinese.htm\">Stanley Unwin</a>\u2019s appearances on the Small Faces\u2019 1968 psychedelic opus Ogdens\u2019 Nut Gone Flake, and, it has to be said, don\u2019t make much more sense than the inventor of Basic Engly Twenty Fido enquiring if you\u2019re sitting comfortabold two square on your botty. It\u2019s a moot point as to whether Jones sounds either rapt with innocent wonder as he reads, or like a man who hasn\u2019t got a clue what he\u2019s supposed to be going on about.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"35791882680f3c0f18490e265baeebaa748d4f2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35791882680f3c0f18490e265baeebaa748d4f2f/0_0_1890_1890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of King\u2019s Mouth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cover of King\u2019s Mouth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, after pausing for a moment to reflect on the reaction of the spittle-flecked audience at the Roxy in 1977, had they been informed that the Clash\u2019s guitarist was going to end up narrating a psychedelic concept album about a monarch with a head that contained galaxies, it\u2019s hard not to concede that the advance publicity on King\u2019s Mouth (initially released in a limited vinyl-only edition on Record Store Day) is correct. Despite the concept and accompanying folderol, what lies at its heart are a succession of songs more straightforwardly appealing than anything the Flaming Lips have come up with in years. Only the brief instrumental Mother Universe speaks of the kind of self-indulgence that\u2019s marked out their recent releases. It\u2019s nothing as craven as a direct return to the sound of The Soft Bulletin and Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots \u2013 it\u2019s comparatively stripped-down, less widescreen in its musical ambitions, more obviously reliant on electronics that sound like electronics rather than a dense patchwork of samples \u2013 but it shares with those albums the sense of a band marshalling their energies and abundance of outre ideas into relatively short, honed, lushly melodic bursts.</p> <p>At their best \u2013 Mouth of the King, All For the Life of the City \u2013 the songs here are a total joy, reacquainting you with certain strengths the Flaming Lips have tended to obfuscate on recent releases. Multi-instrumentalist Steven Drozd has the ability to mould a wildly varied set of musical backdrops into a cohesive whole \u2013 the album goes from the fidgety distorted funk of Feedaloodum Beedle Dot to the 10cc-ish AOR of The Sparrow to the cinematic, choral sample-bedecked instrumental Funeral Parade without seeming disjointed, largely because whatever style they\u2019re essaying, it somehow always sounds like the Flaming Lips. Wayne Coyne can still project childlike wonder and homespun wisdom without sounding cloying. From Do You Realize? to Waitin\u2019 for Superman, Flaming Lips\u2019 biggest songs have frequently hinged on presenting lyrical ideas that look a bit trite on paper, but gain a peculiar, affecting emotional heft when delivered in Coyne\u2019s wayward, fragile voice.

      "bodyText": "Before we turn to the Flaming Lips\u2019 15th studio album, it\u2019s worth considering the extremely peculiar path that has brought the Oklahoma trio to this point. They began life as a minor psychedelic alt-rock band with seemingly zero mainstream commercial potential beyond hand-to-mouth survival, on the same US post-punk gig circuit that supported umpteen bands with zero mainstream commercial potential in the mid-80s. When they were signed to a major label in 1991, it looked like one of the grandest acts of folly yet in the crazed search to find the next Nirvana: their debut release under their new deal was an EP called Yeah I Know It\u2019s a Drag, But Wastin\u2019 Pigs Is Still Radical. Like a number of bands signed in the post-grunge goldrush, they had a minor novelty hit \u2013 1994\u2019s She Don\u2019t Use Jelly \u2013 and that appeared to be that. And then the damnedest thing happened: the Flaming Lips released the extraordinary 1999 album The Soft Bulletin, developed an equally extraordinary live show and became something like a mainstream success. Its successor, 2002\u2019s Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, sold half a million copies in the US alone and won a Grammy, which the Flaming Lips seemed to take as a signal to let their imaginations run riot in the most confounding way. They released unwatchable Christmas films, 24-hour long songs, experimental double albums that frontman Wayne Coyne promoted with the suggestion that it \u201cwould have made a better single album if only the artist could have focused themselves\u201d, a series of releases on which they covered The Dark Side of the Moon, Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band and the Stone Roses\u2019 eponymous debut in their entirety, a collaboration with Ke$ha that was pressed on vinyl containing Ke$ha\u2019s menstrual blood, etc. On the one hand, hooray for a band resolutely refusing to cave in to commercial pressure. On the other, a lot of this stuff has definitely muddied the water between \u201cfearless and unbridled artistic experimentation\u201d and \u201capparently just testing everyone\u2019s patience for the sake of it\u201d. It says something about their releases in the intervening years that King\u2019s Mouth has been greeted as a concise return to form: a concept album accompanied by an immersive art exhibition and a children\u2019s book, about a monarch with a giant head that contains galaxies and weather systems, narrated by former Clash guitarist Mick Jones. The latter\u2019s contributions are very much in the vein of Stanley Unwin\u2019s appearances on the Small Faces\u2019 1968 psychedelic opus Ogdens\u2019 Nut Gone Flake, and, it has to be said, don\u2019t make much more sense than the inventor of Basic Engly Twenty Fido enquiring if you\u2019re sitting comfortabold two square on your botty. It\u2019s a moot point as to whether Jones sounds either rapt with innocent wonder as he reads, or like a man who hasn\u2019t got a clue what he\u2019s supposed to be going on about. Still, after pausing for a moment to reflect on the reaction of the spittle-flecked audience at the Roxy in 1977, had they been informed that the Clash\u2019s guitarist was going to end up narrating a psychedelic concept album about a monarch with a head that contained galaxies, it\u2019s hard not to concede that the advance publicity on King\u2019s Mouth (initially released in a limited vinyl-only edition on Record Store Day) is correct. Despite the concept and accompanying folderol, what lies at its heart are a succession of songs more straightforwardly appealing than anything the Flaming Lips have come up with in years. Only the brief instrumental Mother Universe speaks of the kind of self-indulgence that\u2019s marked out their recent releases. It\u2019s nothing as craven as a direct return to the sound of The Soft Bulletin and Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots \u2013 it\u2019s comparatively stripped-down, less widescreen in its musical ambitions, more obviously reliant on electronics that sound like electronics rather than a dense patchwork of samples \u2013 but it shares with those albums the sense of a band marshalling their energies and abundance of outre ideas into relatively short, honed, lushly melodic bursts. At their best \u2013 Mouth of the King, All For the Life of the City \u2013 the songs here are a total joy, reacquainting you with certain strengths the Flaming Lips have tended to obfuscate on recent releases. Multi-instrumentalist Steven Drozd has the ability to mould a wildly varied set of musical backdrops into a cohesive whole \u2013 the album goes from the fidgety distorted funk of Feedaloodum Beedle Dot to the 10cc-ish AOR of The Sparrow to the cinematic, choral sample-bedecked instrumental Funeral Parade without seeming disjointed, largely because whatever style they\u2019re essaying, it somehow always sounds like the Flaming Lips. Wayne Coyne can still project childlike wonder and homespun wisdom without sounding cloying. From Do You Realize? to Waitin\u2019 for Superman, Flaming Lips\u2019 biggest songs have frequently hinged on presenting lyrical ideas that look a bit trite on paper, but gain a peculiar, affecting emotional heft when delivered in Coyne\u2019s wayward, fragile voice. It\u2019s a trick much in evidence here: Giant Baby finds him reflecting on his mother\u2019s death and concluding that \u201clife is sometimes sad\u201d; on the concluding How Can a Head, he\u2019s gawping in wonder at the powers of the human brain. How Can a Head is the album\u2019s highlight, blessed with as lovely a melody as the band have ever written. Luxuriating in it, you\u2019re struck by the sense that you should probably enjoy it while it lasts. If the Flaming Lips\u2019 recent history has taught us anything, it\u2019s that their next album will probably be confounding: abnormal service resumed.

\n<p>Most importantly, there\u2019s the fact that the officially submitted cast members had a relatively weak year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/16/lena-headey-cersei-death-game-of-thrones-the-flood-interview\">Lena Headey in particular is a terrific actress</a>, but Game of Thrones required her to do little more than peer over walls with a glass of wine in her hand. Sophie Turner did the best with what she could, which wasn\u2019t much. Coster-Waldeau has had meatier years too. Perhaps, against the thin gruel of HBO\u2019s submissions, the self-submitters of Game of Thrones stood out as a more tantalising choice.</p> \n<p>But now comes the fun bit: seeing what happens next. It\u2019s thought that HBO chose against submitting Allen and Christie, in particular, because it was worried about splitting the vote. And certainly, if Allen\u2019s inclusion draws votes away from Peter Dinklage, who almost single-handedly held the entire show together this year with a career-best performance, then it\u2019ll be a crying shame.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83eb4a9ac97c8d772ad471d8fdab5b738e77c034\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83eb4a9ac97c8d772ad471d8fdab5b738e77c034/0_0_3150_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will he split the vote?

All</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What\u2019s more, there\u2019s also the campaigning to consider. In 2016 it was reported that networks spend <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/networks-spend-60-to-80-million-on-emmy-campaigns-2016-9?r=US&amp;IR=T\">up to $80</a><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/networks-spend-60-to-80-million-on-emmy-campaigns-2016-9?r=US&amp;IR=T\">m on their Emmy campaigns</a> to reinforce the credentials of their nominees. Now, HBO only submitted five of the eight actors nominated. Who is it going to throw its money behind? The people it submitted? Will there be For Your Consideration billboards featuring just Nikolaj Coster-Waldeau and Peter Dinklage, with Alfie Allen cropped out? Will Gwendoline Christie have to battle through her campaign alone, a David against her own network\u2019s Goliath? Or will HBO risk weakening its firepower by including everyone, even the self-submitters?</p> \n<p>If any of the self-submitters actually win, this whole affair might end up changing the manner in which the Emmys are conducted. If individual performers know they can stand their ground against the might of the networks, we might start to see smaller and more interesting shows take home trophies.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s a big if. After all, don\u2019t forget the best supporting actress category also includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/killing-eve\">Killing Eve</a>\u2019s Fiona Shaw. The Game of Thrones cast might have seen off dragons and a literal army of the dead, but whether they can stand up to the ruthlessness of <a href=\"http://www.bbcamerica.com/shows/killing-eve/cast-crew/carolyn-martens\">Carolyn Martens</a> is another matter entirely.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Unless you actively enjoy excruciatingly drawn-out scenes of roundtable policy minutiae, the Game of Thrones finale was a bit of a disappointment. However, don\u2019t be sad, because that was simply a fake-out. The real Game of Thrones finale will come during the Emmys, where eight different cast members will vie for supporting drama categories. In the supporting actor category, Alfie Allen, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Peter Dinklage are facing off against each other, while the supporting actress category has chucked Gwendoline Christie, Lena Headey, Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams into a pit together. Add to this the inclusion of Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke (in the lead actor and actress drama categories respectively) and Carice van Houten in the guest actress category, and the whole thing looks set to be brutal. I\u2019d call it a Game of Noms, if that didn\u2019t make me hate myself. However, this wasn\u2019t necessarily the plan. Seven of these performers gained their nominations in the traditional manner, with HBO putting them up for consideration. But the other three \u2013 Christie, Allen and van Houten \u2013 failed to receive the same blessing. So, instead, they decided to go it alone. It\u2019s understood that each submitted themselves for their awards, stumping up the $225 submission fee. The news has ruffled a few feathers in the world of TV, but submitting yourself for an Emmy is actually quite easy. Once you\u2019ve passed the first two (admittedly large) hurdles of elbowing your way into the television industry and becoming a member of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, you can simply put forward your work on a website. Pick a category, upload a video, choose a payment method and you\u2019re away. Because the bar to entry is so low, the Academy tends to be overwhelmed with entries \u2013 this year was a record breaker, with over 9,100 entries submitted in 124 categories \u2013 that its 24,000 voting members have to sift through, either en masse or in specific peer groups, before finally settling on the final nominations and then a winner. It isn\u2019t uncommon for performers to self-submit, but it is rare that they end up with nominations. Why Allen, Christie and van Houten succeeded this year is likely down to a number of factors. There\u2019s the pure blunt force of Game of Thrones as an entity, for starters. Even if you didn\u2019t watch it, it was truly impossible to avoid this year, which will automatically shove these performers into the consciousness of the voters. In van Houten\u2019s case, there\u2019s a little canny category-gaming going on as well \u2013 whether or not she qualifies as a guest actress on a show where she plays a long-running character is a discussion for another time \u2013 but you have to admit that it worked. Most importantly, there\u2019s the fact that the officially submitted cast members had a relatively weak year. Lena Headey in particular is a terrific actress, but Game of Thrones required her to do little more than peer over walls with a glass of wine in her hand. Sophie Turner did the best with what she could, which wasn\u2019t much. Coster-Waldeau has had meatier years too. Perhaps, against the thin gruel of HBO\u2019s submissions, the self-submitters of Game of Thrones stood out as a more tantalising choice. But now comes the fun bit: seeing what happens next. It\u2019s thought that HBO chose against submitting Allen and Christie, in particular, because it was worried about splitting the vote. And certainly, if Allen\u2019s inclusion draws votes away from Peter Dinklage, who almost single-handedly held the entire show together this year with a career-best performance, then it\u2019ll be a crying shame. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s also the campaigning to consider. In 2016 it was reported that networks spend up to $80m on their Emmy campaigns to reinforce the credentials of their nominees. Now, HBO only submitted five of the eight actors nominated. Who is it going to throw its money behind? The people it submitted? Will there be For Your Consideration billboards featuring just Nikolaj Coster-Waldeau and Peter Dinklage, with Alfie Allen cropped out? Will Gwendoline Christie have to battle through her campaign alone, a David against her own network\u2019s Goliath? Or will HBO risk weakening its firepower by including everyone, even the self-submitters? If any of the self-submitters actually win, this whole affair might end up changing the manner in which the Emmys are conducted. If individual performers know they can stand their ground against the might of the networks, we might start to see smaller and more interesting shows take home trophies. But that\u2019s a big if. After all, don\u2019t forget the best supporting actress category also includes Killing Eve\u2019s Fiona Shaw. The Game of Thrones cast might have seen off dragons and a literal army of the dead, but whether they can stand up to the ruthlessness of Carolyn Martens is another matter entirely.",

      "bodyText": "Retail sales in the UK were unexpectedly strong in June, boosted by sales of secondhand goods at charity shops and antique dealers, although department stores continued to struggle. The quantity of goods bought in June rose 1% from May, according to the Office for National Statistics. City economists had forecast a 0.3% drop in sales, following May\u2019s 0.6% fall. The figures boosted the pound by half a cent to $1.2480. However, there was a sharp slowdown in retail sales growth in the three months to June. Sales rose 0.7%, down from 1.6% in the previous three months \u2013 marking the weakest growth rate since the three months to February. Many economists believe the UK economy could shrink in the second quarter, a hangover from the stockpiling boom in the run-up to the original Brexit deadline in March. The Office for Budget Responsibility warned on Thursday a no-deal Brexit would plunge Britain into a recession. Rhian Murphy, head of retail sales at the ONS, said: \u201cRetail sales growth slowed in the latest three months as food stores saw falling sales for the first time this year and department stores continued their steady decline. \u201cHowever, retail as a whole saw a return to growth in the month of June, mainly due to growth in non-food stores, with increased sales in secondhand goods, including charity shops and antiques.\u201d Clothes sales staged a partial recovery, rising 1.2% following May\u2019s 3.8% drop, as consumers flocked to summer sales in June after a slow uptake in the previous month.

Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cJune\u2019s retail sales figures are a timely reminder that consumers aren\u2019t being haunted by the possibility of a no-deal Brexit but are happy to spend the proceeds from rising growth in the real wages. \u201cConsumers will remain deaf to the warnings about a no-deal Brexit and only pare back their spending if it happens.\u201d He said June\u2019s strong rise was not flagged by any of the surveys, partly because sales in the \u201cother stores\u201d category \u2013 mainly consisting of small, independent retailers \u2013 jumped by 3.2%.

      "bodyText": "Knife crime-related offences rose by 8% in England and Wales in the past year, government figures have shown. Between April 2018 and March 2019, police forces recorded 43,516 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument, in comparison with 40,215 in the year ending March 2018. The increase, based on data from 43 police forces in England and Wales, excludes Greater Manchester police (GMP) due to the force\u2019s undercounting of knife-related crimes in previous years. When crimes involving a knife or sharp instrument recorded by GMP over the past year are factored in, the figure for offences in England and Wales is 47,136 \u2013 the highest since records began. Of those incidents, 32% happened in London \u2013 where for every 100,000 people, there were 169 knife-related offences. Outside of the capital, the areas with the highest rates were Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire, where there were 129, 118 and 116 knife-related offences per 100,000 people respectively. In recent weeks, the government has come under increased scrutiny over their tackling of Britain\u2019s knife crime crisis after it extended controversial stop and search powers. Assault with injury and assault with intent to cause serious harm accounted for 46% of offences involving a knife or sharp object, according to the Office for National Statistics. Robberies made up 18,462 or 42% of offences in the category \u2013 an increase of 10% from the previous year. Homicide, rape, attempted murder and sexual assault involving a knife or sharp instrument made up a small proportion of the figures in the year ending March 2019. The most prolific related offence was robbery involving a knife or sharp instrument \u2013with 18,462 incidents recorded \u2013 up 10% from April 2017 to March 2018, when 16,732 incidents were recorded.

      "body": "<p>The Ebola crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is already the second deadliest outbreak in history. More than 2,500 cases have been confirmed in DRC and 1,600 deaths have been recorded. The situation is escalating rapidly, with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/15/ebola-virus-reaches-congolese-city-of-goma\">new case</a> in the transit hub of Goma reported on Sunday.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/17/drc-ebola-epidemic-is-international-emergency-says-who\">declared the crisis</a> a public health emergency of international concern. This raises the stakes and must lead to fundamental changes in the response. The WHO wants more funding to extend and reinforce outbreak control measures, but simply expanding the current approach is unlikely to result in a more effective response.</p> <p>We believe it is time for the WHO to step back and allow local leaders and frontline responders to lead the response.</p> <p>The majority of deaths in DRC are occurring in homes, or at health centres not equipped to deal with the outbreak. The Ebola response must go to where the cases are, which means embedding it into local communities. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(19)31211-5.pdf\">Research</a> on the 2014-16 Sierra Leone Ebola crisis has shown that learning from local responders is critical for effective response. Yet, international and Congolese frontline workers have urged a rethink on the emergency response, with community-led interventions tailored to local context given priority, <a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/w/1kvJpOqbkPwGE\">their calls have gone </a><a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/w/1kvJpOqbkPwGE\">unheeded</a>.</p> <p>Armed violence is widespread in DRC, and there are very high levels of hostility to foreign intervention. In North Kivu, one of the areas affected, \u201cforeign\u201d doesn\u2019t even have to mean international. Often, simply being from outside the local area is enough to be considered an outsider.</p> <p>Lack of trust in outside interventions can mean that people in urban and rural communities are reluctant to seek care or be treated at Ebola healthcare facilities, which are surrounded with orange tape and run by staff in hazmat suits. Those who do seek treatment are at risk of being perceived as sympathetic to \u2013 or even complicit in \u2013 a response widely and violently condemned by some members of their communities.</p> <p>Even when conducting surveillance work in villages to identify and trace cases, responders \u2013 many of whom need the services of a translator to communicate in local languages \u2013 arrive in convoys of four-by-four vehicles. This is consistently raised as a point of contention by affected communities.</p> <p>Less emphasis must be put on the international responseand more on local staff and community leaders. District authorities, traditional leaders, women\u2019s groups and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/15/democratic-republic-of-the-congo-drc-ebola-crisis-outbreak\">even militia</a> groups must be allowed to take the lead in shaping a culturally acceptable response to reduce hostility and improve access and outcomes.</p> <p>The severe breakdown of trust in the Ebola response demands a different approach to care provision. There are more than 1,000 public and private non-Ebola clinics in the affected areas, which have highly limited screening and isolation capabilities, despite being the first point of contact for most suspected cases. Increased resources, training and equipment provision for these clinics should be prioritised. This would help to normalise and de-stigmatise Ebola, and improve healthcare generally at such facilities.</p> <p>Some families and individuals are too remote fromhealth facilities, or too fearful of them, to seek care at all. In such cases, it is too much to expect a parent to give up a child or other family member to strangers. Extended family ties are very strong, with obligations to a wide set of relatives. The reality is that some people will care for their loved ones at home regardless of medical advice.</p> <p>Some responders want home care to be made safer, strictly as an interim measure. This would include widespread distribution of personal protective equipment including gloves, boots and chlorine, together with sensible instructions on minimising infection risk to the carer and maximising the survival chances of the sick, as well as information and resources that encourage facility-based care. Towards the end of the Sierra Leone epidemic, the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventiondeveloped guidelines on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/pdf/2018/english/Protect-from-Ebola-While-You-Wait-Flipbook_English_P.pdf\">what to do while waiting for an ambulance to arrive</a>, which could be adapted.</p> <p>Allowing local people to lead the response does not mean there is no role for the international humanitarian community. On the contrary, technical advice, response coordination and an emphasis on human rights remain important contributions the international response can offer. But in DRC, as in Sierra Leone, a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach is often seen as threatening, and needs to be avoided.</p> <p>Experience from Sierra Leone suggests panic and undue haste undermine Ebola control.

      "bodyText": "The Ebola crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is already the second deadliest outbreak in history. More than 2,500 cases have been confirmed in DRC and 1,600 deaths have been recorded. The situation is escalating rapidly, with a new case in the transit hub of Goma reported on Sunday. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the crisis a public health emergency of international concern. This raises the stakes and must lead to fundamental changes in the response. The WHO wants more funding to extend and reinforce outbreak control measures, but simply expanding the current approach is unlikely to result in a more effective response. We believe it is time for the WHO to step back and allow local leaders and frontline responders to lead the response. The majority of deaths in DRC are occurring in homes, or at health centres not equipped to deal with the outbreak. The Ebola response must go to where the cases are, which means embedding it into local communities. Research on the 2014-16 Sierra Leone Ebola crisis has shown that learning from local responders is critical for effective response. Yet, international and Congolese frontline workers have urged a rethink on the emergency response, with community-led interventions tailored to local context given priority, their calls have gone unheeded. Armed violence is widespread in DRC, and there are very high levels of hostility to foreign intervention. In North Kivu, one of the areas affected, \u201cforeign\u201d doesn\u2019t even have to mean international. Often, simply being from outside the local area is enough to be considered an outsider. Lack of trust in outside interventions can mean that people in urban and rural communities are reluctant to seek care or be treated at Ebola healthcare facilities, which are surrounded with orange tape and run by staff in hazmat suits. Those who do seek treatment are at risk of being perceived as sympathetic to \u2013 or even complicit in \u2013 a response widely and violently condemned by some members of their communities. Even when conducting surveillance work in villages to identify and trace cases, responders \u2013 many of whom need the services of a translator to communicate in local languages \u2013 arrive in convoys of four-by-four vehicles. This is consistently raised as a point of contention by affected communities. Less emphasis must be put on the international responseand more on local staff and community leaders. District authorities, traditional leaders, women\u2019s groups and even militia groups must be allowed to take the lead in shaping a culturally acceptable response to reduce hostility and improve access and outcomes. The severe breakdown of trust in the Ebola response demands a different approach to care provision. There are more than 1,000 public and private non-Ebola clinics in the affected areas, which have highly limited screening and isolation capabilities, despite being the first point of contact for most suspected cases. Increased resources, training and equipment provision for these clinics should be prioritised. This would help to normalise and de-stigmatise Ebola, and improve healthcare generally at such facilities. Some families and individuals are too remote fromhealth facilities, or too fearful of them, to seek care at all. In such cases, it is too much to expect a parent to give up a child or other family member to strangers. Extended family ties are very strong, with obligations to a wide set of relatives. The reality is that some people will care for their loved ones at home regardless of medical advice. Some responders want home care to be made safer, strictly as an interim measure. This would include widespread distribution of personal protective equipment including gloves, boots and chlorine, together with sensible instructions on minimising infection risk to the carer and maximising the survival chances of the sick, as well as information and resources that encourage facility-based care. Towards the end of the Sierra Leone epidemic, the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventiondeveloped guidelines on what to do while waiting for an ambulance to arrive, which could be adapted. Allowing local people to lead the response does not mean there is no role for the international humanitarian community. On the contrary, technical advice, response coordination and an emphasis on human rights remain important contributions the international response can offer. But in DRC, as in Sierra Leone, a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach is often seen as threatening, and needs to be avoided. Experience from Sierra Leone suggests panic and undue haste undermine Ebola control. The affected population has to be patiently supported to find its own way. It also needs to be assigned a constructive role. Mobilising families to help fetch water and prepare food at Ebola care centres, or working with local communities to develop their own prevention plans (which are then funded), could go a long way to mitigating local hostility, where that hostility is based on feelings of helplessness and despair. Above all, there is a need to trust in local common sense, once the nature of the epidemic and the infection risks it poses have been made clear.

      "bodyText": "The brother of the Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi has denied any involvement in the attack, a court has heard. Hashem Abedi appeared in court on Thursday morning after being extradited from Libya to the UK on Wednesday. He is charged with murdering 22 people in the attack, with one charge of attempted murder and one of conspiracy to cause an explosion likely to endanger life. His lawyer, Zafar Ali QC, said: \u201cHe denies any involvement in any of the alleged offences.\u201d He added: \u201cHe did not oppose extradition. He wanted to come back to clear his name.\u201d Hashem Abedi, of no fixed abode, did not enter a plea. Wearing a grey top and white trousers, he spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and nationality. Salman Abedi detonated a bomb contained in a rucksack at 10.29pm on 22 May 2017. The attack occurred on the concourse of the arena as thousands of music fans left an Ariana Grande concert. More than 260 people were injured and more than 600 reported at least psychological harm. The next hearing will be at Oxford crown court on Monday. Hashem Abedi will appear via video link.",

Landing days after the extraordinary scenes at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket-world-cup-2019\">the Cricket World Cup final at Lord\u2019s</a>, Barney Douglas\u2019s documentary account of the reinvention of English cricket under the aegis of coach Andy Flower and captain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/16/england-world-cup-andrew-strauss-cricket\">Andrew Strauss</a> is almost as well-timed as a Joe Root cover drive.</p> <p>That World Cup final demonstrated how, at its best, this sport writes its own outlandish script. What Douglas underlines \u2013 defying decades of film-making indifference \u2013 is that cricket can be cinematic: at once widescreen (the Sky archives have been raided for aerial shots of packed stadiums in sun-dappled locales) and closeup in its duels between batsmen and bowlers. Unpredictable, too: some intriguing turn in this narrative elevates the film a notch or two over standard sports-doc fodder.</p> <p>It\u2019s primarily, Douglas realises, a matter of squad management.

      "bodyText": "The stars align around certain releases. Landing days after the extraordinary scenes at the Cricket World Cup final at Lord\u2019s, Barney Douglas\u2019s documentary account of the reinvention of English cricket under the aegis of coach Andy Flower and captain Andrew Strauss is almost as well-timed as a Joe Root cover drive. That World Cup final demonstrated how, at its best, this sport writes its own outlandish script. What Douglas underlines \u2013 defying decades of film-making indifference \u2013 is that cricket can be cinematic: at once widescreen (the Sky archives have been raided for aerial shots of packed stadiums in sun-dappled locales) and closeup in its duels between batsmen and bowlers. Unpredictable, too: some intriguing turn in this narrative elevates the film a notch or two over standard sports-doc fodder. It\u2019s primarily, Douglas realises, a matter of squad management. England\u2019s rise to No 1 in the rankings is described firsthand by the flinty Flower, circumspect Strauss and key personnel (droll James Anderson, larky Graeme Swann), each deployed, as on the pitch and in their subsequent media careers, to find some new angle on the often grinding and convoluted business of five-day cricket. Time and distance allows for a sensitive re-evaluation of the Kevin Pietersen situation, a Twitter-heightened flashpoint that threatened to undo burgeoning morale \u2013 and which remains a sore spot in certain quarters. Here, Douglas opens the door to sports psychology, and the film starts to reposition itself as a more nuanced proposition than the flag-waver it initially presented as.

      "bodyText": "Australian writer Yang Hengjun is expected to be formally charged with endangering national security, according to his lawyer. Yang, a Chinese public intellectual who has long advocated for democratic reforms in China, has been detained for the last six months in an unknown location in China. Yang\u2019s lawyer, Mo Shao Ping, said Yang\u2019s family in Shanghai has been told to come to Beijing to receive a formal notice of the writer\u2019s criminal detention, indicating formal charges are forthcoming. The maximum punishment for endangering national security is life in prison or in serious cases, the death penalty. The notice the family receives should have more details of the charges Yang faces, which could include additional charges. Yang was initially detained on suspicion of endangering national security. \u201cAnything is possible. Right now we cannot say,\u201d Mo said. The Australian embassy in Beijing said a relative of Yang\u2019s notified the embassy that he has been transferred to a detention centre in Beijing. Yang, a naturalised Australian citizen since 2002, has been held under a system known as \u201cresidential surveillance at a designated location\u201d, RSDL, a type of secret detention where authorities can deny access to lawyers and family. At the end of six months under RSDL, a suspect should be released, formally charged, or transferred to criminal detention. Friday marks six months since Yang\u2019s detention under RSDL, according to his lawyer. Yang\u2019s case could complicate already cooling ties between Australia and China, over concerns about potential Chinese interference in national affairs, Huawei and human rights. On Monday, Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said her government was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about Beijing\u2019s treatment of Uighurs, an ethnic minority in Xinjiang. Payne said China had blocked Australia\u2019s attempts to offer consular assistance to dual citizens and their families believed detained in Xinjiang. Intelligence officials believe Chinese hackers may have been responsible for a security breach at Australian National University in June. Yang, a former Chinese diplomat, is a popular writer and blogger known for his spy novels and political commentary. Being transferred to criminal detention does not augur well for Yang, human rights advocates say. Friends of his previously believed he would be released following the 30th anniversary of the June Fourth crackdown. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t know the details of Yang\u2019s case, the Chinese government has a record of deploying vague \u2018national security\u2019 charges to prosecute peaceful critics,\u201d said Yaqiu Wang, China researcher for Human Rights Watch. This week, Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs, said Yang\u2019s case was proceeding \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and that the state had \u201cfully guaranteed\u201d the protection of his rights. Critics say the pace of Yang\u2019s case shows a lack of evidence on the part of authorities. \u201cThey haven\u2019t got evidence,\u201d said Feng Chongyi, an academic at the University of Technology Sydney and a friend of Yang\u2019s. \u201cIf they had gotten anything they would have gone immediately to arrest him and would have charged him earlier before the expiry of six months.\u201d Feng believes how the Australian government responds will affect how Chinese authorities pursue Yang\u2019s case. \u201cThey continue to do the so-called investigation. If there is no cost to them of course they will take this kind of political prisoner as long as they can.\u201d Yang\u2019s wife, Yuan Xiaolong, a permanent resident of Australia, has been barred from leaving China. Human Rights Watch urged the Australian government to press Chinese authorities to release her from the exit ban. Yang is known in online circles as minzhu xiaofan, or \u201cdemocracy peddler\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m like an old auntie jabbering on, always promoting democracy and repeating its benefits,\u201d he wrote in an article in 2014. \u201cDictatorship is always torn down in one night, but good democracy isn\u2019t built in one night.\u201d Additional reporting by Lillian Yang",

      "bodyText": "Everything\u2019s going digital, and that includes education. From homework management apps to virtual reality geometry lessons, there\u2019s plenty on offer from companies competing for a slice of the sizeable global market for online learning. Education technology (edtech) exports are worth \u00a3170m to the UK economy and the Department for Education (DfE) has unveiled plans to build \u201cthe best edtech ecosystem in the world\u201d, with a new edtech strategy. It\u2019s hoped powerful technologies will improve student learning and relieve teacher workload in the face of shrinking education budgets. Yet, despite a majority female teaching workforce at school level, women are missing from senior edtech roles: a problem highlighted when the DfE recently announced an edtech leadership advisory group in which women from the edtech industry were equalled by men named Chris. That\u2019s not even including group chair, Chris Holmes, and universities minister, Chris Skidmore, who works with the panel. \u201cPanels should represent the clients and users they serve. The workforce in schools is 70% female, and users of edtech will be 50:50 for students. Diversity must also be in the room when companies are making decisions, designing technology and thinking through strategy. That includes BAME representation,\u201d says Jules Daulby, a literacy, inclusion and assistive technology specialist who co-founded grassroots education movements, WomenEd and WomenEdtech. Leading the way for female edtech representation globally is Daphne Koller, a Stanford University professor and creator of online learning platform, Coursera. She founded Coursera in 2012 with friend and fellow educator, Andrew Ng, after delivering one of her classes online through video. Seven years and more than 40 million learners later, Coursera now belongs to an elite group of \u201cunicorn\u201d companies, that is, privately held tech companies valued at over $1bn. \u201cThe traditional education system needs to move on,\u201d says Melody Lang, who launched her own purpose-driven investment company in January 2019.

With \u00a36m funding and a 60-strong team behind her, Lakhani\u2019s technology is now used \u201ceverywhere from leading British independent schools to Lebanese schools educating large numbers of Syrian refugees\u201d.

OK, we laughed about it then too \u2013 here are some of the most humiliating World Cup moments endured by the England men\u2019s cricket team. In the 1987 World Cup final, they were doing so well that Allan Border brought himself on to bowl, which was, of course, the perfect moment for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8iA5TNdFhRQ?t=1610\">Mike Gatting to deploy his fabled reverse-sweep</a>. In 1996, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iJzIB-qxf8Q?t=680\">Neil Smith discharged his guts on to the pitch</a> and then Sri Lanka knocked his team out in the quarter-finals, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4BL96KOzM0\">chasing down 236 with nearly 10 overs to spare</a>. In 1999, the last time the competition was held in the green and pleasants, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn0bc8DLu3k\">the opening ceremony had to be cut short because of rain</a> and England were eliminated before <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOxJrxBE38o\">the official song</a> came out, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9O9GW9hsrA\">dismissed for 103 by South Africa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFLwA_wJrcA\">169 by India</a>. Here they are in 2007, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Pv_cZIgpXQI?t=245\">struggling to beat Canada in the aftermath of the Fredalo jaunt</a>; and here they are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHzeXVY82kw\">losing to Ireland in 2011</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2JeK7voWBg\">a moment greatly appreciated by the people of Pune</a>.

      "bodyText": "1) Now we can laugh about it. OK, we laughed about it then too \u2013 here are some of the most humiliating World Cup moments endured by the England men\u2019s cricket team. In the 1987 World Cup final, they were doing so well that Allan Border brought himself on to bowl, which was, of course, the perfect moment for Mike Gatting to deploy his fabled reverse-sweep. In 1996, Neil Smith discharged his guts on to the pitch and then Sri Lanka knocked his team out in the quarter-finals, chasing down 236 with nearly 10 overs to spare. In 1999, the last time the competition was held in the green and pleasants, the opening ceremony had to be cut short because of rain and England were eliminated before the official song came out, dismissed for 103 by South Africa and 169 by India. Here they are in 2007, struggling to beat Canada in the aftermath of the Fredalo jaunt; and here they are losing to Ireland in 2011, a moment greatly appreciated by the people of Pune. And, because we can\u2019t help ourselves, a bit of 2019: the ICC\u2019s montage of the staggering denouement. 2) It\u2019s that time of year again when we begin preparing for the World Chase Tag championships, to be held at London\u2019s York Hall on 24 August. Here\u2019s the final of WCT 3, and a best chase compilation from the same. 3) On a similar tip, check out the finals of the Ultimate Dodgeball Championships. Next week: murderball, red rover and British Bulldogs. 4) When hosting an event it\u2019s important to be hospitable \u2013 a maxim pushed to the limit by South Korea\u2019s women\u2019s water polo team at the weekend. Playing Hungary in their home World Aquatics Championships, they were beaten 64-0 to smash the previous record defeat of 33-0, set earlier that day when Netherlands pipped South Africa. However, things have looked up a bit for them since then \u2026 5) With the key match of 2000 Bledisloe Cup reaching its conclusion, Australia trailed New Zealand 23-21 and won a potentially decisive penalty \u2026 except the regular goal-kicker, Stirling Mortlock, was off the pitch. So Australia captain John Eales \u2013 6ft 7in, 18 stone-plus, nicknamed Nobody, \u201cbecause Nobody\u2019s Perfect\u201d \u2013 assumed responsibility. Here he is, telling us all about it. 6) To the unbridled joy of no one you would dream of speaking to, pre-season football is under way. Schalke, it seems, beat Stadtauswahl Bottrop 20-1 so, for the Bottrop fans among us, here\u2019s the glorious own goal that failed to ignite a comeback for the ages. Our favourites from below the line last week 1) The rules of Kabaddi \u2013 explained. 2) A costly poker miscount. 3) The NFL tries announcerless games in 1980. 4) The heavy metal knitting championships. 5) Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen goes lawnmower racing. 6) Sorana Cirstea makes six successful challenges in a set. 7) A T-Rex race.

      "bodyText": "The legality of releasing 50 million non-native pheasants and partridges into the British countryside each year is to be challenged in the courts by a new crowdfunded campaign. The government should be forced to carry out environmental assessments of the impact of the shooting industry\u2019s release of game birds into the wild each year, according to Wild Justice, a campaign group led by environmentalists Mark Avery, Ruth Tingay and Chris Packham. Lawyers for Wild Justice believe that in failing to carry out such studies, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is in breach of the EU habitats directive. Avery said: \u201cIf you were building a supermarket near a special area of conservation or other protected area, it would be assessed for its impact on protected sites. We don\u2019t see that there is anything different in releasing 50 million non-native birds into the countryside, a number that is going up all the time. \u201cThere is reasonable evidence that these birds could be having an impact. People forget that pheasants go around gobbling up adders, lizards and all sorts of invertebrates. All these dead pheasants [from shooting and roadkill] are feeding foxes, carrion crows and others, which go on to eat other, rarer species. \u201cThis is a serious legal challenge and we hope to get people talking about pheasant shooting for months to come.\u201d The action comes after new research revealed a link between pheasant shoots and higher numbers of avian predators such as crows and buzzards.

But seeing them as a fundamental part of the body\u2019s rhythm \u2013 something to be endured, or even celebrated each month (the author Maisie Hill writes in her book Period Power <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/29/im-such-a-big-fan-of-the-menstrual-cycle-the-women-asking-whether-its-possible-to-have-a-better-period\" title=\"\">of embracing their natural high</a>) \u2013 is only one side of the story. The other is a tale of pain, bloating, bad skin and mood swings. Many women feel trapped in a cycle that can be unpredictable, inconvenient and unpleasant.</p> \n<p>Menstruation is the process by which the body sheds the lining of the uterus and unfertilised egg, triggered by fluctuating levels of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone. Not having periods does not create a \u201cbacklog\u201d, nor are they necessary to \u201ccleanse the body\u201d. Menstruation can, however, exacerbate incapacitating physical or mental health problems including endometriosis and depression; it can also be distressing or problematic for people with <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gender-dysphoria/\" title=\"\">gender dysphoria</a>. According to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reproductive-health-what-women-say\" title=\"\">a recent survey of 7,500 women by Public Health England</a>, half those aged 16-64 reported menstrual issues in the last year, rising to 75% of those aged 16-24.</p> \n<p>Dr Jane Thomas, a consultant gynaecologist at Homerton university hospital in London, says that having so many periods is a modern phenomenon: historically, women would spend much of their time pregnant or breastfeeding (which can delay the return of periods). \u201cIt would be a minority of people who had a couple of children only and menstruated all the way through their lives.\u201d</p> \n<p>So, if women do not want a period, is there a medical reason that they should? Many may be surprised to learn that the short answer is: no.</p> \n<p>While Thomas notes that regular periods are an indicator of good health, Dr Anne Connolly, the clinical lead for Women\u2019s Health for the Royal College of GPs, says there is no health benefit to them: \u201cNinety-nine per cent of women don\u2019t need to bleed.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=JMSTE16\" title=\"\">Judith Stephenson</a>, the Margaret Pyke professor of sexual and reproductive health at University College London, says the same. \u201cIn some ways, it seems like one of God\u2019s great design faults \u2026 It is not helpful to have these periods \u2013 in fact, if you don\u2019t have them, one of the biggest benefits would be reducing iron deficiency anaemia.\u201d</p> \n<p>The option not to have periods is rooted in hormonal contraceptives, which use synthetic versions of oestrogen and progesterone to interfere with the menstrual cycle. This prevents pregnancy (meaning the decision to stop bleeding is not compatible with trying for a baby), sometimes with other effects \u2013 including lightening bleeding or stopping it altogether. Many new forms of contraception \u2013 including the contraceptive implant and injection, intrauterine system (the hormonal coil) and the progestogen-only \u201cmini\u201d pill \u2013 are designed to be taken continuously, meaning many users can safely go months or years without any bleeding.</p> \n<p>The benefits can be myriad, from saving money to mitigating health problems, including <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/\" title=\"\">polycystic ovary syndrome</a> (PCOS), in which there is a risk of problematic cells building up in the lining of the womb. While regular natural periods prevent this buildup, and thus can be beneficial for the condition, so too are hormonal contraceptives (even if they stop periods), because they keep the lining of the womb thin.</p> \n<p>The idea that bleeding is necessary has been fuelled by decades of advice that women on the combined pill should take a break for one week a month. This results in a withdrawal bleed, or \u201cfake\u201d period (which is why the combined pill is often referred to, somewhat misleadingly, as \u201cregulating\u201d periods). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/23/medical-advice-pill-pope-bleeds-women\" title=\"\">Some claim that this</a> was contrived by the pill\u2019s inventors to make it acceptable to the Catholic church; others argue it was chiefly a practice to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/8xy9qk/the-truth-about-the-pope-rule-and-the-seven-day-contraceptive-pill-gap\" title=\"\">reassure women that they were not pregnant</a> and to give them a break from the high doses of hormones.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1edaaae0aa9f954cd091bd4866aa3ef70e87d8a8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1edaaae0aa9f954cd091bd4866aa3ef70e87d8a8/0_192_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Strips of contraceptive pills\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many new forms of contraceptive pill are designed to be taken continuously without any monthly break.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Experts say women today take this seven-day break as a hangover from earlier practice, even as the makeup and dose of the combined pill has changed over time. When, in January, the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) <a href=\"https://www.fsrh.org/news/fsrh-release-updated-guidance-combined-hormonal-contraception/\" title=\"\">updated its guidelines</a> to make it clear there were no health benefits to taking the break, many women felt they had been cheated into having a monthly bleed.</p> \n<p>Thomas says doctors have known for years that the combined pill could be taken without a break, but many women I spoke to said that they had no idea until they read of the change in guidelines. For 27-year-old Cinzia DuBois, from Edinburgh, the impact was huge. When she was forced to take a gap in her pill, the week before and after her bleed would often leave her feeling suicidal. \u201cI\u2019ve attempted to kill myself four times, so it\u2019s not a light matter,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving to go through this every month was exhausting for both myself and my partner.\u201d Since she stopped taking a break in her pill, \u201cI haven\u2019t had a single suicidal episode and have found my spells of depression much less frequent than they were and not as extreme,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>For the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/07/revealed-pill-still-most-popular-prescribed-contraceptive-in-england\" title=\"\">more than 3 million women</a> who take the combined pill in England, the FSRH announcement made no monthly bleed a possibility. But not everyone is comfortable with that idea, or of ditching natural periods. Holly Grigg-Spall, the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/sweetening-the-pill.html\" title=\"\">Sweetening the Pill: Or How We Got Hooked On Hormonal Birth Control</a>, says that while she understands why some women might choose not to bleed, there is limited research on the long-term impact of continuously taking the combined pill. Telling women they can stop their periods without giving them all the information could reinforce taboos around bleeding, she says. \u201cIt is really just an exaggerated form of saying to women keep your periods quiet, hide them, be secret about them, don\u2019t talk about them, don\u2019t show your tampon when you walk to the bathroom, your boyfriend doesn\u2019t want to know about your periods.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some have also raised concerns that bleeding is a sign that a woman has not conceived. But Thomas is clear that the only way to be sure you are not pregnant is a pregnancy test: \u201cYou can definitely bleed and be pregnant. So having a period or withdrawal bleed from the pill isn\u2019t a guarantee.\u201d Experts also stress that stopping periods won\u2019t affect future fertility. \u201cWhen you stop taking the hormones, they get flushed out of your system very quickly, and your periods will return to what they were before you started taking the pill,\u201d says Connolly.</p> \n<p>It is, however, easier to reliably stop bleeding with some contraceptives than with others. The majority of women taking methods that contain synthetic versions of both oestrogen and progesterone <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4075955/\" title=\"\">can achieve that outcome</a>, but it is less predictable for some methods containing synthetic progesterone only. Some women experience bleeding that is regular, irregular or prolonged (albeit often light); it differs between methods. About 20% of women on the contraceptive implant no longer bleed, compared with 68% on the injection at two years of use.</p> \n<p>Some women may also prefer not to use hormonal contraceptives, as they can bring unwanted side-effects such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/pill-linked-depression-doctors-hormonal-contraceptives\" title=\"\">fluctuations in weight and mood</a>. Some methods can also slightly raise the risk of certain cancers, including breast cancer (although they reduce the risk of others, including womb cancer).</p> \n<p>Thomas agrees that more research is needed into the long-term effects of taking hormonal contraception. However, she and other experts say there should be greater awareness of the benefits of contraceptives beyond preventing pregnancy, from tackling acne to alleviating premenstrual symptoms.</p> \n<p>Stephenson says the option of having periods is naturally addressed in consultations about contraception choices, but should be talked about more widely. \u201cIt is absolutely a sensible discussion in its own right,\u201d she says. Earlier this year, she co-launched <a href=\"https://www.contraceptionchoices.org/\" title=\"\">ContraceptionChoices.org</a>, a website that recommends contraceptive options to women on the basis of what they say matters to them \u2013 including whether they want to have periods.</p> \n<p>Some do, some don\u2019t, each for a variety of reasons. But perhaps the most empowering approach for all women is simple: to let them choose for themselves. Sophie, 24, from Glasgow, no longer bleeds thanks to the contraceptive implant, and says it has made a huge difference to her mental health \u2013 she couldn\u2019t be happier. \u201cJust because something is natural, I don\u2019t think it in any way means we should have to go through it,\u201d she says. \u201cDifferent things suit different people, and that\u2019s fantastic.\u201d</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Many new forms of contraception \u2013 including the contraceptive implant and injection, intrauterine system (the hormonal coil) and the progestogen-only \u201cmini\u201d pill \u2013 are designed to be taken continuously, meaning many users can safely go months or years without any bleeding. The benefits can be myriad, from saving money to mitigating health problems, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), in which there is a risk of problematic cells building up in the lining of the womb. While regular natural periods prevent this buildup, and thus can be beneficial for the condition, so too are hormonal contraceptives (even if they stop periods), because they keep the lining of the womb thin. The idea that bleeding is necessary has been fuelled by decades of advice that women on the combined pill should take a break for one week a month. This results in a withdrawal bleed, or \u201cfake\u201d period (which is why the combined pill is often referred to, somewhat misleadingly, as \u201cregulating\u201d periods). Some claim that this was contrived by the pill\u2019s inventors to make it acceptable to the Catholic church; others argue it was chiefly a practice to reassure women that they were not pregnant and to give them a break from the high doses of hormones. Experts say women today take this seven-day break as a hangover from earlier practice, even as the makeup and dose of the combined pill has changed over time. When, in January, the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) updated its guidelines to make it clear there were no health benefits to taking the break, many women felt they had been cheated into having a monthly bleed. Thomas says doctors have known for years that the combined pill could be taken without a break, but many women I spoke to said that they had no idea until they read of the change in guidelines. For 27-year-old Cinzia DuBois, from Edinburgh, the impact was huge. When she was forced to take a gap in her pill, the week before and after her bleed would often leave her feeling suicidal. \u201cI\u2019ve attempted to kill myself four times, so it\u2019s not a light matter,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving to go through this every month was exhausting for both myself and my partner.\u201d Since she stopped taking a break in her pill, \u201cI haven\u2019t had a single suicidal episode and have found my spells of depression much less frequent than they were and not as extreme,\u201d she says. For the more than 3 million women who take the combined pill in England, the FSRH announcement made no monthly bleed a possibility. But not everyone is comfortable with that idea, or of ditching natural periods. Holly Grigg-Spall, the author of Sweetening the Pill: Or How We Got Hooked On Hormonal Birth Control, says that while she understands why some women might choose not to bleed, there is limited research on the long-term impact of continuously taking the combined pill. Telling women they can stop their periods without giving them all the information could reinforce taboos around bleeding, she says. \u201cIt is really just an exaggerated form of saying to women keep your periods quiet, hide them, be secret about them, don\u2019t talk about them, don\u2019t show your tampon when you walk to the bathroom, your boyfriend doesn\u2019t want to know about your periods.\u201d Some have also raised concerns that bleeding is a sign that a woman has not conceived. But Thomas is clear that the only way to be sure you are not pregnant is a pregnancy test: \u201cYou can definitely bleed and be pregnant. So having a period or withdrawal bleed from the pill isn\u2019t a guarantee.\u201d Experts also stress that stopping periods won\u2019t affect future fertility. \u201cWhen you stop taking the hormones, they get flushed out of your system very quickly, and your periods will return to what they were before you started taking the pill,\u201d says Connolly. It is, however, easier to reliably stop bleeding with some contraceptives than with others. The majority of women taking methods that contain synthetic versions of both oestrogen and progesterone can achieve that outcome, but it is less predictable for some methods containing synthetic progesterone only. Some women experience bleeding that is regular, irregular or prolonged (albeit often light); it differs between methods. About 20% of women on the contraceptive implant no longer bleed, compared with 68% on the injection at two years of use. Some women may also prefer not to use hormonal contraceptives, as they can bring unwanted side-effects such as fluctuations in weight and mood. Some methods can also slightly raise the risk of certain cancers, including breast cancer (although they reduce the risk of others, including womb cancer). Thomas agrees that more research is needed into the long-term effects of taking hormonal contraception. However, she and other experts say there should be greater awareness of the benefits of contraceptives beyond preventing pregnancy, from tackling acne to alleviating premenstrual symptoms. Stephenson says the option of having periods is naturally addressed in consultations about contraception choices, but should be talked about more widely. \u201cIt is absolutely a sensible discussion in its own right,\u201d she says. Earlier this year, she co-launched ContraceptionChoices.org, a website that recommends contraceptive options to women on the basis of what they say matters to them \u2013 including whether they want to have periods. Some do, some don\u2019t, each for a variety of reasons. But perhaps the most empowering approach for all women is simple: to let them choose for themselves. Sophie, 24, from Glasgow, no longer bleeds thanks to the contraceptive implant, and says it has made a huge difference to her mental health \u2013 she couldn\u2019t be happier. \u201cJust because something is natural, I don\u2019t think it in any way means we should have to go through it,\u201d she says. \u201cDifferent things suit different people, and that\u2019s fantastic.\u201d Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

      "bodyText": "There is a new generation of US stars emerging at Europe\u2019s elite clubs. And among this talent-rich class is a player who \u2013 in soccer terms at least \u2013 is American only by chance. Sergi\u00f1o Dest, an 18-year-old full-back who signed his first professional contract with Ajax in December last year, was born and raised in Almere in the Netherlands to a Dutch mother and a US serviceman father. He hadn\u2019t even visited the States until a trip to New York City \u2013 his father\u2019s hometown \u2013 in 2014, and hadn\u2019t considered representing the US until the possibility came up in a phone call. \u201cI was in touch with Ajax about a player that possibly could join them,\u201d former US under-20 assistant coach Dave van den Bergh, who played for Ajax in the 1990s, told the Guardian. \u201cAnd I asked, \u2018Are there any other players in your system you know of that have American passports?\u2019 They came back to me and said, \u2018We have a kid in the under-17s who has dual citizenship, would you want to take a look at him?\u2019\u201d After watching tape of Dest in action for the club\u2019s prestigious youth academy, Van den Bergh saw a player of serious potential. Dest represented the Netherlands at youth level in his early teens, but had seemingly fallen off the national radar since, something that has become the US\u2019s gain. \u201cI don\u2019t think he ever saw [playing for the US] as a possibility, because he wasn\u2019t aware of us scouting in the area,\u201d Van den Bergh says. \u201cBut once the opportunity presented itself, he was very much in tune with America, with his heritage. He was immediately honored. He said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s what I want to do. I want to represent the United States.\u2019 Once the opportunity arose, he took it with both hands and never looked back.\u201d After cutting his teeth at the Under-17 World Cup in 2017, Dest was key to USA\u2019s success at the Concacaf Under-20 Championship last November \u2013 they beat Mexico in the final \u2013 impressing sufficiently to be named in the team of the tournament. Dest was again one of the standout performers for the US at the recent U-20 World Cup, where his offensive adventure, precision in possession and focus in one-on-one situations helped his side upset tournament favourite France during a run to the quarter-finals. \u201cConcacaf competition is not the same as the Word Cup or those type of competitions, so physically and technically he was superior to a lot of the players he played against,\u201d US Under-20 head coach Tab Ramos told the Guardian of Dest\u2019s performances for his team this past year. \u201cHe had quite an easy time and made us a lot better. \u201cThe mentality of our team is that our two central defenders are really the only ones who stay home all the time, and I really like for everyone else to be free enough to attack, so he fits in really well to the system we play.\u201d It is not only Dest\u2019s talent that could soon see him become a major asset for the US at senior level.

      "bodyText": "Katie Hale\u2019s debut novel is a post-apocalyptic tale narrated by two female characters, both called Monster. The first Monster is an adult woman who, by her own account, is monstrous because she is a natural solitary, fascinated by how machines and bodies work but hostile to all human contact. She is estranged from her parents, has no sexual desires and wants no friends. When the apocalypse comes, at first she experiences it as freedom: \u201cThe three Warhammer geeks I live with have already scuttled home. I spread myself through their empty rooms. I am enormous. I am bigger than the city.\u201d Her mother pleads: \u201cYou have nobody \u2013 come home.\u201d Monster replies: \u201cI have myself.\u201d When the book opens, these events are in the past, and Monster is trekking through a depopulated England scarred by ash pits where the dead have been incinerated. y shunning other people, she\u2019s avoided the things that killed them, but all she\u2019s gained is that she\u2019s left to struggle alone.

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales coroner will push for the state\u2019s police force to release its strip search protocols as part of an inquest into drug-related deaths at music festivals. Counsel assisting the coroner Peggy Dwyer told the court on Thursday that the inquest had yet to receive \u201cpolice protocols\u201d on when strip searches could be carried out in the state, but that she intended to pursue the matter . \u201cThat issue is something that, in my respectful submission, should be clearly understood by the families of the young people who are involved in the inquest and by the general public at large, under what circumstances are police entitled to strip search patrons who are entering,\u201d she said. The issue of strip searches at music festivals has risen a number of times during the inquest, which is examining the deaths of six young people from MDMA toxicity at musical festivals between December 2018 and January 2019. Last week a witness cried while describing how a police officer told her she would make a strip search at a music festival \u201cnice and slow\u201d if she did not tell her where she was hiding drugs. David Caldicott, the emergency doctor and pill-testing advocate, described the practice as \u201cunconscionable\u201d. \u201cIt has no health benefit, as far as I\u2019m concerned, and it\u2019s got considerable mental health issues associated with it,\u201d he said last week. \u201cColleagues of mine in the UK find it extraordinary that it is happening in a first-world country.\u201d Last month the Sydney Morning Herald revealed details of officers breaching strip search powers, as well as police using inconsistent rules at various music festivals. Dwyer\u2019s comments on Thursday came during the cross-examination of detective chief inspector Gus Viera, who was the police commander at the Knockout Circuz festival in December 2017. Sydney man Nathan Tran consumed multiple MDMA capsules and died at the event. On Thursday Viera \u2013 who said he had acted as an officer at about 20 music festivals dating back to 2010, including the Big Day Out and Stereosonic \u2013 said that when he was working at a music festival he always tried \u201cto get as many drug dogs as I can.\u201d Viera gave evidence that at the Knockout Circuz event police searched 298 people, 69 of whom were found to have drugs on them. Only six of them were carrying quantities that amounted to supply offences. Asked by Dwyer whether police aimed their drug dog operations at suppliers, Viera said that was not possible. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can really answer that question, we will target whoever has drugs on them whether that\u2019s supply of possess,\u201d he said. Viera told the inquest he did not like music festivals, and wanted police to have the power to close festivals early when public safety is at risk. \u201cIt\u2019s all bad,\u201d he told the inquest. \u201cAs a father to two daughters, I wouldn\u2019t let them go. So no, I\u2019m not a fan at all.\u201d Viera told the inquest that on the night of Tran\u2019s death the director of medical service provider EMS, Mike Hammond, told him that though he believed he had stocked enough equipment for an event twice the size of Knockout Circuz by 10.30pm the provider was at capacity. The coroner has previously heard other criticisms of EMS, which provided care at all five of the festivals which are the subject of the inquest. On Monday Guardian Australia reported that independent expert had found that a 23-year-old man who died at the Defqon.1 music festival last year may have survived if he had received better care at the event.",

The winner of the inclusive design award, National Theatre\u2019s Smart Caption Glasses \u201clisten\u201d to what is being said, or sung, on stage, and turn it into text, which the glasses receive via wifi, allowing deaf theatregoers to follow the dialogue. Now 80% of performances provide the glasses. Everyone Can provides bespoke gaming sessions to disabled people, improving confidence and social skills, while Ecoed Life is a gaming app that shows people how to reduce their environmental footprint, and the Inca project has devised an app to help those with language impairments such as aphasia to write poetry and prose. Other standout entries include Safe and Found Online, winner of the ageing society category, which works with police forces to help locate missing older people faster; Beam, winner of the community impact award, which crowdfunds job training for homeless people; MeeTwo, the winner of the connected society award, a free, fully moderated, peer support mental health app for 11- to 23-year-olds; and Good Boost, which uses waterproof tablets and artificial intelligence to provide tailor-made aqua therapy sessions in 16 swimming pools across England for patients with musculoskeletal problems, for the same cost as a swim, with no waiting times. But, for sheer inspiration, perhaps the most impressive entry is from Mihika Sharma, who, aged just five, came up with a design for a smart stick to help blind people cross the road. Her idea was so good that University College London helped her build a prototype. Now aged nine, Mihika\u2019s stick has sensors to detect obstacles and puddles, and is connected to the person\u2019s phone\u2019s GPS system, so it can guide them to their destination, using right and left vibrations. \u2022 Anna Bawden is deputy editor of Society Guardian and a Tech4Good judge",

      "body": "<p>This year started with a bang. It burst into life with fireworks and kisses, and then came the sound of a spoon tapping on a wine glass. \u201cSince we\u2019re all together,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI wanted to say it\u2019s been an honour knowing you while I\u2019ve been in London.\u201d</p> <p>Another leaving speech. I have heard many over the past few years, watching loved ones leave in search of job opportunities or housing security, or as a cure for homesickness. Later, as I lay in bed, I thought about my rate of friend attrition. How long until I found myself totally alone? Five years? Ten? My new year resolution was a no-brainer: I must try to make new friends.</p> <p>A lot of young people feel the same. According to a survey last year for the BBC, 40% of 16- to 24-year-olds say they <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2018/loneliest-age-group-radio-4\" title=\"\">feel lonely often or very often</a>. My problem with making friends isn\u2019t finding suitable candidates, but a lack of free time means I struggle to deepen relationships with people I like. But I do have my phone and I am part of an always-connected, always-scrolling generation. Can I use the internet to find my future bestie?</p> <p>To help me on my journey, I contact <a href=\"https://kateleaver.com/book\" title=\"\">Kate Leaver, author of The Friendship Cure</a>, a book exploring modern friendship. She was inspired to write it by an article in the Atlantic, in which journalist Julie Beck argued that we shed friendships as we age because our spouses (to whom we are legally bound) and our family (to whom we are biologically bound) fill our worlds. When that happens, friendships are the first to go. \u201cThat article essentially frightened me into a year-long research binge so I could make the case for reviving our interest and our investment in friendship,\u201d says Leaver.</p> <p>She says we have \u201corganised our modern lives so that we\u2019re more isolated than we think we are\u201d. Social media makes us believe we are surrounded by people, and we may mistake likes and comments for intimacy. Offline, meanwhile, we have been brought up to believe it is unacceptable to speak to strangers, even as traditional public spaces \u2013 libraries, sports centres \u2013 are being closed down. In the few spaces that remain, she says: \u201cWe\u2019re left with all these grown adults not knowing how to make new friends or get close to people.\u201d</p> <p>This rings painfully true. I go to the gym two or three times a week, yet my visits are silent. I don\u2019t enjoy the gym; I do it so I don\u2019t drop dead in 30 years. I pass through, barely making eye contact, let alone exchanging words. Can the internet help me make friends there? </p> <p>I decide to follow my gym on Instagram, commenting on its posts alongside other members. Mostly, these are health fanatics and their comments are just fire emojis (a symbol that means exciting or excellent) \u2013 so I\u2019m not sure how I could build intimacy. I try to get involved anyway, heaping praise and asking questions. Later, at the gym, I approach another user, a man who looks as if he is in his late 20s, and ask if he was the person I saw on Instagram winning a fitness challenge. He was. We swap names and talk about where we live. If we have lots in common, it is not immediately apparent. Perhaps it is our millennial inability to carry on a conversation, or perhaps we are both tired after exercise, but the chat dwindles. We don\u2019t speak when our paths cross again, but I do get a wave now and then.</p> <p>I also download a friend-making app \u2013 <a href=\"https://bumble.com/bff\" title=\"\">Bumble BFF</a>. I am already using Bumble for dating and it is easy enough to toggle between the friends and romance platforms. I even use the same bio: \u201clefty journalist from London, climbing the ladder of success wrong by wrong\u201d. I think it is charming, but other women do not. My rate of matches in the friend setting is significantly lower than in the romance section. I initiate a conversation with every match I receive, but notice that potential friendships are not tended with the same energy as possible romances. Perhaps Beck is right \u2013 in the choice between love and friendship, pals always lose.</p> <p>The swipe functionality of Bumble BFF also makes me uncomfortable. Like the romance portion, you swipe right to say you like the profile, left to say you don\u2019t. And you can make this decision based on one picture, rather than needing to take in the whole profile before you give your verdict.

With a large proportion of Facebook friends being people I met more than 10 years ago, I am not sure I still have anything in common with many of them. But perhaps Facebook\u2019s supposed aim \u2013 to keep us connected with people we might otherwise lose contact with \u2013 will come in handy. <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407518761225\" title=\"\">Jeffrey Hall, a researcher</a> from the University of Kansas, found that you need 80-100 hours to become friends with someone, or 200 hours to become close friends.

And there are plenty of old friends on Facebook.</p> <p>I contact Paul, my BFF from sixth-form college. He went to a different university and, although we tried to stay in touch, our paths diverged over time. We chat briefly online, opting to meet for dinner right away. The dinner is like old times and there is no distance between us even though so much has changed. We discuss our respective new partners and what happened to the old ones, our new jobs and where we hope to go, as well as our old hobbies, which remain the same (writing and film-watching).

      "bodyText": "This year started with a bang. It burst into life with fireworks and kisses, and then came the sound of a spoon tapping on a wine glass. \u201cSince we\u2019re all together,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI wanted to say it\u2019s been an honour knowing you while I\u2019ve been in London.\u201d Another leaving speech. I have heard many over the past few years, watching loved ones leave in search of job opportunities or housing security, or as a cure for homesickness. Later, as I lay in bed, I thought about my rate of friend attrition. How long until I found myself totally alone? Five years? Ten? My new year resolution was a no-brainer: I must try to make new friends. A lot of young people feel the same. According to a survey last year for the BBC, 40% of 16- to 24-year-olds say they feel lonely often or very often. My problem with making friends isn\u2019t finding suitable candidates, but a lack of free time means I struggle to deepen relationships with people I like. But I do have my phone and I am part of an always-connected, always-scrolling generation. Can I use the internet to find my future bestie? To help me on my journey, I contact Kate Leaver, author of The Friendship Cure, a book exploring modern friendship. She was inspired to write it by an article in the Atlantic, in which journalist Julie Beck argued that we shed friendships as we age because our spouses (to whom we are legally bound) and our family (to whom we are biologically bound) fill our worlds. When that happens, friendships are the first to go. \u201cThat article essentially frightened me into a year-long research binge so I could make the case for reviving our interest and our investment in friendship,\u201d says Leaver. She says we have \u201corganised our modern lives so that we\u2019re more isolated than we think we are\u201d. Social media makes us believe we are surrounded by people, and we may mistake likes and comments for intimacy. Offline, meanwhile, we have been brought up to believe it is unacceptable to speak to strangers, even as traditional public spaces \u2013 libraries, sports centres \u2013 are being closed down. In the few spaces that remain, she says: \u201cWe\u2019re left with all these grown adults not knowing how to make new friends or get close to people.\u201d This rings painfully true. I go to the gym two or three times a week, yet my visits are silent. I don\u2019t enjoy the gym; I do it so I don\u2019t drop dead in 30 years. I pass through, barely making eye contact, let alone exchanging words. Can the internet help me make friends there? I decide to follow my gym on Instagram, commenting on its posts alongside other members. Mostly, these are health fanatics and their comments are just fire emojis (a symbol that means exciting or excellent) \u2013 so I\u2019m not sure how I could build intimacy. I try to get involved anyway, heaping praise and asking questions. Later, at the gym, I approach another user, a man who looks as if he is in his late 20s, and ask if he was the person I saw on Instagram winning a fitness challenge. He was. We swap names and talk about where we live. If we have lots in common, it is not immediately apparent. Perhaps it is our millennial inability to carry on a conversation, or perhaps we are both tired after exercise, but the chat dwindles. We don\u2019t speak when our paths cross again, but I do get a wave now and then. I also download a friend-making app \u2013 Bumble BFF. I am already using Bumble for dating and it is easy enough to toggle between the friends and romance platforms. I even use the same bio: \u201clefty journalist from London, climbing the ladder of success wrong by wrong\u201d. I think it is charming, but other women do not. My rate of matches in the friend setting is significantly lower than in the romance section. I initiate a conversation with every match I receive, but notice that potential friendships are not tended with the same energy as possible romances. Perhaps Beck is right \u2013 in the choice between love and friendship, pals always lose. The swipe functionality of Bumble BFF also makes me uncomfortable. Like the romance portion, you swipe right to say you like the profile, left to say you don\u2019t. And you can make this decision based on one picture, rather than needing to take in the whole profile before you give your verdict. You cannot move on to another profile until you have cast your judgment, so you are primed to decide within seconds in order to sate your curiousity about who is next. Inevitably, I find myself judging other women based on their looks \u2013 on what I think their clothes communicate about their personality, or what the set up of their shots says about their interests \u2013 and no doubt I am being judged similarly. It hurts to be reduced to this, and more so than it does when it is by the opposite sex.

      "bodyText": "Prime minister Scott Morrison says his government has no plans to raise Newstart beyond the usual indexation levels, while talking up national employment figures, declaring \u201chow good are jobs\u201d. The comments come as one of his backbenchers warn people will turn to crime if the welfare payment is not increased. While advocating for an increase in the payment for those in regional and rural communities, the former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce said it was a \u201creality of life\u201d that those attempting to get by on Newstart would \u201cgrow dope\u201d or steal in order to make ends meet. But Morrison ruled out any change beyond the six-monthly indexation change, which last added just 30 cents a day to the $275.10 a week base payment, increasing it by just over $2. \u201cMore importantly, for those who are on Newstart \u2026 well over 90%, about 99% per cent, of people who are on Newstart are actually on other forms of payments as well,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting people into jobs. The latest jobs figures show 20,000 additional full-time jobs. That\u2019s good news, that\u2019s great news, more jobs. How good are jobs.\u201d The oft-repeated claim from government MPs that most people on Newstart also receive other government assistance is true, but in the majority of cases that payment works out to less than $10 a week. Business leaders have repeatedly called for a real-term increase to the unemployment payment, saying it was much needed to stimulate the economy. Morrison said the government\u2019s tax package, passed by the parliament including Labor and the crossbench earlier this month, would do the same job. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s going to support the economy, and that\u2019s the tax relief provided to more than 3.5 million people that live outside Australia\u2019s metropolitan areas,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cTax relief. We also made the changes to the deeming rates last weekend, and that\u2019s an appropriate adjustment after the movement in the cash rate by the Reserve Bank.\u201d Newstart has not seen an increase, in real terms, since the Keating government. Joyce has become the latest government MP to call for the payment to be reviewed and increased but with a focus on those who live in rural and regional communities. \u201cI need to go to bat for my people, and the people out in regional areas, we don\u2019t have a public transport system, you\u2019ve got a secondhand, dumpy car, you don\u2019t have a doctor down the street, you need to drive to town for it,\u201d he told ABC News. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at $50 a week plus in fuel just to pick up your groceries. They\u2019ve got a different predicament to people in the cities. People end up in the little regional towns, they end up in the small towns, because they keep falling down and down. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it on $280 a week.\u201d Labor MPs have also begun to break ranks and demand an increase to the payment, with party policy to have the payment reviewed.",

Real\u2019s plan is music to the ears of Mino Raiola, the Manchester United midfielder\u2019s agent, who has fuelled further fire by refusing to rule out a return to Juventus. With that saga only just starting, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is keen to put another protracted transfer to bed; he wants Sporting Lisbon\u2019s Bruno Fernandes pronto, with Solskj\u00e6r said to have piled pressure on Ed Woodward to get the Portuguese in the building. And then of course there is Harry Maguire, but Leicester City are in no mood to make life easy and Brendan Rodgers has made it clear the clock is ticking. \u201cThere will be a cut-off point,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the valuation isn\u2019t met, it certainly won\u2019t be allowed to go to the very end [of the transfer window] because, if we did want to bring someone in, it would be too late.

It also makes TV sets, soundbars, headphones, air conditioners and dehumidifiers.

Its square 3.5in screen is unsuitable for YouTube and most mobile web pages, but this is why you\u2019re looking for a mini-laptop as well.</p> <p>Either way, I wouldn\u2019t recommend a BlackBerry Classic to the average consumer, who would be better off with, for example, a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/motorola-6-24-Inch-Android-Sim-Free-Smartphone-Black/dp/B07N8KXQLH/\">Motorola G7 for \u00a3179.99</a>.

However, most people wanted bigger screens \u2013 they quickly increased to about 10in \u2013 more memory and more storage. This closed the price gap to \u201cproper\u201d laptops, and the netbook market collapsed.</p> <p>The next generation of mini-laptops arrived with the Asus Transformer (which originally ran Android), Lenovo\u2019s Miix range (now discontinued), the Acer One and similar machines. Most of them had 10.1in screens, and some \u2013 such as the <a href=\"https://www.ebuyer.com/787046-asus-transformer-book-t101ha-convertible-laptop-t101ha-gr029r\">Asus T101HA</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ebuyer.com/788377-acer-one-10-convertible-laptop-nt-lcqek-001\">Acer One 10</a> \u2013 had a screen resolution of only 1280 x 800 pixels. Most were cheap because they had only 2GB of memory and 32GB of slow eMMC chip storage, which is much the same as a built-in SD Card.</p> <p>As with netbooks and Chromebooks, the idea is that users won\u2019t need powerful processors or local storage because they will use online applications and save all their data online. In theory, this is still the case. You could therefore consider a laptop like an <a href=\"https://www.ebuyer.com/788377-acer-one-10-convertible-laptop-nt-lcqek-001\">Acer One 10 at \u00a3229.86</a>, or even a <a href=\"https://www.ebuyer.com/882546-thomson-x5-32gb-10-1-laptop-black-uk-neo10a-2bk32\">Thomson Neo 10 at \u00a399.95</a>, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.

It was great for writing, and much less cumbersome than my old Filofax. I don\u2019t think PDAs will ever retake the mass market, because large smartphones and small tablets have filled that hole. However, there is still some interest in mini-laptops, which can now reach enthusiasts via Kickstarter and Indiegogo campaigns. The Gemini PDA, from UK-based Planet Computers, is an attempt to recreate something like the Psion Series 5.

Once Upon a Time in Hollywood being his ninth, that leaves us with one big question: assuming all goes according to plan, what will the last Tarantino movie be?</p> <p>We may already have an answer: since 2017, the film-maker has been talking up his plan to direct a Star Trek movie for producer JJ Abrams and Paramount Studios. In a recent <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/podcast/2476541/will-quentin-tarantinos-last-movie-be-star-trek-the-director-talks-about-a-loophole\">interview</a>, he reaffirmed his interest in the project, as well as his commitment to walk away from directing after one more turn behind the camera.</p> <p>The notion that his curtain call might take place aboard the Starship Enterprise has struck many a fan as preposterous, leading them to speculate that Tarantino wouldn\u2019t count it towards his self-imposed 10-film limit.</p> <p>But it appears the director is well ahead of them, telling CinemaBlend: \u201cI guess I do have a loophole, [if] the idea was to throw a loophole into it. Which would be [to go], \u2018Uhhh, I guess Star Trek doesn\u2019t count. I can do Star Trek \u2026 but naturally I would end on an original.\u2019 But the idea of doing 10 isn\u2019t to come up with a loophole. I actually think, if I was going to do Star Trek, I should commit to it. It\u2019s my last movie. There should be nothing left-handed about it. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to do that, but that might happen.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELeMaP8EPAA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ELeMaP8EPAA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Despite the various qualifications within his remarks (those <em>ifs </em>and <em>I don\u2019t knows</em> are certainly telling), it now appears that Tarantino\u2019s final film as a director may indeed be Star Trek. It\u2019s yet another odd factor that makes this previously implausible idea \u2013 no one ever expected to see an R-rated Star Trek movie in the first place, let alone one directed by arguably the most uncompromising and controversial American director of the past quarter-century \u2013 even more implausible.</p> <p>Adding to the weirdness of it all is the fact that Mark L Smith, who co-wrote The Revenant, is on scripting duties. Should the project move forward with everyone locked into their current positions, not only would it mark the first time Tarantino has directed an entry in an existing franchise (or, for that matter, in the genre of science fiction), but also the first film he\u2019s directed but didn\u2019t write. Given how vociferous he has been throughout the years about his writing process, placing it on equal levels with his work as a director, that may be the most surprising detail of all.</p> <p>Then again, it may also be the point. On first glance, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood \u2013 which charts the collision course between a fictional TV star on the verge on obsolescence (Leonardo DiCaprio), his longtime friend and stuntman (Brad Pitt) and his new neighbor, the real-life actor Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) with the murderous Manson cult in the summer of 1969 \u2013 looks to be his most personal film to date, as well as the purest expression of his overarching interests and obsessions: film and television (specifically, the movies and shows he grew up on); his hometown Los Angeles (recreated as it was during his early childhood); the intersection between America\u2019s history and its pervading mythology; and the craft of acting (his original vocation, and arguably the most consistent theme explored throughout his body of work).</p> <p>Perhaps Tarantino intends Once Upon a Time in Hollywood to be his last truly personal statement as a director, opting to retire behind a big-budget, high-concept bit of popcorn spectacle from which he is slightly more removed than usual, just for the hell of it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6eab6bb21d39c31118bb3ccc2adb2ce3a9ab1615\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eab6bb21d39c31118bb3ccc2adb2ce3a9ab1615/0_0_2048_1400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman in 2003\" width=\"1000\" height=\"684\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman in 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Soeren Stache/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, any such speculation must take into account the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/quentin-tarantino-abandoned-projects-movies-almost-made/\">history of projects</a> that Tarantino has been attached to over the years that have failed to come to fruition. Foremost among this litany are a Reservoir Dogs/Pulp Fiction spin-off about Michael Madsen and John Travolta\u2019s Vega Brothers characters; an adaptation of Elmore Leonard\u2019s western novel Forty Lashes Less One; a biopic of the abolitionist renegade John Brown; a loose spin-off of Inglourious Basterds called Killer Crow (about a rogue unit of black soldiers who go on a killing spree of their racist white counterparts while fighting overseas); and, of course, Kill Bill: Volume 3.</p> <p>There have also been rumors of a handful of literary adaptations (spy thrillers Modesty Blaise and Berlin Game, as well as a second, more faithful version of Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s yuppie nightmare Less Than Zero) and a couple of remakes, including those of Italian horror maestro Lucio Fulci\u2019s The Psychic and pre-reboot versions of The Green Hornet, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-man-from-uncle\">The Man from U</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-man-from-uncle\">N</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-man-from-uncle\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-man-from-uncle\">L</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-man-from-uncle\">E</a> and Westworld.</p> <p>Star Trek isn\u2019t the first case of Tarantino circling a brand-name franchise either. He previously pitched a gritty update of James Bond, specifically an adaptation of Ian Fleming\u2019s introductory novel, Casino Royale, which would have seen Pierce Brosnan retaining the role of James Bond. He also had short dalliances with the sci-fi/fantasy genre, having been attached to pre-superhero movie boom versions of Luke Cage and The Silver Surfer.</p> <p>Should his Star Trek film follow a similar trajectory and end up consigned to the \u201cwhat if \u2026\u201d pile, it\u2019s unlikely that any of these films would take its place on his docket. He hasn\u2019t talked about any of them in years, save for Kill Bill: Volume 3, the possibility of which he floated as late as 2015. But given <a href=\"https://movieweb.com/kill-bill-3-never-happen-uma-thurman-quentin-tarantino-fight/\">the controversy</a> surrounding an injury suffered by lead actress Uma Thurman while filming the original, for which many hold Tarantino responsible, as well her treatment by disgraced Kill Bill producer Harvey Weinstein, such a prospect seems incredibly unlikely (though Thurman herself won\u2019t entirely dismiss the possibility).</p> <p>But while Kill Bill fans shouldn\u2019t expect to see the further adventures of the Bride anytime soon, there <em>is</em> a sequel to another of Tarantino\u2019s action-revenge epics currently in the pipeline. It was recently <a href=\"http://collider.com/quentin-tarantino-jerrod-carmichael-django-zorro-movie/#images\">reported</a> that Tarantino tapped actor-comedian Jerrod Carmichael to pen the script for an adaptation of Dynamite and DC Comics\u2019 Django/Zorro for Sony. That comic series, co-written by Tarantino and Matt Wagner, follows the continuing adventures of Django Unchained\u2019s eponymous freed slave-turned-bounty, and teams him up with the Mexican superhero.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"71d17350c1224e22fe747deea3e13c620ae209bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71d17350c1224e22fe747deea3e13c620ae209bc/0_0_3000_2110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Foxx in Django Unchained\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Foxx in Django Unchained.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As of now, Tarantino is set to executive-produce the film, with no plans to direct. However, should he opt not to make Star Trek after all, this seems as likely a project for him to take on for his 10th and final film as any (the only other project he\u2019s floated in recent years is an <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/next-quentin-tarantino-movie/\">old-school gangster drama</a> set in 1930s Australia, but little is known about that aside from its period and setting).</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/quentin-tarantino-confirms-retirement-rumors-two-more-943862\">discussing</a> his reasoning behind early retirement, Tarantino has talked about wanting to \u201cDrop the mic. Boom.

      "bodyText": "Just over a week away from the US release of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s latest film, the showbiz-cum-true crime epic Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, the anticipation among film freaks and general audiences alike is at a fever pitch. Though this is par the course for Tarantino, whose every directorial effort is regarded as a major cinematic event, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood carries with it an extra sense of gravitas: not only is it a new Tarantino film, it is very likely the penultimate Tarantino film. For years now, the outspoken auteur has said he plans to retire from feature directing once he completes his 10th film. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood being his ninth, that leaves us with one big question: assuming all goes according to plan, what will the last Tarantino movie be? We may already have an answer: since 2017, the film-maker has been talking up his plan to direct a Star Trek movie for producer JJ Abrams and Paramount Studios. In a recent interview, he reaffirmed his interest in the project, as well as his commitment to walk away from directing after one more turn behind the camera. The notion that his curtain call might take place aboard the Starship Enterprise has struck many a fan as preposterous, leading them to speculate that Tarantino wouldn\u2019t count it towards his self-imposed 10-film limit. But it appears the director is well ahead of them, telling CinemaBlend: \u201cI guess I do have a loophole, [if] the idea was to throw a loophole into it. Which would be [to go], \u2018Uhhh, I guess Star Trek doesn\u2019t count. I can do Star Trek \u2026 but naturally I would end on an original.\u2019 But the idea of doing 10 isn\u2019t to come up with a loophole. I actually think, if I was going to do Star Trek, I should commit to it. It\u2019s my last movie. There should be nothing left-handed about it. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to do that, but that might happen.\u201d Despite the various qualifications within his remarks (those ifs and I don\u2019t knows are certainly telling), it now appears that Tarantino\u2019s final film as a director may indeed be Star Trek. It\u2019s yet another odd factor that makes this previously implausible idea \u2013 no one ever expected to see an R-rated Star Trek movie in the first place, let alone one directed by arguably the most uncompromising and controversial American director of the past quarter-century \u2013 even more implausible. Adding to the weirdness of it all is the fact that Mark L Smith, who co-wrote The Revenant, is on scripting duties. Should the project move forward with everyone locked into their current positions, not only would it mark the first time Tarantino has directed an entry in an existing franchise (or, for that matter, in the genre of science fiction), but also the first film he\u2019s directed but didn\u2019t write. Given how vociferous he has been throughout the years about his writing process, placing it on equal levels with his work as a director, that may be the most surprising detail of all. Then again, it may also be the point. On first glance, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood \u2013 which charts the collision course between a fictional TV star on the verge on obsolescence (Leonardo DiCaprio), his longtime friend and stuntman (Brad Pitt) and his new neighbor, the real-life actor Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) with the murderous Manson cult in the summer of 1969 \u2013 looks to be his most personal film to date, as well as the purest expression of his overarching interests and obsessions: film and television (specifically, the movies and shows he grew up on); his hometown Los Angeles (recreated as it was during his early childhood); the intersection between America\u2019s history and its pervading mythology; and the craft of acting (his original vocation, and arguably the most consistent theme explored throughout his body of work). Perhaps Tarantino intends Once Upon a Time in Hollywood to be his last truly personal statement as a director, opting to retire behind a big-budget, high-concept bit of popcorn spectacle from which he is slightly more removed than usual, just for the hell of it. Of course, any such speculation must take into account the history of projects that Tarantino has been attached to over the years that have failed to come to fruition. Foremost among this litany are a Reservoir Dogs/Pulp Fiction spin-off about Michael Madsen and John Travolta\u2019s Vega Brothers characters; an adaptation of Elmore Leonard\u2019s western novel Forty Lashes Less One; a biopic of the abolitionist renegade John Brown; a loose spin-off of Inglourious Basterds called Killer Crow (about a rogue unit of black soldiers who go on a killing spree of their racist white counterparts while fighting overseas); and, of course, Kill Bill: Volume 3. There have also been rumors of a handful of literary adaptations (spy thrillers Modesty Blaise and Berlin Game, as well as a second, more faithful version of Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s yuppie nightmare Less Than Zero) and a couple of remakes, including those of Italian horror maestro Lucio Fulci\u2019s The Psychic and pre-reboot versions of The Green Hornet, The Man from UNCLE and Westworld. Star Trek isn\u2019t the first case of Tarantino circling a brand-name franchise either. He previously pitched a gritty update of James Bond, specifically an adaptation of Ian Fleming\u2019s introductory novel, Casino Royale, which would have seen Pierce Brosnan retaining the role of James Bond. He also had short dalliances with the sci-fi/fantasy genre, having been attached to pre-superhero movie boom versions of Luke Cage and The Silver Surfer. Should his Star Trek film follow a similar trajectory and end up consigned to the \u201cwhat if \u2026\u201d pile, it\u2019s unlikely that any of these films would take its place on his docket. He hasn\u2019t talked about any of them in years, save for Kill Bill: Volume 3, the possibility of which he floated as late as 2015. But given the controversy surrounding an injury suffered by lead actress Uma Thurman while filming the original, for which many hold Tarantino responsible, as well her treatment by disgraced Kill Bill producer Harvey Weinstein, such a prospect seems incredibly unlikely (though Thurman herself won\u2019t entirely dismiss the possibility). But while Kill Bill fans shouldn\u2019t expect to see the further adventures of the Bride anytime soon, there is a sequel to another of Tarantino\u2019s action-revenge epics currently in the pipeline. It was recently reported that Tarantino tapped actor-comedian Jerrod Carmichael to pen the script for an adaptation of Dynamite and DC Comics\u2019 Django/Zorro for Sony. That comic series, co-written by Tarantino and Matt Wagner, follows the continuing adventures of Django Unchained\u2019s eponymous freed slave-turned-bounty, and teams him up with the Mexican superhero. As of now, Tarantino is set to executive-produce the film, with no plans to direct. However, should he opt not to make Star Trek after all, this seems as likely a project for him to take on for his 10th and final film as any (the only other project he\u2019s floated in recent years is an old-school gangster drama set in 1930s Australia, but little is known about that aside from its period and setting). When discussing his reasoning behind early retirement, Tarantino has talked about wanting to \u201cDrop the mic. Boom. Tell everybody: \u2018Match that shit!\u2019\u201d Of course, Tarantino has also always maintained a large transgressive streak as an actor and a public figure, so perhaps he intends for his final cinematic statement to be a dark and radical upending of an established piece of mainstream entertainment with a huge and hugely invested fanbase. Given the state of movies at the current moment \u2013 Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is one of the few original, adult-oriented films to get a wide release this summer \u2013 such may prove to be the ultimate mic drop after all. Whatever he chooses for his 10th and final film, it\u2019s unlikely that his fans will ever stop looking forward to what he had in store. Retirements, after all, are meant to come out of (just look at Tarantino\u2019s peer Steven Soderbergh, who retired from directing in 2013 only to return four years later), and while Tarantino has said he\u2019s just about done with feature films, he hardly seems primed to turn into a Salinger-esque recluse, promising to turn his attention to other creative pursuits, including writing theater, novels and criticism (he has also expressed interest in long-form storytelling, and his recent supervision of an extended cut of The Hateful Eight for Netflix shows he\u2019s not adverse to working with a streaming platform).

He is talking not about himself but about Gove\u2019s own entry in the genre, <em>Portillo: The Future of the Right.</em> Weeks after Gove\u2019s study of Michael Portillo hit bookshelves, the Enfield Southgate MP\u2019s putative leadership bid had hit the buffers.</p> <p>Bennett\u2019s <em>A Man in a Hurry</em> has suffered a similar fate. And unlike <em>The Future of the Right</em>, which was criticised (both at the time and by Bennett) for pulling its punches, this book arguably played a decisive role in the downfall of its subject. It is in these pages that Bennett revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/07/michael-gove-admits-to-taking-cocaine-on-several-social-occasions\" title=\"\">Gove took cocaine while working at the Times</a>, a story which, given the wafer-thin margin that separated him from Jeremy Hunt in the vote of MPs, may well have brought his leadership bid to an early end.</p> <p>It is by no means guaranteed that Gove will even be kept in the cabinet if and when Boris Johnson takes office. Even if he is, he looks, at present, to be a politician on the downward slope. He has enjoyed, as Bennett details, not one but two political resurrections already: once when David Cameron restored him to full cabinet rank after electoral triumph in 2015, once after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/15/beleaguered-may-offers-gove-brexit-secretary-job\" title=\"\">Theresa May brought him back from the wilderness</a> after electoral disaster in 2017. While you would have to be foolish to rule out a third return, the chances are that this book is a work of historical interest rather than a vital explainer of the man of the moment. How does it fare?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I know of no candidate to the Oxford Union who managed to reach the presidency 'without resorting to dark tactics' as Bennett claims Gove did</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the many difficulties of writing a biography of Gove is that anyone who begins the task is, at once, writing about the right\u2019s most readable polemicist and the Conservative party\u2019s best rhetorician of the last 20 years. It\u2019s a nerve-racking job for any writer, but Bennett handles it well. The book rattles along nicely as it recounts Gove\u2019s early life, school days and career before politics.

      "bodyText": "\u201cPolitical biographers who choose to write about a figure not yet at the end of their career are taking a gamble,\u201d Owen Bennett writes in his biography of Michael Gove. He is talking not about himself but about Gove\u2019s own entry in the genre, Portillo: The Future of the Right. Weeks after Gove\u2019s study of Michael Portillo hit bookshelves, the Enfield Southgate MP\u2019s putative leadership bid had hit the buffers. Bennett\u2019s A Man in a Hurry has suffered a similar fate. And unlike The Future of the Right, which was criticised (both at the time and by Bennett) for pulling its punches, this book arguably played a decisive role in the downfall of its subject. It is in these pages that Bennett revealed that Gove took cocaine while working at the Times, a story which, given the wafer-thin margin that separated him from Jeremy Hunt in the vote of MPs, may well have brought his leadership bid to an early end. It is by no means guaranteed that Gove will even be kept in the cabinet if and when Boris Johnson takes office. Even if he is, he looks, at present, to be a politician on the downward slope. He has enjoyed, as Bennett details, not one but two political resurrections already: once when David Cameron restored him to full cabinet rank after electoral triumph in 2015, once after Theresa May brought him back from the wilderness after electoral disaster in 2017. While you would have to be foolish to rule out a third return, the chances are that this book is a work of historical interest rather than a vital explainer of the man of the moment. How does it fare? One of the many difficulties of writing a biography of Gove is that anyone who begins the task is, at once, writing about the right\u2019s most readable polemicist and the Conservative party\u2019s best rhetorician of the last 20 years. It\u2019s a nerve-racking job for any writer, but Bennett handles it well. The book rattles along nicely as it recounts Gove\u2019s early life, school days and career before politics. It frustrates when, as with any historical work, the author\u2019s conclusions seem arguable. I\u2019m not convinced by Bennett\u2019s views on Gove\u2019s family, for instance. The book points out that he resisted finding out about his biological mother in deference to the woman who raised him. Bennett thinks there\u2019s a contradiction between this and statements by Gove\u2019s adoptive mother that she would support him should he wish to meet his biological mother. But it\u2019s in the nature of loving parents to be self-sacrificing, and in the nature of considerate sons to try to avoid causing them pain. If he is overly suspicious about Gove\u2019s family, Bennett is far too generous about his career in student politics; I know of no candidate to the Oxford Union who managed to reach the presidency \u201cwithout resorting to dark tactics\u201d as Bennett claims Gove did. Nor I am I convinced by Bennett\u2019s audit of Gove\u2019s time as education secretary: he focuses on the vast increase in the number of academies and free schools that opened under him. That Gove carried out his reforms is not in question. What is in question is whether the difference between his academies and those of Tony Blair required him to make an enemy of the teaching profession, a decision that has dogged his career ever since. Of course, the measures that he and his staff took to restrict the circle of trust and information in the department make it harder to make the pro-Gove case and may well mean that future historians conclude that he was simply an irredeemable bomb-thrower.

But these are the quibbles that shouldn\u2019t detract from a highly skilful bringing together of diaries, contemporary accounts and the author\u2019s own research. The story ends with Gove launching his campaign \u2013 a campaign derailed mostly because Conservative members wanted the loudest and most uncompromising Brexiter in the field. As a result, this is a good book that feels somewhat pointless: though we shouldn\u2019t forget that we\u2019d have said the same thing had Bennett published a biography of Boris Johnson in the summer of 2016. \u2022 Michael Gove: A Man in a Hurry is published by Biteback (\u00a320).

      "bodyText": "Modern classical and electronic music is still dominated by stars who are largely \u201cpale, male and stale\u201d, leading industry figures have warned, after learning of a major new compilation album featuring only two works composed by women. Collaborations, which will be released by Mercury KX \u2013 a label that claims to cross \u201cthe borders between electronic, ambient, classical, alternative and modern music\u201d \u2013 is compiled by choreographer Wayne McGregor and was billed as \u201ca collection of music from the biggest names in modern classical and electronic music\u201d in a tweet sent by the label. But the dearth of female artists was immediately picked up on \u2013 with footwork artist Jlin and Finnish contemporary composer Kaija Saariaho the only women represented over the 15 tracks. Composer Hannah Peel tweeted: \u201cBiggest names in modern classical and electronic? Makes me feel a bit sick in 2019\u201d and then listed female artists who were not on the record, including FKA twigs, Gazelle Twin, Poppy Ackroyd, Holly Herndon, Mira Calix (who McGregor has collaborated with) and Anna Meredith. McGregor said the record was inaccurately promoted by Mercury KX, and that the selection is taken from work he has commissioned over the last 25 years to accompany dance pieces. \u201cClearly these are not the most important contemporary and electronic composers in the world. That\u2019s just a ridiculous thing to say,\u201d explained McGregor, who included two tracks each from Max Richter and Jon Hopkins. \u201cWhen I\u2019m commissioning I\u2019m not just looking at music. I\u2019m thinking about commissioning in context of the whole [dance] piece. In isolation \u2026 I realised that in terms of gender parity it is not great and we want to do better with that, definitely,\u201d he said. \u201cI was horrified by how few women we\u2019d commissioned.\u201d McGregor said that if he were to try to put together a compilation with a 50/50 gender split he\u2019d struggle. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could from work I\u2019ve commissioned,\u201d he said. Hannah Peel, who has just won an Emmy nomination for her work on Game of Thrones, said that in 2019 there is no excuse for having such a slight representation of female artists. \u201cIf you\u2019re a world-renowned contemporary choreographer on the bleeding edge, you should be leading the way on this. There isn\u2019t an excuse. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to labels before who have said that they don\u2019t want to put my work out because they\u2019ve already got a woman. You\u2019re instantly put in competition with other female artists for that one spot. There has always been a problem with the labels \u2013 it feels like a club and only one woman is allowed in.\u201d In 2018, research found that only 76 classical concerts among 1,445 performed worldwide included at least one piece by a woman, and at those concerts 3,442 (97.6%) of all performed pieces were written by men and only 82 (2.3%) by women.

Frances Morgan, music writer and judge of the Oram awards, which recognise female and non-binary composers and electronic musicians, said she wasn\u2019t surprised at the gender balance of the compilation because of the label\u2019s style. \u201cThat label does have a very particular sort of roster which seems to skew towards men, in particular white men, in particular white men of a certain compositional style.

      "bodyText": "Catastrophic news for insect life has inspired communities and councils around the UK to take action, generating splashes of summer colour which hope to have a lasting impact. After reporting a campaign by the conservation charity Plantlife to encourage the growth and planting of flowers on UK roadside verges, we asked you to share stories from where you are. Below, readers share some of their local successes, including thoughts about how leaving nature to run its course by standing back rather than taking action can help \u2013 and explain how they have been getting involved in community projects big and small. \u2018A little goes a long way\u2019 \u201cHengrove Way is a 1960s dual carriageway in the south of Bristol. The wide central verge was originally reserved for a tram system but was planted a few years ago with an avenue of purple beech trees. The meadow here is sown annually by the Bristol city council parks. Budgets are tight and so they try and make a little spread a long way \u2013 in this case there are over 300 metres of flowers: as a resident they give me much enjoyment.\u201d Richard, Bristol \u2018It\u2019s ace arriving home each day to see what\u2019s popped up\u2019 \u201cThree neighbouring families with five children grouped together to care for three unloved grass verges adjacent to our homes in Flackwell Heath, Buckinghamshire. We planted yellow rattle to compete with the grass annuals to provide colour in year one, and perennials from year two onwards. We lovingly named our patch Flack Wild Heath. \u201cI was mowing the verges myself each week anyway, and over a beer with our neighbours, we decided we should give it a go. We\u2019ve had lots of interest and look forward to new friends in the village extending the Heath from next year. More of us should do the same; it\u2019s easy to sit back and wait for the council or someone else. Actually though, there\u2019s way more pleasure in seeing our own patch develop. Very rewarding. In fact, it\u2019s ace arriving home each day to see what\u2019s popped up.\u201d Marcus Firmin, Buckinghamshire \u2018Keeping things as natural as possible\u2019 \u201cI planted this wildflower bank earlier this year on the edge of a path which overlooks a meadow outside my home. The idea is to develop areas that give colour to the meadow as well as attracting different types of wildlife, while trying just to manage small areas and keeping things as natural as possible.\u201d David Warr, Jersey \u2018We\u2019ve been sowing wildflowers everywhere this year\u2019 \u201cTotnes Gardens is a small Royal Horticultural Society affiliated voluntary group, working around the town.

Back in 2015, her first full year as a village health worker, 16 people came down with the disease in Mi Kyaung Hlaung, where roughly 600 residents live surrounded by mosquito-ridden tropical forests. Last year, armed with latex gloves, lancets and a supply of disposable malaria testing kits, she diagnosed just one villager despite testing 250 people. Before she started work, most of her neighbours had only a vague idea of what malaria was and how to prevent it. \u201cNow, whenever they see symptoms, they\u2019ll approach me first rather than the other way round,\u201d she says.

Their efforts have helped save thousands of lives, and are fast turning Myanmar from a malaria black spot into a world leader in the fight to eliminate the disease. Across the country, almost 4,000 people died from malaria in 2010, according to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates. In 2017, the disease claimed just over 200 lives. Dr Patricia Graves, a leading specialist on the transmission and control of malaria, is confident Myanmar is on track to be malaria-free by 2030. The country\u2019s success with village-based health workers \u201cis a huge thing that other countries can learn from,\u201d she says. Also key to the plummeting death rate is the distribution of mosquito nets treated with long-lasting insecticide, added Graves, who travelled to Myanmar as a consultant last year to assess US-funded malaria projects. Some fear the spread of drug-resistant forms of the disease might undo this progress, though scientists believe they have found a way to tackle these strains by treating large numbers of people in \u201chotspot\u201d villages regardless of whether they showed symptoms. An experimental programme last year drastically reduced or eradicated malaria in 50 villages using this strategy. As the number of cases reaches zero it is vital to remain vigilant, says Graves. \u201cWhen you get towards elimination you need to mop up the cases much more quickly, because it can bounce back very fast.\u201d Dr Bo Bo Thet, the field director in Tanintharyi for University Research Co (URC), which manages USAid-funded malaria projects, says being close to elimination poses two problems. \u201cOne is that community awareness becomes quite low, so if someone gets a fever they\u2019re less likely to get tested for malaria. The second problem is that as malaria cases go down, immunity also goes down, so it\u2019s easier to get malaria,\u201d he says. A lack of awareness is not just an issue for laypeople. Staff at government health clinics sometimes fail to recognise symptoms too, he added. Pay Say, a 42-year-old farm labourer, went to the government clinic just outside Mi Kyaung Hlaung village as soon as he started having shivers and joint pain last month. But staff there didn\u2019t test him for malaria, instead giving him an unspecified injection and sending him home, he says. He had been hospitalised with malaria in 2006 and suspected he had it again, so he went to Say Mu Phaw for a second opinion. She tested a drop of blood from his finger and found he was positive. Without her, he may well have remained untreated and become severely ill. \u201cIn some rural health centres there aren\u2019t enough staff, including doctors,\u201d says Dr Thin Thin Chit, senior operations director at URC. \u201cInfrastructure is really important for elimination.\u201d Myanmar\u2019s badly underfunded health system is one of the reasons she and Bo Bo Thet are less optimistic than Graves about the chances of defeating the disease by 2030, when the WHO hopes to see at least a 90% reduction in cases globally compared with 2016. \u201c2030? I\u2019m not so sure,\u201d says Bo Bo Thet. \u201cBy that time some parts of Myanmar will achieve elimination, but not everywhere.\u201d When the number of cases reaches zero in areas where URC works, the volunteer health workers will be trained to diagnose and treat other diseases, such as tuberculosis and HIV, says Bo Bo Thet. This will allow them to monitor their villages and act quickly if malaria returns, and is a better use of resources than focusing only on malaria in areas where people are no longer suffering from the disease. Initiatives like this, which should stop donors losing interest once the battle appears to be all but won, are imperative. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine operating without outside funding,\u201d says Bo Bo Thet. With its dilapidated hospitals and clinics unable to meet the challenge, Myanmar will need major foreign donors like the US to remain committed until the very end. Scot Marciel, the US ambassador to Myanmar, says that while anti-malaria funding has to be approved each year by Congress, he expects Myanmar to \u201cremain a priority\u201d. \u201cThe biggest risk we face in this fight is complacency,\u201d he says.

In late July firearms industry group the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) and another gun industry body, both of which have backed looser gun sales regulations, are slated to hold a three-day confab at the Trump hotel. The gun gathering comes after Trump announced this spring that he was abandoning a UN arms trade treaty, a move the NSSF praised.

Moreover, an Iraqi sheikh this year spent a whopping 26 nights at the Trump hotel not long after advocating for a tougher US policy towards Iran, according to the Washington Post. In separate lawsuits, about 200 congressional Democrats and attorneys general from Maryland and DC have charged that the foreign revenues received by Trump\u2019s hotel violate the foreign emoluments clause, which bars any payments or gifts to the president and other federal officials without congressional authorization. The justice department has gone to court to block the emoluments suits, arguing for a narrow and controversial interpretation of the law and echoing arguments made by Trump\u2019s personal lawyers that only direct payments to Trump himself by foreign governments would be covered by the clause.

It was compiled by Mark Daly, a senator with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a>\u2019s main opposition party, Fianna F\u00e1il, to inform Irish policymakers about the implications if Northern Ireland votes to join the Republic despite opposition from unionists, as permitted under the Good Friday agreement.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason for the report is to identify the fears and concerns,\u201d Daly said. \u201cIdentity is a key one \u2013 will roads be renamed, will it become Bobby Sands international airport?\u201d</p> <p>Daly has his own fear: that Ireland will stumble into unity unprepared, unleashing grave, long-term consequences.</p> <p>The senator James Wilson, who served with the British army in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, was commissioned to interview members of the Orange Order, a loyalist flute band and Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) veterans, among others.</p> <p>Some expressed anxiety about losing land that was originally owned or farmed by Catholics displaced more than a century ago.</p> <p>\u201cThere are real and genuine fears among the unionist community in Northern Ireland that the land would be taken from them, there would be retribution on members of the security forces and their community\u2019s identity would be lost,\u201d said the report, which runs to 55 pages, with another 200 pages of appendices.</p> <p>Violent land disputes during the partition of Ireland in 1921 and the targeting of land-owning UDR members during the Troubles created a real fear of farm takeovers similar to those seen in Robert Mugabe\u2019s Zimbabwe, said Daly. \u201cIt\u2019s not theoretical. Anytime somebody says that and it\u2019s not addressed, the fear grows.\u201d</p> <p>Other fears include loss of identity, nationalist triumphalism, retribution against former security force members, a return to violence, losing welfare and health care benefits, and rejoining the EU.</p> <p>\u201cFor those who cling to the binary, and there are many unionists who do, the fear is that their identity is denied,\u201d wrote one contributor, Mike Nesbitt, a former leader of the Ulster Unionist party.</p> <p>Rev Kyle Paisley, the brother of the Democratic Unionist MP Ian Paisley Jnr, cited fear of swapping the NHS for the Republic\u2019s uneven health care.</p> <p>An unnamed UDR veteran painted a grim scenario of a loyalist uprising overwhelming the Irish army and police. \u201cThey would have to raise a Catholic gendarmerie, like the B Specials, and then you will have civil war, way beyond the Troubles II and more like Bosnia.\u201d</p> <p>There was also a strong resolve among some unionists to fight for their rights in the face of a united Ireland. \u201cThere is a lot of young loyalists out there who missed the war, champing at the bit for military glory. We need Northern Ireland to work. If it doesn\u2019t, a united Ireland will certainly not work,\u201d said one unionist.</p> <p>Others viewed the Brexit chaos as a lesson to be learned. They saw the prospect of a border poll in the near future \u2013 with 50% +1 meaning their exiting the UK and joining a united Ireland \u2013 as a corollary of Brexit, which \u201cfilled certain cohorts of that demographic with apprehension and loathing\u201d, the report found.</p> <p>The report also stated that the Brexit referendum has demonstrated that a border poll \u201ccannot be rushed or used for political gain\u201d or jeopardise \u201cthe hard won peace we all enjoy on this island\u201d.</p> <p>Norman Hamilton, the former moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, said he felt those who were pushing for united Ireland \u201chave little skill in, or interest in, uniting communities\u201d which would be necessary for such a major constitutional change.</p> <p>He said he feared a referendum in the foreseeable future \u201cnot least because of what has been learned \u2013 or not learned \u2013 from the recent referendum in the UK\u201d.</p> <p>Paisley said he believed unionists would reject a united Ireland not just on political or religious grounds but because of a lack of unity on the matter and the attraction of the NHS in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>A unionist public representative told the researchers \u201cany talk or discussion on a united Ireland by unionism is seen by many as tantamount to negotiating surrender\u201d.</p> <p>Demographic data shows Northern Ireland Catholics, who tend to be nationalists, will soon outnumber Protestants, who tend to be unionists. A majority \u2013 56% \u2013 voted in the 2016 referendum to stay in the EU but Northern Ireland now faces a potentially ruinous exit, burnishing the appeal of a neighbour with EU membership, economic success and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/11/progressive-united-ireland-dup\">social liberalism.</a></p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Some unionists in Northern Ireland fear Zimbabwe-style land seizures by Irish nationalists if the region joins a united Ireland, according to a report that lays bare anxieties about any Brexit-fuelled breakup of the UK. Farmers and others with Protestant and unionist backgrounds worry that Catholic and nationalist neighbours would claim their land in a cultural, economic and political takeover by Dublin \u2013 \u201cthe mother of all fears\u201d, the report found. Based on interviews with focus groups and unionist representatives, the report was published on Thursday. It was compiled by Mark Daly, a senator with Ireland\u2019s main opposition party, Fianna F\u00e1il, to inform Irish policymakers about the implications if Northern Ireland votes to join the Republic despite opposition from unionists, as permitted under the Good Friday agreement. \u201cThe reason for the report is to identify the fears and concerns,\u201d Daly said. \u201cIdentity is a key one \u2013 will roads be renamed, will it become Bobby Sands international airport?\u201d Daly has his own fear: that Ireland will stumble into unity unprepared, unleashing grave, long-term consequences. The senator James Wilson, who served with the British army in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, was commissioned to interview members of the Orange Order, a loyalist flute band and Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) veterans, among others. Some expressed anxiety about losing land that was originally owned or farmed by Catholics displaced more than a century ago. \u201cThere are real and genuine fears among the unionist community in Northern Ireland that the land would be taken from them, there would be retribution on members of the security forces and their community\u2019s identity would be lost,\u201d said the report, which runs to 55 pages, with another 200 pages of appendices. Violent land disputes during the partition of Ireland in 1921 and the targeting of land-owning UDR members during the Troubles created a real fear of farm takeovers similar to those seen in Robert Mugabe\u2019s Zimbabwe, said Daly. \u201cIt\u2019s not theoretical. Anytime somebody says that and it\u2019s not addressed, the fear grows.\u201d Other fears include loss of identity, nationalist triumphalism, retribution against former security force members, a return to violence, losing welfare and health care benefits, and rejoining the EU. \u201cFor those who cling to the binary, and there are many unionists who do, the fear is that their identity is denied,\u201d wrote one contributor, Mike Nesbitt, a former leader of the Ulster Unionist party. Rev Kyle Paisley, the brother of the Democratic Unionist MP Ian Paisley Jnr, cited fear of swapping the NHS for the Republic\u2019s uneven health care. An unnamed UDR veteran painted a grim scenario of a loyalist uprising overwhelming the Irish army and police. \u201cThey would have to raise a Catholic gendarmerie, like the B Specials, and then you will have civil war, way beyond the Troubles II and more like Bosnia.\u201d There was also a strong resolve among some unionists to fight for their rights in the face of a united Ireland. \u201cThere is a lot of young loyalists out there who missed the war, champing at the bit for military glory. We need Northern Ireland to work. If it doesn\u2019t, a united Ireland will certainly not work,\u201d said one unionist. Others viewed the Brexit chaos as a lesson to be learned. They saw the prospect of a border poll in the near future \u2013 with 50% +1 meaning their exiting the UK and joining a united Ireland \u2013 as a corollary of Brexit, which \u201cfilled certain cohorts of that demographic with apprehension and loathing\u201d, the report found. The report also stated that the Brexit referendum has demonstrated that a border poll \u201ccannot be rushed or used for political gain\u201d or jeopardise \u201cthe hard won peace we all enjoy on this island\u201d. Norman Hamilton, the former moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, said he felt those who were pushing for united Ireland \u201chave little skill in, or interest in, uniting communities\u201d which would be necessary for such a major constitutional change. He said he feared a referendum in the foreseeable future \u201cnot least because of what has been learned \u2013 or not learned \u2013 from the recent referendum in the UK\u201d. Paisley said he believed unionists would reject a united Ireland not just on political or religious grounds but because of a lack of unity on the matter and the attraction of the NHS in Northern Ireland. A unionist public representative told the researchers \u201cany talk or discussion on a united Ireland by unionism is seen by many as tantamount to negotiating surrender\u201d. Demographic data shows Northern Ireland Catholics, who tend to be nationalists, will soon outnumber Protestants, who tend to be unionists. A majority \u2013 56% \u2013 voted in the 2016 referendum to stay in the EU but Northern Ireland now faces a potentially ruinous exit, burnishing the appeal of a neighbour with EU membership, economic success and social liberalism.",

      "bodyText": "What role should the late, great rapper Tupac Shakur play in the day-to-day life of a public servant? It\u2019s a question 66-year-old Jerry Foxhoven, until recently the director of Iowa\u2019s social services agency, might have mixed feelings about. Foxhoven was ousted from his post in June the day after sending an email containing Tupac lyrics to employees of the Iowa department of human services. For those in the know, this wasn\u2019t an uncommon occurrence. A renowned Tupac superfan, Foxhoven was known for sending emails to his colleagues that included lyrics from Tupac\u2019s songs and for hosting listening parties \u2013 dubbed \u201cTupac Fridays\u201d \u2013 in his office. He even celebrated his 65th birthday with \u201cthug life\u201d frosted cookies. It\u2019s just that this time, the email went to all 4,300 staff. While it might seem incongruous for a white bureaucrat in his 60s to stan the 90s hip-hop legend, a closer look at Tupac\u2019s work reveals a social poet whose work is remarkably compatible with the everyday office grind. Here are 10 lyrics and quotes from his oeuvre that won\u2019t \u2013 hopefully \u2013 get you fired. 1. \u201cHow long will they mourn me?\u201d How Long Will They Mourn Me? It seems not long at all in Foxhoven\u2019s case, but who hasn\u2019t wondered aloud to colleagues, often and insecurely, about your intra-office legacy? No? OK. Me neither. 2. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can pay you back / But the plan is to show you that I understand / You are appreciated\u201d Dear Mama Tupac was talking about his mother, but this line works equally well for managers who are unable or unwilling to offer above-minimum wage increases to their staff. 3. \u201cPicture me inside the misery of poverty / No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived\u201d Thugz Mansion A helpful negotiating counter to the above. 4. \u201cLet\u2019s change the way we eat / Let\u2019s change the way we live / And let\u2019s change the way we treat each other\u201d Changes Changes is perhaps Tupac\u2019s most elegant track. A profound critique of race relations in the US, and a stirring indictment of injustice. It also sort of sounds like an HR manager talking about the new ergonomic chairs and hot-desking system. 5. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me / I was given this world I didn\u2019t make it\u201d Keep Ya Head Up Useful for failed projects, missed deadlines, basically anything for which you\u2019re trying to shed responsibility. 6. \u201cJust got the message you\u2019ve been calling all week / Been out here hustling on these streets, ain\u2019t had a chance to speak\u201d Unconditional Love Tupac\u2019s answer to \u201csorry I missed you, I\u2019ve been tied up in meetings\u201d. 7. \u201cOur future is our confidence and self-esteem\u201d In this quote from a 1996 interview, Tupac\u2019s belief that your own self-worth will be society\u2019s measure of your value sounds weirdly like the heading of a Powerpoint presentation about meeting KPIs. 8. \u201cThe seed must grow regardless of the fact that it\u2019s planted in stone\u201d The Rose that Grew from Concrete Tupac emerged from a difficult upbringing through the Digital Underground \u2013 an American alternative hip-hop outfit from Oakland, California \u2013 and, like this line, much of his oeuvre relates to making something from nothing. Also good for convincing the intern to take on a project you know has no way of succeeding. 9. \u201cPlease don\u2019t cry, dry your eyes, never let up / Forgive, but don\u2019t forget, girl, keep ya head up\u201d Keep Ya Head Up Tupac went through several tumultuous chapters in his personal life; prison, gun violence (obviously) and that time a teenage Rashida Jones dissed him in an open letter published in the Source. Through it all, though, his lyrics never wavered on calling out social injustices and reframing them as life lessons for other black youth. This line, in which he exhorts his audience to persist through dark times, is also useful when awkwardly encountering a colleague crying in the stairwell. 10. \u201cThey\u2019ve got money for war but can\u2019t feed the poor\u201d Keep Ya Head Up Extremely deep.

      "bodyText": "State and territory ministers have agreed to take a \u201cnationally consistent approach\u201d to building industry safety standards, according to the federal industry minister. On Thursday Karen Andrews declared that she had brokered an agreement after meeting building and housing ministers to discuss industry complaints about skyrocketing insurance costs and the patchwork response to safety concerns. Under the deal, the commonwealth and states will jointly fund an \u201cimplementation team\u201d within the Australian Building Codes Board to oversee the response to the Shergold-Weir report into construction safety issues, released in April 2018. That follows demands from New South Wales, Queensland and other states not to create a new bureaucracy to deal with the issue. Andrews told reporters in Sydney that states will retain responsibility for rectification of building works \u2013 including combustible cladding \u2013 reiterating that the commonwealth will not co-fund rectification, as Victoria proposed on Tuesday. On Monday industry groups united to call for a risk assessment strategy for combustible cladding, an agreed timetable for rectification and a joint government-industry taskforce to oversee recommendations from the Shergold-Weir report. The report called for the establishment of a compulsory product certification system for high-risk building products and nationally consistent technical standards for the construction of buildings and for plumbing work across Australia. Andrews said the call for nationally consistent standards had been \u201cthe most contentious\u201d recommendation, but had been agreed by states and territory ministers on Thursday. \u201cConsumers right across Australia and members of the building and construction sector can rest assured their state and territory governments are committed to resolve the issues that have plagued the sector for many many years.\u201d Andrews said there is now a \u201cpathway to a lower risk profile\u201d and called on insurers to stay in the market and lower premiums. But there were few other outcomes to report from the meeting \u2013 with Andrews explaining that there will be \u201cfurther discussion\u201d with insurers about a timetable for reduction of premiums and the new implementation team will decide on a timetable for states to comply with other recommendations. Andrews said states and territories will take a \u201ctwo stage\u201d approach to dealing with combustible cladding: firstly to deal with the legacy caseload of existing buildings with unsafe materials, and secondly to develop a \u201cprogram for the future\u201d to prevent unsafe works. Ken Morrison, the chief executive of the Property Council, said the meeting was \u201cvery positive\u201d. \u201cWe are going to have a consistent approach to the implementation of the reforms that building ministers have had in front of them for 18 months,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is lot of work to do but it is a big step up today and we welcome the fact that ministers have put aside their state by state parochialism.\u201d Earlier, the Queensland housing minister, Mick de Brenni, defended states\u2019 implementation of reforms, telling Radio National they \u201chaven\u2019t been dragging heels\u201d but had each started from a different base. For example, he noted that just 17 buildings in Queensland have been identified so far as needing rectification of combustible cladding, a \u201cvery different\u201d situation from that in New South Wales and Victoria, the latter of which has identified 500 buildings. De Brenni renewed his call on the commonwealth to ban the import of combustible aluminium panels. On Tuesday Victoria announced a $600m fund to rectify combustible cladding, with half to be funded by the state government and half from a levy on permits for buildings worth more than $800,000, because the federal government refused to co-fund the initiative. That prompted a furious response from the Property Council, which warned it would add \u201cuntenable costs to new construction projects in that state\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Troops should not be called in\u2019 Hello, I\u2019m Warren Murray presenting the front page of your day. Boris Yeltsin was looking \u201cpuffy around the neck and jaw\u201d but at least \u201cstayed off the vodka\u201d after getting a chest infection. He got \u201cv pissed off\u201d after a phone call with Bill Clinton was botched by officials. The latter, as US president, was known for \u201ctalking loudly, then failing to act\u201d while first lady Hillary Clinton was \u201chighly intelligent and very highly motivated\u201d. These and other appraisals of foreign leaders are revealed in newly unlocked government papers from the National Archives that show colourful pen portraits were, as Caroline Davies writes, \u201ca staple of the diplomatic cable long before the leaking of the former US ambassador Kim Darroch\u2019s emails\u201d. The files show postwar prime ministers were irked by the length of time and rising costs of refurbishing Downing Street \u2013 a survey under Churchill in 1954 discovered dry rot and beetle damage, with risk of Nos 10, 11 and 12 partially collapsing. Churchill wrote: \u201cI am shocked that the Ministry of Works contemplates two or three years. The Ark did not take so long.\u201d John Major enthusiastically supported Manchester\u2019s bid for the 2000 Olympics, but ministers and officials were less convinced \u2013 the city ended up losing to Sydney. And in 1967 when anti-nuclear protesters threatened to expose the official purpose of \u201cTurnstile\u201d \u2013 a vast underground complex in Wiltshire meant to house central government in wartime \u2013 the \u201cD-notice\u201d committee of the Ministry of Defence stepped in to steer press coverage away. Official instructions stated that \u201cunless the situation developed very abnormally, troops should not be called in\u201d. * * * \u2018Hitler in the bunker\u2019 \u2013 The Labour peer Dianne Hayter has been sacked as shadow Brexit minister after she likened the \u201cbunker mentality\u201d around Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership to the \u201clast days of Hitler\u201d. Hayter remains the party\u2019s deputy leader in the Lords because it is an elected position. At a meeting of the centre-left Labour First group on Tuesday she attacked the Labour leadership over its response to antisemitism complaints. \u201cThose of you who haven\u2019t [read the book] will have watched the film Bunker, about the last days of Hitler, of how you stop receiving into the inner group any information which suggests that things are not going the way you want.\u201d The Ilford North Labour MP, Wes Streeting, said Hayter\u2019s sacking was a \u201cgross over-reaction \u2026 The speed of this sacking shows that Labour\u2019s leader is quick to act to protect his feelings, but slow to act against racists. The double standards are extraordinary.\u201d * * * Trump escalates racial taunts \u2013 A crowd chanted \u201cSend her back! Send her back!\u201d about Ilhan Omar \u2013 the congresswoman who arrived in the US as a Somalian child refugee \u2013 in ugly scenes at one of the president\u2019s rallies last night. The House of Representatives earlier voted down an attempt to impeach the president, after a motion was brought forward blasting Trump for bringing \u201cdisgrace\u201d on the office with his racist remarks aimed at four congresswomen of colour. Democrats followed the lead of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who said multiple investigations into the president, his associates and their activities should be allowed to play out. * * * Sun holiday shame \u2013 British tourists\u2019 responsibility for foul beaches, overcrowding, traffic, aeroplane emissions and other environmental impacts will come under parliamentary scrutiny.

Each of these communities contained something less tangible \u2013 neighbourhoods like these are ecosystems. They incubate communities and cultures that do not and could not exist elsewhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/20/end-of-an-era-seoul-prepares-to-rip-out-its-manufacturing-heart\">'I'm panicking': Seoul prepares to rip out its manufacturing heart</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sometimes, as in these 10 that follow, a neighbourhood lives in the memory of the displaced and their descendants, as powerful in death as in life.</p> <h2>Josefov, Prague</h2> <p>In 1914, the author Gustav Meyrink wrote a vivid depiction of 16th-century life in Prague\u2019s Jewish quarter, Josefov. His novel Der Golem describes an oppressive labyrinth of ancient, looming houses in which \u201csomething malicious seemed to permeate the very bricks\u201d.</p> <p>That was pretty close to the perspective of Prague\u2019s city government at the end of the 19th century. By then, Josefov\u2019s medieval streets had become a dense, diverse hub of poor Czechs, immigrants and artisans whose trades had been devastated by factory manufacturing. City authorities, inspired by Georges-Eug\u00e8ne, Baron Haussmann\u2019s recent \u201crenovation\u201d of Paris, saw it as a blight. In December 1896, the Finis Ghetto urban-renewal scheme kicked off with a literal bang, as 45 houses were destroyed by dynamite. With the exception of few religious sites, the entire neighbourhood was destroyed.</p> <p>The razing faced little opposition from Prague\u2019s Jewish residents, many of whom returned after redevelopment \u2013 fuelling resentment among the displaced, and contributing to the antisemitic atmosphere that prevailed in the years before the first world war.</p> <h2>Mecca Flats, Chicago</h2> <p>A neighbourhood within a building, Mecca Flats was built for Chicago\u2019s 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition and by 1910 was home to artists, musicians, white-collar workers and labourers, mostly black, many arrivals in the great migration. The building was one of America\u2019s first luxury apartment houses, oriented around a central atrium that brought the street life of the neighbourhood indoors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"445a65c211d1b53f399a45f1ec94a9e6c106224f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/445a65c211d1b53f399a45f1ec94a9e6c106224f/0_37_1579_1973/800.jpg\" alt=\"The shattered doorway of the Mecca building, 1951\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The shattered doorway of the Mecca building, 1951.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wallace Kirkland/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the great depression, it housed more than 1,000 people. The poet Gwendolyn Brooks worked in the building as a peddler in the 1930s, and immortalised it in her 1968 epic poem, In the Mecca, conceiving of it as a cross-section of black American life: \u201cTo touch every note in the life of this block-long block-wide building, would be to capsulize the gist of black humanity in general.\u201d</p> <p>The Mecca was acquired by the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1941; tenants, activists and preservationists rallied to save it, but it was replaced with the school\u2019s Crown Hall \u2013 a bright slice of modernism, designed in direct opposition to the perceived darkness and decrepitude of the Mecca.</p> <h2>St John\u2019s Ward, Toronto</h2> <p>St John\u2019s Ward was an aberration in uptight, homogenous 20th-century Toronto. A diverse polyglot with a population density approaching that of contemporary central Hong Kong, it was a prototypical arrival city, with Irish, Italian, Jewish, African, Chinese and others establishing their first Canadian beachheads. A 1922 dispatch in the city\u2019s Globe newspaper reported: \u201cChinese restaurants are filled with negro customers, many of them women, while here and there an occasional white girl can be seen partaking of a meal with either a brown or yellow skinned partner.\u201d Sanitation and overcrowding were the ostensible targets of the reformers who sought to eradicate the Ward, but that nascent multiculturalism was probably as much a target.</p> <p>Redevelopment began in 1946 and continued for decades; today, the district is an imposing institutional corridor separating the city\u2019s downtown from the fine-grained neighbourhoods to the west \u2013 a few of which, especially Kensington Market and Chinatown, still bear traces of the old Ward.</p> <h2>Black Bottom, Detroit</h2> <p>Born in Alabama, Coleman Young\u2019s family moved to Detroit\u2019s Black Bottom in 1923. The future mayor found himself at five years old amid a community of Jewish, Greek, Italian and Irish residents \u2013 and a burgeoning black population arriving, as his family did, from the south. (Boxers Joe Louis and Sugar Ray Robinson, both southerners by birth, lived a few doors from one another here in the 1930s.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d34b975e5356b437871b3c71086af44b0dd9c528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d34b975e5356b437871b3c71086af44b0dd9c528/0_92_1502_901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hastings Street used to be the main thoroughfare in the Detroit neighbourhood of Black Bottom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hastings Street used to be the main thoroughfare in the Detroit neighbourhood of Black Bottom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Detroit Historical Society</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Young was politicised as a teenager, listening to union workers talk leftist politics in a local barbershop. He found entertainment along the neighbourhood\u2019s commercial spine, Hastings Street, where John Lee Hooker, Della Reese and others found their musical footing in small clubs.</p> <p>As with other renewal projects nationally, the funds to raze the community were in part provided by the federal Housing Act of 1949, which extended broad powers of expropriation to cities. By 1956 much of Hastings Street had been destroyed and replaced by the Chrysler Freeway. Bisected, what remained of the community quickly fell into decline.</p> <p>Late in life, Young would remember the neighbourhood as \u201ca thrilling convergence of people, a wonderfully versatile and self-contained society\u201d.</p> <h2>West 99th Street, New York City</h2> <p>Philip Payton Jr is sometimes referred to as the \u201cfather of Harlem\u201d for his work buying properties in Upper Manhattan and renting them to black tenants. In 1905, he began to do the same on West 99th and 98th streets, purchasing several blocks of buildings between Central Park West and Amsterdam Avenue.</p> <p>A Harlem-in-miniature took root here, and half a decade later, it was a tight-knit community that included the composer Will Marion Cook, opera singer Abbie Mitchell, activist James Weldon Johnson, historian Arturo Schomburg and singer Billie Holiday. In 1951, empowered as Detroit was by 1949\u2019s Housing Act, the city declared the district a slum and evicted residents. More than 500 buildings were demolished, replaced by a luxury housing project called Park West Village.</p> <p>The community became one of the lesser known victims of US slum clearance, though no less mourned by its former residents. \u201cThere\u2019s a space in my life that\u2019s missing right now because of that move,\u201d former resident Jim Torain told a documentary film crew in 2008.</p> <h2>Chavez Ravine, Los Angeles</h2> <p>In 1844, Los Angeles councilman and rancher Julian Chavez petitioned for 83 acres (33.5 hectares) of land in what was than a semi-rural district near today\u2019s Echo Park. He got it, and over the following decades three neighbourhood, Palo Verde, La Loma and Bishop, developed in the verdant hills north of the city. The mostly Mexican-American residents practised subsistence agriculture and raised livestock, ran their own schools, and lived a semi-agrarian lifestyle \u2013 in the shadow of one of the nation\u2019s ascendant boomtowns.</p> <p>By the 1940s, urban renewal made the community a target for redevelopment. Residents\u2019 homes were expropriated, and while they were promised relocation to new public housing, those plans fell apart after Norris Poulson, who believed public housing to be a communist plot, won 1953\u2019s Los Angeles mayoral race.</p> <p>A handful of stragglers waged the years-long Battle of Chavez Ravine against city authorities, but by 1959 the community was destroyed. In 1962, Dodger Stadium was erected on the site.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"39beb71b237c185b8442db3664bb82a3fa8c3140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39beb71b237c185b8442db3664bb82a3fa8c3140/107_142_3853_2312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Norris Poulson (right) and Bob Hunter (left) survey Chavez Ravine in 1957\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norris Poulson (right) and Bob Hunter (left) survey Chavez Ravine in 1957.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: University of Southern California/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Sophiatown, Johannesburg</h2> <p>Sophiatown was the Victorian-era brainchild of a real estate investor who in 1897 bought 237 acres of land near Johannesburg, laid out a few tidy streets, and named them after his children and wife.

      "bodyText": "The wave of urban renewal that swept the world in the 20th century gave us inner-city highways, modernist downtown malls and high-rise housing projects. It destroyed countless fine-grained, human-scaled neighbourhoods. We lost more than just physical buildings. Each of these communities contained something less tangible \u2013 neighbourhoods like these are ecosystems. They incubate communities and cultures that do not and could not exist elsewhere. Sometimes, as in these 10 that follow, a neighbourhood lives in the memory of the displaced and their descendants, as powerful in death as in life. Josefov, Prague In 1914, the author Gustav Meyrink wrote a vivid depiction of 16th-century life in Prague\u2019s Jewish quarter, Josefov. His novel Der Golem describes an oppressive labyrinth of ancient, looming houses in which \u201csomething malicious seemed to permeate the very bricks\u201d. That was pretty close to the perspective of Prague\u2019s city government at the end of the 19th century. By then, Josefov\u2019s medieval streets had become a dense, diverse hub of poor Czechs, immigrants and artisans whose trades had been devastated by factory manufacturing. City authorities, inspired by Georges-Eug\u00e8ne, Baron Haussmann\u2019s recent \u201crenovation\u201d of Paris, saw it as a blight. In December 1896, the Finis Ghetto urban-renewal scheme kicked off with a literal bang, as 45 houses were destroyed by dynamite. With the exception of few religious sites, the entire neighbourhood was destroyed. The razing faced little opposition from Prague\u2019s Jewish residents, many of whom returned after redevelopment \u2013 fuelling resentment among the displaced, and contributing to the antisemitic atmosphere that prevailed in the years before the first world war. Mecca Flats, Chicago A neighbourhood within a building, Mecca Flats was built for Chicago\u2019s 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition and by 1910 was home to artists, musicians, white-collar workers and labourers, mostly black, many arrivals in the great migration. The building was one of America\u2019s first luxury apartment houses, oriented around a central atrium that brought the street life of the neighbourhood indoors. By the great depression, it housed more than 1,000 people. The poet Gwendolyn Brooks worked in the building as a peddler in the 1930s, and immortalised it in her 1968 epic poem, In the Mecca, conceiving of it as a cross-section of black American life: \u201cTo touch every note in the life of this block-long block-wide building, would be to capsulize the gist of black humanity in general.\u201d The Mecca was acquired by the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1941; tenants, activists and preservationists rallied to save it, but it was replaced with the school\u2019s Crown Hall \u2013 a bright slice of modernism, designed in direct opposition to the perceived darkness and decrepitude of the Mecca. St John\u2019s Ward, Toronto St John\u2019s Ward was an aberration in uptight, homogenous 20th-century Toronto. A diverse polyglot with a population density approaching that of contemporary central Hong Kong, it was a prototypical arrival city, with Irish, Italian, Jewish, African, Chinese and others establishing their first Canadian beachheads. A 1922 dispatch in the city\u2019s Globe newspaper reported: \u201cChinese restaurants are filled with negro customers, many of them women, while here and there an occasional white girl can be seen partaking of a meal with either a brown or yellow skinned partner.\u201d Sanitation and overcrowding were the ostensible targets of the reformers who sought to eradicate the Ward, but that nascent multiculturalism was probably as much a target. Redevelopment began in 1946 and continued for decades; today, the district is an imposing institutional corridor separating the city\u2019s downtown from the fine-grained neighbourhoods to the west \u2013 a few of which, especially Kensington Market and Chinatown, still bear traces of the old Ward. Black Bottom, Detroit Born in Alabama, Coleman Young\u2019s family moved to Detroit\u2019s Black Bottom in 1923. The future mayor found himself at five years old amid a community of Jewish, Greek, Italian and Irish residents \u2013 and a burgeoning black population arriving, as his family did, from the south. (Boxers Joe Louis and Sugar Ray Robinson, both southerners by birth, lived a few doors from one another here in the 1930s.) Young was politicised as a teenager, listening to union workers talk leftist politics in a local barbershop. He found entertainment along the neighbourhood\u2019s commercial spine, Hastings Street, where John Lee Hooker, Della Reese and others found their musical footing in small clubs. As with other renewal projects nationally, the funds to raze the community were in part provided by the federal Housing Act of 1949, which extended broad powers of expropriation to cities. By 1956 much of Hastings Street had been destroyed and replaced by the Chrysler Freeway. Bisected, what remained of the community quickly fell into decline. Late in life, Young would remember the neighbourhood as \u201ca thrilling convergence of people, a wonderfully versatile and self-contained society\u201d. West 99th Street, New York City Philip Payton Jr is sometimes referred to as the \u201cfather of Harlem\u201d for his work buying properties in Upper Manhattan and renting them to black tenants. In 1905, he began to do the same on West 99th and 98th streets, purchasing several blocks of buildings between Central Park West and Amsterdam Avenue. A Harlem-in-miniature took root here, and half a decade later, it was a tight-knit community that included the composer Will Marion Cook, opera singer Abbie Mitchell, activist James Weldon Johnson, historian Arturo Schomburg and singer Billie Holiday. In 1951, empowered as Detroit was by 1949\u2019s Housing Act, the city declared the district a slum and evicted residents. More than 500 buildings were demolished, replaced by a luxury housing project called Park West Village. The community became one of the lesser known victims of US slum clearance, though no less mourned by its former residents. \u201cThere\u2019s a space in my life that\u2019s missing right now because of that move,\u201d former resident Jim Torain told a documentary film crew in 2008. Chavez Ravine, Los Angeles In 1844, Los Angeles councilman and rancher Julian Chavez petitioned for 83 acres (33.5 hectares) of land in what was than a semi-rural district near today\u2019s Echo Park. He got it, and over the following decades three neighbourhood, Palo Verde, La Loma and Bishop, developed in the verdant hills north of the city. The mostly Mexican-American residents practised subsistence agriculture and raised livestock, ran their own schools, and lived a semi-agrarian lifestyle \u2013 in the shadow of one of the nation\u2019s ascendant boomtowns. By the 1940s, urban renewal made the community a target for redevelopment. Residents\u2019 homes were expropriated, and while they were promised relocation to new public housing, those plans fell apart after Norris Poulson, who believed public housing to be a communist plot, won 1953\u2019s Los Angeles mayoral race. A handful of stragglers waged the years-long Battle of Chavez Ravine against city authorities, but by 1959 the community was destroyed. In 1962, Dodger Stadium was erected on the site. Sophiatown, Johannesburg Sophiatown was the Victorian-era brainchild of a real estate investor who in 1897 bought 237 acres of land near Johannesburg, laid out a few tidy streets, and named them after his children and wife. After the city located a sewage disposal plant nearby, his white homebuyers fled, and black residents found an opportunity denied them elsewhere: property ownership. By the 1950s, Sophiatown was the \u201cChicago of South Africa\u201d, filled with shebeens (speakeasies), incubating musicians and artists. It was a focal point of activity for the African National Congress and a young Nelson Mandela, and a hub of anti-apartheid activism.

Sophiatown had the black people \u2013 meaning Coloured, Indians, Blacks of all tribes \u2013 and the whites living together.\u201d In 1955, its residents were mostly relocated to the township of Soweto, out of the city. The community was bulldozed, reconstructed as a district of tidy bungalows, and renamed, in Afrikaans, Triomf, eventually reverting in 2006 to its original name. Downtown/North End, Halifax The de facto capital of Canada\u2019s eastern provinces, Halifax is proof that urban renewal often exacted as great a toll on small cities as on large ones. In 1969, local planners were aiming to replicate the slum clearance policies of bigger metropolises, and devised a scheme to raze the city\u2019s historic waterfront for an expressway to the suburbs. Protests halted the expressway, but not a massive downtown interchange that wiped out almost 15 blocks and 400 buildings in the city centre. It displaced thousands of mostly poor residents, and severed the city\u2019s working-class North End from its downtown, exacerbating its decline. Many of the displaced were African-Nova Scotian, descendants of some of Canada\u2019s oldest black communities.

      "body": "<p>Amazon\u2019s cheapest, most basic Kindle now has a light and a better screen, which makes it very nearly the new default ebook reader. The new Kindle 9 \u2013 which is, confusingly, one of the new 10th generation of Kindles alongside the fourth-generation Paperwhite and third-generation Oasis \u2013 looks very similar to the previous version.</p> <p>The sides of the reader feel as though they have been softened slightly. It has been made 2mm narrower and 0.4mm thinner but 13g heavier than the previous version. The Kindle 9 is easy to hold for extended periods and feels fairly robust.</p> <p>The contrast of the 6in e-ink screen has been improved, with the text displayed on a whiter background. It has the same density at 167 pixels per inch (ppi) as its predecessor, which makes it noticeably less crisp than the 300ppi Paperwhite, but perfectly easy to read even with fairly small font.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98aff9e7f7b5b006120344362ce996227ac644bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98aff9e7f7b5b006120344362ce996227ac644bf/355_269_4208_2526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Kindle 2019 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The frontlight augments the reading experience, whitening the screen so as dusk doesn\u2019t slow you down.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The big new addition for the Kindle 9 is an adjustable frontlight \u2013 the same technology that until recently was the differentiating factor of the more expensive Paperwhite.

      "bodyText": "Amazon\u2019s cheapest, most basic Kindle now has a light and a better screen, which makes it very nearly the new default ebook reader. The new Kindle 9 \u2013 which is, confusingly, one of the new 10th generation of Kindles alongside the fourth-generation Paperwhite and third-generation Oasis \u2013 looks very similar to the previous version. The sides of the reader feel as though they have been softened slightly. It has been made 2mm narrower and 0.4mm thinner but 13g heavier than the previous version. The Kindle 9 is easy to hold for extended periods and feels fairly robust. The contrast of the 6in e-ink screen has been improved, with the text displayed on a whiter background. It has the same density at 167 pixels per inch (ppi) as its predecessor, which makes it noticeably less crisp than the 300ppi Paperwhite, but perfectly easy to read even with fairly small font. The big new addition for the Kindle 9 is an adjustable frontlight \u2013 the same technology that until recently was the differentiating factor of the more expensive Paperwhite. Now you can read the basic Kindle in the dark. It has fewer LEDs down the side, but works just as well, going from completely off to maximum brightness in 24 increments. There\u2019s no automatic brightness adjustment, as one might be used to on a phone, but adjusting the frontlight manually via the quick settings menu is trivial. The Kindle also has an improved touchscreen, making accidental swipes and page turns slightly less likely. It\u2019s still not as good as dedicated page-turn buttons, but works fine even for one-handed reading.

A new marked-as-read feature makes keeping track of your library a little easier, as does the ability to create collections of books. Observations The textured plastic back is fairly easy to mark, but hides those marks relatively well. It\u2019s still hard to list books by the author\u2019s order, such as Ian Rankin\u2019s numerous Rebus detective novels by chronology, as you might on a bookshelf. A single button on the bottom turns the screen on and off, but you can set a pin to protect it. The Kindle 9 is not water-resistant, and there\u2019s a seam around the sides of the device in which dust can get stuck. Price The Kindle 9 comes in either black or white with 4GB of storage for \u00a369.99 with ads or \u00a379.99 without. For comparison, the 2018 Kindle Paperwhite costs \u00a3120 with 8GB and the Kindle Oasis \u00a3230 with 8GB, while Kobo\u2019s Aura 2 costs \u00a3100.

      "body": "<p>One of the most famous victims \u2013 and a rare survivor \u2013 of Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s war on drugs is a 30-year-old pedicab driver named Francisco Santiago Jr. In September 2016, while cycling through central Manila, Santiago was abducted by a Philippine national police (PNP) officer posing as a passenger. Santiago\u2019s name was not on the \u201ckill list\u201d of the PNP\u2019s now-infamous drug-sting operation known as <em>Oplan Tokhang</em>, or \u201cOperation Knock and Plead\u201d, but he had become a target, nonetheless.</p> <p>After he was taken to a police station and beaten for the better part of a day, Santiago was led back into the streets and shot multiple times, suffering wounds to his chest and arms. Thinking him dead, one officer approached Santiago and placed a pistol next to his hand. Santiago waited, barely breathing as blood pooled around him, until he heard the hurried sounds of journalists arriving at the scene. He sat up, pleading for his life and waving his blood-soaked arms in surrender. By the next morning, local newspapers had already assigned Santiago a new name: Lazarus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--thumbnail\" data-alt=\"Pulitzer credit\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;meta content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt; &lt;link href=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/gia/fonts/v1/fonts.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; &lt;style&gt;  .wrapper{  padding: 0;  position: relative;  border-top: 1px solid #dcdcdc;}  h1{  font-family: &quot;Guardian Text Sans Web&quot;,&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,&quot;Lucida Grande&quot;,sans-serif;  font-weight: 900;  color: #121212; }  .boxout-primary-content{  padding-top: 3px;  margin-top: 6px;  margin-bottom: 24px;  font-family: &quot;Guardian Text Sans Web&quot;,&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,&quot;Lucida Grande&quot;,sans-serif;  color: #121212;  font-size: 12px;  line-height: 1.3; }  a {  color: #ad0006;  border-bottom: 1px solid #dcdcd; }  a:hover {  border-bottom-color: #ad0006; }  .logo {  max-width: 175px;  width: 100%;  margin-top: 12px; }  &lt;/style&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;boxout-primary-content&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;This piece was produced with support from the &lt;a href='https://pulitzercenter.org/about-us/'target=&quot;_parent&quot;&gt;Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>When the officers saw that Santiago was not dead, he was sent to an emergency room and handcuffed to his hospital bed. He spent the following two years in jail on myriad charges, including the illegal possession of a firearm. Last August, when he was finally acquitted, he found sanctuary with a missionary in the Redemptorist order of the Catholic church named Jun Santiago, known to most as Brother Jun.</p> <p>Just as Jun has done for countless families of drug-war victims, he began sheltering Santiago \u2013 at Baclaran church, his parish in southern Manila, and various safe houses in the provinces surrounding the capital \u2013 offering protection and guidance to a man who had fallen into a precarious position. When Santiago appeared in a Manila courtroom last October, facing trial again for the illegal possession of a firearm (a charge refiled well after the sting), Jun was with him, a buffer against the PNP officers stalking the hallways outside the court, some of them the very same men who had tried to kill him two years earlier.</p> <p>Occupying a vague space between activist, journalist and minister, Jun is the ragged tip of the spear in the Catholic church\u2019s resistance to the war on drugs \u2013 a war that has been condemned by international human rights organisations and has, by some estimates, claimed more than 20,000 lives. As a brother of the Redemptorist order, Jun is not technically clergy. He lives among the priests on the forested grounds of Baclaran, but operates as a layman, and often stands out from the company he keeps. His black hair hangs down to his shoulders. His uniform comprises a pair of rustic boots, cuffed jeans and, on that day at the Manila trial court, a Nirvana T-shirt.</p> <p>Jun has taken it upon himself to perform a dizzyingly varied set of roles: from menial tasks, such as supplying candles for protest marches, to diplomatic work, such as appealing to eminent prelates for solidarity, to more dangerous missions such as patrolling Manila\u2019s streets at night and racing to crime scenes in order to photograph the dead \u2013 hundreds over the past three years. In a political climate where many fear the impulses of a violent president, Jun lives at risk on behalf of his church and thousands of Filipinos threatened by Duterte\u2019s war on drugs. Not yet 50, Jun\u2019s friends joke that he is already on the path to sainthood.</p> <p>In the Philippines, where four in five citizens identify as Catholic, the church has emerged as the most prominent voice of dissent against the drug war. The church is also under perpetual assault from a president intent on contesting the very essence of Philippine Catholicism. Having framed his 2015 election campaign as a referendum on the legitimacy of the church, Duterte has forced religious leaders to choose between coveted political capital and their moral mandates. In particular, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, the country\u2019s most influential church authority, has been criticised by activists and clerics alike for his deferential approach to Duterte. Such a stance, they argue, seems blind to the country\u2019s suffering and risks degrading the moral integrity of the church. Meanwhile, Jun and a small crop of the church opposition have reoriented their lives around a mission to document the drug war while helping to seek accountability for those carrying it out.</p> <p>In a country where vigilante executions have become commonplace, this work is perilous at best; Catholic leaders who speak out are often inundated with death threats, sometimes from Duterte himself. Since December, 2017, three Filipino priests have been killed in mysterious circumstances. One was ambushed in his car after negotiating the release of a political prisoner; another, while saying blessings on a group of children, was shot dead by a motorcyclist; a third was murdered at the altar in front of parishioners just before mass.</p> <p>When I asked Jun whether he was concerned for his own safety, he shook his head and drew a circle around his chair, as if tracing an invisible ring of fire.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of our job,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy be afraid?\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>There are three basic ways to die in Duterte\u2019s war on drugs. \u201cRiding in tandem\u201d has been the dominant mode in Manila: drive-by operations conducted on motorcycle, with balaclava-clad assassins \u2013 believed in some cases to be the PNP\u2019s hired guns. Other executions take place through so-called \u201clegitimate police operations\u201d carried out by large taskforces, whether for a group or just a single target. Other victims simply disappear.</p> <p>The logic of the drug war is cold and transparent. Manila\u2019s slums have become killing fields, and police impunity compounds the horrors of extrajudicial killings. Fishermen have reportedly dumped bodies into Manila Bay at the orders of PNP officers. Women have been extorted for sex in exchange for the safety of male family members. Bodies have turned up on curbs and corners after dark, their heads wrapped in packing tape to disguise evidence of torture, cardboard messages draped around their necks: \u201c<em>Pusher Ako</em>\u201d (\u201cI\u2019m a pusher\u201d).</p> <p>Such theatrical touches are common in the drug war\u2019s crime scenes, which often show signs of staging. The website Rappler, the Philippines\u2019s opposition-news outlet, has noted how ziplock bags of shabu (the methamphetamine at the heart of the country\u2019s drug crackdown) turn up in the pockets of victims so frequently and conveniently as to suggest they had been planted. Nearly as often, a handgun \u2013 typically a rusted .38 calibre \u2013 rests beside the body, or in the victim\u2019s hand. In some cases, and ominously, ambulances have arrived at a target\u2019s home ahead of the police, portending the violence to come.</p> <p>And yet for all the carnage, and as alarming as these tactics seem, Duterte remains broadly popular. Before October of last year, the president\u2019s approval ratings had hovered around 80%; after a slump at the beginning of 2019, they rebounded by spring. And this May, the Philippines\u2019 midterm elections gave an unmistakable vote of confidence to Duterte: allies of the president claimed each of the 12 senate seats up for grabs. Among the new senate members is Ronald dela Rosa, the PNP chief who presided over the drug war in its first two years. Such a sweeping victory should allow Duterte to consolidate power in the second half of his presidency, and many fear that it clears the path for him to push through several ambitious policy goals, namely the reinstitution of a legal death penalty and the rewriting of the constitution to prolong his own power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b50a5c85925e2b68d86dfb8ed16eaeec05d9508f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b50a5c85925e2b68d86dfb8ed16eaeec05d9508f/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The body of a suspected drug dealer lies in a Manila street, the victim of a vigilante-style execution.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The body of a suspected drug dealer lies in a Manila street, the victim of a vigilante-style execution.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It may also lead to a resurgence in the drug killings. In June, the drug war claimed its youngest victim, a three-year-old girl named Myca Ulpina, who was killed in a sting targeting her father. \u201cWe are living in an imperfect world,\u201d the new senator Dela Rosa said of the young girl\u2019s death. \u201cShit happens during operations.\u201d</p> <p>Caloocan bishop Pablo \u201cAmbo\u201d David, a rare dissenter among the Philippines\u2019s bishop class, has expressed alarm that Duterte has already succeeded in corrupting \u201ceven a basic sense of good and bad\u201d in the minds of so many Catholics \u201cin making it so easy for people to accept that these people deserve to die because they\u2019re drug suspects\u201d.</p> <p>Recently, Ambo\u2019s public dissent prompted a counter from Duterte: the president accused the bishop of stealing from the offering plate and dealing in drugs himself. Duterte threatened to personally \u201cdecapitate\u201d Ambo, who was then deluged with death threats from other sources. Through such direct attacks, Duterte has chipped away at a veneration of the church half a millennium in the making. Priests themselves no longer know their standing in the culture. As Father Albert Alejo, a member of the Catholic resistance, put it to me, the crisis of the drug war transcends the death toll. \u201cIn the end, they are not just killing bodies,\u201d he said, \u201cthey are killing our logic and they are killing our moral foundations.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When Duterte launched his presidential campaign in November 2015, he was a little-known mayor with a reputation for violence in the southern capital of Davao, where residents referred to him as the \u201cdeath squad mayor\u201d. Six months later, his was the most famous face in the country, due mainly to a campaign that promised fantastical reforms to a frustrated and alienated electorate. \u201cHe promised them the moon and the stars,\u201d one Catholic activist told me, with pledges to clear Manila traffic \u2013 some of the worst in the world \u2013 in just 100 days, to weed out government and corporate corruption, and to scrub the country of crime and poverty through an unforgiving war on drugs.</p> <p>Along with these bold promises, Duterte built his campaign on violent and blasphemous rhetoric that gave voters in an overwhelmingly Catholic country every possible reason to abandon him. His public appearances were marked by vulgarities and open threats, and rather than court the country\u2019s religious leaders to take political advantage of their traditional popularity, he instead waged a relentless crusade against the Catholic church, wielding its record of sexual abuse as moral leverage, going so far as to curse Pope Francis after his 2015 visit to Manila, complaining about the nightmarish traffic caused by the pope\u2019s mass. \u201c<em>Putang ina</em>,\u201d Duterte sneered. \u201cSon of a whore, go home. Do not visit us again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"74a9ed8da3e663bbb24e22a992ad89acd01d96b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74a9ed8da3e663bbb24e22a992ad89acd01d96b3/0_43_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Rodrigo Duterte in Manila earlier this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Rodrigo Duterte in Manila earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rolex dela Pe\u00f1a/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These attacks should have landed discordantly with Filipino voters, for whom Catholicism is entwined with national identity. Here, Christian scripture is as inescapable as the sun and sea; prayer beads hang from countless rearview mirrors; neon crosses cap city skylines. In the crowded networks of Manila\u2019s vendor stalls \u2013 between sneakers and mangos and glass-bottled colas \u2013 passersby can pick up all kinds of Catholic trinkets: glossy plastic piet\u00e0 statues, Crayola-coloured votive candles, floral and beaded rosaries, medallions stamped with the faces of saints. In the capital\u2019s alleyways, chapels materialise out of stone and sheet metal, nearly indistinguishable from the neighbouring shanties, where homemade shrines glow in the windows.</p> <p>Yet the same country that is adorned in the ornaments of faith also remains broadly supportive of a misogynistic and murderous demagogue. \u201cWe will be celebrating very soon 500 years of Christianity,\u201d said Father Flavie Villanueva, an anti-drug-war activist, alluding to Spain\u2019s arrival in the Philippines \u2013 and with it, Catholicism \u2013 in 1521. \u201cBut look at who voted for Duterte, and the people still supporting Duterte. There are still so many Catholics on that side.\u201d</p> <p>As antagonistic as his rhetoric was during the campaign, Duterte\u2019s hostility toward the church has only intensified during his presidency. As if testing the limits of his own blasphemy, Duterte has aimed each curse at a Catholic dogma more sacred than the last. Addressing Filipinos during a 2016 speech in Laos, he predicted a future in which the Catholic church would be irrelevant and beckoned his countrymen into an \u201c<em>iglesia ni Duterte</em>\u201d (a \u201cchurch of Duterte\u201d). On All Saints\u2019 day last year, he mocked Catholic saints as hypocrites and loons, and proposed himself as a proper object of worship: \u201cSanto Rodrigo\u201d. Last October, he aimed even higher than the pope, calling God himself a \u201cson of a whore\u201d and asking: \u201cWho is this stupid God?\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Duterte\u2019s ascent has resurrected a dilemma for the Philippines\u2019s Catholic leadership that mirrors an identity crisis the church has faced throughout its history: what is its responsibility under an immoral regime? Cardinal Tagle rarely speaks publicly about the war on drugs, and when he does it is through broad condemnations of a \u201cculture of death\u201d \u2013 vague phrasing that encompasses abortion as well as the drug war. His position is further muddied by the fact that he has been photographed in genial meetings with Duterte, whom he has yet to condemn by name. \u201cGood luck trying to find him,\u201d one church activist said of Tagle. \u201cHe hates having reporters corner him with questions about the extrajudicial killings.\u201d (Cardinal Tagle did not respond to multiple requests to be interviewed for this story.)</p> <p>This dance has frustrated secular human-rights organisations who look to the church to take the lead on any number of urgent issues. \u201cThey were very slow. They were silent,\u201d Phelim Kine, deputy director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia division, said of the church\u2019s response to Duterte\u2019s drug war. Carlos Conde, the lone Human Rights Watch representative based in the Philippines, expressed similar frustrations. He believes that the church is \u201cthe only institution that is left standing that can confront Duterte \u2026 It is just a cop-out to say that the church is not political. Of course the church is political.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"41c22eccb12b78f0d872819b2150587150fb504b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41c22eccb12b78f0d872819b2150587150fb504b/0_0_4000_2662/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Residents react near a crime scene where three alleged drug dealers were killed after a drug raid in a shanty community in Manila.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Residents react near a crime scene where three alleged drug dealers were killed after a drug raid in a shanty community in Manila.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noel Celis/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recent history supports Conde\u2019s argument. The Philippine priesthood backed the country\u2019s successful revolutions of 1986 and 2001, and opposed a failed counterrevolution later that same year. The first and most famous of these was the People Power Revolution, which deposed the dictator Ferdinand Marcos and brought an end to more than a decade of martial law. The church was instrumental in orchestrating the revolt. The legacy of those revolutions hangs heavy over the modern-day Philippine church, a radically different organisation than it was then. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anything to do with politics right now,\u201d Villanueva told me, describing a church that has shied away from the expectations established by those past revolts.</p> <p>Undoubtedly, the Catholic leadership has played a more cautious hand with Duterte than some of its strident parish priests have. But, as Guadalupe Tu\u00f1\u00f3n, an Academy Scholar at Harvard University\u2019s Weatherhead Center for International Affairs who specialises in the intersection of religion and politics, points out, these shadow games may only reveal part of the story. \u201cWhatever they are saying on the record is potentially less important than what they are allowing in their dioceses,\u201d says Tu\u00f1\u00f3n. Tagle himself may be quiet, but any dissidence in his archdiocese comes by his tacit permission. It is noteworthy, then, that one of the country\u2019s handful of vocal bishops is the cardinal\u2019s direct subordinate, Broderick Pabillo, the auxiliary bishop of Manila.</p> <p>Pabillo defends the cardinal\u2019s approach, arguing that \u201cthere are different ways how you can respond\u201d to accomplish the same ends. Nonetheless, there is a dissonance between Tagle\u2019s silent approach and Pabillo\u2019s wider view of how the church should be tackling this issue. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have done enough,\u201d Pabillo told me. \u201cAmong the clergy and among the lay people, only a few are speaking out.\u201d</p> <p>When I asked him what would happen if the church led the kind of widespread protest that he was advocating, he said, without qualification: \u201cIt would stop the killings.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>At Eusebio funeral services in northern Manila, Brother Jun sat with Orly Fernandez, the operations manager, in the open doorway of the building\u2019s garage, waiting for news. Jun spends many of his nights at Eusebio, one of the PNP\u2019s \u201caccredited\u201d funeral homes, whose business has boomed during the drug war. When there is a killing, the police call an accredited funeral home to retrieve the body. When Fernandez gets a call, he often tips off Jun, who speeds ahead of the hearse in order to photograph the scene before the body is removed.</p> <p>For nearly three years, Jun has dedicated his after-dark hours to this ritual, which is part of his work with the nightcrawlers, a group of Filipino journalists who cover the graveyard shift, waiting for calls about drug-war killings. At the height of the war, three to five killings a night were routine. On one night in the summer of 2017, as part of what the PNP called a \u201cOne Time, Big Time\u201d operation, 32 people were killed in less than 24 hours. Jun sees documenting this violence \u2013 through photography and the collection of police reports \u2013 as crucial to the anti-drug-war effort. The work of the nightcrawlers has helped to draw international attention to the atrocities of the war on drugs, and they provide a support network for the families of victims. Still, Jun is unusually situated between photographer and missionary, and this allows him advantages over his peers in both worlds. For one thing, victims\u2019 families are often more inclined to talk with a representative of the church than the media; and as an activist brother, rather than a priest, Jun has some agility within the church\u2019s rigid structure.</p> <p>It was a quiet night at Eusebio. Jun mentioned going to a province north of Manila where many of the killings were concentrated. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to the provinces,\u201d Fernandez told him. \u201cThere are enough killings here.\u201d Fernandez estimated that, the week before, he had recovered 10 bodies in northern Manila. While the group loitered on the curb outside the garage, Fernandez retrieved three printouts from inside and laid them out on his bench. The word \u201cmissing\u201d was printed in large letters across the top of each, with pictures of three faces below. This had become the norm: with declining media coverage and wilier evasions by the police, the dead tended to disappear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6f6f5440dff7497084d0e80ff986eb5a75e61855\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f6f5440dff7497084d0e80ff986eb5a75e61855/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Newly promoted police officers in formation during a ceremony police HQ in Taguig city, south of Manila.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newly promoted police officers in formation during a ceremony police HQ in Taguig city, south of Manila.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francis R Malasig/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After passing a few monotonous hours smoking cigarettes and eating ramen from a nearby 7-Eleven, the handful of journalists on shift followed Jun to a nearby wake. As rigorous reporting on killings has declined, wakes have become one of Jun\u2019s primary venues for gathering information, both to secure police reports and to hear the families\u2019 versions of events. Jun stopped the car outside a one-room shack. Inside, they found a woman sleeping across two folding chairs in front of an open casket. It was late, approaching 1am, but children, extended family members and friends of the departed were still there, playing cards outside. Philippine wakes can go on for a week or longer, and gambling is a common way to pass the time, with the winnings going toward the vigil costs.</p> <p>Jun fell into friendly conversation with the sister and mother of the victim and soon won their trust. Within minutes, they were laughing at his jokes, and after a short conversation they handed him the PNP papers from the killing. The report stated that a teenage girl had reported a shooting in Navotas a few nights before. An unidentified gunman shot the victim, Victor dela Cruz, twice; once in the shoulder and once in the arm. On Dela Cruz\u2019s body, the report added, police recovered a \u201cheat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance believe [sic] to be \u2018shabu\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Jun pocketed the papers and went home for the night.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Not long after our night at Eusebio, I was standing with Jun outside another funeral home, this time in Cebu City, the largest city in the Philippines\u2019s Visayas region. Late last summer, as the intensity of the drug war subsided in Manila, drug-related killings spiked in Cebu. A small congress of Catholic activists had travelled here to meet with J\u00f3se Palma, the archbishop of Cebu.</p> <p>The arrival of the drug war in Cebu marred one of the Philippines\u2019s most picturesque islands, and also one of the most important in the country\u2019s Christian tradition. Cebu is known as the the cradle of Catholicism in the Philippines. The island\u2019s surge in drug-related killings had followed the transfer of three notorious senior PNP officers to Cebu. \u201cFollow the police officers,\u201d Jun told me when we first met, explaining that you could pretty accurately predict where the next rash of killings would break out by tracking where certain PNP officers and units were transferred.</p> <p>In the end, the activists who had travelled to Cebu to see the archbishop came away disappointed. Although he had been outspoken about the war on drugs, Palma mostly fell back on platitudes \u2013 \u201cKilling is not the answer\u201d and \u201cWe have God\u201d \u2013 and seemed to take the PNP\u2019s official statements regarding the killings at face value. At the end of the meeting, each member of the group appealed to Palma with their own suggestions for the church\u2019s response. Jun directly implored the bishop to examine the situation with greater scepticism. \u201cThe pattern they were using in Manila, they just brought it here,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s so blatant.\u201d</p> <p>Palma nodded agreeably, then mentioned a local clerical coalition that he hoped could \u201cbe a factor in digging up many of these things\u201d. He turned down an invitation from another activist to speak at an upcoming protest due to his schedule. Soon we wrapped up the meeting. Palma would fly to Rome the next day.</p> <p>Outside of the archbishop\u2019s palace, Jun was frustrated that Palma hadn\u2019t seemed to grasp the farce of PNP operations \u2013 their cruelty, their gravity and the formula. But for all of his discontent with the church\u2019s staid response, Jun knows he cannot hold the rest of the hierarchy to the same standard he holds himself. \u201cThis is their territory. This is their responsibility. You have to respect the other parishes,\u201d he sighed. One bishop cannot weigh in on the concerns of another bishop\u2019s diocese without express permission from the second bishop. The same goes for priests and their parishes. Protests are scattered throughout the establishment instead of being unified behind the will of a common God. The complex structure of the Catholic church chafes against its own activism.</p> <p>Jun\u2019s very presence in Cebu was a kind of subversion of the hierarchy: far beyond the limits of his own parish, he was educating an archbishop on the atrocities of his archdiocese. Still, Jun insisted he came to Cebu not out of the obligations of a religious missionary, but out of a duty to his country: \u201cI am here as a journalist and as a Filipino. Personally, my vocation is not bounded by my religious affiliation.\u201d</p> <p>On our last evening in Cebu, Jun drove the party up into the mountains behind the city, to the site of a recent massacre. A few hours before sunrise on the night of the \u201cOne Time, Big Time\u201d operation in Cebu, seven people were abducted and taken to an abandoned farmer\u2019s road to be killed. When we reached the site, a brick path overlooking the valley below, Jun pantomimed the executions, pacing and gesticulating across the vista to describe how five people were murdered and how two escaped. He looked out beyond the ravine, where a small wooden cross still memorialised the massacre. \u201cI am a Filipino. First things first,\u201d he told me later. \u201cThe religious identity is just an offshoot of being a Filipino.\u201d</p> <p>We drove back into the valley to a Redemptorist retreat house on the outskirts of town where, the next day, Jun would give a presentation to Catholic leaders on the atrocities he had witnessed. He wanted to prepare, so, finding a seat in a quiet corner, he pulled up a slideshow on his computer. Photographs of the drug war\u2019s dead faded in and out on the screen. With each new image, Jun recited a place and a name. Down the hall, muffled smalltalk mixed with the hum of cicadas in the trees. Night had long since fallen, the stars winking like tea lights behind the incoming clouds.</p> <p><em>A longer version of this article first appeared in the <a href=\"https://www.vqronline.org/reporting-articles/2019/06/church-vs-state\" title=\"\">Virginia Quarterly Review</a></em></p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the most famous victims \u2013 and a rare survivor \u2013 of Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s war on drugs is a 30-year-old pedicab driver named Francisco Santiago Jr. In September 2016, while cycling through central Manila, Santiago was abducted by a Philippine national police (PNP) officer posing as a passenger. Santiago\u2019s name was not on the \u201ckill list\u201d of the PNP\u2019s now-infamous drug-sting operation known as Oplan Tokhang, or \u201cOperation Knock and Plead\u201d, but he had become a target, nonetheless. After he was taken to a police station and beaten for the better part of a day, Santiago was led back into the streets and shot multiple times, suffering wounds to his chest and arms. Thinking him dead, one officer approached Santiago and placed a pistol next to his hand. Santiago waited, barely breathing as blood pooled around him, until he heard the hurried sounds of journalists arriving at the scene. He sat up, pleading for his life and waving his blood-soaked arms in surrender. By the next morning, local newspapers had already assigned Santiago a new name: Lazarus. When the officers saw that Santiago was not dead, he was sent to an emergency room and handcuffed to his hospital bed. He spent the following two years in jail on myriad charges, including the illegal possession of a firearm. Last August, when he was finally acquitted, he found sanctuary with a missionary in the Redemptorist order of the Catholic church named Jun Santiago, known to most as Brother Jun. Just as Jun has done for countless families of drug-war victims, he began sheltering Santiago \u2013 at Baclaran church, his parish in southern Manila, and various safe houses in the provinces surrounding the capital \u2013 offering protection and guidance to a man who had fallen into a precarious position. When Santiago appeared in a Manila courtroom last October, facing trial again for the illegal possession of a firearm (a charge refiled well after the sting), Jun was with him, a buffer against the PNP officers stalking the hallways outside the court, some of them the very same men who had tried to kill him two years earlier. Occupying a vague space between activist, journalist and minister, Jun is the ragged tip of the spear in the Catholic church\u2019s resistance to the war on drugs \u2013 a war that has been condemned by international human rights organisations and has, by some estimates, claimed more than 20,000 lives. As a brother of the Redemptorist order, Jun is not technically clergy. He lives among the priests on the forested grounds of Baclaran, but operates as a layman, and often stands out from the company he keeps. His black hair hangs down to his shoulders. His uniform comprises a pair of rustic boots, cuffed jeans and, on that day at the Manila trial court, a Nirvana T-shirt. Jun has taken it upon himself to perform a dizzyingly varied set of roles: from menial tasks, such as supplying candles for protest marches, to diplomatic work, such as appealing to eminent prelates for solidarity, to more dangerous missions such as patrolling Manila\u2019s streets at night and racing to crime scenes in order to photograph the dead \u2013 hundreds over the past three years. In a political climate where many fear the impulses of a violent president, Jun lives at risk on behalf of his church and thousands of Filipinos threatened by Duterte\u2019s war on drugs. Not yet 50, Jun\u2019s friends joke that he is already on the path to sainthood. In the Philippines, where four in five citizens identify as Catholic, the church has emerged as the most prominent voice of dissent against the drug war. The church is also under perpetual assault from a president intent on contesting the very essence of Philippine Catholicism. Having framed his 2015 election campaign as a referendum on the legitimacy of the church, Duterte has forced religious leaders to choose between coveted political capital and their moral mandates. In particular, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, the country\u2019s most influential church authority, has been criticised by activists and clerics alike for his deferential approach to Duterte. Such a stance, they argue, seems blind to the country\u2019s suffering and risks degrading the moral integrity of the church. Meanwhile, Jun and a small crop of the church opposition have reoriented their lives around a mission to document the drug war while helping to seek accountability for those carrying it out. In a country where vigilante executions have become commonplace, this work is perilous at best; Catholic leaders who speak out are often inundated with death threats, sometimes from Duterte himself. Since December, 2017, three Filipino priests have been killed in mysterious circumstances. One was ambushed in his car after negotiating the release of a political prisoner; another, while saying blessings on a group of children, was shot dead by a motorcyclist; a third was murdered at the altar in front of parishioners just before mass. When I asked Jun whether he was concerned for his own safety, he shook his head and drew a circle around his chair, as if tracing an invisible ring of fire. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our job,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy be afraid?\u201d * * * There are three basic ways to die in Duterte\u2019s war on drugs. \u201cRiding in tandem\u201d has been the dominant mode in Manila: drive-by operations conducted on motorcycle, with balaclava-clad assassins \u2013 believed in some cases to be the PNP\u2019s hired guns. Other executions take place through so-called \u201clegitimate police operations\u201d carried out by large taskforces, whether for a group or just a single target. Other victims simply disappear. The logic of the drug war is cold and transparent. Manila\u2019s slums have become killing fields, and police impunity compounds the horrors of extrajudicial killings. Fishermen have reportedly dumped bodies into Manila Bay at the orders of PNP officers. Women have been extorted for sex in exchange for the safety of male family members. Bodies have turned up on curbs and corners after dark, their heads wrapped in packing tape to disguise evidence of torture, cardboard messages draped around their necks: \u201cPusher Ako\u201d (\u201cI\u2019m a pusher\u201d). Such theatrical touches are common in the drug war\u2019s crime scenes, which often show signs of staging. The website Rappler, the Philippines\u2019s opposition-news outlet, has noted how ziplock bags of shabu (the methamphetamine at the heart of the country\u2019s drug crackdown) turn up in the pockets of victims so frequently and conveniently as to suggest they had been planted. Nearly as often, a handgun \u2013 typically a rusted .38 calibre \u2013 rests beside the body, or in the victim\u2019s hand. In some cases, and ominously, ambulances have arrived at a target\u2019s home ahead of the police, portending the violence to come. And yet for all the carnage, and as alarming as these tactics seem, Duterte remains broadly popular. Before October of last year, the president\u2019s approval ratings had hovered around 80%; after a slump at the beginning of 2019, they rebounded by spring. And this May, the Philippines\u2019 midterm elections gave an unmistakable vote of confidence to Duterte: allies of the president claimed each of the 12 senate seats up for grabs. Among the new senate members is Ronald dela Rosa, the PNP chief who presided over the drug war in its first two years. Such a sweeping victory should allow Duterte to consolidate power in the second half of his presidency, and many fear that it clears the path for him to push through several ambitious policy goals, namely the reinstitution of a legal death penalty and the rewriting of the constitution to prolong his own power. It may also lead to a resurgence in the drug killings. In June, the drug war claimed its youngest victim, a three-year-old girl named Myca Ulpina, who was killed in a sting targeting her father. \u201cWe are living in an imperfect world,\u201d the new senator Dela Rosa said of the young girl\u2019s death. \u201cShit happens during operations.\u201d Caloocan bishop Pablo \u201cAmbo\u201d David, a rare dissenter among the Philippines\u2019s bishop class, has expressed alarm that Duterte has already succeeded in corrupting \u201ceven a basic sense of good and bad\u201d in the minds of so many Catholics \u201cin making it so easy for people to accept that these people deserve to die because they\u2019re drug suspects\u201d. Recently, Ambo\u2019s public dissent prompted a counter from Duterte: the president accused the bishop of stealing from the offering plate and dealing in drugs himself. Duterte threatened to personally \u201cdecapitate\u201d Ambo, who was then deluged with death threats from other sources. Through such direct attacks, Duterte has chipped away at a veneration of the church half a millennium in the making. Priests themselves no longer know their standing in the culture. As Father Albert Alejo, a member of the Catholic resistance, put it to me, the crisis of the drug war transcends the death toll. \u201cIn the end, they are not just killing bodies,\u201d he said, \u201cthey are killing our logic and they are killing our moral foundations.\u201d * * * When Duterte launched his presidential campaign in November 2015, he was a little-known mayor with a reputation for violence in the southern capital of Davao, where residents referred to him as the \u201cdeath squad mayor\u201d. Six months later, his was the most famous face in the country, due mainly to a campaign that promised fantastical reforms to a frustrated and alienated electorate. \u201cHe promised them the moon and the stars,\u201d one Catholic activist told me, with pledges to clear Manila traffic \u2013 some of the worst in the world \u2013 in just 100 days, to weed out government and corporate corruption, and to scrub the country of crime and poverty through an unforgiving war on drugs. Along with these bold promises, Duterte built his campaign on violent and blasphemous rhetoric that gave voters in an overwhelmingly Catholic country every possible reason to abandon him. His public appearances were marked by vulgarities and open threats, and rather than court the country\u2019s religious leaders to take political advantage of their traditional popularity, he instead waged a relentless crusade against the Catholic church, wielding its record of sexual abuse as moral leverage, going so far as to curse Pope Francis after his 2015 visit to Manila, complaining about the nightmarish traffic caused by the pope\u2019s mass. \u201cPutang ina,\u201d Duterte sneered. \u201cSon of a whore, go home. Do not visit us again.\u201d These attacks should have landed discordantly with Filipino voters, for whom Catholicism is entwined with national identity. Here, Christian scripture is as inescapable as the sun and sea; prayer beads hang from countless rearview mirrors; neon crosses cap city skylines. In the crowded networks of Manila\u2019s vendor stalls \u2013 between sneakers and mangos and glass-bottled colas \u2013 passersby can pick up all kinds of Catholic trinkets: glossy plastic piet\u00e0 statues, Crayola-coloured votive candles, floral and beaded rosaries, medallions stamped with the faces of saints. In the capital\u2019s alleyways, chapels materialise out of stone and sheet metal, nearly indistinguishable from the neighbouring shanties, where homemade shrines glow in the windows. Yet the same country that is adorned in the ornaments of faith also remains broadly supportive of a misogynistic and murderous demagogue. \u201cWe will be celebrating very soon 500 years of Christianity,\u201d said Father Flavie Villanueva, an anti-drug-war activist, alluding to Spain\u2019s arrival in the Philippines \u2013 and with it, Catholicism \u2013 in 1521. \u201cBut look at who voted for Duterte, and the people still supporting Duterte. There are still so many Catholics on that side.\u201d As antagonistic as his rhetoric was during the campaign, Duterte\u2019s hostility toward the church has only intensified during his presidency. As if testing the limits of his own blasphemy, Duterte has aimed each curse at a Catholic dogma more sacred than the last. Addressing Filipinos during a 2016 speech in Laos, he predicted a future in which the Catholic church would be irrelevant and beckoned his countrymen into an \u201ciglesia ni Duterte\u201d (a \u201cchurch of Duterte\u201d). On All Saints\u2019 day last year, he mocked Catholic saints as hypocrites and loons, and proposed himself as a proper object of worship: \u201cSanto Rodrigo\u201d. Last October, he aimed even higher than the pope, calling God himself a \u201cson of a whore\u201d and asking: \u201cWho is this stupid God?\u201d * * * Duterte\u2019s ascent has resurrected a dilemma for the Philippines\u2019s Catholic leadership that mirrors an identity crisis the church has faced throughout its history: what is its responsibility under an immoral regime? Cardinal Tagle rarely speaks publicly about the war on drugs, and when he does it is through broad condemnations of a \u201cculture of death\u201d \u2013 vague phrasing that encompasses abortion as well as the drug war. His position is further muddied by the fact that he has been photographed in genial meetings with Duterte, whom he has yet to condemn by name. \u201cGood luck trying to find him,\u201d one church activist said of Tagle. \u201cHe hates having reporters corner him with questions about the extrajudicial killings.\u201d (Cardinal Tagle did not respond to multiple requests to be interviewed for this story.) This dance has frustrated secular human-rights organisations who look to the church to take the lead on any number of urgent issues. \u201cThey were very slow. They were silent,\u201d Phelim Kine, deputy director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia division, said of the church\u2019s response to Duterte\u2019s drug war. Carlos Conde, the lone Human Rights Watch representative based in the Philippines, expressed similar frustrations. He believes that the church is \u201cthe only institution that is left standing that can confront Duterte \u2026 It is just a cop-out to say that the church is not political. Of course the church is political.\u201d Recent history supports Conde\u2019s argument. The Philippine priesthood backed the country\u2019s successful revolutions of 1986 and 2001, and opposed a failed counterrevolution later that same year. The first and most famous of these was the People Power Revolution, which deposed the dictator Ferdinand Marcos and brought an end to more than a decade of martial law. The church was instrumental in orchestrating the revolt. The legacy of those revolutions hangs heavy over the modern-day Philippine church, a radically different organisation than it was then. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anything to do with politics right now,\u201d Villanueva told me, describing a church that has shied away from the expectations established by those past revolts. Undoubtedly, the Catholic leadership has played a more cautious hand with Duterte than some of its strident parish priests have. But, as Guadalupe Tu\u00f1\u00f3n, an Academy Scholar at Harvard University\u2019s Weatherhead Center for International Affairs who specialises in the intersection of religion and politics, points out, these shadow games may only reveal part of the story. \u201cWhatever they are saying on the record is potentially less important than what they are allowing in their dioceses,\u201d says Tu\u00f1\u00f3n. Tagle himself may be quiet, but any dissidence in his archdiocese comes by his tacit permission. It is noteworthy, then, that one of the country\u2019s handful of vocal bishops is the cardinal\u2019s direct subordinate, Broderick Pabillo, the auxiliary bishop of Manila. Pabillo defends the cardinal\u2019s approach, arguing that \u201cthere are different ways how you can respond\u201d to accomplish the same ends. Nonetheless, there is a dissonance between Tagle\u2019s silent approach and Pabillo\u2019s wider view of how the church should be tackling this issue. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have done enough,\u201d Pabillo told me. \u201cAmong the clergy and among the lay people, only a few are speaking out.\u201d When I asked him what would happen if the church led the kind of widespread protest that he was advocating, he said, without qualification: \u201cIt would stop the killings.\u201d * * * At Eusebio funeral services in northern Manila, Brother Jun sat with Orly Fernandez, the operations manager, in the open doorway of the building\u2019s garage, waiting for news. Jun spends many of his nights at Eusebio, one of the PNP\u2019s \u201caccredited\u201d funeral homes, whose business has boomed during the drug war. When there is a killing, the police call an accredited funeral home to retrieve the body. When Fernandez gets a call, he often tips off Jun, who speeds ahead of the hearse in order to photograph the scene before the body is removed. For nearly three years, Jun has dedicated his after-dark hours to this ritual, which is part of his work with the nightcrawlers, a group of Filipino journalists who cover the graveyard shift, waiting for calls about drug-war killings. At the height of the war, three to five killings a night were routine. On one night in the summer of 2017, as part of what the PNP called a \u201cOne Time, Big Time\u201d operation, 32 people were killed in less than 24 hours. Jun sees documenting this violence \u2013 through photography and the collection of police reports \u2013 as crucial to the anti-drug-war effort. The work of the nightcrawlers has helped to draw international attention to the atrocities of the war on drugs, and they provide a support network for the families of victims. Still, Jun is unusually situated between photographer and missionary, and this allows him advantages over his peers in both worlds. For one thing, victims\u2019 families are often more inclined to talk with a representative of the church than the media; and as an activist brother, rather than a priest, Jun has some agility within the church\u2019s rigid structure. It was a quiet night at Eusebio. Jun mentioned going to a province north of Manila where many of the killings were concentrated. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to the provinces,\u201d Fernandez told him. \u201cThere are enough killings here.\u201d Fernandez estimated that, the week before, he had recovered 10 bodies in northern Manila. While the group loitered on the curb outside the garage, Fernandez retrieved three printouts from inside and laid them out on his bench. The word \u201cmissing\u201d was printed in large letters across the top of each, with pictures of three faces below. This had become the norm: with declining media coverage and wilier evasions by the police, the dead tended to disappear. After passing a few monotonous hours smoking cigarettes and eating ramen from a nearby 7-Eleven, the handful of journalists on shift followed Jun to a nearby wake. As rigorous reporting on killings has declined, wakes have become one of Jun\u2019s primary venues for gathering information, both to secure police reports and to hear the families\u2019 versions of events. Jun stopped the car outside a one-room shack. Inside, they found a woman sleeping across two folding chairs in front of an open casket. It was late, approaching 1am, but children, extended family members and friends of the departed were still there, playing cards outside. Philippine wakes can go on for a week or longer, and gambling is a common way to pass the time, with the winnings going toward the vigil costs. Jun fell into friendly conversation with the sister and mother of the victim and soon won their trust. Within minutes, they were laughing at his jokes, and after a short conversation they handed him the PNP papers from the killing. The report stated that a teenage girl had reported a shooting in Navotas a few nights before. An unidentified gunman shot the victim, Victor dela Cruz, twice; once in the shoulder and once in the arm. On Dela Cruz\u2019s body, the report added, police recovered a \u201cheat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance believe [sic] to be \u2018shabu\u2019.\u201d Jun pocketed the papers and went home for the night. * * * Not long after our night at Eusebio, I was standing with Jun outside another funeral home, this time in Cebu City, the largest city in the Philippines\u2019s Visayas region. Late last summer, as the intensity of the drug war subsided in Manila, drug-related killings spiked in Cebu. A small congress of Catholic activists had travelled here to meet with J\u00f3se Palma, the archbishop of Cebu. The arrival of the drug war in Cebu marred one of the Philippines\u2019s most picturesque islands, and also one of the most important in the country\u2019s Christian tradition. Cebu is known as the the cradle of Catholicism in the Philippines. The island\u2019s surge in drug-related killings had followed the transfer of three notorious senior PNP officers to Cebu. \u201cFollow the police officers,\u201d Jun told me when we first met, explaining that you could pretty accurately predict where the next rash of killings would break out by tracking where certain PNP officers and units were transferred. In the end, the activists who had travelled to Cebu to see the archbishop came away disappointed. Although he had been outspoken about the war on drugs, Palma mostly fell back on platitudes \u2013 \u201cKilling is not the answer\u201d and \u201cWe have God\u201d \u2013 and seemed to take the PNP\u2019s official statements regarding the killings at face value. At the end of the meeting, each member of the group appealed to Palma with their own suggestions for the church\u2019s response. Jun directly implored the bishop to examine the situation with greater scepticism. \u201cThe pattern they were using in Manila, they just brought it here,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s so blatant.\u201d Palma nodded agreeably, then mentioned a local clerical coalition that he hoped could \u201cbe a factor in digging up many of these things\u201d. He turned down an invitation from another activist to speak at an upcoming protest due to his schedule. Soon we wrapped up the meeting. Palma would fly to Rome the next day. Outside of the archbishop\u2019s palace, Jun was frustrated that Palma hadn\u2019t seemed to grasp the farce of PNP operations \u2013 their cruelty, their gravity and the formula. But for all of his discontent with the church\u2019s staid response, Jun knows he cannot hold the rest of the hierarchy to the same standard he holds himself. \u201cThis is their territory. This is their responsibility. You have to respect the other parishes,\u201d he sighed. One bishop cannot weigh in on the concerns of another bishop\u2019s diocese without express permission from the second bishop. The same goes for priests and their parishes. Protests are scattered throughout the establishment instead of being unified behind the will of a common God. The complex structure of the Catholic church chafes against its own activism. Jun\u2019s very presence in Cebu was a kind of subversion of the hierarchy: far beyond the limits of his own parish, he was educating an archbishop on the atrocities of his archdiocese. Still, Jun insisted he came to Cebu not out of the obligations of a religious missionary, but out of a duty to his country: \u201cI am here as a journalist and as a Filipino. Personally, my vocation is not bounded by my religious affiliation.\u201d On our last evening in Cebu, Jun drove the party up into the mountains behind the city, to the site of a recent massacre. A few hours before sunrise on the night of the \u201cOne Time, Big Time\u201d operation in Cebu, seven people were abducted and taken to an abandoned farmer\u2019s road to be killed. When we reached the site, a brick path overlooking the valley below, Jun pantomimed the executions, pacing and gesticulating across the vista to describe how five people were murdered and how two escaped. He looked out beyond the ravine, where a small wooden cross still memorialised the massacre. \u201cI am a Filipino. First things first,\u201d he told me later. \u201cThe religious identity is just an offshoot of being a Filipino.\u201d We drove back into the valley to a Redemptorist retreat house on the outskirts of town where, the next day, Jun would give a presentation to Catholic leaders on the atrocities he had witnessed. He wanted to prepare, so, finding a seat in a quiet corner, he pulled up a slideshow on his computer. Photographs of the drug war\u2019s dead faded in and out on the screen. With each new image, Jun recited a place and a name. Down the hall, muffled smalltalk mixed with the hum of cicadas in the trees. Night had long since fallen, the stars winking like tea lights behind the incoming clouds.

Weir\u2019s piece is a fairly lateral response to nature, inspired in part by the German Romantic idea of the enchanted wood and the fairytales it engendered. The piece, like much of her work, has a strong, multilayered intellectual underpinning. It is not a visceral response to threat, though audiences who have spent the past year participating in or reading about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/16/extinction-rebellion-activists-target-east-london-concrete-plant\">Extinction Rebellion</a> might interpret it as such.</p> <p>I suggest that if she wrote it today it would most likely be a concerto for orchestra and 12 buzzsaws. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it as a political piece,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I completely agree with you.

His award-winning orchestral piece <a href=\"https://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/jl-adams-become-ocean\">Become Ocean</a>, premiered in 2013, doesn\u2019t just represent the sea, or use it as a metaphor for human struggle in the way that composers of the past might have done. As the title makes clear, it seeks to become the ocean, to capture its power and movement in sound. Haydn is celebrating God in The Creation, while Beethoven is seeking to capture the interplay of nature and the creative spirit in his \u201cPastoral\u201d Symphony. But Adams is trying to encapsulate nature itself, in all its brutal energy, with mankind removed from the picture. It\u2019s nature as the protagonist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9865f3d8d2b8f1750c121b2e0869b746730c5ec8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9865f3d8d2b8f1750c121b2e0869b746730c5ec8/0_195_2917_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a whale breaching in Alaskan seas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brutal energy \u2026 a whale breaching in Alaskan seas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Betty Wiley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nature is not just the source of everything I do, it is the ultimate source of everything we human animals do</p> <footer> <cite>John Luther Adams</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMy work has always been deeply rooted in personal experience of wild places,\u201d Adams says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how it could be any other way.

      "bodyText": "The Proms have a slightly uneasy relationship with Big Themes. Former director Nicholas Kenyon used to love them \u2013 grand overarching narratives designed to hold the otherwise unwieldy two-month music festival together. But his successors have been more circumspect, recognising that Proms-goers for the most part attend single concerts rather than a group of performances linked to, say, death or sex \u2013 or this year\u2019s theme, nature, and our part in destroying it. That big theme, admits current Proms director David Pickard, stole up on him almost unawares. \u201cYou don\u2019t always start with a theme,\u201d he says. \u201cPieces come in and it emerges. You start to see a theme emerging from what people are wanting to write. That was what happened with this. None of these things should be forced.\u201d The two initial building blocks were In the Name of the Earth, John Luther Adams\u2019s large-scale choral work, which will receive its European premiere; and the Lost Words prom, which Pickard calls \u201ca family concert about something that matters very much to young people\u201d. The latter is based on writer Robert Macfarlane and illustrator Jackie Morris\u2019s glorious 2017 book of poems and paintings of the same name, celebrating nature and bemoaning the fact that children are losing the language that allows them to inhabit it. With those two concerts in place, Pickard started to think more generally about music\u2019s relationship with the natural world. \u201cWhen you ask someone to write about nature now,\u201d he says, \u201cthey are not necessarily writing about it in a romantic way, in the way Beethoven did. They\u2019re writing about the danger of loss.\u201d The season will offer a fascinating juxtaposition of old and new views of the natural world, of innocent celebration and present-day fear and anger. Haydn\u2019s Creation, Beethoven\u2019s \u201cPastoral\u201d Symphony, Sibelius\u2019s Fifth Symphony (with its finale inspired by the sight of 16 swans passing overhead), Richard Strauss\u2019s Alpine Symphony, Messiaen\u2019s From the Canyons to the Stars, and other canonical nature-inflected works will sit alongside contemporary or new pieces. These include Judith Weir\u2019s Forest, Stevie Wishart\u2019s The Last Dance?, Alexia Sloane\u2019s Earthward and Hans Zimmer\u2019s Earth. Zimmer\u2019s piece features in a prom marking the 50th anniversary of the moon landing \u2013 another theme this year \u2013 but because Zimmer has chosen to portray Earth as seen from the moon it becomes part of the underlying musical preoccupation with our precious planet. Master of the Queen\u2019s music Judith Weir\u2019s orchestral piece Forest dates from 1995. It has been programmed alongside Sibelius\u2019s Fifth Symphony in a concert on the same Sunday as In the Name of the Earth \u2013 a kind of de facto Nature Day. Weir\u2019s piece is a fairly lateral response to nature, inspired in part by the German Romantic idea of the enchanted wood and the fairytales it engendered. The piece, like much of her work, has a strong, multilayered intellectual underpinning. It is not a visceral response to threat, though audiences who have spent the past year participating in or reading about Extinction Rebellion might interpret it as such. I suggest that if she wrote it today it would most likely be a concerto for orchestra and 12 buzzsaws. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it as a political piece,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I completely agree with you. If I sat down to write a piece called Forest now, I couldn\u2019t not write about Brazil and all that stuff.\u201d She worries that the audience will come with expectations of picture-painting. \u201cThe piece which I call Forest may not sound anything like trees or nature. It\u2019s a busy, dense piece and you might not have that view of a forest at all.\u201d John Luther Adams, who has spent much of his life in Alaska being inspired by and defending its wilderness, has no such qualms.

The inquiry into the environmental cost of tourism and transport will consider whether the UK government should play a greater role in offsetting the waste and damage caused by the tens of millions of Britons who go on holiday overseas each year. It will also look at ways to reduce the negative consequences of the growing domestic tourism industry, including the hefty carbon footprint of aviation and cruise companies.

Among her many achievements, she went on to be the first western ballerina to perform with Moscow\u2019s Bolshoi Ballet in 1957 and became director of the London Festival Ballet (now <a href=\"https://www.ballet.org.uk/people/dame-beryl-grey-dbe/\">English National Ballet</a>) in 1968, rescuing the company from crisis.</p> <p>At 92, Grey is still involved in the ballet world, although she slowed down following an operation for bowel cancer in 2017. How is she now, I ask. \u201cOh, fine!\u201d she says breezily. This is the woman who once danced Swan Lake with a stomach bug, vomiting between acts. Ballet dancers are tough. She\u2019s frailer now, but still sharp, warm and always elegant, dressed in blouse and pearls. We sit in the conservatory of her Sussex home with photos on the wall, of her husband Sven (who died a decade ago) and backstage snaps of glamorous dance luminaries.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been very lucky,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lovely life. Dance meant everything to me. Dancing is a very personal expression of happiness.\u201d It must have been difficult to be dancing at the same time as Fonteyn, I say, when everyone else was in her shadow. \u201cAnd under her spell,\u201d interjects Grey. There was no resentment, she says, because they were as bewitched by her as anyone else. What was so compelling? \u201cI suppose her simple honesty. She was perfect for the company because she always did what she was told. She was very beautiful, but she was very kind and sweet and never big-headed.\u201d</p> <p>Grey mostly did what she was told, but she had her own mind, too, and left the Royal Ballet in 1957 to broaden her horizons. Performing at the Bolshoi was momentous. This was in the depths of the cold war, but Grey played her own small part in thawing relations. \u201cAfter my first performance, the British ambassador had a party and it was the first time any of the Bolshoi had been to the British embassy, so that was a good breakthrough.\u201d</p> <p>She loved performing there. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful when you go on stage to be surrounded by everyone so totally \u2018in\u2019 what they\u2019re doing.

Zimmerli embraced the building\u2019s reputation of being haunted by spirits of the past (Zimmerli says multiple people have seen a woman looking out from one of the hotel\u2019s windows, even when it was empty) and outfitted each of the four rooms with a different spine-tingling theme to rouse the morbid corners of guest\u2019s imaginations.</p> <p>The Black Monarch isn\u2019t unique in Victor in that sense. Strange sounds, moving objects and the appearance of translucent miners or bordello sex workers are said to haunt the entire miniature town.</p> <p>Victor looks as it did in its heyday of the early 20th century, when it was the fifth-largest city in the state and was pumping out billions of dollars of gold (adjusted for inflation) out of the 500 mines that surrounded it.

      "bodyText": "An enormous growling wolf is the first of many horrors to greet visitors entering the Black Monarch Hotel in Victor, Colorado. Located in this once-abandoned mountain town, the Black Monarch hotel offers an over-the-top immersive art experience for those who fetishize nightmares and is the latest addition to a thriving haunted hotel industry that has become big business in Colorado. Adam Zimmerli, the hotel\u2019s owner and renovator, purchased the former brothel and saloon last year, amazed at how perfectly preserved it was from its 1899 construction. Zimmerli embraced the building\u2019s reputation of being haunted by spirits of the past (Zimmerli says multiple people have seen a woman looking out from one of the hotel\u2019s windows, even when it was empty) and outfitted each of the four rooms with a different spine-tingling theme to rouse the morbid corners of guest\u2019s imaginations. The Black Monarch isn\u2019t unique in Victor in that sense. Strange sounds, moving objects and the appearance of translucent miners or bordello sex workers are said to haunt the entire miniature town. Victor looks as it did in its heyday of the early 20th century, when it was the fifth-largest city in the state and was pumping out billions of dollars of gold (adjusted for inflation) out of the 500 mines that surrounded it. The town went from a booming economy with a population of 18,000 to nearly a ghost town by the 1990s, and it has a bloody past. When miners attempted to organize, the corporations that owned the mines were ruthless in their union-busting techniques. \u201cThey hired gangsters to commit countless murders, train derailments, set fires, purposely collapse mines with people inside them,\u201d says Zimmerli. At the time, the Black Monarch was known simply as the Monarch, an upscale gentlemen\u2019s club, where many of the millionaires who committed these atrocities probably gambled and drank before venturing upstairs to the bordello. During the renovation, Zimmerli has maintained much of the design of a gold rush saloon (tall ceilings, tin-plated walls) but added a gothic tone in the form of black walls and ceilings, countless stuffed animals, skulls and vast libraries of books with titles like Carnal Crimes, Diseases of Children and The History of the Devil. The HH Holmes room, named for the World\u2019s Fair serial killer who murdered tourists while they slept in his hotel, is decorated with several human anatomy posters, antique medical equipment and instruments of torture like pitchforks, scythes and axes on the wall. The room bearing the name of Elizabeth B\u00e1thory, the 17th-century Hungarian countess who is said to have bathed in the blood of her victims, is adorned with crimson walls, a bat encased in red velvet and ominous portraits of B\u00e1thory (including a sculpture of her in a red bath surrounded by heads on spikes) watching you while you sleep in a four-poster bed with black, sheer curtains. The witchcraft room features pentagrams, goat skulls and an enormous bed suspended from the ceiling on thick ropes. In the nearby Nikola Tesla room (named for the pioneering and wildly eccentric electrical science genius) a series of elk skulls with enormous antlers are mounted above the bed next to oversized drawings of the Tesla coil, angry swirls of electricity mirroring the reaching antlers in a menacing way. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people get so scared here they leave only a few hours after checking in,\u201d the caretaker Jennings Davis says in a thick Mississippi accent. Many of Victor\u2019s current residents don\u2019t feel terrorized by the town\u2019s spooky appearances. \u201cWe live with it every day, and aren\u2019t frightened by it,\u201d said Sue Kochevar, the co-owner of Victor\u2019s only restaurant, the Fortune Club Diner. Located across the street from the Black Monarch, Kochevar says she often hears the sounds of footsteps in her empty building late at night, or objects falling randomly from shelves and locked bedrooms ransacked from the inside. \u201cWe get a lot of paranormal investigators here,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd they say there\u2019s a lot of residual energy here from the gold rush days.\u201d In fact, many residents are welcoming the travelers motivated by rumors of hauntings. Colorado\u2019s haunted hotel industry boomed in no small part due to its role in the renowned horror novel and film The Shining. Stephen King got the idea for The Shining at Colorado\u2019s Stanley Hotel, and the place has managed to become one of the most popular destinations among paranormal tourists, particularly during its annual horror film festival. Room 217 \u2013 the one King was checked into during his lightbulb moment, and later used in the book \u2013 is the most frequently requested room, because of rumors of it being haunted. Forty years later, rumors of hauntings have become a selling point, not a deterrent, for travelers across the US. When filming for The Shining took place at the Timberline Lodge in Oregon, in 1979, the hotel\u2019s management were so concerned about a PR crisis they requested that room 217 of the book be changed to 237 in Kubrick\u2019s film, because they actually did have a room 217 and were afraid guests would think it was haunted. These days, the Timberline often gets requests from visitors who want to stay in the hotel where The Shining was filmed, some of them specifically for rooms 217 and 237. In 1912, six children and two adults were murdered inside a small farmhouse in Villisca, Iowa, deterring potential renters or buyers of the property for years until a series of YouTube videos suggesting the house was haunted circulated among the ghost-hunting community. The owner was suddenly inundated with requests to stay the night. Despite having no running water or electricity, guests will now pay $428 a night to sleep in what is now advertised as \u201cThe Villisca Axe Murder House\u201d. In 2014, one such guest of the house was found alone in a bedroom with a self-inflicted stab wound at 12.45am \u2013 the approximate time the axe murderer had struck more than a century earlier. Stories like this are irresistible fodder to ghost hunters aiming to legitimize their profession. But for those looking for a more synthetic kind of terror with no real danger attached to it \u2013 similar to riding a rollercoaster or eating a habanero pepper \u2013 the vague, harmless glimpses of the supernatural experienced in Victor, Colorado, (whether real or imagined) are a bit more appealing. Every hour of the weekend I spent in the Black Monarch hotel was punctuated with countless moments of adrenalized terror, believing I\u2019d seen, heard or felt the presence of some gold rush apparition. I was primed for this at every turn, considering the lore and decor of the hotel, but it was a lot of fun. \u201cThe people who come here love to be scared,\u201d says Kochevar. \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine. But for us that live here in Victor, we like it for its authenticity, and the history of the town.

The local court judge, Greg Borchers, who was sanctioned for inappropriate comments in 2017, also openly pondered whether \u201csome important anthropological literature\u201d would one day help explain \u201cIndigenous laissez-faire parenting\u201d and \u201cwhy it is that people abandon their children on such a regular basis\u201d. Borchers was removed from the Alice Springs youth court in 2017 following a series of \u201cgratuitous and unnecessary\u201d remarks to juveniles. His conduct prompted a complaint from the Central Australian Aboriginal legal aid service, and an investigation by the chief judge of the Darwin local court, John Lowndes, found Borchers had brought the judiciary into disrepute. Borchers was allowed to continue to sit in other NT courts. Guardian Australia has learned that Borchers has continued to make controversial comments since his removal from the Alice Springs court. In April, Borchers was dealing with an Indigenous woman for breaching a domestic violence order requiring her not to drink in the presence of another named person. In sentencing the woman, Borchers said: \u201cYesterday probably was pension day, so you got your money from the government, abandoned your kids in that great Indigenous fashion of abrogating your parental responsibility to another member of your family, and went off and got drunk.\u201d Five months earlier, Borchers was in Katherine sentencing an Indigenous woman for assault.

A government spokesman said it would be inappropriate for ministers to comment on the actions of judges, but noted: \u201cWork is underway to create a Judicial Complaints Commission, with legislation expected to be introduced into the Legislative Assembly later in the year.\u201d Following the last complaint against Borchers, the Criminal Lawyers Association of the Northern Territory president, Marty Aust, called on fellow lawyers not to target individuals, including judges, and do more to recognise the difficult work facing members of the profession. \u201cDemonising individuals whether in the media or a courtroom cannot be a productive solution,\u201d Aust told Lawyers Weekly. \u201cThe collegiality of the legal profession is one of its greatest attributes and a proud tradition we all enjoy as officers of the court. CLANT considers the matter now finalised.\u201d The last complaint against Borchers was investigated by Lowndes over a number of months in 2017. Lowndes found the judge had displayed a lack of \u201cjudicial temperament\u201d. \u201cI have formed the view that in a number of matters the judge has not demonstrated the courtesy, tolerance, patience and sensitivity which, in accordance with the AIJA Guide to Judicial Conduct, should necessarily characterise the discharge of the judicial function,\u201d Lowndes said in findings delivered in December 2017. \u201cThe judge has been found to have engaged in inappropriate judicial conduct, which is unacceptable. \u201cIt detracts from the proper performance in the matter at hand, specifically, and it reflects poorly on the courts generally and brings the judiciary into disrepute.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Labor leader Anthony Albanese has urged the Morrison government to avoid \u201cplaying politics\u201d with drought funding, saying Labor would support \u201cany level\u201d of funding the Coalition names, as long as it doesn\u2019t come at the expense of another portfolio. The government\u2019s $5bn \u201cfuture drought fund\u201d was knocked back in the last parliament, after Labor announced it would not support any moves to take funds from the Building Australia Fund to pay for it. At a drought forum in Dubbo, Scott Morrison said one of the first priorities for the government when parliament resumes next week would be to reintroduce, and pass the bill. \u201cThat drought fund needs to pass the parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Labor doesn\u2019t support it, then, we will work with the crossbench as we did on income tax cuts, where they were opposed leading up to that vote, and we ensured they were able to be passed,\u201d he said. Labor, under leader Bill Shorten, had previously labelled the money pool, designed to keep drought-stricken communities afloat while waiting on the rain, a \u201cslush fund\u201d which robbed communities of other vital funding. Albanese, speaking at the same forum, said Labor was prepared to support \u201cany level of cash that the government believes should be injected into communities\u201d, but not at the expense of other areas. \u201cOur concern with the legislation that was introduced last time was that it took money from the Building Australia Fund, that is an essential component of Infrastructure Australia and the idea that we would depoliticise infrastructure funding in this country in order to fund drought funding,\u201d he said. \u201cI say to the government, don\u2019t play politics with this. It is too important. Just stop it. Provide the funding, with appropriations, as you should. And we\u2019ll back it. Any level you want, done. It can go through in an hour.\u201d The statement was greeted with applause. Morrison also plans on moving forward with plans to make it an offence, punishable by up to 12 months imprisonment, for anyone who encourages or promotes trespassing on farms, or private land, either online or through publications. \u201cThere will be legislation to deal with ensuring that cowardly keyboard warriors who incite criminal behaviour of people invading farms, that they will be classed as criminals as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect support on that.\u201d Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick told Sky News on Thursday his party would be voting for the additional trespass penalties. Fellow crossbench senator and One Nation leader Pauline Hanson is also in favour of the move, giving the government the support it needs to pass the bill even if Labor opposes it. Labor will hold a shadow cabinet meeting on Monday where it will finalise its positions on the coming legislation. The latest Bureau of Meteorology drought update showed \u201csignificant decline\u201d in autumn and winter rainfall, with much of south-eastern and south-western Australia experiencing the lowest rainfall in the past 20 years. Rainfall for the next three months is predicted to follow that trend, with the BoM anticipating a drier than average quarter for most of the nation.",

      "bodyText": "Australian outlaw motorcycle gangs have expanded into south-east Asia to take advantage of a booming, multibillion-dollar methamphetamine export market in the region, a landmark report from the United Nations has warned. Where once China and Hong Kong were the dominant suppliers for illicit methamphetamines into Australia, a new report by the UN office of drugs and crime released on Thursday detailed the new \u201cglobal reach\u201d of drug exports originating in south-east Asia. The most detailed look yet into the drug market in the region, the report explains how criminal networks in the region use lightly regulated free-trade zones, lax border control, money laundering through casinos and corruption to traffic \u201cunfathomable quantities\u201d of \u201chigh-profit methamphetamine\u201d into neighbouring countries including Australia. Based on information gathered from intelligence agencies, the UN estimates that the interconnected illicit methamphetamine market in south-east Asia, east Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Bangladesh is now worth between US$30.3bn and US$61.4bn annually. The market in Australia and New Zealand represents about US$11.1bn of that, partly because of the \u201cdisproportionately\u201d high wholesale and retail prices for the drug in those countries. And, according to the UN, criminal networks in Australia have moved in to get a slice of the booming market. While major criminal syndicates from Macau, China, Hong Kong and Thailand have become \u201cdominant players\u201d in the production and trafficking of methamphetamine and other synthetic drugs from south-east Asia, more recently outlaw motorcycle gangs from Australia and New Zealand have \u201csought to gain a foothold in the region\u201d. Citing evidence from intelligence agencies, the report details how outlaw motorcycle gangs have expanded their presence into the region, partly because of the increased law enforcement attention on them in Australia. The report says motorcycle gangs are now involved in drug trafficking, extortion and money laundering in the region, using the example of the arrest in Australia of three men associated with an outlaw motorcycle gang with 119kg of crystal methamphetamine trafficked from Malaysia and seized in Melbourne in April 2017. \u201cIt is expected that OMCGs may expand their involvement in the methamphetamine trade from south-east Asia to Australia, considering the low price per kilogram, and increased quantities of methamphetamine manufactured and available in the region,\u201d the report states. While demand for methamphetamine is rising, the global demand for heroin appears to be falling. But Australia remains a target market for criminal networks in south-east Asia. For example, authorities in Malaysia report that \u201cincreasing quantities\u201d of the drug are being trafficked through its ports, \u201cin particular to Australia\u201d. \u201cForensic analysis and profiling of heroin seized at the border of Australia and investigated by the Australian federal police indicate that the heroin market in the country has been predominantly supplied by heroin originating from south-east Asia, accounting for nearly all of the heroin detected in the country in the past couple of years,\u201d the report states. \u201cHeroin trafficked from Myanmar to Australia usually transits through one or more countries before arriving in Australia, and large quantities of the drug have been trafficked through countries in Southeast Asia. \u201cFor instance, Malaysia was reported as the top embarkation and transit point, accounting for 53% of all heroin seized in the country in 2017. Lao PDR, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam have also been reported as major embarkation points for heroin seized in Australia in recent years.\u201d The UN report focuses not just on the production and trafficking of illicit drugs in the region but also wildlife and timber trafficking, human trafficking and migrant smuggling, as well as counterfeit goods and fraudulent medicines. While some illicit trade crosses borders clandestinely along jungle tracks or unofficial seaports, most illegal commodities are transported along the same infrastructure as legitimate trade. A \u201cdramatic expansion of some of these illicit flows in recent years\u201d has been assisted by free-trade agreements aimed at boosting trade and economic growth in the region, the report states, while commercial banks, securities companies, real estate agencies and casinos are used for money laundering. One method of concealment used by transnational crime and trafficking groups operating in the Shan State \u2013 the main production hub for crystal methamphetamine in Myanmar \u2013 is through tea packages. \u201cBased on extensive case information reported by countries in the region, seizures of crystalline methamphetamine concealed in a particular tea packaging have been found throughout the Mekong and in most other parts of south-east Asia, as well as in Australia,\u201d the report states. \u201cThe majority of major crystalline methamphetamine seizures in recent years have involved this method, with the number of seizures involving tea packages increasing in line with the growth of crystalline methamphetamine production in Myanmar.\u201d Casinos, in particular, are used as money laundering ventures. As of January 2019, there were 230 licensed casinos in south-east Asia. Of those, 150 were in Cambodia \u2013 compared with only 57 in 2014. Many of the casinos emerged after a crackdown on money laundering activities in Macau in 2014, the report notes, raising concerns that a \u201cdisplacement\u201d of criminal activities associated with casinos has taken place. \u201cCambodia in particular has witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of casinos and casino licenses granted since 2014,\u201d the report states. \u201cIn addition, there are increasing reports of casinos in Lao PDR, Myanmar, and the Philippines with proven links or alleged links to organised crime and money laundering. \u201cIn the Mekong region, many casinos are located in areas characterised by poor governance and political instability, or in border regions with significant crime or armed insurgency problems, and they operate illegally or quasi-legally.\u201d The report comes as Pacific nations struggle with an influx of drug trafficking from the US and Latin America towards Australia.

      "bodyText": "Indonesia\u2019s national airline has come under fire for banning the taking of in-flight images after a popular video blogger posted a photo online showing a handwritten menu he was handed in business class. The travel v-logger Rius Vernandes was also reported to police after the post, which led to the airline Garuda Indonesia being widely mocked online. The photo was uploaded with the caption: \u201cThe menu is still being printed sir.\u201d The post originated on a flight from Sydney to Denpasar on Saturday, and came a week after the airline was ridiculed for serving in-flight meals in business class from the Japanese fast food chain HokBen. Rius and his partner, who was travelling with him, have since been reported to police and could face defamation charges under Indonesia\u2019s strict electronic transactions law. In a video posted on YouTube the day after, entitled \u201cWhat really happened, behind Garuda\u2019s business class handwritten menu\u201d, Rius defended himself, saying he did not intend to harm the airline\u2019s reputation, and often reviewed the services of other airlines as well. On Wednesday afternoon he posted another picture on his Instagram of two brown envelopes from the police, calling him for questioning. In the accompanying post he appealed for support, especially from \u201cfellow influencers\u201d. \u201cI hope you can help share and support me through this problem because I don\u2019t want to see that, in the future, whenever we review something as is, whenever we give constructive criticism, we can be criminalised,\u201d he wrote. Garuda announced it was banning passengers and flight crew from taking in-flight photos and videos, according to an internal memo circulated on 14 July. But by Tuesday the airline had backtracked, after more public backlash. The policy, said Garuda\u2019s corporate secretary, Ikhsan Rosan, had \u201cnot yet been finalised, and should not have been shared to the public\u201d. \u201cPeople can still take pictures [on board our flights] for their own use,\u201d he said, \u201cas long as they don\u2019t disturb the other passengers\u201d. Indonesia\u2019s electronic transactions law refers to any material posted online and has been increasingly used in the past two years to prosecute opposition figures and government critics. Last month a court in Surabaya sentenced well-known musician and opposition supporter, Ahmad Dhani, to one year in jail for calling his rivals \u201cidiots\u201d in his vlog, while this month another opposition figure and playwright, was sentenced to two years behind bars for lying about bruises on her face - pictures of which went viral online - injuries she said were the result of being beaten up, when instead she had undergone cosmetic surgery. Critics says the use of the law is becoming increasingly problematic and in some cases has resulted in victims, rather than perpetrators facing jail time. One case that has stirred national attention is that of Baiq Nuril, who was prosecuted under the ITE law after she recorded a lewd phone call from her boss, audio of which was later distributed online. The woman, from Lombok, was sentenced to six months in jail while her boss, a principal at a local school, was not prosecuted. After exhausting all avenues of appeal, this week she applied for amnesty from the president.",

      "bodyText": "Taking inspiration from losing inspiration is almost its own songwriting genre. A few years back, the Guardian compiled a list of procrastination songs with the help of readers, but it neglected Australia\u2019s back catalogue of apathy and self-doubt, not limited to Courtney Barnett\u2019s Need a Little Time, Missy Higgins\u2019 Everyone\u2019s Waiting, Alex Lahey\u2019s I Haven\u2019t Been Taking Care of Myself, and Teeth and Tongue\u2019s Give Up On Your Health. Angie McMahon can relate. The Melbourne-based singer-songwriter first made headlines in 2013 after winning a Telstra competition to support Bon Jovi, but having done the shows, she halted the momentum to evaluate the quality of her material and start again from scratch. Pressure. It\u2019s the uneasy bedfellow of perfectionism. And McMahon finds herself thinking about pressure a lot \u2013 its effect on her, and its effect on others. \u201cIn the paper the other day I was reading about growing rates of depression in children and how looking after mental health has to become part of the school curriculum. I was like, \u2018Yes!\u2019\u201d she tells Guardian Australia. Sitting in a Melbourne bar, she cups her face and doesn\u2019t so much lean on the table as slump cooperatively towards the recorder. \u201cWithout getting too personal, I\u2019ve heard of two men I knew, who were really successful, and who were loved, who died from their depression. You just can\u2019t imagine how different it might have been if they had known a culture from birth where you get to talk about that. It makes me so sad there\u2019s that attitude of having to be closed off.

So, I apologize for what I\u2019ve done but again, I need to move forward and continue on the work we\u2019re doing for Puerto Rico.\u201d The affair only adds to sustained criticism of Rossell\u00f3\u2019s leadership as sweeping austerity and privatization measures imposed after Hurricane Maria decimated the island almost two years ago drew public backlash. Puerto Rico, an unincorporated US territory, is in the midst of a multibillion-dollar debt crisis now managed by an unelected oversight board appointed in Washington that oversees much of the island\u2019s economic affairs. Shortly before the text message scandal, referred to as \u201cRickyLeaks\u201d, a number of administration officials and contractors, including the former education secretary Julia Keleher, were arrested by the FBI over allegations of corruption and misappropriation of $15.5m in federal funds apportioned to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. Key figures in the movement to oust Rossell\u00f3 remained hopeful that the protests on Wednesday would remain peaceful. A number of high-profile Puerto Ricans, including the actor and playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda, singer Ricky Martin and trap artist Benito Mart\u00ednez Ocasio, known by his stage name Bad Bunny, have also lent vocal support to the protests. Martin and Ocasio are expected to appear at the protests. San Juan\u2019s firebrand mayor, Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, an outspoken critic of Rossell\u00f3, told the Guardian by text message the demonstrations would mark \u201ca historic day in Puerto Rico\u201d. Cruz, who announced she would challenge Rossell\u00f3 in elections next year, became the face of resistance to the Trump administration\u2019s faltering efforts to assist during the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Both Mayor Cruz and Ricky Martin also appeared as targets of abuse in the leaked text messages. According to the messages, Rossell\u00f3 referred to Cruz as \u201coff her meds\u201d while other administration officials mocked Martin\u2019s sexuality.",

      "bodyText": "An Aboriginal woman has been allowed to return home with her baby after child protection services in Victoria made six attempts to overturn a court ruling that she was able to properly care for her child. Advocates for the 28-year-old woman, who has foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FasD), said child protection workers for the Department of Health and Human Services did not appropriately consider her disability in its initial assessment declaring her an unfit parent, and have suggested the decision to remove the child was informed by prejudice. Liz* gave birth to her son, Ethan*, in May. He was removed by child protection following a parenting assessment after the pair had been discharged from hospital. She challenged the order in court and was allowed to retain care of her baby on condition she was supervised 24 hours a day by a court-appointed babysitting service or approved person. It meant she was unable to move into her two-bedroom public housing unit. The case was brought back to court six times, almost once a week, between 7 June and the hearing on Tuesday, when the child protection order was modified. The department has continued to impose restrictive monitoring conditions, despite Liz being granted a $100,000 package from the national disability insurance scheme that includes seven hours of daily intensive developmental support. Karinda Taylor, the chief executive of the First Peoples\u2019 Health and Wellbeing Clinic, said the initial assessment of Liz had been culturally inappropriate. It included a suggestion Liz was using sexualised language toward her infant because she said \u201cdo you want the titty?\u201d before breastfeeding. Taylor, a Wamba Wamba woman, registered nurse and midwife, hosted Liz and Ethan at her house for a week and wrote a report for the court saying Liz was able to care for Ethan provided she had appropriate support. \u201cI have never been concerned about Ethan\u2019s safety while in Liz\u2019s care,\u201d she said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Taylor said the babysitters who supervised Liz\u2019s care of Ethan were not \u201cculturally competent and FasD informed,\u201d which left Liz \u201cmore vulnerable\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that Liz hasn\u2019t until this week had an opportunity to feel safe, the ability to speak honestly about her support needs living with a brain injury and not have her disability used against her,\u201d she said. Taylor said Liz was worried about having her baby removed because her older child, who is now four, was removed as an infant and placed in kinship care. She is allowed to visit that child for one hour a fortnight and is working toward regaining care of both her children. Liz was able to spend the first night with Ethan in her new unit on Tuesday night. Her doctor, Peter Walsh, said it was a \u201cfantastic outcome\u201d. \u201cThis only occurred due to the monumental efforts of the care and legal teams and it shouldn\u2019t have taken six court appearances to reach the obvious and just conclusion,\u201d he said. The NDIS package covers six months of support, including help managing FasD symptoms such as difficulties in emotional regulation, as well as seven hours daily on individual skills development. But Walsh said the department \u201cstill want to impose restrictions on this family rather than help find solutions\u201d. \u201cIt makes you wonder how many other Aboriginal women or women with disabilities are having their children removed solely because of prejudice, systemic racism or failure of the system,\u201d he said. The department said it was unable to comment on individual cases. \u201cParental assessments are conducted to support child safety and wellbeing, and we engage with relevant interpreting or other agencies to support a parent\u2019s individual needs as is required,\u201d a spokeswoman said. Victoria has announced $47.3m to support Indigenous children in child protection under the Wungurilwil Gapgapduir agreement, and is the first jurisdiction in Australia to transfer guardianship of children in child protection to Indigenous organisations. * Names have been changed",

If we look at the composition of governments and who is leading countries, it\u2019s clear that Gen X should start shouldering some of the blame. They\u2019ve been in positions of power for a while now, and terrible thinkpieces that fan the flames of generational warfare should start to reflect this. Should Gen X be doing more to address the climate crisis even though it is largely the fault of boomers? I say yes, yes they should. For example, here\u2019s the age distribution for heads of government from OECD companies, using generational definitions from Pew Research: You\u2019ve got Donald Trump (a boomer) on one end, and Jacinda Ardern on the other (she\u2019s almost a millennial). The main thing to note is that there are a lot of Gen Xers there. In Australia, we now have our first Gen X prime minister, Scott Morrison. While the boomers have largely overseen the climate crisis, it\u2019s a Gen X prime minister who now has no effective policies for meaningful cuts to Australia\u2019s emissions. Canada has Justin Trudeau, and New Zealand has Ardern. Ardern and her government have been widely praised for their response to the Christchurch massacre, which included a ban on most automatic and semi-automatic weapons. In the UK, Theresa May is a boomer, but Britain has previously had a Gen Xer in number 10 in David Cameron. And if I understand basic physics, it\u2019s almost certain that Gen X will only continue to become more prevalent in positions of power, so everyone should probably brush up on their knowledge of Nirvana\u2019s back catalogue or start using quotes from Reality Bites in everyday conversation. Finally, these generational terms (iGeneration lol) aren\u2019t really of much use for actual demographic purposes. Aside from baby boomers, the date cut-offs are pretty arbitrary. They\u2019re mostly used by marketing companies to sell cereal or juice machines that connect to the internet and have their own cryptocurrency. Also, If anyone has pioneered a system for classifying generational date cut-offs based on data, I\u2019d quite like to see it, so please email me. Please do not email me to tell me why I am wrong, cheers. Nick Evershed is the data and interactives editor for Guardian Australia",

Wednesday\u2019s 419-6 vote increases chances that the Senate will follow the House, going for full repeal.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Beginning in 2022, the tax would slap a 40% levy on the value of health insurance plans above $11,200 for single coverage and $30,100 for family policies. The idea was to help control costs by putting a brake on the value of health insurance plans. To avoid the tax, insurers and employers might have to shift more costs to policyholders.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Based on Congressional Budget Office estimates, repeal would add $193 billion to the federal deficit from 2022-2029, by scratching projected revenues off the government\u2019s books. The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation expects that about 1 in 5 employers offering health insurance would have at least one insurance plan subject to the tax in 2022, and the share would grow quickly over time.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d2faaa08f0845f89e30f37b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lauren-gambino\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-17T23:16:58.210Z\">12.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s some analysis of Bernie Sanders\u2019 healthcare proposal, from the Guardian\u2019s <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Lauren Gambino</strong> in Washington: </p> \n  <p><strong>Bernie Sander</strong><strong>s offered a robust defense of his Medicare for All proposal</strong>, vowing to end the \u201cinternational embarrassment\u201d of the US being the only major, wealthy country in the world without a universal healthcare system as the issue takes center stage in the race to capture the Democratic nomination. <br></p> \n  <p>The Vermont senator\u2019s speech escalated an ongoing war of words with the former vice-president <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, who has embraced a plan that would establish a \u201cpublic option\u201d and would not eliminate private health insurance. <br><br>\u201cThe current debate over Medicare for All has nothing to do with healthcare,\u201d Sanders told a friendly crowd at George Washington University in Washington. \u201cWe are not in a debate about which healthcare system is working well or which is better. What the debate that we are currently having in this campaign and all over this country has nothing to do with healthcare, but it has everything to do with the greed and profits of the healthcare industry.\u201d<br><br>In the speech, Sanders also pledged to reject all campaign donations from lobbyists, executives and political action committees of health insurance and pharmaceutical companies and challenged his rivals to follow suit.<br><br>\u201cIf we are going to break the stranglehold of corporate interests over the healthcare needs of the American people, we have got to confront a Washington culture that is corrupt, that puts profits before people,\u201d Sanders said, adding: \u201cCandidates who are not willing to take that pledge should explain to the American people why those corporate interests believe their campaigns are a good investment. <br><br>Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All proposal would transform the current healthcare system into one operated by the government that covers \u201cevery man, woman and child in this country\u201d. Under his plan, no one would pay deductibles, premiums and copays and there would be no private insurance. He proposes a four-year transition period by gradually reducing the eligibility rate of the Medicare program. <br><br tabindex=\"-1\">Several candidates in the primary have signed onto Sanders legislation, but in his speech the senator sought to remind voters who popularized the issue. But he\u2019s facing increasing pushback from Biden and other more moderate candidates who prefer to build on the Affordable Care Act, which was passed by nine years ago under the Obama administration. At an event in Iowa, Biden said Medicare for All was \u201crisky\u201d while lower-tier candidates like Senator Michael Bennet and former congressman John Delaney warned that the party would lose to Trump if the nominee embraces his ideas. <br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cLet me make a prediction,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIn order to defeat the Medicare for All movement, powerful special interests will be spending millions on 30-second television ads, full-page magazine ads and corporate-sponsored \u2018studies\u2019 to frighten the American people about Medicare for All \u2013 which is exactly what happened before the passage of Medicare in the 1960s.

In all of this, the aforementioned Donald John Trump has, by his statements, brought the high office of the President of the United States in contempt, ridicule, disgrace, and disrepute, has sown seeds of discord among the people of the United States, has demonstrated that he is unfit to be President, and has betrayed his trust as President of the United States to the manifest injury of the people of the United States, and has committed a high misdemeanor in office. Therefore, Donald John Trump by causing such harm to the society of the United States is unfit to be President and warrants impeachment, trial, and removal from office. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under rule IX, a resolution offered from the floor by a Member other than the majority leader or the minority leader as a question of the privileges of the House has immediate precedence only at a time designated by the Chair within 2 legislative days after the resolution is properly noticed.</p> \n   <p>Pending that designation, the form of the resolution noticed by the gentleman from Texas will appear in the Record at this point.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: Lawmakers killed an attempt to impeach Donald Trump. The articles of impeachment brought by the representative Al Green of Texas accused Trump of bringing the presidency \u201cin contempt, ridicule, disgrace, and disrepute\u201d. The House of Representatives also voted to hold attorney general William Barr and commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross \u2013 in criminal contempt. And Congress voted to slash a key feature of Obama\u2019s healthcare plan, by repealing a tax on high-cost insurance plans. In an interview with PBS, the US Middle East envoy said the Trump administration \u201cdoes not contemplate one state\u201d as an option to resolve Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Trump continued to attack four progressive members of Congress throughout the day, including at a rally in North Carolina. He indicated that he thought the backlash to his racist attack on them amounted to a political victory, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not unhappy,\u201d with the scandal. A majority of Americans in a poll said Trump\u2019s comments were offensive, while a growing majority of Republicans in a separate poll saw immigration as an existential threat to the US. At his rally in North Carolina, Trump carried on with his attacks the \u201cSquad,\u201d falsely accusing representative Ilhan Omar of praising Al Quaeda. Prior to the rally, Trump called the House effort to impeach him earlier \u201cmost ridiculous project I\u2019ve ever been involved in,\u201d according to the AP. He also tweeted that the issue of impeachment \u201cis now OVER\u201d. There is still a chance Trump could be impeached, even if he\u2019s elected to a second term. In an interview with PBS, the US special envoy to the Middle East Jason Greenblatt revealed that Trump\u2019s Middle East plan \u201cdoes not contemplate one state\u201d as a solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. When asked by Judy Woodruff what rights Palestinians deserve to have, he responded: \u201cRights is a big word. I mean, I think our hope is to give Palestinians as great a life as the Israelis have, with everybody in the region being as secure as possible.\u201d Watch here: Another bit of news from the House of Representatives (which has had a busy, busy day): Lawmakers voted today to repeal a so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on high-cost health insurance plans. The tax was a key feature of Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, as the AP explains: House Democrats and Republicans joined in a rare show of unity Wednesday, voting overwhelmingly to repeal an unpopular tax on generous health insurance that\u2019s a symbol of former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law. The so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d never went into effect, since lawmakers kept delaying it. Wednesday\u2019s 419-6 vote increases chances that the Senate will follow the House, going for full repeal. Beginning in 2022, the tax would slap a 40% levy on the value of health insurance plans above $11,200 for single coverage and $30,100 for family policies. The idea was to help control costs by putting a brake on the value of health insurance plans. To avoid the tax, insurers and employers might have to shift more costs to policyholders. Based on Congressional Budget Office estimates, repeal would add $193 billion to the federal deficit from 2022-2029, by scratching projected revenues off the government\u2019s books. The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation expects that about 1 in 5 employers offering health insurance would have at least one insurance plan subject to the tax in 2022, and the share would grow quickly over time. Here\u2019s some analysis of Bernie Sanders\u2019 healthcare proposal, from the Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino in Washington: Bernie Sanders offered a robust defense of his Medicare for All proposal, vowing to end the \u201cinternational embarrassment\u201d of the US being the only major, wealthy country in the world without a universal healthcare system as the issue takes center stage in the race to capture the Democratic nomination. The Vermont senator\u2019s speech escalated an ongoing war of words with the former vice-president Joe Biden, who has embraced a plan that would establish a \u201cpublic option\u201d and would not eliminate private health insurance. \u201cThe current debate over Medicare for All has nothing to do with healthcare,\u201d Sanders told a friendly crowd at George Washington University in Washington. \u201cWe are not in a debate about which healthcare system is working well or which is better. What the debate that we are currently having in this campaign and all over this country has nothing to do with healthcare, but it has everything to do with the greed and profits of the healthcare industry.\u201d In the speech, Sanders also pledged to reject all campaign donations from lobbyists, executives and political action committees of health insurance and pharmaceutical companies and challenged his rivals to follow suit. \u201cIf we are going to break the stranglehold of corporate interests over the healthcare needs of the American people, we have got to confront a Washington culture that is corrupt, that puts profits before people,\u201d Sanders said, adding: \u201cCandidates who are not willing to take that pledge should explain to the American people why those corporate interests believe their campaigns are a good investment. Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All proposal would transform the current healthcare system into one operated by the government that covers \u201cevery man, woman and child in this country\u201d. Under his plan, no one would pay deductibles, premiums and copays and there would be no private insurance. He proposes a four-year transition period by gradually reducing the eligibility rate of the Medicare program. Several candidates in the primary have signed onto Sanders legislation, but in his speech the senator sought to remind voters who popularized the issue. But he\u2019s facing increasing pushback from Biden and other more moderate candidates who prefer to build on the Affordable Care Act, which was passed by nine years ago under the Obama administration. At an event in Iowa, Biden said Medicare for All was \u201crisky\u201d while lower-tier candidates like Senator Michael Bennet and former congressman John Delaney warned that the party would lose to Trump if the nominee embraces his ideas. \u201cLet me make a prediction,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIn order to defeat the Medicare for All movement, powerful special interests will be spending millions on 30-second television ads, full-page magazine ads and corporate-sponsored \u2018studies\u2019 to frighten the American people about Medicare for All \u2013 which is exactly what happened before the passage of Medicare in the 1960s. They failed then and they\u2019re going to fail now.\u201d Meanwhile, in Greenville, North Carolina, Trump is about to speak at a rally. And a statement from the Department of Justice echoes the White House\u2019s line: A statement from the press secretary called the vote \u201canother lawless attempt to harass the President and his Administration\u201d Lawmakers voted 230-198 to hold the attorney general and the commerce secretary in criminal contempt for obstructing a probe into Trump\u2019s failed efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. All Republicans and four Democrats voted \u2018no.\u2019 The AP explains: The vote is largely symbolic because the Justice Department is unlikely to prosecute them. The action marks an escalation of Democratic efforts to use their House majority to aggressively investigate the inner workings of the Trump administration. President Donald Trump last week abandoned his bid to inject a citizenship question into the census, after the Supreme Court said the administration\u2019s justification for the question \u201cseems to have been contrived.\u201d Trump directed agencies to try to compile the information using existing databases. In other news from the House, they\u2019ve voted to block certain arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The Washington Post reports: The House voted Wednesday to undo President Trump\u2019s attempt to sidestep Congress and complete several arms sales benefiting Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, sending the measures to the Oval Office where they are expected to be met with a veto. The Trump administration announced in May that they would invoke emergency authority to push through 22 arms sales worth over $8 billion, including missiles, munitions and surveillance aircraft for Saudi Arabia. A bipartisan majority \u2014 but not a veto-proof majority \u2014 of both the Senate and the House objected to the move, which would replenish part of the Saudi arsenal that lawmakers believe have been used against civilians in Yemen\u2019s long-running war. Lawmakers in both parties also object to the idea of seemingly rewarding Saudi leaders with hefty arms deals, at a time when most members want to punish them for their alleged role in the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. CNN has announced the list of Democratic candidates who will be participating in the upcoming debate on 30 and 31 July. They are: 1) Colorado senator Michael Bennet 2) Former vice-president Joe Biden 3) New Jersey senator Cory Booker 4) Montana governor Steve Bullock 5) South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg 6) Former Housing and Urban Development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro 7) New York mayor Bill de Blasio 8) Former Maryland representative John Delaney 9) Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard 10) New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand 11) California senator Kamala Harris 12) Former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper 13) Washington governor Jay Inslee 14) Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar 15) Former Texas representative Beto O\u2019Rourke 16) Ohio representative Tim Ryan 17) Vermont senator Bernie Sanders 18) Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren 19) Author Marianne Williamson 20) Businessman Andrew Yang The House voted 332 to 95 in favor of tabling the impeachment resolution. 137 Democrats voted with Republicans to kill the resolution, whereas 95 Democrats voted to consider the issue of impeachment. Note: in the House of Representatives, to table a resolution something means to kill it without a debate or a vote. Meanwhile, the attorney general, William Barr, and the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, have sent a letter to House speaker Nancy Pelosi, asking her to postpone a vote holding them in contempt of Congress for withholding information about the Trump administration\u2019s bid to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. Maanvi Singh, here \u2013 taking over in San Francisco. The House is currently voting to table the articles of impeachment against Donald Trump. The results should be in soon, in about 10 minutes... Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: Articles of impeachment against Donald Trump were expected to reach the House floor late Wednesday, but the Democratic leadership was expected to table or otherwise defer a vote. The articles, brought by the representative Al Green of Texas, accuse Trump of bringing the presidency \u201cin contempt, ridicule, disgrace, and disrepute\u201d. The House was expected to vote on a resolution finding two members of Trump\u2019s cabinet \u2013 the attorney general, William Barr, and the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross \u2013 in contempt. Trump continued to attack four progressive members of Congress and indicated that he thought the backlash to his racist attack on them amounted to a political victory. \u201cI\u2019m not unhappy,\u201d with the scandal, Trump said. A majority of Americans in a poll said Trump\u2019s comments were offensive, while a growing majority of Republicans in a separate poll saw immigration as an existential threat to the US. Donald Trump is meeting today with survivors of religious persecution from 17 countries, the White House advises, \u201cto reaffirm his Administration\u2019s commitment to religious liberty.\u201d A list of attendees provided by the White House: Reverend Hkalam Samson, Christian, Burma Wai Wai Nu, Rohingya, Burma Farid Ahmed, Muslim, New Zealand Rabbi Faiz Algaradi, Jewish, Yemen Yuhua Zhang, Falun Gong, China Reverend Mario F\u00e9lix Lleonart Barroso, Christian, Cuba Helen Berhane, Christian, Eritrea Esther Bitrus, Christian, Nigeria Pastor Andrew Brunson, Christian, Turkey Luong Xuan Duong, Cao Dai, Vietnam Badreldin Yousif Elsimat, Muslim, Sudan Pastor A Ga, Montagnard Christian, Vietnam Pastor Langjaw Gam Seng, Kachin Christian, Burma Father Thabet Habeb, Christian, Iraq Mariam Ibraheem, Christian, Sudan Farahnaz Ikhtiari, Hazara Shia, Afghanistan Jewher Ilham, Uigher Muslim, China Illyong Ju, Christian, North Korea Nyima Lhamo, Tibetan Buddhist, China Manping Ouyang, Christian, China Nadia Murad, Yezidi, Iraq Yamini Ravindran, Advocate, Sri Lanka Shaan Taseer, Advocate, Pakistan Abdul Shakoor, Ahmadiyya Muslim, Pakistan Dabrina Bet-Tamraz, Christian, Iran Mohib Ullah, Rohingya (Sunni), Burma Irene Weiss, Jewish, Germany The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, appears to be backtracking on his previous statement that he had \u201cruled out\u201d a Senate bid in Kansas. The former Republican congressman\u2019s name had been circulating among GOP insiders earlier this year as a potential replacement for outgoing Senator Pat Roberts, but Pompeo said he did not intend to leave the Trump administration. But now \u2013 just a week after Kris Kobach, best known for spewing hateful comments about undocumented immigrants, announced his own bid \u2013 Pompeo seems to be changing his tune. \u201cYeah, I would have never dreamed that I\u2019d be the secretary of state even a year before I became the director of the CIA, a year before that,\u201d he told a Kansas City radio station. \u201cAnd so I always leave open the possibility that something will change and my path in life will change too, but my mission set ... is really very clear.\u201d A 62% majority of Americans say the country\u2019s openness to people from around the world is \u201cessential to who we are as a nation,\u201d according to new data from the Pew Research Center. But a growing number of Republicans say that if the United States is too open to people from around the world, \u201cwe risk losing our identity as a nation,\u201d according to Pew: Currently, 57% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say that if the United States is too open to people from around the world, \u201cwe risk losing our identity as a nation.\u201d Fewer (37%) say America\u2019s openness to those from other countries is essential to who we are as a nation, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted July 10-15 among 1,502 adults. Both last fall and in 2017, Republicans\u2019 opinions on this question were divided. Since October, the share of Republicans who say America risks losing its identity if it is too open has increased 13 percentage points, while the number who view the nation\u2019s openness to others as essential has declined 10 points. Over the past two years, there has been virtually no change in Democrats\u2019 attitudes, Pew report: \u201cToday, an overwhelming majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners (86%) say America\u2019s openness is essential to who we are as a nation; 85% said this last October.\u201d Read further. In an exclusive phone interview with the Daily Mail online, Donald Trump suggested once again that he sees the backlash over his racist attack on four Democratic congresswoman as a political win. Asked \u201cif he planned that sequence of events and the one that followed yesterday, which ended with the passage of a resolution condemning him\u201d \u2013 a preposterous proposition, both in its assumption that Trump has scored a political victory and in its failure to recognize the impulsive quality of Trump\u2019s tweets \u2013 Trump said: \u201cWell, let\u2019s put it this way. I\u2019m not unhappy.\u201d After only four Republicans voted in favor of a House resolution Tuesday night condemning racist tweets sent by Trump telling the four members of congress, all women of color, to \u201cgo home\u201d to other countries, Trump boasted on Twitter that he had unified Republicans while raising the profile of the four congresswomen. \u201cSo great to see how unified the Republican Party was on today\u2019s vote concerning statements I made about four Democrat Congresswomen...\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey are now the top, most visible members of the House Democrats, who are now wedded to this bitterness and hate.\u201d But it was far from clear that Trump\u2019s political genius lived up to his estimation of it. Two-thirds of Americans found his \u201cgo home\u201d comments to be offensive, according to a major poll released Wednesday. Past big political plays by Trump, such as his fearmongering about migrant \u201ccaravans\u201d, to the point of deploying US troops to the southern border, as a tactic for boosting Republicans in the 2018 election were, in retrospect, ineffective at best and possibly self-defeating. Kentucky Sen Rand Paul has blocked an attempt to pass an extension of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund in the Senate, arguing that any new spending should be offset by cuts to other spending. The deficit-hawk routinely votes for tax-cuts which are not paid for by spending cuts, like the 2017 Trump tax reform package, which analysts suggest may cost $2.3 trillion over the next 10 years. A zinger from the former vicepresident, in response to Trump\u2019s claim Tuesday he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a racist bone in his body\u201d. Donald Trump took yet another jab, albeit a much lighter one at \u201cthe Squad\u201d via Twitter Wednesday with a 1:15-long patriotic video clip. Set to the tune of God Bless the USA by Lee Greenwood, the clip is almost exclusively footage of Trump greeting armed service and law enforcement members, but the end caption reads: \u201cOne squad under God.\u201d White House officials and congressional leaders are drawing closer to a two-year budget agreement that would raise the debt ceiling, although both sides caution that some serious obstacles remain to a deal, Politico reports. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer emerged from a 45-minute meeting on Wednesday sharing optimism that they might reach an agreement this week. If Congress does nothing, the government will run out of money sometime in early September, potentially prompting another shutdown. From Politico: Pelosi and Schumer spoke on the phone with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during the session. Mnuchin, who is leading the budget talks for the White House, is attending a G7 finance ministerial meeting in France. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to act by next Thursday, which is what we\u2019d like to do to honor regular order, we have to get something soon so we can post with enough time,\u201d Pelosi told reporters. The House is scheduled to adjourn next week for the August recess. President Trump has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in honor of former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens. In the aftermath of Trump urging four Democratic congresswomen to \u201cgo back\u201d to the \u201ccrime-infested places from which they came,\u201d the mayor of the German town where Trump\u2019s grandfather was born has a message for the president. \u201cSeeing the not-so-imposing homes of his ancestors might bring him back to earth,\u201d said Thomas Jaworek, the conservative mayor of Kallstadt, where Trump\u2019s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born and then left as a teenager. The comments were reported by the Washington Post, who spoke with other local residents. Many had similar remarks to share: \u201cEveryone has his or her roots somewhere \u2014 and to demand of others to simply leave the country is paradoxical for him,\u201d said Beatrix Riede, 61, who heads an association for women in the town. \u201cI can only wish Americans that they will elect someone who turns on his mind before saying something,\u201d Riede added. Former Kansas Secretary of State and gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach was asked a simple question on CNN and his non-answer was fairly revealing. Here is the full text of the impeachment articles against Donald Trump for \u201chigh misdemeanors\u201d expected to receive a vote later Wednesday: Mr. GREEN of Texas: Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I rise to give notice of my intention to raise a question of the privileges of the House. The form of the resolution is as follows: Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, of high misdemeanors. Resolved, that Donald John Trump, President of the United States, is unfit to be President, unfit to represent the American values of decency and morality, respectability and civility, honesty and propriety, reputability and integrity, is unfit to defend the ideals that have made America great, unfit to defend liberty and justice for all as extolled in the Pledge of Allegiance, is unfit to defend the American ideal of all persons being created equal as exalted in the Declaration of Independence, is unfit to ensure domestic tranquility, promote the general welfare and to ensure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity as lauded in the preamble to the United States Constitution, is unfit to protect the government of the people, by the people, for the people as elucidated in the Gettysburg Address, and is impeached for high misdemeanors that the following Article of Impeachment be exhibited to the Senate: Article of Impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives of the United States, in the name of itself, of the people of the United States, against Donald John Trump, President of the United States, in maintenance and support of its impeachment against him for high misdemeanors committed as President constituting harm to American society to the manifest injury of the people of the United States: Article I. The House of Representatives on July 16, 2019, strongly condemned President Donald Trump\u2019s racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color by saying that our fellow Americans who are immigrants, and those who may look to the President like immigrants, should \u201cgo back\u2019\u2019 to other countries, by referring to immigrants and asylum seekers as \u201cinvaders,\u2019\u2019 and by saying that Members of Congress who are immigrants, or those of our colleagues who are wrongly assumed to be immigrants, do not belong in Congress or in the United States of America. In all of this, the aforementioned Donald John Trump has, by his statements, brought the high office of the President of the United States in contempt, ridicule, disgrace, and disrepute, has sown seeds of discord among the people of the United States, has demonstrated that he is unfit to be President, and has betrayed his trust as President of the United States to the manifest injury of the people of the United States, and has committed a high misdemeanor in office. Therefore, Donald John Trump by causing such harm to the society of the United States is unfit to be President and warrants impeachment, trial, and removal from office. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under rule IX, a resolution offered from the floor by a Member other than the majority leader or the minority leader as a question of the privileges of the House has immediate precedence only at a time designated by the Chair within 2 legislative days after the resolution is properly noticed. Pending that designation, the form of the resolution noticed by the gentleman from Texas will appear in the Record at this point. The Chair will not at this point determine whether the resolution constitutes a question of privilege. That determination will be made at the time designated for consideration of the resolution. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit challenging the administration\u2019s new rule that effectively bans asylum protections for most people crossing the southern border. The new rule prohibits anyone from applying for asylum if they have passed through another country and didn\u2019t seek asylum there first. In a statement, the ACLU said: \u201cthe Trump administration is trying to unilaterally reverse our country\u2019s legal and moral commitment to protect those fleeing danger.\u201d The statement continued: It\u2019s patently unlawful under U.S. law as well as international human rights law \u2013 and it\u2019s an unacceptable assault on our country\u2019s values. Our team has been working around the clock to file this suit and stop the new rule in its tracks. The Trump administration has been tearing apart families and stoking fear and racism across the country for over two years now. Last weekend, the president reminded us of what fuels his anti-immigrant agenda when he told Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 four women of color and new members of Congress \u2013 to \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from. This is racism, plain and simple. Bernie Sanders is weighing in on the Department of Justice decision Tuesday not to bring charges against the officer who killed Eric Garner with an illegal chokehold in 2014. Former Trump officials believe the president would like to strike a nuclear deal with Iran that \u201cessentially mirrors\u201d the one Barack Obama and John Kerry negotiated in 2015, according to a new report from Politico. \u201cTrump got rid of the Iran nuclear deal because it was Barack Obama\u2019s agreement,\u201d Jarrett Blanc, a former State Department official who helped oversee the 2015 deal\u2019s implementation, told Politico. \u201cIf you were to present to Trump the same deal and call it Trump\u2019s deal, he\u2019d be thrilled.\u201d Trump quit the nuclear deal in May 2018, reimposing sanctions the U.S. had lifted on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. This comes as Rand Paul is apparently offering his services to Trump, as an emissary to the Islamic republic. Also from Politico: Over a round of golf this past weekend, Sen. Rand Paul asked President Donald Trump\u2019s blessing for a sensitive diplomatic mission. Paul proposed sitting down with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to extend a fresh olive branch on the president\u2019s behalf, according to four U.S. officials. The aim: to reduce tensions between the two countries. Trump signed off on the idea. Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating with Republicans rose in a USA Today/Ipsos poll conducted entirely after his racist tweets on Sunday attacking four Democratic congresswomen of color. Trump\u2019s net approval with Republicans in the new poll rose 5 percentage points, to 72%, from a similar poll conducted last week. The Washington Post is reporting that the Trump campaign is planning to roll out a new mobile application in the coming weeks \u201caimed at engaging its most loyal supporters. Known internally as the \u2018Trump app\u2019 and set to be released as early as within the next month, the app is part of an effort by campaign manager Brad Parscale to juice enthusiasm among Trump supporters and capitalize on the energy at Trump\u2019s rallies.\u201d The Post continues: Trump loyalists who download the app will be able to use it to get registered to vote, recruit additional supporters and stay up to date on what Trump is doing, said one campaign official familiar with the development who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. It will include incentives for supporters who actively volunteer to help the campaign, and facilitate neighborhood watch parties and other volunteer work, the official said. For instance, supporters waiting in line to attend a rally who get a dozen friends to download the app might earn VIP seats once inside. According to NBC News, JT Lewis, the 19-year-old brother of a Sandy Hook shooting victim, has announced that he is running for state Senate in Connecticut. Lewis is challenging an incumbent who he said never returned a phone call his grieving mother made after the shooting. Two-thirds of Americans say Trump\u2019s comments on \u201cthe squad\u201d were offensive in a new poll from USA Today/Ipsos. From USA Today: A clear majority of Americans say President Trump\u2019s tweets targeting four minority congresswomen were \u201cun-American,\u201d according to a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll. But most Republicans say they agreed with his comments, an illustration of the nation\u2019s sharp partisan divide on issues of patriotism and race. More than two-thirds of those aware of the controversy, 68%, called Trump\u2019s tweets offensive. Among Republicans alone, however, 57% said they agreed with tweets that told the congresswomen to go back to their \u201coriginal\u201d countries, and a third \u201cstrongly\u201d agreed with them. New York governor Andrew Cuomo says his state, along with New Jersey and Connecticut is suing the Trump Administration over the so-called Salt (State and Local Tax deduction) policy in a 2017 tax overhaul, calling the law an \u201ceconomic civil war\u201d. The changes lowered the deductions taxpayers could claim for taxes paid to state and local governments, and functioned to raise taxes on many in higher-tax, Democratic-leaning places like New York. Four progressive democrats known as \u201cThe Squad\u201d have revealed the source of their militaristic moniker \u2013 they gave it to themselves at a photo shoot. \u201cSomeone said, `Oh you should do a hashtag or something #squadgoals and then it morphed into whole other thing,\u201d Congressmember Ayanna Pressley told Gayle King Wednesday on CBS This Morning. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about dismantling \u2013 we\u2019re also intentional about building and fostering,\u201d the Massachusetts congresswoman explained. \u201cThe reality is anyone who is interested in building a more equitable and just world is a part of The Squad.\u201d Airplane giant Boeing is the focus of a House hearing on aviation safety today that will include testimony from family members of victims of the deadly Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crash. All of the manufacturer\u2019s 737 MAX jets have remained grounded since March when a fatal flaw in the plane\u2019s software was implicated in two separate crashes. You can watch live below: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is looking on the bright side of Trump\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric this morning. The Washington Post report Ocasio-Cortez shared notes that in multiple federal cases, Trump\u2019s own words on Twitter have been used by judges to discredit the administration\u2019s racially or ethnically neutral rationale for a policy. In 2017, for example, \u201cJudge Derrick K. Watson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii viewed Trump\u2019s comments as evidence of the real reason for travel restrictions \u2014 religious animus rather than national security.\u201d It happened again during the administration\u2019s failed quest to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. Texas representative Al Green will force a vote in the House on articles of impeachment for Donald Trump later this afternoon. Green\u2019s move does not enjoy the support of party leadership or very many members-even those who support impeachment- and will necessarily fail. Green is bringing the vote using a procedural mechanism Tuesday known as a privileged resolution which allows any member of the House to try and force an impeachment vote. Green has attempted this twice before, unsuccessfully. Republicans controlled the House both times and tabled the measures. It just seemed to me that we should bring these articles before the House of Representatives, so that we could not only condemn him, but impeach him, so that he will understand that there are some boundaries because, as we speak now, there don\u2019t appear to be boundaries, or at least it appears that the president doesn\u2019t perceive any boundaries,\u201d -Rep Al Green MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe revealed old footage Wednesday morning of Donald Trump partying with accused human trafficker Jeffrey Epstein that\u2019s sure to dial up the cringe factor on your day. While their discussion is mostly inaudible, at one point Trump is seen pointing toward the women and appears to say in Epstein\u2019s ear: \u201cLook at her, back there. She\u2019s hot.\u201d Epstein appears to agree, then Trump says something else that makes Epstein double up with laughter. The video is from the same year in which Trump hosted a party with a guest list of himself, Epstein, and \u201c28 girls,\u201d according to reporting from The New York Times. Trump said of his relationship with Epstein last week: \u201cI knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him .. I was not a fan.\u201d Federal prosecutors indicted Epstein this month, charging him with sex trafficking and accusing him of using his fortune to \u201ccreate a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit.\u201d Presidential candidate and California senator Kamala Harris swiped back at Trump for his remarks about the Democratic congresswomen late on CNN Tuesday, saying that the president \u201cneeds to go back where he came from and leave that office.\u201d Harris said also called the comments \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201cunbecoming of the President of the United States.\u201d \u201dI think it defiles the office of the United States,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt is irresponsible. It is hateful. It is hurtful. And he has taken the presidency to a new low.\u201d -Kamala Harris Harris is one of the few 2020 challengers to break through at all, according to an analysis from Axios which found that online interest in the candidate field plunged over the past week as attention turned to Jeffrey Epstein, women\u2019s soccer and Trump\u2019s racist tweets. According to Axios: \u201cIn the week ending Sunday, when Trump began his tweet rant, articles about the Democratic candidates generated just 6.5 million combined social media interactions (shares, likes, comments) \u2014 the fewest since mid-January.\u201d Good Morning and welcome to the politics live blog for 17 July. We\u2019ll kick off this morning with the ongoing skirmish between Donald Trump and four progressive Democratic congresswomen, which has consumed the political news cycle for the better part of the week now, with no signs of dying down soon. \u201cThe Squad\u201d \u2013 as congresswomen Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts \u2013 have come to be known, was on CBS This Morning for an interview with Gayle King early Wednesday. In the interview, Tlaib called Trump the \u201cthe biggest bully [she\u2019s] ever had to deal with\u201d. Ocasio-Cortez joined her colleague in condemning Republicans for not standing up to the president over his social media posts. America has always been about the triumph of people who fight for everyone versus those who want to preserve rights for just a select few... There is no bottom to the barrel of vitriol that will be used and weaponized to stifle those who want to advance rights for all people in the United States.\u201d \u2013 Ocasio-Cortez The interview comes a day after the US House voted to condemn Trump for the remarks that sparked the conflict, in which the president suggested the four non-white US citizens \u201cgo back\u201d to where they \u201ccame from\u201d. Just four Republicans joined Democrats in approving the resolution.",

      "bodyText": "The inadequate level of Newstart is designed to leave out-of-work Australians \u201cincreasingly miserable\u201d, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty has warned. Philip Alston, the brother of former Liberal senator and federal communications minister Richard Alston, weighed into the debate about the adequacy of unemployment benefits on Thursday, as former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce joined the ranks of those criticising the level of Newstart. On Wednesday Labor MPs Mike Freelander and Nick Champion called for a $75 a week increase in the unemployment payment, which has been frozen at $275 a week for 25 years, a reduction of 40% in real terms according to the Australian Council of Social Services. Philip Alston, who is in Australia to receive an honorary doctorate from the Australian Nation University, compared Australia\u2019s approach with the intentional hardship caused by the United Kingdom\u2019s benefits system, the subject of his scathing country report in November 2018. \u201cWhat the government is trying to do is say that work is the only way out of poverty,\u201d Alston told ABC\u2019s AM. \u201cAnd what we\u2019re going to do to make that happen is to make any form of government assistance like Newstart increasingly unsustainable. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be no incentive whatsoever no matter how badly off you are to stay on this allowance. That\u2019s the mentality that\u2019s behind it.\u201d Alston said it was \u201cfine\u201d for governments to prioritise employment but \u201cthere is always going to be a significant percentage of the population who are extremely badly off\u201d and \u201csimply can\u2019t drop things and go out to work\u201d because they suffer from family, mental health or other chronic problems. \u201cThey\u2019re gong to be left in increasingly miserable conditions which are not at all fitting for a rich, advanced country like Australia.\u201d On Thursday Joyce told the Australian newspaper that Newstart \u201cis a hard life\u201d and suggested reforming the payment to consider recipients\u2019 geographical locations, to compensate them for higher costs of living in the regions and higher rents in capital cities. \u201cIf someone\u2019s on Newstart in a town like Woolbrook, it\u2019s going to cost you $50 to go to Tamworth to do the groceries or go to a job interview,\u201d Joyce reportedly said. \u201cThey live in those places because the rent\u2019s cheap but the rent\u2019s cheap because it\u2019s a long way from the services.\u201d The Morrison government has so far resisted calls to increase the rate of Newstart, with treasurer Josh Frydenberg citing the fact that more than 90% of recipients receive some other form of payment. Many Newstart recipients receive a fortnightly energy supplement of just $8.80 a fortnight, and are also eligible for rent assistance of up to $137.20 a fortnight if living alone or $91.47 a fortnight if living in shared accommodation. Alston also took aim at the third phase of the Coalition\u2019s income tax cut package, which passed the Senate with Labor and crossbench support earlier in July. The third phase will flatten the tax rate to 30% for all workers earning between $45,000 and $200,000 from 2024-25. Alston said the third phase was \u201ca very bad policy initiative\u201d because it will tie the government\u2019s hands years in advance, \u201chollow out\u201d its revenues and have a \u201chighly significant\u201d impact on its ability to deliver services. \u201cClearly the sort of tax cuts that are envisaged in phase three are going to have a huge impact on the governments ability to provide protection for the broader community \u2026 [such as] to ensure a functioning healthcare system.\u201d On Wednesday the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, defended Labor\u2019s decision to pass the government\u2019s $158bn income tax package, telling 5AA Radio that Labor had decided \u201cto be defined by what we supported, rather than by what we opposed\u201d by passing the cuts after failing to excise the third phase. Albanese noted that changes legislated in 2018 \u2013 which Labor opposed \u2013 were already going to remove a tier from the tax scales in 2024-25 and the new income tax cut package merely reduced the rate of the new flattened tax bracket from 32.5% to 30%. \u201cIt is just a fact that the flattening of the tax scales happened in 2018. Labor voted against it in the House of Reps and the Senate.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "While it might be one of the most hated household chores, the power of laundering sheets shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. Toowoomba\u2019s Vanguard Laundry washes a mammoth 180,000kgs of linens per month, but the business generates much more than just clean sheets. Luke Terry launched Vanguard in 2017, as a budding social enterprise focused on helping people with a lived experience of mental illness find work. In less than two years, Vanguard has assisted more than 140 people to enter the workforce. \u201cVanguard just did a really big research piece with Swinburne University, and it showed that when someone gets a job, everything changes,\u201d Terry says. \u201cThe amount of time they spent in hospital changed, smoking rates dropped, the reliance on government decreased, but most importantly, the indicators around their purpose and meaning in life and mental health and wellbeing, are greatly increasing.\u201d As well as employment, Vanguard provides an in-house career development centre to support disadvantaged jobseekers through sustainable career opportunities with local employers, as well as training and career development. For Terry, who was inspired by his own mental health challenges, his social enterprise model is proving more sustainable than mainstream options. Luke Terry pictured with Westpac Regional General Manager, Cara Jones \u201cI don\u2019t think that social enterprise will ever replace government programs, but we can challenge them, and we can build a stronger system where no one is left behind,\u201d he says. \u201cEmployment focused social enterprises have a 90% plus success rate of helping people get back to 52 weeks of consistent employment. Federal government [programs] only achieve employment for 3% of people that are voluntarily registered with them, and of those people, there\u2019s only a 28% success rate that they\u2019ll get to 26 weeks of successful employment.\u201d Terry says there are currently only 20 large-scale employment focused social enterprises in Australia that pay staff a full award wage and employ more than 50 people, but believes that these models can pick up where government models are lacking. \u201cI strongly believe that we can create a world, starting in Australia, where if you want to work and you have a willingness to really work hard to develop a career, then there is an employment place for you,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd social enterprises are the way to really support those people that have a willingness to get back to work.\u201d Social enterprises are entering the Australian market at a steady rate, and while such organisations are designed to be sustainable, support from the government and philanthropic programs make a big impact. Terry is a recipient of a Westpac Social Change Fellowship, a program that invests in the growth and development of the social innovator, as opposed to the organisation itself. As part of his Fellowship, Terry visited more than 30 large scale employment focused social enterprises across the globe to better understand best practice. He\u2019s now drawing on these learnings to scale up Vanguard Laundry and establish his new project - White Box Enterprises - which launched this week. White Box is the first of its kind in Australia, with a vision to create more than 5,000 jobs through social enterprise by 2030. Another Fellowship recipient is Laura O\u2019Reilly, who developed an umbrella non-profit, Fighting Chance, designed to launch social enterprises which each solve a specific challenge facing people with a disability. \u201cHaving a job is an absolutely essential core part of being an adult,\u201d O\u2019Reilly says. \u201cIt gives you identity. It\u2019s core to a sense of contribution, purpose and pride. And sometimes it\u2019s hard for people who have a job to understand that. \u201cTalk to anyone who has experienced unemployment for any length of time, it\u2019s an extremely debilitating and soul crushing experience.\u201d Chem, an employee at Jigsaw, a social enterprise providing employment &amp; work experience to people living with a disability Jigsaw is just one business that sits under the Fighting Chance umbrella, inspired in part by her brother Shane\u2019s lived experience of having cerebral palsy. \u201cThere are hundreds of thousands of people in Australia with mild or moderate disability \u2013 such as hearing or vision impairment, or autism, who are incredibly capable, intelligent, and have so much to give to the economy; but because of their disability, it\u2019s really hard to find work,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you dig into the stats, Australia is one of the worst performing countries when it comes to supporting people with a disability to access employment. Only 53% of people with disability are employed, compared with 83% of the mainstream population.\u201d Jigsaw strives to make that uphill battle a little easier, by training and employing people with disability from within its digitalisation and document management business. Jigsaw provides its services to 80 corporate and government clients, in a bid to break down employment barriers. To date, Jigsaw has trained and employed over 150 people with disability, and supported a further 20 to transition to mainstream employment. \u201cWe could spend a lot of time trying to persuade people to employ people with a disability, or we could just get on with employing them, and change attitudes through doing,\u201d O\u2019Reilly says. \u201cThat\u2019s the power of what social enterprise offers.\u201d Karn Ghosh is another Fellowship recipient who believes that business can be a \u2018force for good\u2019 in sustainably tackling community problems. \u201cIn business, as in life, purpose and problem-solving are not mutually exclusive. There\u2019s this magical sweet spot where you can do good and solve real social problems, and an outcome of that might be to build a cracking business,\u201d he says. He started Kinela with a goal to radically change the healthcare experience for people with disability, chronic disease and for older Australians. Kinela has a number of programs tailored for specific disabilities or health goals, and these programs are delivered through specialist allied health services - dietetics, speech pathology, occupational therapy and physiotherapy \u2013 in local communities.
