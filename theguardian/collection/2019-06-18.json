[The candidates] are all Brexiteers and there are large parts of my party who will never vote for a Brexiteer.</p> \n   <p>It was a masterclass in avoiding the answers to questions, there was not a single new policy idea and there were a lot of assertions which made no sense. For example, we are going to be tough with Europe, we are going to imply leaving on the October the 31st.</p> \n   <p>But, when it comes to it, the arithmetic in Parliament is the same. There is no majority for no deal, the Europeans know that, they have said they won\u2019t renegotiate the deal.</p> \n   <p>So, all this stuff about being tough is the language of city bankers who negotiate deals and know they have to have a hard line. If they fail, two companies move away and continue trading, if they fail this time it is the savings of the British people ... and the coherence of the United Kingdom at risk.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d09684b8f08532f138d452b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T23:02:48.922Z\">12.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The programme also featured some supporters of the various candidates. The former party leader, <strong>Iain Duncan Smith, </strong>who\u2019s supporting <strong>Boris Johnson,</strong> said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I thought it was clear the whole way through, what he said was we have to leave on the 31st October full stop. That\u2019s what he said. And then he goes on to say it is eminently achievable i.e. getting all the plans ready for the 31st is absolutely right. I am more than happy, I thought that was a very strong commitment we are leaving on the 31st October.</p> \n   <p>I think if you look at what he said, and I what I believe that absolutely categorically we need to deliver: Number one we have to commit to leaving by the 31<sup>st</sup> October - he has done that. Two, you can\u2019t renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement you\u2019ll insult the intelligence of the EU.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The junior minister <strong>George Eustice, </strong>is supporting his boss at Defra, <strong>Michael Gove</strong>. He told the programme he could rule out the possibility of a pact with <strong>Rory Stewart</strong>.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Rory has been pushing this around, but it is a bonkers idea. I\u2019ve told him that. In Conservative leadership campaigns \u2013 and I\u2019ve seen a few \u2013 when a candidate is eliminated, their supporters go all over the place, they scatter like cats. We must let this contest progress and see who\u2019s left standing. You don\u2019t do sort of bizarre pacts as Rory has been suggesting.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The former work and pension secretary, <strong>Stephen Crabb,</strong> is backing <strong>Sajid Javid. </strong>He brushed off talk that his man was thinking of packing it in.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Did Sajid Javid look like a man who\u2019s about to throw in the towel or about to be knocked out of the contest? He fought tonight, I thought he gave - in a difficult format \u2013 he gave a good display of what he can offer the country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Referring to reports that Stewart\u2019s campaign had sent almost identical messages to potential supporters following this afternoon\u2019s vote, albeit some more complimentary than others, Crabb said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It didn\u2019t praise my intellect funnily enough, it made other compliments but not my intellect.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d0965508f08263b930f23db\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T22:39:55.661Z\">11.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Michael Gove</strong> also spoke to the BBC\u2019s Newsnight after the debate and he was somewhat more upbeat \u2013 even going so far as to assure the four other candidates they\u2019d have a place on his \u201cteam\u201d after he\u2019s elected to the party leadership.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I won the debate. Because I had the most detailed answers and I have a clear plan to how we can deliver Brexit and make sure we get all the benefits of life outside the European Union.</p> \n   <p>And, of course, there were some other great people there. I love Rory, I love Boris, Saj and Jeremy, they will all be fantastic members of my team.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d09601f8f08374cc5790c04\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T22:13:05.079Z\">11.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a little more on <strong>Rory Stewart\u2019s</strong> reaction to his own performance during tonight\u2019s debate. He was asked by the BBC\u2019s Newsnight if he agreed he was a \u201cbit lacklustre\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t find that format really worked for me. I\u2019m going to have to learn how I flourish in a strange format in an alternative reality.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p> Stewart was seen to take his tie off during the debate. Asked why, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, I thought maybe, if I took my tie off, we could get back to a bit of reality. I was beginning to feel on those strange BBC white bar stools, that we were moving off into an alternate reality.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He was asked whether he could carry on to the next stage on his own, or would need to join up with another of the candidates to make it through.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I definitely think that we would all be in a stronger position if we could begin to combine. The problem, of course, that you\u2019re dealing with is that, with politicians, every single person thinks that they should be the leader, so the challenge in all these conversations is who\u2019s coming in behind who</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked to elaborate, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019ve said I wouldn\u2019t serve in a Boris government, but I like the other candidates very much and I would be making open offers to all of them.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And he clarified that, in such a situation, he would be looking to be the leader.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d09578d8f08532f138d449d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T21:29:52.949Z\">10.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Rory Stewart </strong>has told Newsnight his performance was a bit \u201clacklustre\u201d tonight.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnight/status/1141092467107872769\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"I didn't find that format really worked for me.\"<br><br>Rory Stewart agrees that his performance in tonight's debate was \"lacklustre\". <a href=\"https://t.co/HsAoNDtRIJ\">https://t.co/HsAoNDtRIJ</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nicholaswatt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NicholasWatt</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RoryStewartUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RoryStewartUK</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Newsnight?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Newsnight</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BBCOurNextPM?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BBCOurNextPM</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/CWvPX80jYx\">pic.twitter.com/CWvPX80jYx</a></p>\u2014 BBC Newsnight (@BBCNewsnight) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnight/status/1141092467107872769?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 18, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight.

This went out in a BBC primetime slot and yet, the biggest issue of the day, Brexit, the five people vying to be the next PM singularly failed to allay the concerns that were put to them by viewers. Will no-deal put by husband out of business? Don\u2019t worry, there will be some \u201ceconomic turbulence\u201d, but we\u2019ll get through it, said Michael Gove. Will you be able to keep the Irish border open? All the candidates said it should be kept open, but none could say how. In fact, on Brexit, no one could answer the<em> how</em> question at all. And, once the topic turned away from Brexit, there were unfunded promises on tax and a general recognition that public services are stretched - without any acknowledgment that the government all five have supported has been responsible. On social media there have been some complaints that Tory leadership coverage crowds out the Labour/opposition perspective, but it is hard to see how anyone at CCHQ might view this as positive coverage for the party. Jeremy Corbyn should be demanding Tory leadership debates on air every night.</p> \n  <p>Whether this will make any difference to the leadership election is a different matter. <strong>Sajid Javid</strong> probably had the best night, mostly for the lovely moment when he bounced his reluctant colleagues into agreeing an external inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory party. This may come to nothing in the end, but Javid looked decisive. If only solving Brexit were that easy. <strong>Jeremy Hunt </strong>and <strong>Michael Gove</strong> both did relatively okay. As the candidate with the most distinctive message on Brexit, and on taxation and public services,<strong> Rory Stewart </strong>would probably win the support of the 50% of the public on that side of the argument. But they are not well represented in the Conservative party, and his evasive answer in response to Javid\u2019s probing on the President Trump/Katie Hopkins tweet probably lost him a lot of ground with liberal Britain. <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> probably had the worst night. His attempt to excuse his gaffe about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was an obvious mistake. (Even if, as he claimed, his words did not make a difference to her incarceration, that was not the argument to make - he should have just said he made a mistake, and was sorry.) On Brexit he was unconvincing (as was everyone else.) And forgetting the imam\u2019s name was a very trivial mishap, but it was one that appeared to confirm a negative view many people have of him - that he has a casual disregard for some people who are not white. </p> \n  <p>Debates don\u2019t make as much difference as people think, and Johnson remains the overall favourite to become next prime minister. But leadership contests are supposed to invigorate a party and leave it looking more attractive to the public. On the basis of tonight, it is hard to see that happening to the Conservatives this summer.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-19T07:43:07.437Z\">at 8.43am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d0941c38f08374cc5790b2a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T19:59:22.172Z\">8.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: If you become PM, you will have no mandate from the public.

Sturgeon said a \u201cbalanced basket of taxes\u201d would allow Scotland to make more sophisticated economic decisions.</p> \n  <p>And she added that if Boris Johnson or another Tory PM cut income taxes in the rest of the UK, a key pledge of many candidates, she may need to think carefully about further income tax rises in Scotland. \u201cThe competitivity of our tax system is something we will never be complacent about,\u201d she said.</p> \n  <p>She suggested new talks over Scotland\u2019s devolved powers were already on Johnson\u2019s mind, specifically giving Holyrood control over nearly all of its tax and spending decisions. She quipped that after a recent second world war commemoration event, Johnson asked her: \u201cSo Nicola: full fiscal autonomy. Does that buy you guys off?\u201d</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon has been focusing heavily on the rightwards, pro-Brexit drift of the contest to succeed Theresa May as a fresh justification for a new independence referendum, with her government tabling legislation to run such a vote.</p> \n  <p>Backing for independence has slightly increased in the polls, bringing it within a few points of reaching 50% support. Many commentators and Scottish politicians believe victory for Johnson will tip that into majority support for independence. That could point to Johnson or any other victor starting the conversations Deerin raises.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6271620c36e99330784f16ad5034529ed47eb18d\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6271620c36e99330784f16ad5034529ed47eb18d/0_54_1796_1078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sturgeon.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Lenoir/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T19:07:36.114Z\">at 8.07pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d092ad28f08532f138d431d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T18:24:19.195Z\">7.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Andrea Jenkyns</strong>, a Brexiter, says that now Dominic Raab has been eliminated she will vote for Boris Johnson.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/andreajenkyns/status/1141040471411744769\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For 3 years we have been fighting to deliver Brexit, with Remain MPs trying to stop the will of our people.

She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is surely deeply concerning that the Conservative party is even contemplating putting into the office of prime minister someone whose tenure as foreign secretary was risible, lacking in any seriousness of purpose or basic competence and who, over the years, has gratuitously offended so many, from gay people, to Africans, Muslim women and many others.</p> \n   <p>But while that, for now, is a matter for the Tories it does further illustrate the different political trajectories of Scotland and other parts of the UK. And it raises the more fundamental question of whether the UK and therefore devolution, in its current form is capable of accommodating those differences.</p> \n   <p>I have to be candid and admit I\u2019m not a neutral observer of these matters but it does seem to me that these days, the unionist offer to Scotland amounts to not much more than: \u2018Your views don\u2019t matter, do as you\u2019re told and, if you don\u2019t like it, tough, we\u2019ll do it anyway.\u2019</p> \n   <p>Brexit starkly illustrates the point. The votes of people here have been ignored. The Scottish government\u2019s attempt at compromise was rejected.

He is unlikely to pick up any of the 30 votes that went to Dominic Raab and are now up for grabs because Raab was the most hardline Brexit candidate, and Stewart is at the other end of the spectrum. But if Sajid Javid\u2019s supporters were to tuck in behind Stewart, his vote would rise to 70. In practice, votes never get redistributed that simply, but last week the fight for second place looked like a Hunt/Gove contest. Now Stewart is in contention.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) Hunt\u2019s lead over Gove has slipped from six votes to five.</strong> But Gove could plausibly expect to pick up more of the 30 Raab votes, because they were both leading figures of the Vote Leave campaign. It is very possible that Gove could overhaul Hunt.</p> \n  <p><strong>4) Johnson is still the overall favourite, but it does feel as if his campaign is losing momentum. </strong>There were 50 votes available after the elimination of Matt Hancock, Andrea Leadsom, Mark Harper and Esther McVey. Johnson picked up just 12 of them despite being seen as the overwhelming favourite. He is still not performing as well as Theresa May did in 2016, when she got 50% of the vote in the first ballot.

Johnson is still under pressure to prove he is pro-business in the light of the row about <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44618154\">his \u201cfuck business\u201d comment</a> a year ago.</p> \n  <p>According to Jack, Johnson said he would extend the Brexit transition, which is due to end at the end of next year under current plans, for an extra 12 months, until December 2021. Jack says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mr Johnson\u2019s plan appeared to be to defer the negotiations over the problematic Irish backstop till after the UK leaves the EU on 31 October. He proposed extending the transition period till December 2021, which would give everyone enough time to negotiate a free-trade deal and come up with the technology to ensure no physical infrastructure would be required at the Irish border.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Extending the transition until December 2021 is one feature of<a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2019/02/the-malthouse-compromise-offical-explainer-in-full.html\"> the Malthouse compromise</a>, a plan that Johnson has enthusiastically backed. But in his recent public remarks on Brexit he has not specifically flagged up this part of the plan as one that he would pursue.</p> \n  <p>Jack also says that, although Johnson restated his commitment to leave the EU by 31 October with or without a deal, his audience were not convinced he meant it. Jack says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When asked whether he was prepared to leave with no deal on 31 October, he said that it was not his preferred option, we had to prepare for no-deal and if necessary go through with it.</p> \n   <p>One attendee I spoke to felt that \u201chis heart wasn\u2019t in that comment\u201d, another said, \u201cthe look in his eyes made you question whether he really meant that\u201d.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>There have been other hints from Johnson that he will shift on his 31 October deadline. At his campaign launch he refused to say he would resign if the UK was still in the EU after October, and in an interview with the World at One on Friday he said <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-claims-obvious-solution-16519026\">it would be wrong \u201cat this stage\u201d to signal a willingness to delay Brexit into November.</a></p> \n  <p>Jack also says Johnson\u2019s decision to leave Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, to answer questions after he left did not go down well.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[Johnson] left Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, to answer questions after he left the breakfast.

Debates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/16/channel-4-debate-tory-leadership-candidates-take-part-in-first-tv-hustings-without-boris-johnson-live-news?page=with:block-5d06709a8f08263b930f0b00#block-5d06709a8f08263b930f0b00\">normally don\u2019t influence campaigns</a> as much as people expect them to, but they can, and this one is eagerly awaited because Johnson, the runaway frontrunner who has largely avoided media scrutiny for months, has agreed to take part. Can any of the candidates upend him in a TV studio? We will find out.</p> \n  <p>Johnson received a boost this morning when <strong>Andrea Leadsom</strong>, the former leader of the Commons who was a candidate herself until forced out herself last week, used an LBC interview this morning to endorse him. <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/nick-ferrari/andrea-leadsom-backs-boris-johnson-prime-minister/\">As LBC reports,</a> she explained her decision like this:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m going to be backing Boris Johnson for the next prime minister. Essentially, there\u2019s two key reasons. One is I think he is the best placed to get us out of the EU at the end of October. His view and mine are closely aligned there.</p> \n   <p>Secondly, I do believe he is an election winner. He is someone who can bring the country and the party back together and take us forward in a positive way.</p> \n   <p>And the third thing which is more nuanced really is that he and I share a scepticism about the HS2 project on the grounds of value for money.</p> \n   <p>But he, at the same time, has a big commitment to improving infrastructure in the country to a pro-business agenda that will really get our ecomony to be motoring, which is essential in a post-Brexit world.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Leadsom is a hardline Brexiter and her decision will be a disappointment to Raab, who will need to votes of people like Leadsom if he is to stay in the race.</p> \n  <p>Her comments about Johnson\u2019s view on HS2 are also fascinating. As my colleagues <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Rowena Mason </strong>and<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> Jessica Elgot</strong> report, there are claims that Johnson has been telling some supporters in private that he opposes the project, while telling others that he will allow it to go ahead.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/17/boris-johnson-accused-of-making-mps-contradictory-brexit-promises\">Boris Johnson accused of making contradictory Brexit promises to MPs</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>9.30am:</strong> Theresa May chairs cabinet.</p> \n  <p><strong>1.30pm:</strong> Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leadership contender, takes part in a <a href=\"https://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/mumsnet_live_events/3614469-Webchat-with-Ed-Davey-Lib-Dem-leadership-candidate-on-Tuesday-18-June-at-1-30pm\">Mumsnet Q&amp;A.</a></p> \n  <p><strong>3pm:</strong> Tory MPs start voting in the second round of the leadership ballot.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now \u2013 thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: The field in the Tory leadership campaign was narrowed to five as Dominic Raab was eliminated from the running. Boris Johnson was way out ahead, with 126 votes. He was followed by Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Rory Stewart and Sajid Javid \u2013 in that order. They each had the support of between 46 and 33 of their parliamentary colleagues. Raab had only 30. You can read an analysis of the vote here. Later, in a public debate on the BBC, the candidates clashed over tax cuts, a no-deal Brexit and the Irish border, as well as public service cuts, climate change and Islamophobia. The five went somewhat wild in New Broadcasting House, with the event being characterised by numerous interruptions that the host, Emily Maitlis, had to work hard to contain. You can read the exchanges by clicking the links and here\u2019s a comprehensive summary of the debate as a whole. And you can read a summary of the day\u2019s news up to lunchtime here. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleague Heather Stewart has produced this excellent article: Lord Heseltine, who had the Tory whip suspended last month after saying he had voted Lib Dem in the European elections, told Newsnight: It was a deeply depressing occasion for me because I\u2019m disenfranchised. [The candidates] are all Brexiteers and there are large parts of my party who will never vote for a Brexiteer. It was a masterclass in avoiding the answers to questions, there was not a single new policy idea and there were a lot of assertions which made no sense. For example, we are going to be tough with Europe, we are going to imply leaving on the October the 31st. But, when it comes to it, the arithmetic in Parliament is the same. There is no majority for no deal, the Europeans know that, they have said they won\u2019t renegotiate the deal. So, all this stuff about being tough is the language of city bankers who negotiate deals and know they have to have a hard line. If they fail, two companies move away and continue trading, if they fail this time it is the savings of the British people ... and the coherence of the United Kingdom at risk. The programme also featured some supporters of the various candidates. The former party leader, Iain Duncan Smith, who\u2019s supporting Boris Johnson, said: I thought it was clear the whole way through, what he said was we have to leave on the 31st October full stop. That\u2019s what he said. And then he goes on to say it is eminently achievable i.e. getting all the plans ready for the 31st is absolutely right. I am more than happy, I thought that was a very strong commitment we are leaving on the 31st October. I think if you look at what he said, and I what I believe that absolutely categorically we need to deliver: Number one we have to commit to leaving by the 31st October - he has done that. Two, you can\u2019t renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement you\u2019ll insult the intelligence of the EU. The junior minister George Eustice, is supporting his boss at Defra, Michael Gove. He told the programme he could rule out the possibility of a pact with Rory Stewart. Rory has been pushing this around, but it is a bonkers idea. I\u2019ve told him that. In Conservative leadership campaigns \u2013 and I\u2019ve seen a few \u2013 when a candidate is eliminated, their supporters go all over the place, they scatter like cats. We must let this contest progress and see who\u2019s left standing. You don\u2019t do sort of bizarre pacts as Rory has been suggesting. The former work and pension secretary, Stephen Crabb, is backing Sajid Javid. He brushed off talk that his man was thinking of packing it in. Did Sajid Javid look like a man who\u2019s about to throw in the towel or about to be knocked out of the contest? He fought tonight, I thought he gave - in a difficult format \u2013 he gave a good display of what he can offer the country. Referring to reports that Stewart\u2019s campaign had sent almost identical messages to potential supporters following this afternoon\u2019s vote, albeit some more complimentary than others, Crabb said: It didn\u2019t praise my intellect funnily enough, it made other compliments but not my intellect. Michael Gove also spoke to the BBC\u2019s Newsnight after the debate and he was somewhat more upbeat \u2013 even going so far as to assure the four other candidates they\u2019d have a place on his \u201cteam\u201d after he\u2019s elected to the party leadership. I won the debate. Because I had the most detailed answers and I have a clear plan to how we can deliver Brexit and make sure we get all the benefits of life outside the European Union. And, of course, there were some other great people there. I love Rory, I love Boris, Saj and Jeremy, they will all be fantastic members of my team. Here\u2019s a little more on Rory Stewart\u2019s reaction to his own performance during tonight\u2019s debate. He was asked by the BBC\u2019s Newsnight if he agreed he was a \u201cbit lacklustre\u201d. You\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t find that format really worked for me. I\u2019m going to have to learn how I flourish in a strange format in an alternative reality. Stewart was seen to take his tie off during the debate. Asked why, he said: Well, I thought maybe, if I took my tie off, we could get back to a bit of reality. I was beginning to feel on those strange BBC white bar stools, that we were moving off into an alternate reality. He was asked whether he could carry on to the next stage on his own, or would need to join up with another of the candidates to make it through. I definitely think that we would all be in a stronger position if we could begin to combine. The problem, of course, that you\u2019re dealing with is that, with politicians, every single person thinks that they should be the leader, so the challenge in all these conversations is who\u2019s coming in behind who Asked to elaborate, he said: I\u2019ve said I wouldn\u2019t serve in a Boris government, but I like the other candidates very much and I would be making open offers to all of them. And he clarified that, in such a situation, he would be looking to be the leader. Rory Stewart has told Newsnight his performance was a bit \u201clacklustre\u201d tonight. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn Here is a Twitter thread from Abdullah Patel, who asked the question about Islamophobia in the debate. And this is what Rory Stewart\u2019s campaign is saying about the debate. A spokesperson said: Watching the debate it was clear that Rory was the sole voice of reality in the room. Sunlight on Boris is showing he will continue the Brexit fudge. No realistic plan that can be delivered, built for short term appeasement of colleagues rather than the long term good of our country and politics. And this is from Rory Stewart. As well as complaining about the BBC chair being uncomfortable, he says he came away from the debate thinking he was the only person committed to Brexit, because the policies backed by the other candidates would just lead to delay, he claimed. And here is a tweet from Sajid Javid, responding to one from Piers Morgan. These are from Jeremy Hunt. These are from Michael Gove. And this is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the debate on Twitter. They are not impressed. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuennsberg From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil From the novelist and political writer Robert Harris From the Financial Times\u2019 Robert Shrimsley From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Kevin Maguire From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole From the Times\u2019 Jenni Russell From the FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne From Metro\u2019s Joel Taylor Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s take on the winners and losers tonight. This is from Adam Fleming, the BBC\u2019s Brussels correspondent, It is hard to recall any other televised leadership debate that reflected so badly on the party concerned. This went out in a BBC primetime slot and yet, the biggest issue of the day, Brexit, the five people vying to be the next PM singularly failed to allay the concerns that were put to them by viewers. Will no-deal put by husband out of business? Don\u2019t worry, there will be some \u201ceconomic turbulence\u201d, but we\u2019ll get through it, said Michael Gove. Will you be able to keep the Irish border open? All the candidates said it should be kept open, but none could say how. In fact, on Brexit, no one could answer the how question at all. And, once the topic turned away from Brexit, there were unfunded promises on tax and a general recognition that public services are stretched - without any acknowledgment that the government all five have supported has been responsible. On social media there have been some complaints that Tory leadership coverage crowds out the Labour/opposition perspective, but it is hard to see how anyone at CCHQ might view this as positive coverage for the party. Jeremy Corbyn should be demanding Tory leadership debates on air every night. Whether this will make any difference to the leadership election is a different matter. Sajid Javid probably had the best night, mostly for the lovely moment when he bounced his reluctant colleagues into agreeing an external inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory party. This may come to nothing in the end, but Javid looked decisive. If only solving Brexit were that easy. Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove both did relatively okay. As the candidate with the most distinctive message on Brexit, and on taxation and public services, Rory Stewart would probably win the support of the 50% of the public on that side of the argument. But they are not well represented in the Conservative party, and his evasive answer in response to Javid\u2019s probing on the President Trump/Katie Hopkins tweet probably lost him a lot of ground with liberal Britain. Boris Johnson probably had the worst night. His attempt to excuse his gaffe about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was an obvious mistake. (Even if, as he claimed, his words did not make a difference to her incarceration, that was not the argument to make - he should have just said he made a mistake, and was sorry.) On Brexit he was unconvincing (as was everyone else.) And forgetting the imam\u2019s name was a very trivial mishap, but it was one that appeared to confirm a negative view many people have of him - that he has a casual disregard for some people who are not white. Debates don\u2019t make as much difference as people think, and Johnson remains the overall favourite to become next prime minister. But leadership contests are supposed to invigorate a party and leave it looking more attractive to the public. On the basis of tonight, it is hard to see that happening to the Conservatives this summer. Q: If you become PM, you will have no mandate from the public. When will you do the right thing and call an election? Johnson says the Labour party don\u2019t want an election. He does not think anyone in the Commons wants one. Q: But you said, when Gordon Brown took over as PM, it was arrogant not to have an election. What is different? Johnson says this is different. The next leader will be taking over at a time of crisis. Hunt says there must be no election until the government has delivered Brexit. Stewart says there must be no election until they have recovered trust. Gove says after Brexit the government can address other things. And then the Tories can take on Jeremy Corbyn, a \u201cdiscredited Marxist\u201d. Javid says they must deliver Brexit first. By 31 October, says Johnson. And that\u2019s it. Javid says his 16-year-old daughter has asked him about this a lot. We have done a lot, but \u201cnowhere near enough\u201d. Becoming carbon neutral will take time. But we need to be a lot more ambitious. The questioner says none of the panel has impressed her. Q: Would you commit to getting net carbon emissions down to zero by 2025? Johnson says he will commit to putting the environment at the heart of his programme. Gove says he has met and praised Greta Thunberg. He has a 25-year environment plan. Q: [To Johnson] Will you stop Heathrow expansion? Johnson says he continues to have \u201cgrave reservations\u201d about this. Q: Will you stop it? Johnson says he has \u201cgrave concerns\u201d. There are court cases under way, he says. He will follow them closely. Johnson refuses to say he would stop the Heathrow third runway going ahead - even though in the past he has opposed it strongly. Javid asks Stewart why he was not willing to criticise Trump over the Katie Hopkins speech. Stewart is on the defensive, and stresses the importance of diplomacy. Q: I\u2019m the imam of a mosque. I see the impact of Islamophobia. Do you accept words have consequences? Johnson says of course he does. In so far as people have taken words out of his articles and escalated, he is sorry for that. But his Muslim great-grandfather came to this country because he thought it would be a beacon of decency. He forgets the name of the questioner (Abdullah). Q: Do you accept words have consequences. Your words about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe did? Johnson says in this case, he does not think his words did have consequences. It was the Iranian regime that is responsible for what happened to Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Q: [To Hunt] And you have endorsed President Trump retweeting comments from Katie Hopkins. Hunt says that is wrong. He backed Trump\u2019s point about Sadiq Khan having a poor record on crime. But he totally rejects Katie Hopkins\u2019 inflammatory language. He says he is married to an immigrant. His children are half-Chinese. But when they go to school they are treated as equals, because we are a tolerant society. Javid says he would be happy for an external investigation into Islamophobia in the Tory party. He invites the others: \u2018Do you all agree?\u2019 Half-heartedly, most of them seem to. That\u2019s it then, says Javid. He says it will happen. Javid appears to bounce his rivals into accepting an external investigation into Islamophobia in the Conservative party. Stewart says the adult social care system is a disgrace. We have not funded it properly because we have not got out of party silos, he says. Gove asks: \u201cWhat is your plan?\u201d He says the plan is there in the Dilnot plan. Hunt says some of the cuts in social care went too far. Hunt says his own government has cut the social care budget too much. Local authorities need more, he says. He says we leave dealing with mental health too late. He says too many children leave school without being able to read and write properly. Johnson says we need to invest much more in education. And we need to join up our mental health system, he says. Stewart says you need taxes to fund public services. He says we can plan for how AI and robotics will change the world of work. Javid says he has relied on public services. Q: But you supported cuts? Javid says he would prioritise health and education. Tax cuts can sometimes lead to more revenue, he says. And the country can afford to borrow more, he says. Q: I have fostered more than 100 children. What would you do to reverse cuts that have affected children? Gove says he started his life in care. He says he has a detailed plan to target money on the poorest. Q: What cuts would you reverse? Gove says he introduced changes that make adoption easier. He will not reverse those. Gove says he is the candidate most committed to working people. He says Johnson\u2019s tax plan, which would help people like MPs, is wrong. He says Jeremy Corbyn is not interested in standing up for working people. He is only interested in defending Iran. Stewart says everyone else in the contest is promising things that are not realistic. Collectively, his rivals have promised cuts worth \u00a384bn. He says it is not the time for tax cuts. If he could deliver a realistic Brexit, he would spend money on public services. The questioner says he thinks Hunt was the candidate talking most sense. He says he disagreed strongly with Stewart. Q: I used to vote Tory, but now vote for the Brexit party. What is your plan to lift the tax burden on the working classes? Javid says the government has addressed the deficit. He thinks we can now cut taxes for working people. He would do this by cutting the basic rate of tax. Q: [To Hunt] You have said your priority is to cut corporation tax. But it has been cut a lot already, almost every year. Hunt says cutting corporation tax would turbo-charge the economy. People say the Tories are the party of the rich. They must never fall into the trap of encouraging this idea. Q: [To Johnson] Under your plan, people on \u00a379,000 would not be in the higher tax rate? Johnson says, as mayor of London, he increased the minimum wage. But he also favours having a debate about the threshold for the higher rate of tax. He says people like nurses should not be in this bracket. Q: Would it definitely go ahead? Johnson says his priority would be to raise the tax threshold. But it is right to have an \u201cambition\u201d to lift the threshold for the higher rate of tax. Johnson appears to scale back his commitment to raising the higher rate tax threshold, describing it as just an \u201cambition\u201d. The questioner says the panel have not answered his question. There is a lot of confusion about this in Northern Ireland, he says. He hopes there will be more clarity in future. Stewart says he is sure that Johnson, like him, has sat in Enniskillen with a sheep farmer. What would he tell him about tariffs? Johnson says there will be no tariffs. There will be a standstill, he says, under GATT 24. Johnson suggests using article 24 of the WTO could be part of the solution. This is an option dismissed by many experts. Gove says he has worked in Northern Ireland. He says he has a plan. Stewart says the extension Johnson is talking about is conditional on a withdrawal agreement. Q: How would you solve the Irish border issue? Hunt says there must be no return to having border infrastructure in Northern Ireland. He says what was problematic about the backstop was the plan to keep the UK in the customs union until there was a solution to the border issue. Q: [To Javid] You want to give \u00a3500m to Ireland. You think money will just solve this? Javid says, as a home secretary, he knows how important the peace process has been. He would have a time limit on the backstop. Q: The Irish will agree? Javid says the current backstop will not get through parliament. The Irish understand this. Q: Leo Varadkar said this weekend there would be no deal without a backstop. Johnson says he agrees with \u201cSaj and Jeremy\u201d. There will be no return to a hard border, he says. He says you can solve the border issue during the implementation period after getting a deal. Stewart says there will be no implementation period unless the UK agrees a deal. Q: Why will the EU agree? Johnson says having Brexit party MEPs will make a difference. And the EU doesn\u2019t want no deal, he says. Stewart says all the others have to say how they will get no deal through parliament. Johnson says it is important to prepare for no deal. It is responsible. A huge amount of work has been done, he says. Javid says we have not prepared well enough in the past. You prepare for no deal precisely because you want a deal, he says. Johnson says: \u201cSaj is absolutely right.\u201d Hunt says the questioner\u2019s husband is in the property business. He will know that the only way to get a deal is to be willing to walk away. But no deal should only be \u201ca very, very last resort\u201d. The questioner says she is not reassured. She is \u201creally concerned about the future for my children\u201d. One is in the City, one is training to be a vet, and one is going to university. No one can give a good answer as to what will happen if there is no deal. Johnson says we will come out on terms that protect the UK. Stewart says if he was prime minister he would rule out no deal. Stewart says he would never accept a no-deal Brexit. Hunt says that means he would be willing to give up on Brexit. Q: My husband is in the property business. Under no deal, he could lose his job. Why are you even contemplating no deal? Because we have to leave the EU, says Gove. He says a no-deal Brexit \u201cwould create some economic turbulence\u201d. Some parts of the UK would suffer. But we must put our democracy first. Q: Can\u2019t you say anything to reassure the questioner? Gove says we are a great country. We can get through this. Hunt mentions a sheep farmer he met whose business would be destroyed by tariffs on lamb. That farmer would say to Johnson: \u2018You\u2019ve got your dream, but mine [under no-deal] has been destroyed.\u2019 Johnson insists there is a solution to the backstop. Javid says you need to have a deadline. Anyone who has negotiated anything knows you have to have a deadline. Rory Stewart says MPs must do what the public said. But they also owe people \u201ctrust\u201d. It will not be possible to negotiate a new deal by 31 October, he says. It would take a long time to get a new deal. He would not waste time trying to get a new deal. He would say to colleagues \u201ctake the shock of the European elections\u201d and get this done. Q: This is the May approach that failed, isn\u2019t it? Stewart says we are in a room with a door, called parliament. He is the only person trying to find the key to the door. Everyone else is running at the door shouting \u201cbelief in Britain\u201d. Gove says we have run into the door three times already. He says Stewart just wants to serve up the same \u201ccold porridge\u201d again. Q: Would you definitely leave before the end of 2019? Gove says he would leave in 2019. Gove signals he would leave the EU before the end of 2019. He said Johnson \u201cjoined\u201d him on the Vote Leave campaign. But he says he disagrees with Johnson about the need to make 31 October a hard deadline. Michael Gove says he was committed to Brexit before the others. But he agrees with Hunt about the need to delay a bit if, by 31 October, a deal is close. He says sometimes in football you have extra time. Sajid Javid thanks the questioner for voting Tory in the past and says it is \u201cessential that we act on those instructions\u201d from the British people. \u201cThey are our bosses.\u201d He says it is fundamental that Brexit must happen by 31 October. Javid rules out any extension of Brexit beyond 31 October. Q: As a lifelong Tory voter, I voted for the Brexit party at the European elections. Can you guarantee that you will get your Brexit plan through the Commons by 31 October? Boris Johnson says the questioner is right. We must get Brexit through by 31 October. If we don\u2019t, \u201cwe will all start to pay a really serious price\u201d. Politicians need to act maturely and soberly and get this done, he says. Jeremy Hunt says if, by 31 October, there was no prospect of a deal, he would leave. But if they were \u201cnearly there\u201d, he would conclude the deal. (Neither Johnson nor Hunt address the how part of this question at all.) Maitlis says the questions will come in from across the UK. Emily Maitlis introduces the programme. She says one of the men on stage will be the next PM. BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham has more on the tweets Tory MPs are getting from Rory Stewart. (See 7.52pm.) And these are from Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. The BBC debate starts at 8pm. Emily Maitlis, who will present it, explains here how it will work. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has sketched out a series of negotiating demands if the next prime minister wants to open talks on new powers for the Scottish parliament, assuming the Tories try to head off a fresh independence vote. Interviewed by Chris Deerin, the director of the centre-right thinktank Reform Scotland, Sturgeon said that top of her shopping list would be devolved powers over immigration to tackle Scotland\u2019s significant demographic problems, with a falling birth rate and a growing elderly population. She said the next demand would be greater tax powers for Holyrood, including VAT, national insurance and business taxation. Sturgeon said a \u201cbalanced basket of taxes\u201d would allow Scotland to make more sophisticated economic decisions. And she added that if Boris Johnson or another Tory PM cut income taxes in the rest of the UK, a key pledge of many candidates, she may need to think carefully about further income tax rises in Scotland. \u201cThe competitivity of our tax system is something we will never be complacent about,\u201d she said. She suggested new talks over Scotland\u2019s devolved powers were already on Johnson\u2019s mind, specifically giving Holyrood control over nearly all of its tax and spending decisions. She quipped that after a recent second world war commemoration event, Johnson asked her: \u201cSo Nicola: full fiscal autonomy. Does that buy you guys off?\u201d Sturgeon has been focusing heavily on the rightwards, pro-Brexit drift of the contest to succeed Theresa May as a fresh justification for a new independence referendum, with her government tabling legislation to run such a vote. Backing for independence has slightly increased in the polls, bringing it within a few points of reaching 50% support. Many commentators and Scottish politicians believe victory for Johnson will tip that into majority support for independence. That could point to Johnson or any other victor starting the conversations Deerin raises. Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexiter, says that now Dominic Raab has been eliminated she will vote for Boris Johnson. There are 30 Raab votes available for redistribution. It would be a surprise if most of them did not go to Johnson, who is now the most pro-Brexit figure in the race. Of the five remaining candidates in the contest, only he and Michael Gove voted in 2016 to leave. But Johnson resigned from cabinet over Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan and voted against it twice (before voting for it in the final vote). Gove backed May\u2019s plan all the way and, unlike Johnson, has not ruled out extending article 50 again. Here is more on Nicola Sturgeon from my colleague Severin Carrell. Nicola Sturgeon has said that Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201calmost certain\u201d election as the next Conservative leader has proven how sharply Scotland is now diverging from the rest of the UK, increasing the case for independence. In a speech to mark 20 years since devolution, the first minister said Johnson\u2019s apparent relish for a no-deal Brexit, and his \u201cgratuitously offensive\u201d opinions about women and minorities are in stark contrast to Scotland\u2019s open, diverse and tolerant politics. Many Scottish National party politicians and strategists, and some Tories, believe Johnson\u2019s victory will turbo-charge Sturgeon\u2019s quest for a fresh Scottish independence referendum, doubly so if he successfully leads the UK out of the EU. Speaking to Reform Scotland, a centre-right thinktank, Sturgeon reminded the audience her government was tabling referendum legislation to pave the way for a new vote at some point in future. She said: It is surely deeply concerning that the Conservative party is even contemplating putting into the office of prime minister someone whose tenure as foreign secretary was risible, lacking in any seriousness of purpose or basic competence and who, over the years, has gratuitously offended so many, from gay people, to Africans, Muslim women and many others. But while that, for now, is a matter for the Tories it does further illustrate the different political trajectories of Scotland and other parts of the UK. And it raises the more fundamental question of whether the UK and therefore devolution, in its current form is capable of accommodating those differences. I have to be candid and admit I\u2019m not a neutral observer of these matters but it does seem to me that these days, the unionist offer to Scotland amounts to not much more than: \u2018Your views don\u2019t matter, do as you\u2019re told and, if you don\u2019t like it, tough, we\u2019ll do it anyway.\u2019 Brexit starkly illustrates the point. The votes of people here have been ignored. The Scottish government\u2019s attempt at compromise was rejected. And voters in the Scottish parliament opposing Brexit and a subsequent power grab were disregarded. And this is from Boris Johnson. This is from Rory Stewart. In an article for Guardian Opinion, Tom Kibasi, the head of the IPPR thinktank, argues that, even though Boris Johnson looks unstoppable, Rory Stewart has reshaped the race. Here\u2019s an extract: Even though Stewart has little chance of winning, he has still reshaped the race. By relentlessly exposing the deceit of his fellow candidates, Stewart\u2019s campaign leaves Johnson weakened as he heads towards the realisation of his only guiding principle: the ambition to be prime minister. Stewart has been very effective at exposing the lie that the withdrawal agreement can be renegotiated through force of personality. He has made plain that a plan predicated on renegotiating it is in truth a plan for a no-deal exit at the end of October. As the Institute for Public Policy Research progressive thinktank has pointed out today, there are still 10 major questions that no-deal advocates have been unable to answer, from fishing to trading agreements. And here is the whole article. Here is the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush\u2019s blogpost on the results. Among other things, he says Rory Stewart is the big winner, but that he may now have hit his ceiling. The big winner is Rory Stewart, however. He now gets a shot at that big televised debate, where he could yet transform the whole contest. His candidacy may well be reaching its ceiling of support and Johnson\u2019s big lead among MPs means he will be well-placed to choose his preferred opponent, who will not be Stewart. But even should he fall short at the next hurdle, he ends this contest as the de facto leader of the Conservative opponents of no deal: and as someone who, albeit from the backbenches, will be a major voice in the Brexit debates. From the Sunday Times\u2019 Tim Shipman These are from Sajid Javid. This is from Michael Gove. Gillian Keegan, the Chichester MP and a supporter of Rory Stewart, told reporters after the result was announced the momentum was with his campaign. She said: They\u2019re very close now. There\u2019s a clear winner, and between the others there are not many votes It\u2019s very rewarding. Rory\u2019s campaign is basically honest about where we are as a country. He\u2019s basically telling people the uncomfortable truth in some cases, but he\u2019s being honest. And who knew there was a market for honesty in politics? I\u2019d always hoped that there was. Mark Francois, the strongly Brexit-minded MP who supports Boris Johnson rather than Dominic Raab, said it was sad that Raab had been eliminated. He went on: Whoever wins, and I hope it\u2019s Boris, I hope they find a good place for Dom in their cabinet, because I think he deserves it. This is from a spokesman for Jeremy Hunt\u2019s campaign. This is a solid result. It shows a steady step forward, which is exactly what we were expecting. It confirms that Jeremy is the best placed candidate to take on Boris. He\u2019s the only candidate who can unite the country and the party by delivering Brexit. A source in the Sajid Javid campaign says Javid will not be withdrawing from the contest before the next ballot, which is tomorrow. He put on 10 votes, the same as Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove and Dominic Raab combined, the source says. \u201cWe are fighting tomorrow\u2019s ballot.\u201d This is from a spokesperson for the Rory Stewart campaign. This is a fantastic result for Rory \u2013 almost doubling his vote \u2013 with the biggest increase of all the candidates. This shows his momentum is continuing to build. He can now go all the way to the final two, giving the clear choice that members deserve. Rory is running a positive campaign that is reaching across the country and he invites MPs to join his team \u2013 leave or remain, frontbencher or backbencher. The moment is here. Together we can get Brexit done, put honesty and trust at the heart of all we do, and make this country fairer, greener and more united. Here are some thoughts on the result. 1) This is a messy, inconclusive result that suggests in the one contest that really counts, the fight for the second-place slot on the final ballot, there are potentially three candidates - Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove and Rory Stewart. 2) Stewart is the candidate with the most momentum. That does not make him a prospective winner by any stretch but there is now a credible path by which he could make it on to the final ballot. He is unlikely to pick up any of the 30 votes that went to Dominic Raab and are now up for grabs because Raab was the most hardline Brexit candidate, and Stewart is at the other end of the spectrum. But if Sajid Javid\u2019s supporters were to tuck in behind Stewart, his vote would rise to 70. In practice, votes never get redistributed that simply, but last week the fight for second place looked like a Hunt/Gove contest. Now Stewart is in contention. 3) Hunt\u2019s lead over Gove has slipped from six votes to five. But Gove could plausibly expect to pick up more of the 30 Raab votes, because they were both leading figures of the Vote Leave campaign. It is very possible that Gove could overhaul Hunt. 4) Johnson is still the overall favourite, but it does feel as if his campaign is losing momentum. There were 50 votes available after the elimination of Matt Hancock, Andrea Leadsom, Mark Harper and Esther McVey. Johnson picked up just 12 of them despite being seen as the overwhelming favourite. He is still not performing as well as Theresa May did in 2016, when she got 50% of the vote in the first ballot. That said, surveys of the membership show he is much more popular with then than any of his rivals and it is still hard to see how he can be beaten. (See 12.23pm.) 5) The result means Raab won\u2019t be taking part in the TV debate tonight, so we may see a repeat of what happened on Sunday night: all the other candidates ganging up on the one candidate (now Johnson) who has not publicly ruled out proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. Given what Tory members seem to think about Brexit (see 11.05am), that may not do him any harm at all. 6) But it does mean Stewart will be in the debate - and he is a potential threat to Johnson because he has been the one candidate willing to denounce Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan as bogus. And here are the results with changes from last Thursday, and overall percentages (rounded up). Boris Johnson - 126 - up 12 - 40% Jeremy Hunt \u2013 46 - up 3 - 15% Michael Gove \u2013 41 - up 4 - 13% Rory Stewart \u2013 37 - up 18 - 12% Sajid Javid \u2013 33 - up 10 - 11% Dominic Raab \u2013 30 - up 3 - 10% Gillan confirms that five candidates will go through: Boris Johnson Jeremy Hunt Michael Gove Rory Stewart Sajid Javid And all five will be in the debate tonight. Cheryl Gillan, the joint acting chair of the 1922 Committee, is now reading out the results. All 313 Tory MPs voted, she says. There were no spoiled ballot papers. Boris Johnson - 126 Jeremy Hunt \u2013 46 Michael Gove \u2013 41 Rory Stewart \u2013 37 Sajid Javid \u2013 33 Dominic Raab \u2013 30 This is from my colleague Peter Walker, who is in committee room 14 where the result is due to announced at 6pm. Stephen Crabb, the former cabinet minister who is backing Sajid Javid for the leadership, has just told BBC News the party should stop choosing Etonians as leader. He said: I\u2019ve got nothing against Etonians. The very best boss I ever had in working life was an Etonian, David Cameron, but I think there is an issue for our party if we keep going back to the same school over and over again for our senior politicians. There is something not quite right about that. We pride ourselves on being a meritocratic party ... We should genuinely look like that at the top of the party. Of course two of the candidates still in the contest, Boris Johnson and Rory Stewart, are Etonians. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope. The SNP has described today\u2019s YouGov poll showing a majority of Conservative party members would prefer to go ahead with Brexit even if it led to the break-up of the UK as a \u201cdisaster\u201d for Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader. (See 11.05am.) This is from Keith Brown, the SNP\u2019s deputy leader (or depute leader, to use the Scots word the SNP prefers). The Tory party has clearly gone off the deep end \u2013 with their Brexit obsession pushing the party further towards the extremes. Tory members are so determined to deliver a damaging Brexit they are happy to watch our economy collapse and open the door of No 10 for Nigel Farage to take control of the UK. And far from prioritising the union, it\u2019s clear Scotland means so little to the members of the Conservative and Unionist party that two thirds are happy for Scotland to become independent if it secures Brexit. And with this poll suggesting that almost a quarter of Tory members in Scotland would prefer to deliver Brexit for their membership down south even if it means an end to the union it\u2019s becoming clearer that Ruth Davidson has little authority in her party in Scotland. This poll is an utter disaster for her and shows that her authority is seeping away at an incredible rate, leaving her increasingly isolated. Here is the BBC\u2019s Emily Maitlis showing the set being used tonight for the Tory leadership debate. There are five chairs on stage at the moment, but it is possible that the BBC might not need them all (if more than one candidate gets eliminated). From the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson The Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes has had a go at forecasting the result. From the BBC\u2019s Chris Mason Nicky Morgan, the Tory MP who chairs the Commons Treasury committee, has warned that borrowing would have to rise under the spending plans proposed by some Tory leadership candidates. Echoing a warning delivered by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, yesterday, Morgan told TheCityUK annual conference that a new prime minister would have around \u00a315bn of \u201cfiscal headroom\u201d set aside to help the economy in the event of a possible no-deal Brexit. She went on: Were the UK to leave with a deal he [the prime minister] would of course release that headroom as additional spending on other priorities. In either scenario the money will be spent, and in either scenario the chancellor believes he will stay within his fiscal rule. Of course, we are seeing some candidates that say they want a no deal but they also want to spend the headroom. I\u2019ll leave it to all of you to make your conclusions. Any new spending commitments or tax cuts made by a new prime minister in the coming months that are paid for by using the so-called fiscal headroom that has been built up \u2013 while at the same time leaving open the possibility that these commitments would still take place were the UK to leave the EU without a deal \u2013 the candidate and the new chancellor may find such a course of action will not be compatible with the current fiscal rules. The ballot has now closed. The papers are being counted, and the result is due at 6pm. These are from Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt. More from the committee room where Tory MPs are voting. The Independent\u2019s John Rentoul has been running a sweepstake on the results. From the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley Here is the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg on the committee corridor doorstep. David Lidington, the de facto deputy PM and a new convert to the Rory Stewart camp, was singing Stewart\u2019s praises to the media as he went to vote. Lidington said Stewart, the international development secretary, had \u201cgone out and he\u2019s told it straight as he sees things, and he\u2019s not been afraid, ever, of going into areas of conversation that might be difficult\u201d. Lidington said: And if the Conservative party is going to form a good working majority in the Commons we\u2019ve got to win back voters from both flanks that we\u2019ve lost. We have to show there are no no-go areas anywhere in the country and anywhere in society for the Conservative party, and I think Rory\u2019s campaign has demonstrated how we can set about doing that. Asked if his man had the necessary 33 votes to proceed, Lidington said: \u201cWell, I hope so. But I don\u2019t know.\u201d Earlier, Stewart had said he also hoped to get the votes, but that it would be very close. More from outside committee room 14. Simon Jack, the BBC\u2019s business editor, has written a good report of a private meeting that Boris Johnson, the favourite in the Tory leadership contest, had with around 40 business leaders this morning. Johnson is still under pressure to prove he is pro-business in the light of the row about his \u201cfuck business\u201d comment a year ago. According to Jack, Johnson said he would extend the Brexit transition, which is due to end at the end of next year under current plans, for an extra 12 months, until December 2021. Jack says: Mr Johnson\u2019s plan appeared to be to defer the negotiations over the problematic Irish backstop till after the UK leaves the EU on 31 October. He proposed extending the transition period till December 2021, which would give everyone enough time to negotiate a free-trade deal and come up with the technology to ensure no physical infrastructure would be required at the Irish border. Extending the transition until December 2021 is one feature of the Malthouse compromise, a plan that Johnson has enthusiastically backed. But in his recent public remarks on Brexit he has not specifically flagged up this part of the plan as one that he would pursue. Jack also says that, although Johnson restated his commitment to leave the EU by 31 October with or without a deal, his audience were not convinced he meant it. Jack says: When asked whether he was prepared to leave with no deal on 31 October, he said that it was not his preferred option, we had to prepare for no-deal and if necessary go through with it. One attendee I spoke to felt that \u201chis heart wasn\u2019t in that comment\u201d, another said, \u201cthe look in his eyes made you question whether he really meant that\u201d. There have been other hints from Johnson that he will shift on his 31 October deadline. At his campaign launch he refused to say he would resign if the UK was still in the EU after October, and in an interview with the World at One on Friday he said it would be wrong \u201cat this stage\u201d to signal a willingness to delay Brexit into November. Jack also says Johnson\u2019s decision to leave Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, to answer questions after he left did not go down well. [Johnson] left Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, to answer questions after he left the breakfast. The attendees who I spoke to found her unconvincing - \u201cshe lost the room\u201d according to one. As a long-time Johnson lieutenant she may yet win herself a big job. More from the committee corridor, where Tory MPs are voting. And here is Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, tweeting about the reciprocal voting rights treaty the UK has signed with Luxembourg. (See 3.17pm.) Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, says more than 1,000 Luxembourgers in the UK will benefit. The Brexit minister Robin Walker faced criticism from MPs from all sides when he answered an urgent question on citizens\u2019 rights after Brexit in the Commons earlier. (See 1.02pm.) The Conservative MP Alberto Costa said: It is inconceivable that that British government let along a Conservative government could allow the rights of British nationals, living, working, studying in the EU to vaporise on the 31 October. The Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said the \u201ccharlatans\u201d and \u201csnake oil\u201d running for leadership of the Tory party would \u201cagain tonight on TV be claiming that no deal will present no difficulties\u201d. He said what they meant was \u201cit will present no difficulties for them\u201d but it would mean reciprocal health care for UK citizens retired in the EU would disappear. Walker told MPs that the government had written to all member states regarding health care and that the government remained \u201ccommitted to delivering on citizens\u2019 rights\u201d and had already secured a bilateral agreement on voting rights with Spain, Portugal and Luxembourg. MPs have starting voting in the next round of the Conservative leadership contest. This is from my colleague Peter Walker. Last week a reader asked for a graphic showing which parts of the country are represented by the Tory leadership candidates. So here it is - showing the constituencies represented by the six candidates still in the race, as well as by the four candidates who have pulled out. The Conservatives dominate seats in the south of England and so it\u2019s no great surprise that four of the six candidates left in the contest are from seats in the south east of England or London. Three of them - Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove and Dominic Raab - are from just one county, Surrey (which is a fine place, but perhaps not especially representative of the UK as a whole). Rory Stewart is the only candidate from a seat in the north, Penrith and The Border in Cumbria. That does not directly explain why he is the person most at odds with what all the rest of the candidates are saying on the key issue of the campaign, Brexit, but it may be a factor. Stewart has spoken repeatedly about how he fears the sheep farmers he represents would suffer very badly under a no-deal. Boris Johnson represents Uxbridge and South Ruislip on the edge of west London, which is not an area dependent on lamb exports. Nicola Sturgeon is expected to warn that the next Tory prime minister will cause more economic damage to Scotland in their first 18 weeks in power than Margaret Thatcher and John Major caused in 18 years in government. In a speech to mark 20 years of devolution in Edinburgh on Wednesday evening, Sturgeon is due to attack Conservative leadership candidates for failing to rule out a no-deal Brexit this October. She will argue the drive to set up the Scottish parliament in 1999 came from a hunger for social and political justice following 18 years of Tory rule from Westminster; the Tories ran the Scottish Office \u2013 the UK government department charged with running the country, despite having only a small minority of Scottish MPs. Speaking to Reform Scotland, a centre right think tank, she is due to say: Immense damage to Scottish communities was caused by an out of touch Conservative party that governed, unelected in Scotland, for 18 years. But now I fear a similarly out of touch Tory party, led by an even more reckless leader, could cause as much damage as Mrs Thatcher and John Major did. But while they took 18 years, he, whoever it is, could do as much \u2013 or more \u2013 damage in just 18 weeks. Because by the end of October, Scotland could be heading for a no-deal Brexit. And crashing out of Europe will be the springboard for a new independence referendum, she said. That\u2019s why, for all the undoubted successes of devolution, this has to be a time for taking stock. Scotland must have the option of choosing a different course. The next six months could offer challenges greater than anything we have seen in the last 20 years. In my view they will inevitably require greater powers for Scotland \u2013 indeed the full powers that come with independence. The Thatcher/Major governments are blamed by Labour and the Scottish National party for their aggressive industrial and privatisation policies, which led to significant job losses and closures in Scotland\u2019s heavy industries, including ship-building and coal mining, decimating communities as in other parts of the UK. Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, has has received the backing of Andrea Leadsom ahead of the second ballot for the Tory leadership contest. Johnson was far ahead in the first ballot last week, with 114 votes, more than the next three contenders, Jeremy Hunt (43), Michael Gove (37) and Dominic Raab (27) combined. Sajid Javid, who got 23 votes last week, and Rory Stewart (19) are also still in the contest. The candidate who comes last will get eliminated later, as well as any candidate receiving fewer than 33 votes. Stewart\u2019s team say they think they have 33 votes, but \u201cit\u2019s tight\u201d. Raab\u2019s team say they are \u201cquietly confident\u201d of reaching this threshold, and Javid\u2019s team say it is going to be \u201cclose\u201d. All candidates still in the race after the results are announced at 6pm will then take part in a BBC hustings starting at 8pm. Conservative members would be prepared to sacrifice the union, destroy their party or suffer economic damage rather than give up on Brexit being delivered, a poll has suggested. (See 11.05am.) Jeremy Hunt has implied that Boris Johnson could not deliver Brexit because EU leaders so not trust him. Speaking to the Evening Standard, he said: I\u2019ve not met a single European leader who doesn\u2019t want to avoid no deal and if you put in front of them someone they are prepared to negotiate with, someone they trust \u2014 no one ever does a deal with someone they don\u2019t trust \u2014 I am that person. Michael Gove has urged Tory MPs not to put Rory Stewart in the final two for the ballot of party members. In an article for the Times (paywall), he suggested this would polarise the party because Stewart did not believe in Brexit. He said: It would be a mistake to put forward two candidates to the final round who will polarise our party. We need candidates who both embrace Brexit\u2019s opportunities and can deliver. I\u2019m the only candidate in this race who both believes in Brexit through and through and who all the other contenders would willingly serve under. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Sajid Javid also claimed Stewart was a remain candidate. Stewart denied this, and said he was now committed to delivering \u201ca moderate and pragmatic Brexit\u201d. (See 10.32am.) Rory Stewart has been rounded on by his fellow Conservative leadership candidates as they fear he has the momentum to take on Boris Johnson, while his background as a probable MI6 spy also came under scrutiny. Britain is being led to a no-deal Brexit by a political elite \u201cwhich has great difficulties discerning and telling the truth\u201d, the UK\u2019s former ambassador to the EU has said, in a withering assessment of the Conservative candidates vying to be prime minister. As Daniel Boffey reports, Ivan Rogers, who resigned from his post in 2017 after clashing with Theresa May\u2019s senior advisers, suggested it was \u201cprobable\u201d the UK would leave the EU without a deal in what he described as an act of \u201ceconomic lunacy\u201d.He said the Tory leadership election brought to mind the quote of the French statesman Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord about the Bourbons in that they had \u201clearned nothing and forgotten nothing\u201d. Prof David King, the former chief scientist, has expressed alarm at the prospect of Boris Johnson becoming prime minister because the Tory MP oversaw \u201cdevastating\u201d cuts in efforts to tackle the climate crisis when he was foreign secretary and then wanted to hush them up. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, has rejected an appeal by the UK\u2019s Brexit secretary for the full gamut of citizens\u2019 rights in the withdrawal agreement to be protected in the event of a no-deal exit. Philip Hammond is so frustrated by Theresa May\u2019s plans to spend billions of pounds on projects to shore up her legacy that he considered resigning, according to government sources. Commenting on this report, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists: It\u2019s been quite hard keeping up with all the anonymous quotes from friends of the chancellor in recent days. But I would simply say he was in cabinet this morning and offering his views across a wide range of topics. Downing Street has said Theresa May is backing the Labour MP Stella Creasy\u2019s call for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority to offer more support for MPs with young children. This is from my colleague Peter Walker. Dominic Raab, the Tory leadership contender, has released a campaign video today stressing his commitment to education, and to expanding apprenticeships. Paul Crowther, the man who threw a milkshake over Nigel Farage during a city centre walkabout, has been sentenced to 150 hours\u2019 unpaid work, the Press Association reports. He has also been ordered to pay \u00a3350 in compensation to Farage for damage to a lapel microphone and for suit cleaning. Crowther admitted common assault and criminal damage. Here\u2019s the full story: From the Sunday Times\u2019 Tim Shipman Alberto Costa, the Conservative MP who pushed for a rethink of government policy on European citizens\u2019 rights post-Brexit, said it was no surprise that Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator rejected the UK proposal. In the House of Commons later today, he will use an urgent question to call on the government to launch a UK taskforce to address the issue. He told the Guardian: \u201cThe UK government needs to do a lot lot more. Simply to write a letter to Barnier and expect a positive response is not good enough. The government have not been trying enough to secure EU citizens\u2019s rights.\u201d Costa, whose parents immigrated from Italy to the UK, was forced to resign as parliamentary private secretary to the Scotland secretary, David Mundell, in February after tabling the amendment to ringfence EU citizens\u2019 right, against what was then government policy. He won unanimous backing in the house and is now calling for a taskforce to be set up to secure all rights of EU citizens in the event of no deal. He also wants those citizens to be able to simply declare they are living and settled in the UK rather than be forced to apply to remain in the UK under the Home Office\u2019s settled status scheme. Although Barnier rebuffed the UK government, it is widely accepted that the European commission does not have the power to ringfence EU citizens\u2019 rights even if it could re-open the withdrawal agreement. This is because the power over issues such as healthcare and social benefits is a national competency, and Brussels cannot order member states to do a deal. \u201cNever before in peacetime have the rights of innocent millions of people been put on the table, that\u2019s 1.2 million in the EU and 3.6 million in the UK,\u201d Costa told the BBC. The ConservativeHome website conducts regular surveys of Conservative party members, including covering who they would like as their next leader. According to the latest, published today, 55% of members want Johnson \u2013 his highest ever score in these tables. Rory Stewart is in second place, but he is well behind, on just 16%, followed by Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid, all in single figures. These are from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. This is from David Gauke, the justice secretary, who is backing Rory Stewart. In a Coffee House blogpost last night, Fraser Nelson, the Spectator editor, suggested the Boris Johnson camp might lend some votes to Jeremy Hunt to ensure Hunt makes it through to the final two rather than Michael Gove, an opponent seen as more of a threat. Nelson says: At the hustings held by the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs this evening, the question wasn\u2019t who was going to win but who should be sent to put Boris Johnson through his paces before he wins. Word is that Team Boris is lending about 15 votes to Jeremy Hunt, who he\u2019d most like to go up against. Which isn\u2019t much: Boris is understood to have over 150 supporters now \u2013 so he could lend 40 votes to Hunt if he wanted. But he is more likely to keep the number low so the vote-lending isn\u2019t obvious. Ignoring the first rule of journalism (the editor is always right \u2013 at least, she always is at the Guardian), James Forsyth, the Spectator\u2019s political editor, says he\u2019s not convinced. Turning back to polling, Opinium has published the results of a poll of people who watched at least some of the Channel 4 Tory leadership candidates debate on Sunday night. Among those who watched at least some of it, Rory Stewart was seen as the winner. But Stewart was getting a lot of his support in this survey from Lib Dem and Labour backers. Among Tory supporters he was only narrowly ahead of Jeremy Hunt, the poll suggests. The poll also suggests that people reacted particularly badly to Michael Gove. (This result may reflect the important but often overlooked point that assessing who \u201cwins\u201d a debate is not straightforward. It is possible to win, in the sense of making arguments that clearly refute those of your opponents, while at the same time coming over as less likeable.) Opinium also says Stewart is now ahead on the measure of who would make the best PM. In its recent previous polls, Boris Johnson was ahead on this measure. As ever, it is best not to read too much into the findings of a single poll. This one should be treated with particular caution because it is based on a survey of just 610 people. Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has released the text of a letter (pdf) he sent to Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, reaffirming the government\u2019s commitment to protect the rights of EU nationals in the UK \u201cin any [Brexit] scenario\u201d and urging the EU to work with the UK on preparing plans to protect the rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU in the event of no deal. This has been welcomed by the3million, which represents the 3 million EU nationals in the UK. YouGov has published a remarkable poll, based on a survey of almost 900 Conservative party members. Officially they are members of the Conservative and Unionist party. But these findings suggest this party no longer exists \u2013 because effectively it has already become the Brexit party. Here are some of the key points. A majority of Conservative party members care more about delivering Brexit than they do about keeping either Scotland or Northern Ireland in the UK, the poll suggests. By more than two to ne, they would rather have Brexit, even if it led to Scotland becoming independent. They seem to worry a tiny bit more about losing Northern Ireland, but most would accept this as the price of Brexit. A majority of members would also rather have Brexit even if it led to \u201csignificant damage\u201d to the UK economy. And amazingly, a majority would still prefer Brexit even if it led to the Conservative party being destroyed. Tory members see the Brexit party as a bigger threat than the Labour party, the poll suggests. Almost half of Conservative members would be happy to have Nigel Farage as their leader, the poll suggests. Philip Hammond is so frustrated by Theresa May\u2019s plans to spend billions of pounds on projects to shore up her legacy that he considered resigning, according to government sources. As Rowena Mason reports, the chancellor is unhappy with the prime minister\u2019s decision to set out plans to spend up to \u00a327bn on education over three years, including building new schools and paying teachers higher wages. John McDonnell, Hammond\u2019s Labour shadow, says the chancellor should have resigned over the impact of his austerity policies. Labour has been fined a total of \u00a31,750 for inaccurate quarterly donations reports and an inaccurate spending return for the last general election, the Electoral Commission has said. As the Press Association reports, the elections watchdog also issued a \u00a3200 penalty to the Conservative party in Wakefield for the late delivery of its 2017 statement of accounts, which it paid on 23 May. Labour said: \u201cWe were happy to clear up these minor administrative issues.\u201d Sajid Javid, the home secretary, got the main 8.10 slot on the Today programme. Here are the main points from the interview. Javid claimed that Rory Stewart, one of his leadership rivals, was effectively the remain candidate. He said: I think [Stewart\u2019s] effectively telling us that we should remain in the EU and there is a small constituency amongst my colleagues that would rather remain than leave, and I think that is part of the challenge that we have to deal with. And so I think up to a point Rory can attract that support but it\u2019s not going to get us any further. Stewart later posted a tweet saying Javid was wrong. Javid described his own communication skills as \u201cless Homer\u2019s Iliad and more Homer Simpson\u201d. Making the point that he made in the press gallery hustings yesterday, about how he did not have the same elite education as his rivals, Javid said: I may have been culture secretary but I don\u2019t have the oratory of Cicero, it\u2019s less Homer\u2019s Iliad and more Homer Simpson. But I try my best to connect and I think it\u2019s very important as a modern Conservative party that we reach out to those modern audiences. This seemed a particular reference to Boris Johnson, who studied classics at Oxford. Javid said it was be a mistake if the final two candidates in the contest ended being very similar. If we end up in a situation where the final two, three, four even are people from similar backgrounds with similar life experiences and it will look like a debate at the Oxford Union and I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s healthy for the Tory party. Javid said if he were up against Johnson in the final round of the contest, he could \u201ctest\u201d him and make him even stronger. Javid explained: Even if it is Boris [as Tory leader], he needs to be properly tested. There cannot be a coronation. And I think, given my experience outside parliament, 20 years in business/finance, in the nine years I\u2019ve been in parliament, I\u2019ve worked in five government departments, I\u2019ve ran four of them, so I can really test Boris on so many issues, and he will come out an even stronger Boris. That\u2019s good for the whole country. Normally in a leadership contest candidates set out to defeat their opponents, not help them emerge stronger. The fact that Javid is making an argument like this (and Michael Gove was saying something a a bit similar yesterday) is a sign of how inevitable Johnson\u2019s victory now seems. From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth At the press gallery hustings yesterday Rory Stewart, the international development secretary and Tory leadership candidate, was asked if he had ever been in MI6? No, he replied (although he does have a family link \u2013 his father was deputy head of the organisation). But that answer may not as straightforward as it sounded. Today the Daily Telegraph has splashed on a story (paywall) quoting a Whitehall security source saying Stewart did work as a spy for at least seven years. This morning on the Today programme, Stewart suggested his denial was meaningless. Asked if the law would allow him to say he had been in MI6 if he had been, Stewart replied: No, and in fact the law wouldn\u2019t allow newspapers to reveal the identity of intelligence officers. Nick Robinson, the presenter, then put it to Stewart that he could not answer this question, and that he just had to say he served his country. Stewart replied: I definitely would say I served my country and if somebody asked me whether I am a spy I would say no. Robinson then said that that no \u201cmight not mean what everybody would mean by no\u201d and Stewart did not challenge this. Presumably Stewart could have just refused to answer the question yesterday about being a spy, but that would have been taken as confirmation. Good morning - on what will be an exciting day in the Conservative leadership contest. We\u2019ve got two big events. First, the second round of voting by MPs takes place this afternoon. There are six candidates still left in the contest \u2013 Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, Sajid Javid and Rory Stewart \u2013 and at one least one will be eliminated today (the person who comes last) and possibly more (because anyone not getting at least 33 votes will be out, under a new threshold introduced for this contest). Last week, it looked as though the only real interest would lie in whether Hunt or Gove would clinch the number two slot in the ballot for party members, up against Johnson, who is ahead by a mile. But since the first ballot last Thursday the Johnson and Stewart campaigns have been making impressive gains. At 6pm we might find out: a) Is Hunt still in second place? b) Who\u2019s been forced out? c) Does Stewart have any chance of getting on the final ballot? d) Does Johnson look even more unstoppable? And then, about two hours later, we will get the BBC debate featuring all the candidates still in the contest. Debates normally don\u2019t influence campaigns as much as people expect them to, but they can, and this one is eagerly awaited because Johnson, the runaway frontrunner who has largely avoided media scrutiny for months, has agreed to take part. Can any of the candidates upend him in a TV studio? We will find out. Johnson received a boost this morning when Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the Commons who was a candidate herself until forced out herself last week, used an LBC interview this morning to endorse him. As LBC reports, she explained her decision like this: I\u2019m going to be backing Boris Johnson for the next prime minister. Essentially, there\u2019s two key reasons. One is I think he is the best placed to get us out of the EU at the end of October. His view and mine are closely aligned there. Secondly, I do believe he is an election winner. He is someone who can bring the country and the party back together and take us forward in a positive way. And the third thing which is more nuanced really is that he and I share a scepticism about the HS2 project on the grounds of value for money. But he, at the same time, has a big commitment to improving infrastructure in the country to a pro-business agenda that will really get our ecomony to be motoring, which is essential in a post-Brexit world. Leadsom is a hardline Brexiter and her decision will be a disappointment to Raab, who will need to votes of people like Leadsom if he is to stay in the race. Her comments about Johnson\u2019s view on HS2 are also fascinating. As my colleagues Rowena Mason and Jessica Elgot report, there are claims that Johnson has been telling some supporters in private that he opposes the project, while telling others that he will allow it to go ahead. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 1.30pm: Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leadership contender, takes part in a Mumsnet Q&amp;A. 3pm: Tory MPs start voting in the second round of the leadership ballot. Voting closes at 5pm, and the result will be announced at about 6pm. 8pm: All the Tory leadership candidates left in the contest will take place in a BBC debate chaired by Emily Maitlis. You can submit potential questions on the BBC website here. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing almost exclusively mostly on the Tory leadership contest and the debate. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

But the gap is closing because alcohol sales grew in England and Wales last year.</p> <p>Scots still drank an average of 9.9 litres of pure alcohol last year, the figures showed, equal to 19 units per adult per week, or nearly 40 bottles of vodka a head. The <a href=\"https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Health/Services/Alcohol/safer-drinking\">chief medical officer\u2019s advice</a> is that while drinking no alcohol is best, it is safest not to drink more than 14 units a week on a regular basis to keep health risks at a low level.</p> <p>Minimum pricing has meant the average cost per unit is higher in Scotland, at 59p against 55p in England and Wales.</p> <p>The data does not cover a full year of minimum unit pricing in practice and an official evaluation of its effectiveness is not due to be published until later this year.

      "bodyText": "Alcohol sales in Scotland have fallen to their lowest level in 25 years after the introduction of price controls, figures show. Scotland\u2019s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, welcomed the figures, which also reveal a 3% fall in the consumption of alcohol last year, and said they showed the introduction of a 50p a unit minimum price in May 2018 was having an effect. It was a promising start in tackling Scotland\u2019s difficult relationship with alcohol, she said. \u201cThere are, on average, 22 alcohol-specific deaths every week in Scotland, and 683 hospital admissions, and behind every one of these statistics is a person, a family, and a community badly affected by alcohol harm,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cGiven the clear and proven link between consumption and harm, minimum unit pricing is the most effective and efficient way to tackle the cheap, high-strength alcohol that causes so much harm to so many families.\u201d Last year, Scotland became the first country to introduce minimum pricing for all alcoholic drinks although some elements of pricing controls have been used in Canada and other countries for more than 40 years. In Scotland, supermarkets and off-licences are banned from selling cheap or discounted spirits, wine, beers and cider, although online sales from suppliers outside Scotland are not affected. The new data from NHS Scotland\u2019s monitoring and evaluating Scotland\u2019s alcohol strategy (Mesas) project showed, however, that Scots still buy 9% more alcohol per head than people in England and Wales. But the gap is closing because alcohol sales grew in England and Wales last year. Scots still drank an average of 9.9 litres of pure alcohol last year, the figures showed, equal to 19 units per adult per week, or nearly 40 bottles of vodka a head. The chief medical officer\u2019s advice is that while drinking no alcohol is best, it is safest not to drink more than 14 units a week on a regular basis to keep health risks at a low level. Minimum pricing has meant the average cost per unit is higher in Scotland, at 59p against 55p in England and Wales. The data does not cover a full year of minimum unit pricing in practice and an official evaluation of its effectiveness is not due to be published until later this year. Even so, the early figures are likely to stoke calls for the UK government to introduce minimum pricing in England. The Welsh government is due to introduce a 50p minimum price this year. The Scottish government is due to consider raising the minimum price next year; it has been under pressure from the Scottish Liberal Democrats and others to set the price at at least 60p a unit. The 50p price was first set in 2012 but the policy was delayed by legal battles with the Scotch Whisky Association. Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said a 60p or greater minimum unit price would have a much more significant effect on alcohol misuse. \u201cThe value of the 50p price was eroded by inflation in the years the policy was caught up in the courts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is time to realise the policy\u2019s original ambition.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has again suggested that the wrongfully convicted teenagers in the Central Park Five case are guilty, and has declined to apologise for taking out print ads in 1989 that called for their execution. The case has been thrust into the limelight again with the release of Oscar-nominated director Ava DuVernay\u2019s Netflix series When They See Us, a fictionalised re-examination of the affair that gripped New York in the late 1980s. Before any of the five teenagers, all black or Hispanic, had been tried over the brutal rape of a white woman in Central Park, Trump, then a Manhattan real-estate tycoon, took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty to be reinstated in New York state. Those involved in the case later said Trump\u2019s ads had a significant impact on the trial and contributed to the wrongful conviction. The prosecution relied heavily on videotaped confessions, which defence lawyers argued were coerced. In 2002, after the boys had spent years in prison, a serial rapist named Matias Reyes confessed to the attack. His DNA linked him to the crime scene. The convictions against the five were vacated and the city settled a multimillion-dollar lawsuit. On Tuesday, as Trump headed to Orlando to launch his campaign for re-election, he was asked by reporters if he would apologise for his role in the saga. The president responded: \u201cWhy do you bring that question up now? It\u2019s an interesting time to bring it up. You have people on both sides of that. They admitted their guilt. If you look at Linda Fairstein, and you look at some of the prosecutors, they think that the city should never have settled that case. So, we\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d Trump\u2019s insistence despite evidence that the five were not guilty was a feature of the 2016 election. Since DuVernay\u2019s series was released, a number of officials involved in the prosecution have suffered significant backlash. Fairstein, the New York prosecutor turned novelist who was referenced by Trump on Tuesday, lost her publishing deal with Penguin Random House. Earlier this month Fairstein wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal defending her role in the case, while conceding it was right for the city to vacate the charges.

      "bodyText": "Steve Cooper has been coaching for a couple of decades, held the pro licence since the age of 26, worked at Liverpool as their academy manager and won the World Cup with England Under-17s, yet the Welshman knew there was something missing from his CV when he applied for the Swansea job and met Trevor Birch, the chairman. For all his achievements Cooper has next to no experience of working with senior players. \u201cIt\u2019s the obvious question to ask about me and I wanted to make sure that, when I had my meetings with Trevor, it wasn\u2019t the elephant in the room. It could be, easily,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWhenever a manager or head coach is appointed there are always questions and the obvious one with me is that it\u2019s my first senior job. But I wouldn\u2019t put myself in this position if I wasn\u2019t ready. The first person I asked if I was ready to work at senior level was myself. \u201cThe experiences I\u2019ve had up to now have all been ones with managerial responsibilities. At the World Cup in India I had 25 members of staff reporting to me. If you don\u2019t get that right or show good leadership or self-worth, then it can quickly fail. I\u2019ve been working towards that for a long time. Twelve months or so ago I was about 96% there. Now I\u2019m 100% ready. Yes, I\u2019ve still got to go and do it but I\u2019m fully equipped to do so.\u201d Aged 39, Cooper is a bold appointment on Swansea\u2019s part and it will be fascinating to see how their decision to steer clear of the usual names on the circuit \u2013 something the Welsh club have also done in the past \u2013 works out. There is already talk outside Swansea that success or failure for Cooper may determine how easily doors open for other youth coaches. \u201cI\u2019m aware that it could be beneficial to future appointments but, if I think about that too much, then I\u2019m not thinking about today and the job in hand,\u201d Cooper said. Cooper\u2019s playing philosophy, which is heavily influenced by the time he spent working at Liverpool under Pep Segura, who is now back at Barcelona as the club\u2019s general manager, was a key factor in Swansea\u2019s decision. Over the course of three interviews Cooper convinced Birch, Leon Britton, who is the football adviser to Swansea\u2019s board of directors, and Alan Curtis, the club president, that his playing principles were totally aligned to those of the club. \u201cFootball people like myself, and fans, have admired the recent history, the journey to the Premier League, the players that have been in the teams \u2013 everyone has looked with admiration,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cSo I know what that identity stands for, and that\u2019s what I believe in too, so it\u2019s a good match, a perfect fit. I\u2019ve watched every game since Christmas and lots before it. The team is in a really good place, willing to run and be brave on the ball. I\u2019m a football coach, I want to grow the players and the identity.\u201d Although Cooper\u2019s long-term goal is to try to get Swansea back in the Premier League by the end of his three-year contract, his immediate focus is on continuing the rebuilding job that Graham Potter started before departing for Brighton last month. It is a task that he is relishing but one made all the more difficult by the fact that Swansea have five senior players \u2013 Jordan Ayew, Andr\u00e9 Ayew, Borja Bast\u00f3n, Tom Carroll and Jefferson Montero \u2013 whom they are desperate to offload to reduce the wage bill and fill a \u00a315m financial hole. With that in mind, it was not surprising to hear Cooper talking about the need to be \u201ccreative\u201d when it comes to deals this summer and how he also hopes to utilise the loan market to strengthen a squad that is light after four experienced players were released at the end of last season and Daniel James was sold to Manchester United for \u00a315m. The reputation that Cooper built as coach during his time working for the Football Association, and the contacts that he made with leading Premier League clubs, could prove to be invaluable in that respect. \u201cIt\u2019s already started,\u201d said Cooper, when asked about trying to bring players in. \u201cAnd that process has been both ways, which has been quite rewarding really. Obviously I\u2019ll be approaching certain clubs about certain players but there\u2019s already been some mentions of players who would like to work together again.\u201d While Cooper went on to say that he had spoken to Gareth Southgate before accepting the Swansea job, and that he was grateful for the England manager\u2019s \u201ckind words and good advice\u201d, it was tempting to wonder what the conversation was like when he called his father to tell him the news. Keith, who had a distinguished career as a top-flight referee, is a Cardiff City supporter. \u201cHe\u2019s banned,\u201d said Cooper, laughing, before adding: \u201cThe family are very proud and I\u2019m doing it for them as much as everybody else. There\u2019s only one team they\u2019ll be wanting to win.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister,has once again<strong> </strong>approved a hotly contested proposal to expand the crude oil pipeline it bought last year, providing hope for a depressed energy industry but angering environmental and Indigenous groups that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/11/canada-pipeline-indigenous-trudeau-treaty\">fiercely opposed the project</a>.</p> <p>Construction on the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline is planned to start this year, Trudeau told a news conference on Tuesday. A senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said earlier that Ottawa expected legal challenges to the approval.</p> <p>The project would triple Trans Mountain\u2019s capacity to carry 890,000 barrels a day from Alberta\u2019s oil sands to British Columbia\u2019s Pacific coast, alleviate congestion on existing pipelines and diversify exports away from the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/canada-pipeline-map/\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/canada-pipeline-map/\">.</a> </figure>  <p>Trudeau, who faces a close election scheduled for October, has been under pressure from both western Canadian politicians who accuse him of doing too little for the struggling oil industry, and from environmental groups that fear spills.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t an either/or proposition. It is in Canada\u2019s national interest to protect our environment and invest in tomorrow, while making sure people can feed their families today,\u201d he said, adding he knew some people would be disappointed.</p> <p>The Liberal government previously approved the expansion in 2016 but that decision was overturned last year after a court ruled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/30/trans-mountain-pipeline-latest-canada-court-overturns\">the government had not adequately consulted </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/30/trans-mountain-pipeline-latest-canada-court-overturns\">Indigenous groups</a>.</p> <p>The approval was widely expected as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/29/canada-kinder-morgan-pipeline-trans-mountain\">the government spent C$4.5bn ($3.4bn</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/29/canada-kinder-morgan-pipeline-trans-mountain\">) to buy the 66-year-old pipeline</a> from Kinder Morgan last year to ensure that the expansion proceeded. Western Canada\u2019s oil production has expanded faster than pipeline capacity, causing a glut of crude to build up and pressure on Canadian prices.</p> <p>The pipeline would allow Canada to vastly increase exports to Asia, where it could command a higher price. Canada has the world\u2019s third largest oil reserves, but 99% of its exports now go to refiners in the US, where limits on pipeline and refinery capacity mean Canadian oil sells at a discount.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really simple. Right now, we basically have one customer for our energy resources, the United States. As we\u2019ve seen over the past few years anything can happen with our neighbors to the south,\u201d Trudeau said.</p> <p>Trudeau said every dollar Canada earns from the project will be invested in clean energy. The court said the government needed to be better, Trudeau noted. \u201cAnd you know what? They were right.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s latest approval can be appealed. Trans Mountain also requires various permits and route approvals in British Columbia, where that province\u2019s left-leaning New Democratic party government opposes the project.</p> <p>The BC government also plans to appeal a recent British Columbia appeal court ruling that the provincial government cannot restrict the flow of oil on pipelines that cross provincial boundaries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/16/canada-oil-pipeline-expansion-killer-whales-kinder-morgan\">Big oil v orcas: Canadians fight pipeline that threatens killer whales on the brink</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many indigenous people see the 620 miles (1,000km) of new pipeline as a threat to their lands, echoing concerns raised by Native Americans about the Keystone XL project in the US.

      "bodyText": "Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister,has once again approved a hotly contested proposal to expand the crude oil pipeline it bought last year, providing hope for a depressed energy industry but angering environmental and Indigenous groups that have fiercely opposed the project. Construction on the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline is planned to start this year, Trudeau told a news conference on Tuesday. A senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said earlier that Ottawa expected legal challenges to the approval. The project would triple Trans Mountain\u2019s capacity to carry 890,000 barrels a day from Alberta\u2019s oil sands to British Columbia\u2019s Pacific coast, alleviate congestion on existing pipelines and diversify exports away from the US. Trudeau, who faces a close election scheduled for October, has been under pressure from both western Canadian politicians who accuse him of doing too little for the struggling oil industry, and from environmental groups that fear spills. \u201cThis isn\u2019t an either/or proposition. It is in Canada\u2019s national interest to protect our environment and invest in tomorrow, while making sure people can feed their families today,\u201d he said, adding he knew some people would be disappointed. The Liberal government previously approved the expansion in 2016 but that decision was overturned last year after a court ruled the government had not adequately consulted Indigenous groups. The approval was widely expected as the government spent C$4.5bn ($3.4bn) to buy the 66-year-old pipeline from Kinder Morgan last year to ensure that the expansion proceeded. Western Canada\u2019s oil production has expanded faster than pipeline capacity, causing a glut of crude to build up and pressure on Canadian prices. The pipeline would allow Canada to vastly increase exports to Asia, where it could command a higher price. Canada has the world\u2019s third largest oil reserves, but 99% of its exports now go to refiners in the US, where limits on pipeline and refinery capacity mean Canadian oil sells at a discount. \u201cIt\u2019s really simple. Right now, we basically have one customer for our energy resources, the United States. As we\u2019ve seen over the past few years anything can happen with our neighbors to the south,\u201d Trudeau said. Trudeau said every dollar Canada earns from the project will be invested in clean energy. The court said the government needed to be better, Trudeau noted. \u201cAnd you know what? They were right.\u201d The government\u2019s latest approval can be appealed. Trans Mountain also requires various permits and route approvals in British Columbia, where that province\u2019s left-leaning New Democratic party government opposes the project. The BC government also plans to appeal a recent British Columbia appeal court ruling that the provincial government cannot restrict the flow of oil on pipelines that cross provincial boundaries. Many indigenous people see the 620 miles (1,000km) of new pipeline as a threat to their lands, echoing concerns raised by Native Americans about the Keystone XL project in the US. Environmentalists say it also raises broader concerns by enabling increased development of the carbon-heavy oil sands. Mike Hurley, mayor of Burnaby, where the pipeline terminates in a tank farm near the Westridge Marine Terminal on Burrard Inlet, said his city was \u201cabsolutely against\u201d the pipeline expansion. \u201cIt brings too much extra risk into our community and we don\u2019t believe the risk is worth the rewards. There\u2019s risk of fire, explosion, chemical releases, a natural disaster for our First Nations people who use the inlet so much, and for business. We have been kept in the dark.\u201d Construction is expected to take two and a half years. This article includes material from Reuters and AP",

Good positional play, and defused a number of Jamaican attacks. 7 Alanna KennedyAnother flawless game from Australia\u2019s centre-back with critical tackles, and went close a few times with chances at the other end from set plays. 7 Steph Catley Nice work on the ball, but exposed a few times by the excellent Shaw for Jamaica. 6 Katrina Gorry Physical game from the midfielder, covering plenty of territory and winning possession in the middle of the park. Served up a pearler for Kerr to head in for Australia\u2019s second close to half-time. 6 Emily van Egmond Good positioning but needs to value possession and distribution needs more attention. 5 Emily Gielnik Fed Kerr beautifully from wide on the left for the first goal despite being camped on the right flank for much of the match where she had good service from the midfield. Managed several threatening balls into Kerr but needed some more diversity. 6 Lisa De Vanna Solid outing from the stalwart in her 150th cap for Australia but didn\u2019t have the impact she would have wanted. 6 Sam Kerr (captain) Four goals in a dominant display from the captain where the game plan, in the first half at least, was to put the ball on Kerr\u2019s head. Her hunger in both defence and attack foiled a few Jamaican attacking raids, and she was rewarded with a well poached fourth. 9 Subs: Caitlin Foord (for Gielnik 59) 7; Hayley Raso (for DeVanna 63) 7; Aivi Luik (for Gorry 87) 6 Jamaica Nicole McClure Stepping up as the second-choice keeper, McClure had no chance with either of Kerr\u2019s headers. Lifted in confidence as the game progressed until giving away a howler for Kerr\u2019s fourth. 4 Sashana Campbell Good cover on De Vanna slowed down Australia\u2019s attack until the rest of the Jamaican defence could drop. Quick feet and evasive skills sparked some attacks late in the first half. 6 Konya Plummer One of the strongest in defence and managed to slow down numerous waves of attack. 6 Allyson Swaby Left Kerr all alone for the second goal and had to work hard to keep tracking back with her in the second half. 4 Deneisha Blackwood Always managed to get her body in the way of Geilnik\u2019s crosses. Ran strongly at defence in the second half. 6 Chantelle Swaby Very quiet as holding midfielder with no real impact in the game. 4 Toriana Patterson Did well to control an often ping-ponging ball through midfield and making Gorry bite. Lucky to not give away a penalty. 6 Khadija Shaw Great runs from deep in her half caused numerous early scares for Williams but did not find much support for her crosses. Consistently tested Australia\u2019s defence and her strong run through midfield put Saloun through for Jamaica\u2019s goal. 8 Mireya Grey Quick feet getting the ball out of her half. One of the quickest on the park and easily able to get away from her marker and also apply strong pressure to any of Australia\u2019s offence. Best chance of the first half with a header that just flashed wide of the far post off a corner. 7 Cheyna Matthews Pushed hard on Catley but couldn\u2019t break through despite applying heavy pressure to Australia\u2019s midfield. Worked well with Shaw to put the most pressure on the Matildas\u2019 defence in the first half. 7 Tiffany Cameron Very quiet first half with no real impact. Substituted at half-time. 4 Subs: Havana Solaun (For Cameron at HT) 7; Trudi Carter (for C. Matthews at 59\u2019) 6; Jody Brown (for Grey at 72\u2019) 4",

      "body": "<p>He speaks. And yet he still says nothing. Given that he has been held hostage by his minders for the past few months, it was only fair that Boris Johnson was given the chance to answer the first question on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/18/boris-johnson-bbc-debate-conservative-leadership-hunt-gove-stewart-javid\">the BBC\u2019s Tory leadership debate</a>. \u201cPiffle, paffle, wiffle, waffle,\u201d said the pasty-faced, priapic Mr Blobby. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/14/jeremy-hunt-what-would-churchill-say-of-boris-johnson-hiding-away-tory-leadership\">His time in captivity</a> has played havoc with his complexion.</p> \n<p>And with his thought processes. Asked to explain if he would leave the EU on 31 October, Johnson managed to both say he would and he wouldn\u2019t. Much the same as he has been telling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/17/boris-johnson-accused-of-making-mps-contradictory-brexit-promises\">both his </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/17/boris-johnson-accused-of-making-mps-contradictory-brexit-promises\">remainer and </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/17/boris-johnson-accused-of-making-mps-contradictory-brexit-promises\">leaver supporters</a>. Only the public are less gullible than some Tory MPs. \u201cPoliticians need to act seriously and soberly,\u201d he concluded, trying to remember not to smirk. Thereby in effect ruling himself out as the UK\u2019s next prime minister. Only for Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove and Sajid Javid to do much the same. Rory Stewart sounded a little less deranged, but his Brexit plans don\u2019t stand much scrutiny either.</p> \n<p>It was all downhill from there. The five men were all sitting on stools, as if they were an ageing boyband performing a one-off reunion gig. Take Twat. Ten minutes in, Stewart began to undress by taking off his tie and that\u2019s when the old artistic differences really kicked.</p> \n<p>\u201cYour ideas are really shit,\u201d said one.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo they\u2019re not,\u201d said another.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s your ideas that are shit.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn to be on lead vocals.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWell stop singing out of tune.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re back on the coke.\u201d</p> \n<p>The entire audience, which was already rapidly thinning out as more and more people switched over to repeats of Chernobyl for light relief, wished they were back on barbiturates. At one point, the presenter, Emily Maitlis, looked as if she too had had enough and wanted to walk off the set. But her professionalism kicked in as Take Twat continued to talk over one another and squabble among themselves.</p> \n<p>\u201cHas that answered your question?\u201d Maitlis asked James from Belfast after Mr Blobby and the Blobbettes had argued over GATT 24, sheep farming and other things about which they clearly knew nothing.</p> \n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d said James, committing hara-kiri. He spoke for an entire nation.</p> \n<p>Having given up any hope of getting a straight answer on Brexit, other questions came in on tax cuts, Islamophobia and public services. Bizarrely, one man even thought Hunt had given a satisfactory reply. Ken Doll lookalike Hunt appeared amazed by this.

      "bodyText": "He speaks. And yet he still says nothing. Given that he has been held hostage by his minders for the past few months, it was only fair that Boris Johnson was given the chance to answer the first question on the BBC\u2019s Tory leadership debate. \u201cPiffle, paffle, wiffle, waffle,\u201d said the pasty-faced, priapic Mr Blobby. His time in captivity has played havoc with his complexion. And with his thought processes. Asked to explain if he would leave the EU on 31 October, Johnson managed to both say he would and he wouldn\u2019t. Much the same as he has been telling both his remainer and leaver supporters. Only the public are less gullible than some Tory MPs. \u201cPoliticians need to act seriously and soberly,\u201d he concluded, trying to remember not to smirk. Thereby in effect ruling himself out as the UK\u2019s next prime minister. Only for Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove and Sajid Javid to do much the same. Rory Stewart sounded a little less deranged, but his Brexit plans don\u2019t stand much scrutiny either. It was all downhill from there. The five men were all sitting on stools, as if they were an ageing boyband performing a one-off reunion gig. Take Twat. Ten minutes in, Stewart began to undress by taking off his tie and that\u2019s when the old artistic differences really kicked. \u201cYour ideas are really shit,\u201d said one. \u201cNo they\u2019re not,\u201d said another. \u201cIt\u2019s your ideas that are shit.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my turn to be on lead vocals.\u201d \u201cWell stop singing out of tune.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re back on the coke.\u201d The entire audience, which was already rapidly thinning out as more and more people switched over to repeats of Chernobyl for light relief, wished they were back on barbiturates. At one point, the presenter, Emily Maitlis, looked as if she too had had enough and wanted to walk off the set. But her professionalism kicked in as Take Twat continued to talk over one another and squabble among themselves. \u201cHas that answered your question?\u201d Maitlis asked James from Belfast after Mr Blobby and the Blobbettes had argued over GATT 24, sheep farming and other things about which they clearly knew nothing. \u201cNot really,\u201d said James, committing hara-kiri. He spoke for an entire nation. Having given up any hope of getting a straight answer on Brexit, other questions came in on tax cuts, Islamophobia and public services. Bizarrely, one man even thought Hunt had given a satisfactory reply. Ken Doll lookalike Hunt appeared amazed by this. It wasn\u2019t his style at all. \u201cCould you just tell me whether my husband will be OK?\u201d pleaded Carmela from Southampton. \u201cYour husband is toast,\u201d snapped Gove. \u201cHe can piss off and die. Now stop talking while I\u2019m interrupting.\u201d It was a relief when it all ended. Not even a near-naked, straight-talking Stewart could chalk this one up as a success. All the country had learned was that it wished they would all shut the fuck up and it didn\u2019t want any of them as prime minister. The only winner on the night was Jeremy Corbyn. The final line up for Take Twat had been decided at the second round of voting earlier in the day.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been forced on to the defensive in a fractious five-way Tory leadership debate, coming under pressure on issues from Islamophobia to his plan to cut taxes for top earners. The former foreign secretary remains overwhelming favourite to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister after winning the second round of voting among Conservative MPs convincingly, with 126 votes of the 313 cast. But in his first appearance in a televised debate during the contest, having spurned Sunday\u2019s Channel 4 event, cracks appeared in some of his positions under scrutiny from viewers\u2019 questions and his rivals\u2019 replies during the BBC programme. Asked by Abdullah, an imam from Bristol, whether he accepted that \u201cwords have consequences\u201d, Johnson claimed his comments \u2013 such as comparing Muslim women in burqas to \u201cletterboxes\u201d \u2013 were sometimes taken out of context. And he referred to his Muslim great-grandfather, who he said came to Britain because it was \u201ca beacon of generosity and openness\u201d. He went on to insist that his mistaken remark that the imprisoned British-Iranian citizen Nazanin Zhagari-Ratcliffe was teaching in Iran \u201cdidn\u2019t make any difference\u201d. Johnson also appeared to wobble over his pledge of a tax cut for high earners, saying: \u201cWhat we would bring forward is a package to help primarily the poorest people in society,\u201d \u2013 but that he thought it was right to have an \u201cambition\u201d to raise the higher rate. The debate, presented by Emily Maitlis, was repeatedly characterised by interruptions. Michael Gove condemned Johnson\u2019s plan to increase the threshold at which the 40p income tax rate is levied, from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000. \u201cI think that is wrong,\u201d Gove said. One of the most notable moments came when all five candidates were given a scathing review by a 15-year-old climate striker named Erin, who asked them to commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2025. None agreed to do so and, asked for her reflections afterwards, Erin said none had \u201creally impressed\u201d her. \u201cClimate change isn\u2019t an issue of tomorrow, it\u2019s an issue of today and we need to create drastic, critical action and I don\u2019t think any of you are willing to offer that,\u201d she told them.

And he stressed the importance of preparing for no deal, in order to secure a better deal. Johnson also gave few details about how he plans to resolve the challenge of preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland, saying he believed the details should be worked out in the transition period after the UK has left. Challenged on why the EU27 would agree to that idea, he pointed to the \u201csolvent\u201d of withholding the \u00a339bn exit payment. Rory Stewart continued his effort to distinguish himself from the other candidates, insisting that now was the wrong time for the Tories to be promising tax cuts. \u201cI\u2019m going to be very straight with people: I don\u2019t think this is the right time to be cutting taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cOur country is suffering huge pressures on public services.\u201d Stewart only joined the cabinet in May, and began the contest as the underdog \u2013 but received 37 votes on Tuesday, after picking up many of those MPs who backed the health secretary, Matt Hancock, in last week\u2019s first round of voting. Gove, who came third with 41, presented himself as the most convincing Brexiter, saying he was the first on the five-man panel to advocate leaving the EU, and \u201cbecause I started this, I will finish it\u201d. Sajid Javid, who only just scraped the 33 votes necessary to stay in the contest for another 24 hours, is likely to come under pressure to fold his campaign. But a spokesman for the home secretary insisted: \u201cHe\u2019s had a great four days, picked up some votes today, and we\u2019ll fight on.\u201d And Javid scored one of the few clear victories during the debate, when he asked his four rivals whether they would all agree to commission an independent review of Islamophobia in the Conservative party, to which they all said yes. But Abdullah later tweeted expressing his disappointment with the Tory hopefuls\u2019 \u201cdeluded\u201d responses to his question about Islamophobia. He said: \u201cWhat I got as a response was nothing short of disappointing and deluded: Boris Johnson forgot my name, spoke about his great-grandfather and about Iran. Gove used the opportunity to have a dig at Jeremy Corbyn. Jeremy Hunt used it as a chance to say he can\u2019t be racist because he has an immigrant wife and Rory Stewart forgot that this is also our country.\u201d He said Javid winning the concession over the review was \u201cthe only positive from the debate\u201d. Hancock withdrew from the leadership race on Friday, and on Sunday threw his weight behind Johnson, who now appears highly likely to be installed in 10 Downing Street by the end of July. But many of the moderate Tories who had rallied behind Stewart remain deeply sceptical about whether Johnson will stick to the one-nation values he has stressed during his leadership pitch, once installed in Downing Street. Hunt\u2019s team had earlier rejected rumours circulating in Westminster that Johnson\u2019s outriders had been urging colleagues to lend their votes to Hunt because he was their preferred opponent. Johnson has the former defence secretary Gavin Williamson and the former Tory party chair Grant Shapps working Westminster on his behalf. He has won over hard Brexiters by promising to take Britain out of the EU by 31 October \u201cwith or without a deal\u201d, but has also played up his one-nation credentials to appeal to his party\u2019s liberal wing. MPs will vote again on Wednesday, and if necessary on Thursday, until the field is narrowed down to just two names, which will then be offered to Conservative members in a postal ballot. The result will be announced in the week beginning 22 July. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 June 2019 to correct the spelling of Grant Shapps\u2019s last name.",

      "bodyText": "Arise, Sam Kerr. A phenomenal performance from the Perth Glory striker saw her single-handedly lift Australia into the Round of 16, where they will face Norway in Nice on Saturday. There was a late scare - when Brazil\u2019s goal against Italy in Valenciennes pushed the Aussies into third - but Kerr\u2019s fourth goal gave Australia an advantage over Brazil in the Group C ladder. For Jamaica, their first-ever Women\u2019s World Cup goal was cause for much celebration, but it wasn\u2019t enough to prevent them from exiting the tournament. That\u2019s all from me - I will be back on Saturday for the Matildas\u2019 next encounter. Thanks for joining me. \u201cSuper hero.\u201d \u201cPhenomenal.\u201d These were just some of the superlatives Sam Kerr\u2019s team-mates had for her in the post-match mixed zone. The woman of the moment was surprisingly unemotional. \u201cI thought I gave the ball away too much,\u201d said Kerr. When you score four goals, I don\u2019t think anyone will complain about that - Sam. Here\u2019s Richard Parkin\u2019s match report from Grenoble. 90+7 min: It\u2019s all over in Valenciennes as well. Brazil get the win, but end Group C in third on goals scored. Italy proceed in first and the Matildas advance in second. All three teams will progress, though, while the Jamaicans see their tournament end tonight. 90+3 min: Referee Kulcsar calls time on an entertaining match here in Grenoble. Take a bow, Samantha Kerr - four goal hero. This. 90 min: Three minutes of extra-time in Grenoble. 89 min: The Aussies are searching for a fifth. Raso has the ball on the right, and moves it inside - only to receive it again. Raso lobs in a cross, but McClure collects. 88 min: If Brazil and Australia each score one more goal in the respective matches, the Matildas will move into first in Group C. No change in Valenciennes, where Brazil remain one goal up thanks to that Marta penalty. 86 min: Australia are now back into second place on goal difference, over Brazil. 83 min: Goalkeeping error from McClure! She receives a backpass and goes to cushion it with her foot, but the ball bounces off and Kerr collects for an easy tap-in. Four goals - Kerr has rocketed up the Golden Boot tally into equal first. 81 min: Less than 10 minutes plus added time in both matches and the outcome of Group C is still very much up for grabs. 79 min: Even in third, the Aussies will still go through to the Round of 16 - but will face an uncertain wait to find out their opponent. 78 min: As things stand, Australia has been relegated to third place in Group C by Brazil\u2019s goal. Italy, Brazil and Australia are all on six points, and Australia have the worst goal difference. Debinha is fouled in the box by Linari, and Marta slots home the ensuing penalty. Well. That mixes things up in Group C. It is also Marta\u2019s 17th World Cup goal. 75 min: How\u2019s this for a stat. 69 min: And that\u2019s the hat-trick for Kerr. Raso offers a nice cross, which bounces off a Jamaican defender and into the path of Kerr about two metre from the goal for one of the easiest goals she will score. She has become the first Australian, male or female, to score a hat-trick at a World Cup. History. Over in Valenciennes, it is still 0-0. Both teams are ringing the changes, but so far without effect. If things stay as they are in both games, Australia will progress in second and face Norway in Nice on Saturday. There\u2019s some pleasing alliteration there. That puts them on a path towards England in the quarter-final, unless anything unexpected happens. The Aussies have also swapped De Vanna for Raso. 62 min: Shaw busts through two Matildas defenders and has a pop at Willians, but it goes wide. Ohfff she has pace. Four of Sam Kerr\u2019s past five international goals have come from headers. Is that head insured? It should be! The subs are coming thick and fast here in Grenoble. Matthews off for Carter for Jamiaca, while Foord is on for Gielnik for the Matildas. Tim writes in: The bar I\u2019m at here in the USA! USA!! USA!!! (PS: as an American, I\u2019d like to apologize for that chant. It\u2019s awful, and embarrasses me every time I hear it. I hate it.) is showing both games simultaneously, and\u2014the goals in the Australia v Jamaica game notwithstanding\u2014I\u2019ve gravitated towards Italy-Brazil: a pleasantly open game, with both teams going for it. That said, if I had my choice I\u2019d be at the Stade des Alpes, if only for the stadium. Glad you\u2019re enjoying it on behalf of all of us readers. Still 0-0 in Valenciennes between Italy and Brazil. Even if Brazil find a goal, the Aussies will need to collect several more here to overtake Italy and claim first place in Group C. Right now, that does not look likely. 53 min: This is end to end stuff in Grenoble. Having claimed their first World Cup goal, now the Jamaicans want their first World Cup point. Australian prodigy Mary Fowler - just 16 - has missed the first two matches through injury. Coach Milicic hinted yesterday that she might see some action from the bench - if Fowler does come on, she would become the fifth youngest player in Women\u2019s World Cup history. It would be good at some stage if the opportunity presents if [Mary] can show her quality. 51 min: Jamaica are back at the Australians and have another pop at Williams - this ain\u2019t over 49 min: Jamaica!!!!! That\u2019s their first goal in World Cup history. Beautiful stuff. The crowd goes wild. Shaw picked a Matildas\u2019 midfielder\u2019s pocket, fed it through the defence to Solaun who rounded Williams and slotted home nicely. Nice little fact here - could Kerr become Australia\u2019s first hat-trick scorer at a World Cup? 46 min: Peep! We\u2019re back underway in Grenoble and they\u2019re back underway in Valenciennes for Italy v Brazil. Stay tuned! My colleague Richard Parkin is sitting next to me frantically writing the match report for tonight, but he still has time for nuggets of wisdom like this on Twitter. It has been rather even over in Valenciennes - 49% possession for Italy and 8 attempts, compared to 7 for Brazil and a slight lead in the possession stats. Sam Kerr is rapidly making her way up this - two more tonight and she will be equal with Golden Boot leader Alex Morgan of the USA. Death. Taxes. Sam Kerr headers. Wish I\u2019d thought of that line myself. Thoughts, dear reader, on the first-half here in Grenoble or the counterpart Group C clash in Valenciennes. Do let me know: email or tweet @KieranPender Just going to leave this here. Again. Kari is enjoying the Italy v Brazil match: Thoroughly enjoyable so far, with lots of chances, great goalkeeping and some lovely bits of skill. And over in the other match, no-one has troubled the score sheet just yet - other than Italy\u2019s disallowed goal. 45 min: Peep! That\u2019s it for the first stanza. We\u2019ll be back shortly for the second 45. 42 min: Goal number two for Sam Kerr, in much the same fashion as the first - a cross from the wing, this time from Gorry, and a scorching header. 40 min: Jamaica go close with a corner. Can they find an equaliser before half-time? This is my seventh stadium of this World Cup and its an absolute stunner. Just look at that Alpine view. Lovely stuff, Grenoble. 38 min: Jamaica with a threatening free-kick for Shaw but it goes high. Well high. The latest on the television issues, via Janet in Austria. These licensing arrangements are really impacting on the capacity of people to follow sport from different parts of the world. It is annoying that only one TV channel has a licence to broadcast the FIFA Womens and so far they have not thought it worth broadcasting the matches that Australia is playing in. OK, it\u2019s a commercial decision, but then, why block live streaming on the Internet as well? Also, there is a German channel, ZDF, that is broadcasting the Australia-Jamaica match in Germany, and this is a channel we get in Vienna. But they are banned from broadcasting the match into Austria. Frustrating. In the other match, Italy scored via Girelli - only for it to be ruled offside. That might sound familiar to any Australian readers... 34 min: Roestbakken, who made her Matildas debut in the last match as a late sub, is not having a good time against Cameron. Peter is enjoying the live tweeting from the Jamaican tourism authorities. I like how their slogan expands on the Visit [Destination] theme by adding a strong suggestion for when such a visit should be made. Now! Someone has obtained Australia\u2019s tactical notes... 29 min: Matthews goes on a rampaging run through the Australian defence and finds herself in the area, only to slip over and be dispossessed. The Stade des Alpes is very close to capacity here and the crowd is making some great noise. There\u2019s also a slight smell of a certain illicit substance... 27 min: Gielnik seems to be on perpetual cross duty tonight. But after he latest attempt goes out for a throw, she lobs it in for a Jamaican player who drives down-field. In the other match, Brazil are peppering the Italian goal but Giuliani is standing firm - for now. This blog should be renamed - \u2018help our readers find television coverage of the match\u2019. Susan in Switzerland is in strife. Email or tweet @KieranPender if you have solutions. Having the same problem in Switzerland as Keith in Italy. Can only find the Italy-Brazil match on the myriad of channels we seem to have. Reader Justin on the similarities between the Italian national teams. I was just wondering whether Italian women defenders were as hard as their male counterparts when Bartoli flew into a challenge that Bonucci or Chiellini would have been proud of. That Brazilian winger is going to have at least one sore ankle tomorrow morning. The Jamaican tourist board getting involved. 21 min: Some exceptional defending from Jamaica\u2019s Grey dispossesses Van Egmond from a dangerous position on the edge of the area. Still no scoring in Italy\u2019s clash with Brazil in Valenciennes. If the Brazilians can win and Australia can muster a few more goals, the Matildas will find themselves top of Group C. 18 min: Kerr with another heroic header in the box, although this one goes wide. She\u2019s quite the player, isn\u2019t she? Jamaican coach Menzies admitted yesterday that he had voted for her for player of the year. A not unreasonable point on Twitter Loyal reader Keith, an Australian currently in Italy, writes in with this query: Does anyone know if any Italian Channel is showing this match? All seem to be showing Italy v Brazil - which of course is also important to our results! 15 min: Despite the early goal, Jamaica are putting up a strong fight here in Grenoble. The Reggae Girlz are moving the ball nicely from side to side, and causing particular strife for young Aussie left-back Roestbakken. Some virtual standings for you: if these results remain unchanged, Italy will top the group on 7 points ahead of Australia on six. Brazil will finish in third but likely still progress to the Round of 16. 11 min: Kerr! The Aussie ace nabs her second in three matches. A looping cross meets the Perth Glory star\u2019s head in the box, and an out-strecthed save from McClure isn\u2019t enough to keep that out. Over in the other match, the Italian weapon Bonansea is making life difficult for the Brazilians. It is still 0-0, though. 6 min: In what will likely be the first of many, Gielnik punts over a nice cross from the right-hand side. McClure isn\u2019t under too much pressure for the save, but I dare say she has a long night ahead. 5 min: Kerr has Australia\u2019s first half-chanced of the game but the striker lobs it up and McClure comfortably collects. 4 min: Shaw for Jamaica goes on a lovely run through the Australian midfield and again troubles Williams. Strong start this, from the ladies in yellow. 3 min: Australia are looking to control this match already, with copious passing in the Jamaican half but - so far - nothing too threatening. 1 min: Jamaica straight into the action, a nice link-up move on the right hand side ultimately finding its way into Australian goalkeeper Lydia Williams\u2019 arms. An early statement of intent from the Reggae Girlz. 1 min: Peeepppp! We\u2019re underway. Jamaica v Australia here, Italy v Brazil in the other Group C encounter. Let\u2019s go! Just minutes away from kick-off here in Grenoble and 700 klicks away in Valenciennes. Feel free to keep me company this evening - email or tweet @KieranPender. As usual, I have crowd-sourced some predictions from the Guardian Australia scribes here in Grenoble. Not much love for Jamaica, unfortunately. Richard Parkin: 5-1 Ella Reilly: 5-1 Kieran Pender: 6-2 The Australian media gathered in Grenoble had our own hit-out today ahead of the match. It was a high-scoring affair, ending 12-10. If tonight\u2019s clash is anywhere near as exciting, we are in for a great evening. Both sets of fans are having a lovely old time, as the sun sets over the stunning Stades des Alpes here in Grenoble - with the Alps literally in the background. At yesterday\u2019s presser, Australia boss Ante Milicic wouldn\u2019t be drawn on the permutations that could see Australia finish almost anywhere in Group C. We don\u2019t fear any opponent. We\u2019ll finish first, second or third, hopefully, for a reason and who we come up against and at what stadium, we have no fear. Jamaican coach Hue Menzies spoke to the press yesterday. Earlier in the day I had spoken to some Jamaican fans, one of whom said to me: We\u2019ve already won the World Cup, just by being here. It is historic. I put that to Menzies, who was having none of it. We have pride in ourselves. We know we should be doing better. We want to get some results out of this. He did later admit that the team\u2019s well-documented challenging journey to the tournament was worthy of plaudits. It\u2019s amazing that we\u2019re here. We\u2019ve dealt with all that adversity. This group is just so resilient. Tonight is a big one for the Matildas\u2019 Lisa De Vanna, who is playing her 150th match for the Australian national team. That leaves her just one off Australia\u2019s most-capped player, Cheryl Salisbury. My dear colleague Richard Parkin spoke to the mercurial striker before the tournament. Italy (4-3-3): Giulani; Gama; Galli; Linari; Guagni; Girelli; Bonansea; Bartoli; Giacinti; Cernoia; Giugliano Brazil (4-5-1): Barbara; Thaisa; Tamires; Debinha; Marta; Cristiane; Leticia Santos; Kathellen; Andressinha; Ludmila; Monica Australia (4-3-3): Williams; Carpenter; Kennedy; Catley; Roestbakken; Gorry; van Egmond; Logarzo; Gielnik; Kerr; De Vanna Jamaica (4-5-1): McClure; Swaby; Plummer; Shaw; Campbell; Blackwood; Cameron; Swaby; Patterson; Matthews; Grey There are, on my counting, nine possible outcomes tonight. I have summarised them, and their consequences, below. Australia beat Jamaica; Brazil beat Italy Italy, Australia and Brazil will all be equal first on six points. The tie-breaker rule will apply, which initially uses goal difference to separate the teams, then goals scored and so on. Jamaica will fly home on zero points.

Jamaica beat Australia; Italy and Brazil draw Italy will top the group on seven points. Brazil will place second on four points. Australia and Jamaica will finish equal third on three points \u2013 tie-breaker rules will apply. I presume, dear reader, that you have already digested word-for-word all 24 of our insightful pre-tournament team previews. If you haven\u2019t, you can increase your knowledge of the four teams in action today with the following pre-match reading.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 19 June. Top stories The Coalition awarded almost $1.4bn in grants through its regional development program in the lead-up to the election, with about half of the funding not subject to a competitive tender process. The spending included grants made through the Stronger Communities program, a political slush fund that gives every lower-house MP $150,000 to spend on community projects costing between $1,500 and $20,000. Almost $100m has been paid out since the scheme was announced in the 2015 budget. The battleground states of Victoria and Queensland \u2013 seen as crucial to the Coalition\u2019s re-election chances \u2013 were the biggest beneficiaries of the spending, receiving $422m and $331m respectively. Donald Trump will formally launch his 2020 re-election campaign on Tuesday in one of the weakest positions of any incumbent president in modern times. Trump will seek to project self-confidence and portray himself as a winner when he takes the stage at the Amway Centre in Orlando, Florida, before a typically raucous 20,000-capacity crowd more than 16 months before election day. The rally \u201clooks to be setting records\u201d, he claimed in a tweet on Monday, adding: \u201cWe are building large movie screens outside to take care of everybody. Over 100,000 requests. Our Country is doing great, far beyond what the haters &amp; losers thought possible \u2013 and it will only get better!\u201d But beneath the self-congratulation, there is cause for panic in Trumpworld. Once-triumphant share issue Afterpay is now the subject of an Austrac investigation. Last week, Australia\u2019s financial crime watchdog, Austrac, ordered the popular buy-now pay-later company to appoint an external auditor over concerns about the company\u2019s compliance with anti-money laundering and terrorism-financing laws. Stocks in the company have tumbled and questions are being asked about the timing of the audit \u2013 announced only a day after the company raised more than $300m in a share offering on the Australian stock exchange. The company has admitted it had been in talks with Austrac since August last year, but says it didn\u2019t know about the order until after the share issue. World Dominic Raab has been eliminated from the contest to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister after the second round of voting by Conservative MPs, but the outsider Rory Stewart will go forward. As expected, Boris Johnson topped the poll, the 126 votes he garnered cementing his lead over rivals and underlining the sense that his progress to Downing Street is now all but unstoppable. Angela Merkel has blamed dehydration after she started to visibly shake while welcoming the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to Berlin. As a military band played the two countries\u2019 national anthems, the chancellor\u2019s whole body shook and she pursed her lips as she tried to contain the situation. Los Angeles has sentenced more people to death than any other county in the US, and only people of colour have received the death penalty under the region\u2019s current prosecutor, a new report shows. Unidentified gunmen on motorbikes have attacked two villages in central Mali, killing at least 41 people in a part of the country where ethnic reprisal attacks have surged in recent months. Astronomers have come up empty-handed after scanning the heavens for signs of intelligent life in the most extensive search ever performed. During three years of observations they found no evidence of signals that could plausibly come from an alien civilisation. Opinion and analysis The journalist who writes a novel has an inhibition to overcome: the reflex guilt about making stuff up. For Taffy Brodesser-Akner, who wrote her first novel, Fleishman Is In Trouble, while working as a writer at the New York Times magazine, the anxiety of leaving behind fact and transcript was alleviated by the knowledge that at least no one was going to yell at her for hurting their feelings. Not that Brodesser-Akner specialises in hatchet jobs. Her profiles, most famously her deep dive into the world of Gwyneth Paltrow last year, are generous without giving her subjects a free ride. The globally shared concern with overtourism has been brought into sharp focus by the photos of climbers queueing to reach the summit of Mount Everest. Guardian Australian columnist Van Badham examines her own motivations for travel: \u201cWe are lured to overtouristed places because we want to share our own stories with the romances established around them, and project ourselves into the collective perception of their beauty and uniqueness. This is why the solution to overtourism is not rooted in how we do tourism, but in how communities can be invested in actively creating \u2013 or restoring \u2013 places of beauty. And not just to spread the crowds more evenly.\u201d Sport Captain Sam Kerr led from the front as she scored all four goals in the Matildas\u2019 4-1 win over Jamaica in their crucial final Women\u2019s World Cup group game. The result, and the swing in goal difference, saw Ante Milicic\u2019s side qualify for the knockout stage of the tournament in second place, above Brazil, who could only beat Italy 1-0 in the other Group C match. Eoin Morgan has launched England to an easy Cricket World Cup win over Afghanistan. The England captain hit 148 from 71 balls, an extraordinary innings which contained 17 sixes, which is a record in ODI cricket, and only four boundaries. With a US$7m prize money pot it\u2019s easy to see why the world\u2019s best swimmers, including several Australians, signed up for the International Swimming League. It\u2019s also easy to see why the sport\u2019s governing body, Fina, have tried to put roadblocks in place. Thinking time: Murder, rape and contamination at Tanzanian mine When safari tourists drive to the Serengeti national park in Tanzania, few realise they are passing one of the world\u2019s most contentious goldmines. From the escarpment above the plain, the North Mara facility is so large that it at first resembles a bare hillside.

Nearer still, you find a vast tailings reservoir filled with contaminated wastewater. Locals live in huts under the shadow of its mud and rock banks.

Remember, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> said thousands of members of the public came out to cheer him in London earlier this month.

      "bodyText": "This blog is about to close for the day. But my Guardian colleague Adam Gabbatt is about to fire up a special politics live blog from Orlando, Florida. He recently alighted there from the Guardian US base in New York to cover, with the help of a very focused team, Donald Trump\u2019s official 2020 reelection campaign launch. It\u2019s going to be a huge night. If you\u2019re a Trump fan, it\u2019s like Christmas in June. If you\u2019re not, well, don\u2019t look away from the difficult things....we\u2019ll have the right tone and sharp analysis, so stick around, we\u2019ll be right back. Early evening summary. It\u2019s already been a busy day in national politics, in particular. Former government ethics chief Walter Shaub has backed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s view that detaining undocumented migrants en masse at the border essentially creates \u201cconcentration camps\u201d. AOC has been in a row with conservatives, specifically Liz Cheney, since Donald Trump last night promised a new rash of mass deportations. The US Senate is one step closer to confirming ultra-conservative, anti-LGBT, anti-women\u2019s rights, religious zealot Matthew Kacsmaryk to a federal judgeship - a job for life. Acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan\u2019s departure is just the latest in the Trump administration to find the door hitting him on the way out. Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot blasts Trump while in NYC Chicago\u2019s new mayor, Lori Lightfoot, is visiting New York this week and is meeting today with city mayor Bill de Blasio and first lady Chirlane McCray. Their meeting has, in rather curmudgeonly fashion, this reporter thinks, been tersely described on official notices as \u201cclosed press\u201d, so we\u2019ll see if anything emerges. But Lightfoot wasn\u2019t pussy-footing around last night at the DNC LGBTQ gala in the Big Apple, blasting the Trump administration for its biased policies. \u201cTrump \u2014 behind his smoke screen of lies, insults and angry tweets \u2014 has pursued a dangerous agenda rolling back basic rights for LGBTQ+ families, troops and employees,\u201d she said in her speech. \u201cThey aim to reverse civil rights which you may have assumed were a matter of settled law.\u201d Personally, and the White House aside, Lightfoot was celebratory, remarking: \u201cOne month ago, I was inaugurated as Chicago\u2019s first openly gay mayor and our first black woman mayor. \u201cI was elected by a huge majority \u2014 74% \u2014 and I have to feel that the vote revealed a genuine sea change in public attitudes. None of this would have been possible a generation ago. It\u2019s still a bit stunning, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Walter Shaub, AOC, concentration camps In the ongoing row about migrant detention camps, former head of the independent Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, who quit the Trump administration in disgust, has weighed in behind Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez this afternoon. AOC last night and earlier today spoke of her outrage that the Trump administration is \u201ccreating concentration camps\u201d on the US-Mexico border to detain undocumented migrants, including children. Shaub just tweeted, and AOC retweeted. He mentions that he saw AOC among protesters at the since-closed Tornillo federal detention facility for migrant youth, which was an appalling bunch of tents in the desert near El Paso, Texas, that mushroomed in size over a matter of months last summer, as the Guardian revealed at the time. Shaub just termed it a \u201cchild concentration camp.\u201d The administration has opened more camps nearby since then, such as this one which was being readied just as the president was calling conditions for migrants crossing the border as \u201cDisneyland\u201d, despite much evidence otherwise. Acting... It looks dramatic when it\u2019s put in a list. MSNBC tots up the senior Trump administration posts currently being operated by an \u201cacting\u201d incumbent. In a sieve we\u2019ll go to sea! Patrick Shanahan\u2019s ousting is just the latest of dozens of senior figures to depart the high-turnover Trump administration. Trump\u2019s White House has had the highest senior-level staff churn rate of the past five presidents, according to figures compiled by the Brookings Institution, a think tank, Reuters reports this afternoon. Here are the most prominent - check out the Guardian\u2019s interactive, directly below. Other less famous names include: Kevin Hassett: Trump said on June 3 that the White House council of economic advisers chairman would leave his post. Randolph \u201cTex\u201d Alles, head of the US Secret Service, left in May as part of a broader shake-up of the Department of Homeland Security, shortly after Kirtsjen Nielsen\u2019s departure. Clete Willems: A key figure in trade talks with China and a deputy to Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow. Heather Wilson: The US Air Force secretary, once considered a top candidate to become defense secretary, returned to academia. Right-winger moves closer to federal judgeship Fiercely anti-LGBTQ, anti-marriage equality, anti-women\u2019s reproductive rights lawyer Matthew Kacsmaryk is one step closer to being handed a life-time appointment as a federal judge, after a vote in the US Senate. His final confirmation vote will be held tomorrow. Kacsmaryk 42, has ripped Roe v Wade, said abortion rights backers are \u201csexual revolutionaries\u201d + fought against LGBTQ protections in employment, housing + health care, HuffPost\u2019s Jennifer Bendery tweeted earlier today, describing the conservative religious zealot as \u201cone of Trump\u2019s most anti-LGBTQ, anti-abortion picks yet\u201d. Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin spoke out on Capitol Hill earlier, on the floor of the Senate, saying: \u201cIt strikes me as unusual, more than coincidental, that in June \u2013 the LGBTQ Pride Month \u2013 our Republican colleagues would decide to bring to the floor the nomination of a Texas district court nominee, Matthew J. Kacsmaryk\u2026 Mr. Kacsmaryk has not been shy about his hostility to marriage equality and transgender Americans,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cI oppose the Kacsmaryk nomination. This is yet another extreme nominee outside the mainstream of American thinking who does not deserve to be rubber-stamped for a lifetime appointment by the United States Senate.\u201d According to Durbin\u2019s Office, Kacsmaryk has \u201crepeatedly written in his personal capacity about his opposition to LGBTQ rights and the Obergefell case.\u201d In 2015 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled same-sex couples have the right to marry in the Obergefell case, Illinois local station KFVS reported. Kacsmaryk claims being transgender is a \u201cdelusion\u201d. Human Rights Campaign legal director Sarah Warbelow said Kacsmaryk \u201cfails a basic expectation of impartiality..HRC will continue to raise the alarm about Kacsmaryk and other nominees who refuse to protect the rights of all Americans.\u201d Chaos at the Pentagon - even McConnell is speaking out Now US Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who appears to pride himself on doing big things \u201clast minute\u201d (in the row over funding for those sickened by Ground Zero), has just said it \u201cwould be better to have a confirmed secretary of defense\u201d as the US confronts Iran, Reuters reports. Meanwhile, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said: \u201cThis is a very difficult time..to have no secretary of defense is appalling..every American should worry.\u201d The new acting defense secretary, as of about two and a half hours ago, is Mark Esper, currently secretary of the Army. He succeeds Patrick Shanahan who quit this morning. Shanahan was in the acting defense secretary role after defense secretary Jim Mattis resigned last December following acute and prolonged disagreements over policy with Donald Trump. When he hired Mattis, Trump was impressed by the marine veteran\u2019s bearing and his nickname \u201cMad Dog\u201d, but the relationship cooled as Mattis resisted Trump\u2019s inclination to distance the US from its Nato allies and blocked bellicose gestures aimed at North Korea in 2017. \u201cI think he\u2019s sort of a Democrat, if you want to know the truth,\u201d Trump told a TV interviewer in October. Former defence officials had said that Mattis saw his primary loyalty to the US constitution, and that had guided his relations with an erratic and acerbic president, our Julian Borger wrote at the time of Mattis\u2019s announced retirement. Early afternoon summary Orlando, Florida, Trump\u2019s base, the rest of us, rest of world, etc, braced for Donald Trump\u2019s official 2020 reelection campaign launch tonight. Reminder, Guardian US will be running a special live blog on this, from Orlando, from 5PM ET, with a live feed of Trump\u2019s speech at 8PM. Trump has promised mass deportations of \u201cmillions\u201d of undocumented immigrants from the US, beginning next week, a policy that has sown confusion and drawn skepticism as well as opprobrium from opponents. Acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan has withdrawn from the process to confirm a permanent defense secretary, amid doubts over background checks, turbulent personal life and reports of tricky relationship with Potus. Joe Biden held a successful fundraiser in New York City yesterday, at a financier\u2019s house, attended by a handful of Republicans. He announced his campaign for 2020 has already raised close to $20 million. Elizabeth Warren soon catapulted a proverbial donkey dropping into his eye in scorn. US markets rising on news that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping plan an \u201cextended meeting\u201d while at the G20 in Japan next week, amid the US-China trade war. Shanahan to resign Pentagon post WaPo\u2019s Josh Rogin tweets: US immigration fresh crackdown - not immediate CNN ace reporter Shimon Prokupecz has tweeted an update on the latest immigration threats/row/confusion. I\u2019ll let it speak for itself. This hours after Donald Trump whipped everyone up into a foam and sent a fresh tremor of fear through any undocumented person in the US by announcing an implausible new \u201cpolicy\u201d via Twitter: \u201cNext week ICE [immigration and customs enforcement] will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States. They will be removed as fast as they come in.\u201d Shanahan: turbulent personal life Patrick Shanahan sat down with the Washington Post last night to talk about tricky things that he obviously knew would come out after he had to withdraw from consideration for defense sec. He explains that he now regrets defending actions by his son William after, as a 17-year-old, William beat his mother unconscious with a baseball bat, breaking her skull. Shanahan at the time wrote a memo to a relative where he described the actions as self defense by his son which, even though they would \u201clikely be viewed as an imbalance of force...Will\u2019s mother harassed him for nearly three hours before the incident\u201d. He told the Post on Monday night that he now regrets making that argument, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t believe violence is appropriate ever.\u201d The article goes on to detail extreme turbulence in his marriage to his ex-wife, and their family life. Joni Ernst: Shanahan\u2019s \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst, who has been stoically outspoken as a military veteran, a sexual assault survivor and an ambitious politician who nevertheless turned down an offer to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice president has said Shanahan just did the right thing by withdrawing from the process to confirm a new US defense secretary. Fox\u2019s Chad Pergram notes that Ernst reacted to the Shanahan news by saying: \u201cHe\u2019s doing the right thing he needs to do and I support him\u201d. That sounds a tiny bit like a Nancy Pelosi clap.... Back story: Patrick Shanahan tells all to WashPo The Washington Post pressed the button to launch this story at 12.58PM ET today, one minute ahead of the time logged when Donald Trump announced Shanahan\u2019s withdrawal from the process to find his forever home at the Pentagon. It\u2019s pretty raw, beginning: In the months that he has served as President Trump\u2019s acting secretary of defense, Patrick Shanahan has worked to keep domestic violence incidents within his family private. His wife was arrested after punching him in the face, and his son was arrested after a separate incident in which he hit his mother with a baseball bat. Public disclosure of the nearly decade-old episodes would re-traumatize his young adult children, Shanahan said. On Tuesday, Trump announced in a tweet that Shanahan would not be going through with the nomination process, which had been delayed by an unusually lengthy FBI background check, \u201cso that he can devote more time to his family.\u201d Shanahan spoke publicly about the incidents in interviews with The Washington Post on Monday and Tuesday. \u201cBad things can happen to good families . . . and this is a tragedy, really,\u201d Shanahan said. Dredging up the episode publicly, he said, \u201cwill ruin my son\u2019s life.\u201d Shanahan out amid questions over his relationship with Trump, personal life, FBI background check Patrick Shanahan\u2019s elevation to the permanent post of defense secretary, from acting, had been the subject of a baffling delay. Just yesterday it was reported that various outlets had questioned his relationship with the president, and the Pentagon has been fielding press queries about his personal life, including a messy divorce that involved an accusation of domestic violence from his ex-wife, who was arrested as part of the dispute, Yahoo news wrote. As late as that report yesterday, Shanahan did not respond to requests for comment on this story. The Pentagon referred questions from Yahoo to a spokesperson for Shanahan, who emphasized the personal nature of the allegations. Despite announcing more than a month ago that Shanahan was his pick to get the job, Trump had yet to nominate him formally, forcing the Senate Armed Services committee to postpone a confirmation hearing it had tentatively scheduled for today. Donald Trump just announced that Patrick Shanahan will not be confirmed as secretary of defense, names secretary of the Army, Mark Esper, as new acting defense sec. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo address tensions with Iran during remarks at Centcom (United States Central Command, part of the Pentagon) reiterating last night\u2019s announcement that the US is sending 1,000 additional troops to the Middle East \u201cto deter [Iran] from further aggression in the region\u201d. Here\u2019s a clip via ABC TV on Twitter. California Democratic Rep Barbara Lee notes \u201conce more for people in the back\u201d that Trump and Pompeo can\u2019t go to war \u201cwithout congressional approval. The administration is looking to pressure the clerical regime, not fight it, but the groundwork is being laid for a \u201cpossible confrontation\u201d with Iran, Politico writes. In international trade news, stock prices are sharply higher on Wall Street this lunchtime following news that the leaders of the US and China will meet face-to-face next week at the G20 summit to discuss their long-running trade dispute. Technology and industrial companies, which would benefit the most from easing trade tensions, rose more than the rest of the market, the AP reports. Apple climbed 2.4% and heavy-duty equipment maker Caterpillar added 2.5%. European markets jumped after the head of the European Central Bank said it was ready to cut interest rates if necessary. The S&amp;P 500 index rose 30 points, or 1%, to 2,919. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 327 points, or 1.2%, to 26,437. The Nasdaq rose 120 points, or 1.5%, to 7,965. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 2.05%. For a summary of previous business news from across the globe, take a glance at our business live blog \u201cas it happened\u201d recap out of the Guardian\u2019s London HQ, also coverage of Donald Trump accusing the European Central Bank of unfairly manipulating the euro. It\u2019s Fox on Joe Biden so it must be true Typo notwithstanding: Joe Biden draws Republicans to fundraiser Democratic 2020 front-runner Joe Biden held a fundraiser in New York City last night. He\u2019s doing three more today in the Big App today. Biden suggested that his presidential campaign has taken in close to $20 million already, the Washington Post writes this morning, offering a glimpse of his fundraising prowess in the early stages of the crowded Democratic primary. Biden says he\u2019s raised money from 360,000 donors, with an average contribution of $55. Last night\u2019s event was at the Upper East Side home of Jim Chanos, president and founder of Kynikos Associates, a prominent short-selling investment firm, Politico mentioned in its morning newsletter, going off of a reporting pool dispatch from the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Ken Thomas. He writes that: \u201cPrior to Mr Biden\u2019s arrival, around 6 p.m., about two dozen climate change demonstrators gathered outside.\u201d Reporters (but not protesters) were ushered into the penthouse apartment, where \u2018guests mingled, sipped wine and chatted at an adjoining outdoor terrace. Artwork lined the walls of the apartment. Biden said he appreciated the donors for \u201cwriting a check to allow me to compete...nationally\u201d. \u2018Guests spotted by the pool included: Former Senator Al D\u2019Amato, Republican of New York, Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney, former Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, who served as a VA undersecretary for health during the Obama administration and says he was fired as VA secretary by Trump in 2018; [grocery store billionaire and former Republican candidate for city mayor] John Catsimatidis, and other prominent Democratic fundraisers. Half an hour later, 2020 rival and the leading woman in the race, Elizabeth Warren, zinged out an email to observers and supporters saying: \u201cI don\u2019t spend time at fancy fundraisers. Instead, I spend my time meeting voters and thanking grassroots donors who chip in what they can. Donate $3 to my campaign, and you might just get a call from me to thank you!\u201d AOC accuses Trump of operating \u201cconcentration camps\u201d at the border Look, I know, Google Calendar is down. You don\u2019t know where you\u2019re supposed to be, doing what. Nothing for it but to dive into the social media storm that\u2019s blown up in a Bermuda Triangle of recrimination and confusion involving New York Democratic Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Wyoming Republican Rep Liz Cheney and....her Dad, Dick...no, wait, I mean her president, Donald. It\u2019s awful. Here goes. We\u2019ll kick off with AOC\u2019s latest riposte to Liz and work backwards. Ocasio-Cortez posted a video to Instagram last night, also accessible here via Twitter, in which she accused the Trump administration of creating concentration camps in which to detain migrants who have crossed the border unlawfully, while they are processed and, increasingly, swiftly dispatched back across to Mexico even if they are claiming asylum from suffering in their home countries, especially Central America. \u201cThe US is running concentration camps on our southern border, that\u2019s exactly what they are,\u201d she says. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t bother you...I do not, I like, okay, whatever,\u201d she says, shrugging in exasperation. \u201cNever again means something,\u201d she says, and points out that such rounding-up and detention \u201cin the land of the free\u201d is extraordinarily disturbing. Cue Twitter tempest over the echoes of the Holocaust, implied parallel between Trump and Hitler, anti-semitism, even mentions of Abu Ghraib...it\u2019s vicious and unfiltered from both sides of the argument. Liz Cheney Trump and Xi meeting \u201chadn\u2019t been officially scheduled\u201d More on that report, after Trump said he had a \u201cvery good\u201d telephone conversation with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping and said the two leaders would have an \u201cextended meeting\u201d later this month in Japan. The meeting, which hadn\u2019t officially been scheduled, is aimed at repairing relations between the two countries and easing tensions over trade, the Wall Street Journal writes, adding that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up more than 300 points in recent trading. The two countries have been embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade dispute since last year and had hoped to reach a deal, but talks faltered in May, with the US blaming China for reneging on its promises in the eleventh hour of discussions. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is scheduled to testify on the president\u2019s trade policy in a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee Tuesday morning.\u2019 Germany\u2019s Merkel listening to US on Iran - at least with one ear German Chancellor Angela Merkel says her country is taking \u201cvery seriously\u201d the new US information about Iran\u2019s alleged responsibility for attacks last week on two oil tankers near the Persian Gulf. Merkel says \u201cthere\u2019s a high-level of evidence. But that won\u2019t stop me from saying we have to do everything to solve the conflict situation with Iran in a peaceful manner.\u201d Iran denies the US accusation, the AP writes. She says Germany \u201cwill do everything to impress on all sides, but especially to make clear to Iran, that this serious situation mustn\u2019t be aggravated.\u201d Merkel also says Germany wants Iran to abide by the 2015 nuclear accord, [agreed by Barack Obama and abandoned by Donald Trump], adding that \u201cif that isn\u2019t the case that will of course have consequences.\u201d Meanwhile, China\u2019s top diplomat has warned the United States against opening a \u201cPandora\u2019s box\u201d in the Middle East after the recent flare-up in tension between Washington and Tehran. Foreign Minister Wang Yi is calling on both countries to avoid escalating the situation. In a further US foreign policy development, the Guardian\u2019s David Smith and Julian Borger report today that Iran has declared it \u201cwill not wage war against any nation\u201d after the US announced that a further 1,000 troops are to be sent to the Middle East amid rising tensions. That full report here. They socked it to him. Before Air Force One touches down in their backyard later today, with Potus, Flotus and Veep preparing to launch his reelection campaign, the big Orlando local daily paper isn\u2019t mincing its words. \u2018Donald Trump is in Orlando to announce the kickoff of his re-election campaign. We\u2019re here to announce our endorsement for president in 2020, or, at least, who we\u2019re not endorsing: Donald Trump,\u2019 the Orlando Sentinel writes today. The editorial continues: \u2018Some readers will wonder how we could possibly eliminate a candidate so far before an election, and before knowing the identity of his opponent. Because there\u2019s no point pretending we would ever recommend that readers vote for Trump. After 2\u00bd years we\u2019ve seen enough. Enough of the chaos, the division, the schoolyard insults, the self-aggrandizement, the corruption, and especially the lies. So many lies \u2014 from white lies to whoppers \u2014 told out of ignorance, laziness, recklessness, expediency or opportunity. Trump\u2019s capacity for lying isn\u2019t the surprise here, though the frequency is. It\u2019s the tolerance so many Americans have for it. There was a time when even a single lie \u2014 a phony college degree, a bogus work history \u2014 would doom a politician\u2019s career.\u2019 There\u2019s a LOT more to digest. 2020 Democrats respond to Trump threat Following the president\u2019s loud-hailer announcement last night about mass deportations of those in the US unlawfully, candidates for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination for president have begun to weight in. Texas\u2019s Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s succinct take on Twitter was: \u201cMilitarizing and raiding our communities makes us less, nor more, safe\u201d, prompting a reply from one person out there describing himself as a \u201cstaunch conservative\u201d, who said: \u201cMr O\u2019Rourke...I must say I agree with you on this.\u201d New York mayor and 2020 wannabe (despite lack of support for the idea in the Big Apple itself) Bill de Blasio tweeted his response this morning, with a link to an article about undocumented people working for Trump. Washington State governor and climate action champion Jay Inslee tweeted: \u201cDonald Trump kicks off his re-election campaign just like he launched his first run - with a racist attack on immigrants meant to divide us.\u201d And Steve Bullock, the Democratic governor of Montana, tweeted: \u201cWe will not let him use cruel threats to divide us.\u201d That sounds great when you first hear it but, when I think about it for two seconds, brings to mind flinging drawing pins at the backside of a bull elephant. Potus has tweeted that he and China\u2019s president Xi Jinping just got off the phone. Trump and Stephen Miller wave \u201crocket docket\u201d If you\u2019re a true believer, giving a hardline policy an offensive moniker is, obviously, hilarious. So, apparently, this new twist on US immigration policy that even lapdogs Kirstjen Nielsen and Ron Vitiello couldn\u2019t stomach is called the \u201crocket docket\u201d, the Washington Post reports today, conjuring images of speed, power and scorched earth in the president\u2019s haste to get on with raids that break up families and will damage the US economy. \u2018Trump and his senior immigration adviser, Stephen Miller (architect of the original Trump travel ban), have been prodding Homeland Security officials to arrest and remove thousands of family members whose deportation orders were expedited by the Justice Department this year as part of a plan known as the \u201crocket docket.\u201d In April, acting ICE director Ronald Vitiello and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen were ousted after they hesitated to go forward with the plan, expressing concerns about its preparation, effectiveness and the risk of public outrage from images of migrant children being taken into custody or separated from their families,\u2019 the Post writes. \u2018US officials with knowledge of the preparations have said in recent days that the operation was not imminent, and ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] officials said late Monday night that they were not aware that the president planned to divulge their enforcement plans on Twitter. Executing a large-scale operation of the type under discussion requires hundreds \u2014 and perhaps thousands \u2014 of US agents and supporting law enforcement personnel, as well as weeks of intelligence gathering and planning to verify addresses and locations of individuals targeted for arrest. The president\u2019s claim that ICE would be deporting \u201cmillions\u201d also was at odds with the reality of the agency\u2019s staffing and budgetary challenges. ICE arrests in the US interior have been declining in recent months because so many agents are busy managing the record surge of migrant families across the southern border with Mexico.\u2019 Trump\u2019s fresh threat of mass deportations sows confusion And, in opposition quarters, scorn and revulsion. The prospect of him really going off on another prejudiced mega-rant tonight is making me queasy. After tweeting last night that \u201cThey will be removed as fast as they come in,\u201d he gave no further details. That would appear to indicate migrants who have recently crossed the US-Mexico border. But an administration official told the Associated Press that the effort would focus on the more than a million people who have been issued final deportation orders by federal judges but remain at large in the country. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to explain the president\u2019s tweets. It is unusual for law enforcement agencies to announce raids before they take place. Some in the Trump administration believe that decisive shows of force \u2014 like mass arrests \u2014 can serve as effective deterrents, sending a message to those considering making the journey to the US, from Central America and beyond, that it\u2019s not worth coming. Trump threatens swift mass deportations of undocumented immigrants; policy document known as \u201cthe rocket docket\u201d Let\u2019s begin with Trump\u2019s tweets from last night. And he adds: Camping out - the base \u2018With tents, sleeping bags and coolers of water in tow, Donald Trump supporters began lining up early Monday for today\u2019s campaign rally in Orlando, nearly two full days before the event, the Orlando Sentinel daily newspaper reports this morning. Outside the Amway Center, where President Trump will officially kick off his 2020 re-election bid at 8 p.m., about two dozen people and counting had staked out a spot along Division Street as of Monday morning. The line had grown to about 50 as of 3 p.m. By 9:30 p.m., the line ballooned to about 250, with people snaked around to Central Boulevard. Around the same time, Trump tweeted there were \u201cthousands of people already lined up.\u201d \u201cThis is the big one,\u201d said Jennifer Petito, 54, of Melbourne, [Florida]. \u201cThis is the mother of all rallies.\u201d Petitio, who was wearing a pink \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d hat and a red-and-white striped fanny pack [your Guardian reporter\u2019s note for our UK readers: translation of this abominable and abominably-titled item = bumbag], was second in line. She said she got there around 2 a.m. \u2014 42 hours before the rally\u2019s start. The Amway has capacity for about 20,000 people. Trump tweeted Monday that there had been more than 100,000 requests for tickets, and that large screens and food trucks would be on hand for those who can\u2019t get inside.\u2019 The Guardian can\u2019t help noticing the discrepancy in the statistics. Remember, Trump said thousands of members of the public came out to cheer him in London earlier this month. The biggest crowds were actually thousands of demonstrators, jeering. Good Tuesday morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s American politics live blog. It\u2019s going to be a lively day and I\u2019ll be taking you up to 5pm east coast time with all the events and analysis. Then Guardian US is kicking off a special live blog from Orlando with my colleague Adam Gabbatt as the team prepares to cover the president\u2019s official 2020 campaign launch, with live stream. Donald Trump launches his 2020 re-election campaign tonight and has performed his own curtain-raiser by threatening via Twitter last night to begin deporting \u201cmillions of illegal aliens\u201d from the US. The pledge has caused nothing but confusion, however, as the logistics of this are virtually impossible, and such policies are usually kept secret anyway. Our politics chief David Smith previews tonight\u2019s event and its significance in this piece today on \u201cvulnerable Trump\u201d. Trump\u2019s base has been flocking from far and wide to the campaign event in Orlando, where Trump\u2019s speech begins at 8pm EDT. We\u2019ll be live streaming it as well as live blogging the event and reporting from in and around the arena in this swing area of a swing state. More decisions are awaited from the US Supreme Court in its traditional June outpouring of decisions. Most breathlessly: the issue of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census and a battle over gerrymandering. And \u2026 what happened at that Joe Biden fundraiser last night? Stay tuned \u2026",

It went on a little too long and you got the sense, as you did in many of Davies\u2019 Doctor Who episodes that he can\u2019t bring himself to say goodbye to his creations quite as quickly as he should, but it tied up loose ends and gave most of the emotional catharsis we needed, even if it did ultimately end on an open note.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the most subtle work and it wasn\u2019t aiming to be.

By humanising such abstract, knotty problems as the power of technology, the creep of surveillance capitalism, and what we frogs should do as the water starts heating up, and by personalising such intractable problems as refugee crises and the competition for scarce resources, it probably reached more people with greater effect than any number of handwringing articles could do. Queer as Folk may remain Davies\u2019 masterpiece, but this was a glorious \u2013 prescient, funny, warm, frightening, compelling \u2013 companion piece.

Bethany and her omniscient implants are drafted in to help, and Edith \u2013 a warrior to the end \u2013 uses Viktor\u2019s escape plan as the springboard for an uprising. A missile launcher takes out the camp\u2019s signal blocker, inmates\u2019 phones come to life and the revolution, it turns out will be televised, streamed, uploaded and distributed so far and wide that even the ruling party\u2019s internet-scrubbing powers won\u2019t contain it. Stephen too plays his part in bringing down the house, an act of redemption that might have rung a little hollow for those of us who never quite bought his descent \u2013 however angry at life and grief-stricken about Danny he was \u2013 into vindictive near-murderer, but was welcome nevertheless. After a fast and furious 45 minutes we ended with a quieter epilogue, as technology (rightly, never an unalloyed good or evil in Davies\u2019 eyes but always a neutral instrument placed in people\u2019s hands for them to decide its use) once more offered liberation, this time to Edith. It went on a little too long and you got the sense, as you did in many of Davies\u2019 Doctor Who episodes that he can\u2019t bring himself to say goodbye to his creations quite as quickly as he should, but it tied up loose ends and gave most of the emotional catharsis we needed, even if it did ultimately end on an open note. It wasn\u2019t the most subtle work and it wasn\u2019t aiming to be. What it was was an unwholesome amount of fun-slash-devastation; soap-operatic in the best way, with (Stephen\u2019s mis-step aside) character never sacrificed to plot, but plot there being aplenty. It wore its concerns lightly but never lost sight of them. By humanising such abstract, knotty problems as the power of technology, the creep of surveillance capitalism, and what we frogs should do as the water starts heating up, and by personalising such intractable problems as refugee crises and the competition for scarce resources, it probably reached more people with greater effect than any number of handwringing articles could do. Queer as Folk may remain Davies\u2019 masterpiece, but this was a glorious \u2013 prescient, funny, warm, frightening, compelling \u2013 companion piece. It\u2019s just a terrifying pity the future is arriving so soon.",

The difference is that, because Afterpay takes on the risk of default from the supplier, the purchaser receives the product upfront.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2019/jun/04/credit-vs-debt-how-afterpay-and-other-buy-now-pay-later-providers-skirt-consumer-laws\">Credit vs debt? How Afterpay and other buy-now pay-later providers skirt consumer laws | Saurav Dutta and Lien Duong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The company was founded in 2014 by Nick Molnar, a Sydney-based 29-year-old who previously founded <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/personal-finance/afterpay-startup-means-no-more-paying-for-dud-online-purchases-20150616-ghpc0n\">an online jewellery retailer while at university</a>. The company went public with a $125m listing in 2016, and reported underlying sales of $4.7bn in the 11 months to May 2019.</p> <p>It now has 1.5 million active customers in the US and has conducted a soft launch in the UK under the name Clearpay.</p> <h2>Why is it in the news?</h2> <p>Last week, Afterpay raised $317.2m in fresh capital through a share issue, in part to help fund its international growth. At the same time, its three executive directors, Molnar, David Hancock and Anthony Eisen, cashed out to the tune of $103.5m. There is no suggestion of any possible link between the investigation by Austrac and the sale of those shares.</p> <p>On 12 June, director Elana Rubin said the company was \u201cpleased by the strong investor support shown in the capital raising for the Afterpay business and our global growth strategy as outlined in our previously announced mid-term plan\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe placement was oversubscribed, and we are also pleased to welcome several new high-quality institutions on to our register,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But just a day later, on 13 June, Afterpay revealed Austrac \u2013 Australia\u2019s financial crime watchdog \u2013 had ordered the company to appoint an external auditor to probe possible breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.</p> <p>The announcement saw the company\u2019s shares sink from $23 at its share issue to $20.27 at the close on Monday.</p> <h2>What is Austrac investigating?</h2> <p>In its notice to Afterpay, Austrac said it had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to suspect the company \u201chas contravened and/or is contravening sections 32 and 81 of the AntiMoney Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) Act\u201d.</p> <p>Section 32 of the act requires reporting entities to first verify customers before providing a service, including a customer\u2019s name and either their address or date of birth verified through \u201cthe use of reliable and independent electronic data from at least two separate data sources\u201d.</p> <p>Section 81 prohibits companies from providing a service to a customer

the identification and verification of customers<br>\u2022 suspicious matter reporting obligations<br>\u2022 its AML/CTF program, including the development of its money laundering and terrorism financing risk assessment</p> <p>Under the legislation, the company could face a maximum penalty of $21m, or $42m if they are found to have breached both sections.</p> <p>The same issues were flagged last year, when the governance firm Ownership Matters issued a report detailing how the lack of verification could allow minors could <a

alcohol</a>.</p> <p>Following the report, Afterpay responded by introducing third-party verification of customer identification.</p> <p>In a statement to the stock exchange, Afterpay said it had been \u201cproactively engaged with Austrac on our AML/CTF compliance over a number of months, including recent engagement about our intention to conduct an independent review as part of our AML/CTF program\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Austrac said it had ordered the appointment of an external auditor after 'a period of ongoing

continue to work closely with Austrac to develop a leading compliance regime specific to our business in a transparent and cooperative manner,\u201d the company said.</p> <h2>Who knew what, and when?</h2> <p>The timing of the Austrac announcement so soon after Afterpay\u2019s capital raising, coupled with the company\u2019s admission that it had been in discussions with Austrac for \u201ca number of months\u201d, prompted the Australian stock exchange to query what the company knew and when.</p> <p>In an earlier trading update on 5 June, Afterpay had said it was \u201ccurrently in dialogue\u201d with Austrac regarding issues the the financial crime watchdog had raised regarding AML/CTF compliance.</p> <p>The company said at the time the outcome of the discussions was \u201cyet to be determined\u201d but that it had \u201cnot identified any money-laundering or terrorism-financing activity via our systems to date\u201d.</p> <p>Then, in its capital raising document issued on 11 June, the company said \u201cone potential outcome\u201d of those discussions was that Austrac could order the company to appoint an external auditor.</p> <p>On 14 June, in response to written request for answers from the ASX, Afterpay revealed it first began \u201cinformal and constructive\u201d discussions with Austrac from August last year.</p> <p>Then, in April, the financial watchdog indicated to Afterpay that it was considering giving notice to appoint an external auditor \u201cbut requested further information or documents\u201d before making a decision.</p> <aside

      "bodyText": "Last week Australia\u2019s financial watchdog, Austrac, ordered the popular buy-now pay-later company Afterpay to appoint an external auditor over concerns about the company\u2019s compliance with anti-money laundering and terrorism-financing laws. Stocks in the company have tumbled, and questions are being asked about the timing of the audit \u2013 announced only a day after the company raised more than $300m in a share offering on the Australian stock exchange. The company has admitted it had been in talks with Austrac since August last year, but says it didn\u2019t know about the order until after the share issue. What is Afterpay? Afterpay operates similarly to a lay-by system \u2013 consumers purchase a product and pay it off in four instalments, paid fortnightly. The difference is that, because Afterpay takes on the risk of default from the supplier, the purchaser receives the product upfront. The company was founded in 2014 by Nick Molnar, a Sydney-based 29-year-old who previously founded an online jewellery retailer while at university. The company went public with a $125m listing in 2016, and reported underlying sales of $4.7bn in the 11 months to May 2019. It now has 1.5 million active customers in the US and has conducted a soft launch in the UK under the name Clearpay. Why is it in the news? Last week, Afterpay raised $317.2m in fresh capital through a share issue, in part to help fund its international growth. At the same time, its three executive directors, Molnar, David Hancock and Anthony Eisen, cashed out to the tune of $103.5m. There is no suggestion of any possible link between the investigation by Austrac and the sale of those shares. On 12 June, director Elana Rubin said the company was \u201cpleased by the strong investor support shown in the capital raising for the Afterpay business and our global growth strategy as outlined in our previously announced mid-term plan\u201d. \u201cThe placement was oversubscribed, and we are also pleased to welcome several new high-quality institutions on to our register,\u201d she said. But just a day later, on 13 June, Afterpay revealed Austrac \u2013 Australia\u2019s financial crime watchdog \u2013 had ordered the company to appoint an external auditor to probe possible breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. The announcement saw the company\u2019s shares sink from $23 at its share issue to $20.27 at the close on Monday. What is Austrac investigating? In its notice to Afterpay, Austrac said it had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to suspect the company \u201chas contravened and/or is contravening sections 32 and 81 of the AntiMoney Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) Act\u201d. Section 32 of the act requires reporting entities to first verify customers before providing a service, including a customer\u2019s name and either their address or date of birth verified through \u201cthe use of reliable and independent electronic data from at least two separate data sources\u201d. Section 81 prohibits companies from providing a service to a customer without having an AML/CTF program in place. In a statement, Austrac said it had ordered the appointment of an external auditor after \u201ca period of ongoing engagement with Afterpay where Austrac has identified concerns with its compliance\u201d. The external auditor will examine the company\u2019s: \u2022 governance and oversight of decisions related to its AML/CTF framework \u2022 the identification and verification of customers \u2022 suspicious matter reporting obligations \u2022 its AML/CTF program, including the development of its money laundering and terrorism financing risk assessment Under the legislation, the company could face a maximum penalty of $21m, or $42m if they are found to have breached both sections. The same issues were flagged last year, when the governance firm Ownership Matters issued a report detailing how the lack of verification could allow minors could use the payments to buy up to $300 worth of alcohol. Following the report, Afterpay responded by introducing third-party verification of customer identification. In a statement to the stock exchange, Afterpay said it had been \u201cproactively engaged with Austrac on our AML/CTF compliance over a number of months, including recent engagement about our intention to conduct an independent review as part of our AML/CTF program\u201d. \u201cWe recognise that buy-now pay-later is a new and maturing sector not only for our customers, but also for regulators, and we will continue to work closely with Austrac to develop a leading compliance regime specific to our business in a transparent and cooperative manner,\u201d the company said. Who knew what, and when? The timing of the Austrac announcement so soon after Afterpay\u2019s capital raising, coupled with the company\u2019s admission that it had been in discussions with Austrac for \u201ca number of months\u201d, prompted the Australian stock exchange to query what the company knew and when. In an earlier trading update on 5 June, Afterpay had said it was \u201ccurrently in dialogue\u201d with Austrac regarding issues the the financial crime watchdog had raised regarding AML/CTF compliance. The company said at the time the outcome of the discussions was \u201cyet to be determined\u201d but that it had \u201cnot identified any money-laundering or terrorism-financing activity via our systems to date\u201d. Then, in its capital raising document issued on 11 June, the company said \u201cone potential outcome\u201d of those discussions was that Austrac could order the company to appoint an external auditor. On 14 June, in response to written request for answers from the ASX, Afterpay revealed it first began \u201cinformal and constructive\u201d discussions with Austrac from August last year. Then, in April, the financial watchdog indicated to Afterpay that it was considering giving notice to appoint an external auditor \u201cbut requested further information or documents\u201d before making a decision. The company said it \u201csought feedback from Austrac on several occasions in May and June\u201d this year following the share raising proposal. \u201cAs recently as 4 June 2019 Austrac stated to [Afterpay] that it had not come to a decision internally,\u201d the company said. The company said it was not aware that the notice was going to be given when it gave its investor presentation on 11 June. \u201cThe first confirmation that Austrac would issue the notice was during a telephone call late on 12 June 2019,\u201d the company said. \u201c[Afterpay] did not have advanced notice of the matters to be raised on that call. During the course of that call, we were informed that Austrac had decided to issue a notice.\u201d Concerns about Afterpay Afterpay has marketed itself as a company for the millennial age, allowing consumers instant gratification on a purchase without introducing them into credit debt. The company \u2013 which has a number of competitors both in Australia and overseas \u2013 doesn\u2019t charge interest on payments but makes money by charging retailer and late payment fees. That has long prompted concerns form consumer advocates who say the company\u2019s no-interest model allows it to avoid consumer protections in the National Consumer Credit Protections Act.",

It is the first polar bear seen in the city in more than 40 years, according to local environmentalists. \u201cShe is still moving around a factory, under observation by police and the emergency services, who are ensuring her safety and those of residents,\u201d environmental services official Alexander Korobkin told AFP. The bear was first spotted on Sunday evening in an industrial area north-east of central Norilsk, Korobkin said. A team of specialists are set to arrive Wednesday to inspect the animal and decide its fate. Oleg Krashevsky, a local wildlife expert who filmed the polar bear close up, said it was unclear what had brought the animal to the city, although it was possible it had simply got lost. He said it had watery eyes and could clearly not see well. The climate crisis has been damaging polar bears\u2019 sea-ice habitats and forced them to scavenge more for food on land, bringing them into contact with people and inhabited areas. A state of emergency was declared in a remote inhabited area of northern Russian earlier this year when dozens of hungry polar bears were seen scavenging for food and entering public buildings and homes. State wildlife experts are expected to arrive in Norilsk on Wednesday to assess the bear\u2019s condition. Local residents in the city known for nickel production came out to photograph the bear and look at it as police prevented them from getting too close.

      "bodyText": "The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has called on other nations to help safeguard tanker traffic in the Persian Gulf following a spate of attacks on ships which Washington blames on Iran. On a visit to US Central Command headquarters, Pompeo said shipping security in the Gulf was not exclusively a US problem. \u201cYou have China that depends enormously on energy transiting the Strait of Hormuz. You have South Korea, Indonesia, Japan, all of whom have an enormous interest in ensuring there\u2019s freedom of navigation throughout this waterway,\u201d the secretary of state said. \u201cThe United States is prepared to do its part, but every nation that has a deep interest in protecting that shipping lane so that energy can move around the world and support their economies needs to make sure they understand the real threat.\u201d Pompeo added that \u201cPresident Trump does not want war, and we will continue to communicate that message, while doing the things that are necessary to protect American interests in the region.\u201d In an interview on Tuesday, Trump played down the threat to the US represented by the tanker attacks in the region, which he described as being \u201cvery minor\u201d. \u201cOther places get such vast amounts of oil there,\u201d Trump told Time magazine. \u201cWe get very little. We have made tremendous progress in the last two and a half years in energy. And when the pipelines get built, we\u2019re now an exporter of energy. So we\u2019re not in the position that we used to be in in the Middle East where \u2026 some people would say we were there for the oil.\u201d The Trump administration is seeking to handle the Gulf crisis amid turmoil in its top ranks. The acting defence secretary, Patrick Shanahan, who Trump had nominated to take on the job official, resigned on Tuesday \u201cto devote more time to his family\u201d, according to a Trump tweet. Trump named the army secretary, Mark Esper, to take over as acting defence secretary. The US has not had a Senate-confirmed defence secretary in place since December, when James Mattis resigned. As with his approach to Nato and US Pacific alliances, Trump is focused on persuading allies in the Gulf to shoulder a greater burden in providing security. The US would be able to rely on Gulf Arab support for tanker protection, but enlisting European involvement is complicated by the fact that European governments see the Trump administration as having precipitating the crisis by walking out of the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal with Iran, and imposing an oil and banking embargo on the country. On Tuesday, Pompeo confirmed that the visit to Tehran last week by the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was made on Trump\u2019s request. \u201cPresident Trump had sent \u2026 Abe to take a message of his to the leadership in Iran,\u201d the secretary of statem said. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, rejected the proposal of a dialogue with Trump and the two tankers, one of them Japanese-owned, were attacked while Abe was in Tehran. The deputy chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Paul Selva also confirmed on Tuesday that the US had been using Swiss and Iraqi channels as well as public messaging to warn Iran off any direct attack on US interests. \u201cTo engage [the US reinforcements] would be a miscalculation that would lead to a response,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them to do that. We want them to be clear-eyed in whatever it is they are planning.\u201d He added: \u201cThe risks of miscalculation are real.\u201d Iran has denied responsibility for the blasts that hobbled two tankers in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday, but on Tuesday the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) \u2013 which the US says carried out the attack with limpet mines \u2013 stepped up the threat to ships travelling through the Strait of Hormuz. \u201cThese missiles can hit with great precision carriers in the sea,\u201d Brig Gen Hossein Salami said in a televised speech. \u201cThese missiles are domestically produced and are difficult to intercept and hit with other missiles.\u201d Anthony Cordesman, a national security analyst at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said Arab states in the Gulf could easily help protect tankers with surveillance planes and drones, and could have warplanes at the site of an attack within minutes. Cordesman acknowledged that deep scepticism over US policy towards Iran has made European governments cautious about being drawn into a conflict, but he argued that the presence of a UK and French naval fleet could offer a powerful political deterrent to further attacks. \u201cIf what you want is a precondition for negotiations, and cool the situation down, there is an incentive for the UK and France to take part \u2013 if what you are doing is deterring attacks and monitoring the situation,\u201d Cordesman said.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn plans to use a speech in the coming days to outline the latest evolution in Labour\u2019s Brexit policy \u2013 but is expected to stop well short of the clarion call for remain demanded by his deputy, Tom Watson. The shadow cabinet will discuss Brexit on Wednesday, with the Labour leader under intense pressure from shadow ministers including Watson, Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer to signal more clearly his support for a fresh referendum. They will receive the second part of a polling presentation that began at last week\u2019s meeting, underlining the fact that Labour\u2019s vote is being squeezed both by the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit party. Corbyn\u2019s team postponed the planned meeting on Monday, as his deputy gave a provocative speech saying: \u201cOur members are remain, our hearts are remain, our values are remain.\u201d Even some of Corbyn\u2019s closest allies, including John McDonnell and Diane Abbott, have been urging him to shift towards more wholehearted backing for a referendum, or risk endangering the party\u2019s prospects in a general election, which could come within months. Two senior Labour sources told the Guardian that Andrew Fisher, Corbyn\u2019s trusted policy chief, had also mooted a shift towards a more pro-remain stance, arguing that Labour\u2019s nuanced message had landed poorly with both remain and leave voters. In the wake of the party\u2019s dire performance in last month\u2019s European parliament elections, when it picked up just 14% of the vote, Corbyn did outline a shift in position, towards advocating a \u201cpublic vote\u201d on any Brexit deal. But he subsequently said a referendum was \u201csome way off\u201d, and disgruntled grassroots members are still organising vigorously to try to put pressure on the leadership at the party\u2019s autumn conference. The Guardian understands Corbyn will flesh out and develop that position \u2013 a public vote on any Brexit deal agreed by a future government, Tory or Labour \u2013 in a speech, perhaps as soon as this week. However, several shadow cabinet members, including Jon Trickett, Ian Lavery and Angela Rayner, remain wary about the impact on Labour voters in leave-supporting constituencies. Some are also anxious about appearing to cave in to Watson, whom they believe is using Brexit as a \u201cwedge\u201d issue, to undermine Labour members\u2019 support for Corbyn\u2019s leadership. There is little prospect of an immediate challenge to Corbyn, but some allies fear that a pro-remain candidate \u2013 perhaps Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary \u2013 could in future win over remain-supporting members who are concerned about the party\u2019s stance. However, the party\u2019s poor result in May has contributed to a change of heart among some shadow cabinet ministers who had previously been wary of a referendum. Richard Burgon has told colleagues he believes the emergence of Boris Johnson as the frontrunner to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister makes it easier for Labour to make the argument that the public should be given another say. Meanwhile Watson took his argument to Twitter on Tuesday, publishing a video in which he chatted with young people about their views on Europe, and asked them what the shadow cabinet \u2013 of which he is a member \u2013 should do. \u201cThe verdict: be bolder, be braver. We have to take a stand,\u201d he said. The debate over Labour\u2019s policy has been sharpened in the wake of the European elections, when Vince Cable\u2019s Lib Dems overtook Labour with a clear \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d slogan. McDonnell tweeted immediately afterwards: \u201cCan\u2019t hide from hit we took last night. Bringing people together when there\u2019s such a divide was never going to be easy. \u201cNow we face prospect of Brexiteer extremist as Tory leader &amp; threat of no deal, we must unite our party &amp; country by taking issue back to people in a public vote.\u201d However, Thornberry was dropped as Corbyn\u2019s stand-in at prime minister\u2019s questions earlier this month after strongly criticising the party\u2019s campaign in a TV appearance on polling day.",

But more than 50 years on, the case remains unsolved. However, an investigation by NPR has uncovered fresh evidence from the civil-rights era cold case \u2013 including the identity of an attacker who says he took part in the beating, but who was never charged. Reeb, a white Unitarian church minister from Boston, was sevrely beaten along with two other ministers on a street corner in Selma, Alabama, where he travelled in support of black voting rights. Reeb, 38, was taken to hospital after the attack, but died from his injuries two days later. A few months after Reeb\u2019s death, Lyndon Johnson cited the minister\u2019s name as he introduced the Voting Rights Act, the landmark piece of legislation designed to end discrimination that led to huge increases in the registration of black voters and black elected officials. Three men were charged over Reeb\u2019s death but were later acquitted by an all-white jury. Frances Bowden, who claims to have witnessed the murder, told NPR that the three acquitted men \u2013 William Stanley Hoggle, Elmer Cook and Namon O\u2019Neal \u201cDuck\u201d Hoggle \u2013 carried out the attack.

I\u2019ve become a target for guys because the hundred I scored [from 57 balls] is considered a slow one in our dressing room. It\u2019s a tough school.\u201d</p> \n<p>Morgan created this tough school. Remember the batsman who switched allegiance from Ireland to England back in 2009 and bundled his new teammates into the DeLorean for a trip to the future via an array of ramps, sweeps, reverse sweeps and even the odd reverse-reverse sweep?</p> \n<p>These days such shots remain largely stashed in the boot \u2013 he produced only a couple here \u2013 with a simpler approach employed. Morgan remains still at the crease, side on to the bowler and, without clearing the front leg like so many others, strikes through the line with just a hint of those rubbery wrists for added power.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4965f1c63c246ce9d607dde0187b126302845b9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4965f1c63c246ce9d607dde0187b126302845b9/0_257_4259_2555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eoin Morgan holds his bat aloft after reaching his century in magnificent style.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eoin Morgan holds his bat aloft after reaching his century in magnificent style.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Copley-IDI/IDI via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If the player has changed over time then, since the 2015 World Cup, Morgan the captain has never once wavered in terms of the cricket he wants from his team. His subordinates are constantly pushed to expand their minds, free their arms and set the trend, rather than follow it. Collapses have been met with the instruction to smarten up but, crucially, not rein it in.</p> \n<p>The result is such that the demolition of the Afghan attack, in which England broke their own record with 25 sixes in the innings and posted the highest ODI score at Old Trafford (as well as the highest of the World Cup to date), was surprisingly unsurprising. It\u2019s what they do these days \u2013 just ask Tim Paine, the former Australia captain who stuck them in at Trent Bridge last year and watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/19/eoin-morgan-england-cricket-record-total-481-australia-trent-bridge\" title=\"\">481 for six unfold</a>.</p> \n<p>Amid this latest display of carnage came a remarkable demolition job on Rashid Khan, the uber-talented wrist-spinner who tears up the Twenty20 leagues and sat atop the ODI bowling rankings less than a year ago, but must now chew on career-worst figures of nine overs, none for 110.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/may/30/cricket-world-cup-2019-latest-standings\">Cricket World Cup 2019: latest standings</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Never before had Rashid gone for more than 68 runs from his allocated set of 10, nor been hit for two sixes in an over. Morgan did this to the 20-year-old twice here and cleared the rope seven times off his bowling in total \u2013 the most by one batsman off one bowler in an ODI.</p> \n<p>It was Bairstow who first climbed into Rashid, watchfully seeing out a couple of overs after his late introduction before slog-sweeping a four and then pinging the sweetest of full-blooded swipes for six.</p> \n<p>Bairstow returned from his maiden spell in the IPL earlier this year gushing about everything he had learned; keeping wicket to Rashid at Sunrisers Hyderabad, and thus getting a handle on his sleight-of-hand magic tricks, must sit high pretty on that list.</p> \n<p>Along with Kevin Pietersen, it was Morgan who was quick to recognise that the power of the IPL went beyond just cash in the bank. The England captain has curiously gone unsold in the last two auctions. Next time the gavel comes out, he may well have some suitors.</p>",

I\u2019ve become a target for guys because the hundred I scored [from 57 balls] is considered a slow one in our dressing room. It\u2019s a tough school.\u201d Morgan created this tough school. Remember the batsman who switched allegiance from Ireland to England back in 2009 and bundled his new teammates into the DeLorean for a trip to the future via an array of ramps, sweeps, reverse sweeps and even the odd reverse-reverse sweep? These days such shots remain largely stashed in the boot \u2013 he produced only a couple here \u2013 with a simpler approach employed. Morgan remains still at the crease, side on to the bowler and, without clearing the front leg like so many others, strikes through the line with just a hint of those rubbery wrists for added power. If the player has changed over time then, since the 2015 World Cup, Morgan the captain has never once wavered in terms of the cricket he wants from his team. His subordinates are constantly pushed to expand their minds, free their arms and set the trend, rather than follow it. Collapses have been met with the instruction to smarten up but, crucially, not rein it in. The result is such that the demolition of the Afghan attack, in which England broke their own record with 25 sixes in the innings and posted the highest ODI score at Old Trafford (as well as the highest of the World Cup to date), was surprisingly unsurprising. It\u2019s what they do these days \u2013 just ask Tim Paine, the former Australia captain who stuck them in at Trent Bridge last year and watched 481 for six unfold. Amid this latest display of carnage came a remarkable demolition job on Rashid Khan, the uber-talented wrist-spinner who tears up the Twenty20 leagues and sat atop the ODI bowling rankings less than a year ago, but must now chew on career-worst figures of nine overs, none for 110. Never before had Rashid gone for more than 68 runs from his allocated set of 10, nor been hit for two sixes in an over. Morgan did this to the 20-year-old twice here and cleared the rope seven times off his bowling in total \u2013 the most by one batsman off one bowler in an ODI. It was Bairstow who first climbed into Rashid, watchfully seeing out a couple of overs after his late introduction before slog-sweeping a four and then pinging the sweetest of full-blooded swipes for six. Bairstow returned from his maiden spell in the IPL earlier this year gushing about everything he had learned; keeping wicket to Rashid at Sunrisers Hyderabad, and thus getting a handle on his sleight-of-hand magic tricks, must sit high pretty on that list. Along with Kevin Pietersen, it was Morgan who was quick to recognise that the power of the IPL went beyond just cash in the bank. The England captain has curiously gone unsold in the last two auctions. Next time the gavel comes out, he may well have some suitors.",

      "bodyText": "Feliciano L\u00f3pez, due to play doubles with Andy Murray in his comeback here at Queen\u2019s this week, was consulting his lawyers on Tuesday about stories circulating in Spain that he and his playing partner, Marc L\u00f3pez, were named in an alleged match-fixing scam at Wimbledon in 2017. The Spaniard, who won the French Open title with his compatriot and unrelated namesake in 2016 \u2013 beating the Bryan brothers in the final \u2013 and was the singles champion here two years ago, declined to comment on the story. It first appeared on Tuesday in El Confidencial, a respected Spanish digital newspaper, then was repeated across social and traditional media outlets. Sources close to the player said he strenuously denied any suggestion that he and Marc L\u00f3pez were even aware that their surprise loss to John-Patrick Smith and Matt Reid, unseeded Australians, had subsequently aroused the suspicions of the Spanish police. Smith, ranked 81 in the world in doubles at the time, and Reid (76) beat the 11th seeds 3-6, 7-6 (2), 6-2, 6-4. Feliciano L\u00f3pez had previously withdrawn from the singles draw with a leg injury. Murray\u2019s camp, meanwhile, confirmed on Tuesday afternoon they were aware of the newspaper stories, but also declined to comment \u2013 as did the Tennis Integrity Unit, which knows about the claims. The allegations centre on the monitored activity of two retired 38-year-old Spanish footballers, Ra\u00fal Bravo, who played six times for Leeds on loan from Real Madrid in 2003, and Carlos Aranda, a La Liga veteran of several clubs. They have also been named in investigations into alleged match-fixing in football, according to El Confidencial. The report said: \u201cInvestigators conducting Operation Oikos reveal that information was passed on about a doubles match involving Feliciano L\u00f3pez and Marc L\u00f3pez at Wimbledon in July 2017, which presumably would be for the purpose of making illegal bets. \u201cThe police got the information from listening to Aranda\u2019s phone. He said: \u2018I have information about a match, do you want it?\u2019 The other speaker said: \u2018Yes man, of course \u2013 if you have it.\u2019 \u201cAranda demanded the contact committed to paying him 50% of all his winnings as payment for the tip, who asked how much he should put on. Aranda said: \u2018As much as you want, it\u2019s Wimbledon!\u2019 \u2013 the idea being that the tournament is so big, no one would be surprised by a huge bet. \u201c\u2018What Feliciano L\u00f3pez and his partner will lose is the doubles,\u2019 was the tip. [They] then lost to Matt Reid and John Patrick Smith, winning the first set before losing the following three.\u201d Feliciano L\u00f3pez and Murray are old friends on the circuit, and the Scot\u2019s coach, Jamie Delgado, made the first overtures about playing together at Queen\u2019s. \u201cHe spoke about the possibility of playing here with Andy,\u201d L\u00f3pez said earlier in the week, \u201cand of course my answer was yes. For me, it\u2019s a great opportunity to share the court with a great player, with a great friend, as well. I hope it\u2019s going to be a good week for us.\u201d Lopez was due to play singles in the Fever-Tree Championships on Tuesday against M\u00e1rton Fucsovics but, like the rest of the card, the match was washed out. Play was abandoned shortly after 5pm. Had he played, L\u00f3pez would have been obliged to attend a press conference \u2013 and it is unlikely the questions would have strayed far from the match-fixing allegations. However, a source close to the player asserted on Tuesday evening that L\u00f3pez was angered by the story and had been in long discussions with his lawyers. Marc L\u00f3pez told Spanish newspaper AS: \u201cThey have no right to dirty our names like that.\u201d As rain ripped through the Queen\u2019s schedule, with more rain forecast, Murray\u2019s comeback, scheduled for Wednesday, has been pushed back to Thursday, to allow L\u00f3pez a chance to play his singles. Murray, still searching for a doubles partner at Wimbledon \u2013 which starts 1 July \u2013 will play with the 35-year-old Brazilian Marcelo Melo at Eastbourne next week.",

Platini was the Uefa president at the time and, as one of the 22 voting Fifa executive committee members in December 2010, he has acknowledged that he voted for Qatar.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/18/michel-platini-arrested-over-award-of-2022-world-cup-to-qatar\">Michel Platini detained over award of 2022 World Cup to Qatar</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>What are the investigators looking into specifically?</strong></h2> <p>The French newspaper Le Monde has reported that the PNF is particularly interested in the now famous lunch nine days before the vote, to which Platini was invited by the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy. Platini has said that, when he arrived at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, he found that Sarkozy had with him Tamim al-Thani, then the son of the Qatar Emir, now the Emir himself, and the then prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim.</p> <p>Platini has said it was clear Sarkozy wanted the Qataris to take over the club he supported, Paris St\u2011Germain, and for Platini to vote for Qatar to host the World Cup. Platini told the Guardian a fortnight ago in Paris before the Fifa congress that he had made his mind up to vote for Qatar before the lunch, having at first considered supporting the USA bid. He said that when he arrived at the lunch and saw the guests, he understood that Sarkozy was supporting Qatar, but has always insisted he was not influenced himself.

      "bodyText": "Why has Michel Platini been questioned by French investigators? France\u2019s Parquet National Financier, which investigates serious financial crime, has since 2017 been looking into possible French corruption in the vote that made Qatar the hosts for the 2022 World Cup. Platini was the Uefa president at the time and, as one of the 22 voting Fifa executive committee members in December 2010, he has acknowledged that he voted for Qatar. What are the investigators looking into specifically? The French newspaper Le Monde has reported that the PNF is particularly interested in the now famous lunch nine days before the vote, to which Platini was invited by the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy. Platini has said that, when he arrived at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, he found that Sarkozy had with him Tamim al-Thani, then the son of the Qatar Emir, now the Emir himself, and the then prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim. Platini has said it was clear Sarkozy wanted the Qataris to take over the club he supported, Paris St\u2011Germain, and for Platini to vote for Qatar to host the World Cup. Platini told the Guardian a fortnight ago in Paris before the Fifa congress that he had made his mind up to vote for Qatar before the lunch, having at first considered supporting the USA bid. He said that when he arrived at the lunch and saw the guests, he understood that Sarkozy was supporting Qatar, but has always insisted he was not influenced himself. Sarkozy has denied influencing Platini to vote for Qatar, suggesting in 2015 that he did not have the power to do so. How has Qatar been prominently involved in France since the vote? Six months after the World Cup was awarded to Qatar, one of the country\u2019s sovereign wealth funds, Qatar Sports Investments, did take over Paris Saint-Germain, which had been in financial difficulties. QSI has put huge amounts into the club, buying superstars including Neymar and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, won six Ligue 1 titles in the last seven years and become fixtures in the Champions League. The Qatari broadcaster beIN immediately also bought the TV rights for Ligue 1 in France and has continued to pay huge money for the French football rights since. The chairman of beIN, Nasser al-Khelaifi, is also chairman of QSI and president of PSG. France has also further developed lucrative trade links with the wealthy gulf state, notably the 2011 sale of 50 Airbus planes to Qatar Airways. Was Platini also questioned about the 2016 European Championship? Platini confirmed this in a statement issued by his representative. It said he had answered all questions \u201ccalmly and precisely, including about the circumstances of the award of Euro 2016\u201d. Uefa\u2019s executive committee awarded the tournament to France in May 2010, by one vote, over Turkey, of 13 cast in a second ballot. There was some surprise at the time that Turkey came so close but there have been no public allegations made of any corruption. The tournament should have been a personal triumph for Platini, in his home country where he is a football legend, but in December 2015 he and the then Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, were banned from football for a payment of 2m Swiss francs Platini received from Fifa in 2011. Platini\u2019s ban concludes this October and he is hoping for a return to football involvement. Could the World Cup be taken away from Qatar if corruption is proved? This seems very unlikely. In eight and a half years Qatar has retained the tournament through several investigations. Most recently the Qataris sailed through an effort by the current Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, to expand the tournament and share it with neighbouring countries. Qatar has spent billions preparing for the tournament three and a half years away, so an extremely good reason would be needed to remove it.",

Apart from his documentaries on Afghanistan or his energetic defence of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal on any radio station that would have him, few people outside of Westminster knew much about the Eton-educated Black Watch veteran. Yet in the past 12 hours his campaign team say they have received earnest enquiries from backers of both Boris Johnson and Michael Gove about potential jobs \u2013 not for Stewart, but jobs that might be available in a future Stewart administration. The MP for Penrith and the Border came a shock fourth in the Tory leadership contest on Tuesday, making it to the next round with 37 votes, an increase of 18 since last week. Victoria Prentis, one of his earliest backers, who has been doing numbers for the Stewart campaign, said she was overjoyed. \u201cMPs told us they were really starting to get traction from their constituents, they were starting to get what we are trying to do,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has a different way of communicating, but it is really getting through to people\u2019s constituents. He really can do this.\u201d Stewart\u2019s campaign has ruffled the positioning of his rivals. \u201cIt is fair to say that Rory Stewart ruined almost everyone\u2019s initial plans,\u201d a member of a rival Tory leadership camp said. One of Stewart\u2019s team said most MPs initially believed his campaign was \u201ceither a joke or just a \u2018suicide bomber\u2019, as it was impolitely put for another candidate like [Michael] Gove \u2026 but it\u2019s been in the last week where people have realised this is really serious.\u201d For a man whose background includes Eton, the Foreign Office and, possibly, the intelligence services, Stewart has done well to paint himself as the outsider rather than Javid, the Rotherham-born son of a Pakistani bus driver. He has overshadowed both Matt Hancock and Dominic Raab\u2019s claim to be the fresh face of the party\u2019s future, taking apart the latter\u2019s unwillingness to rule out proroguing parliament. His viral Twitter and video campaigning have made his other rivals look cautious and old-fashioned. One MP said they believed Stewart had identified one place that Tory MPs would definitely be watching. \u201cTwitter is the worst place to campaign to win over the general public, but this is different, Tory MPs are obsessively monitoring it,\u201d the MP said. \u201cAnd really, what other choice did he have? \u201cEvery MP will say yes to a personal chitchat with Boris; if Rory had tried that same tactic, he would have flunked. Most colleagues might not even have bothered to watch a standard campaign launch speech if he\u2019d done one.\u201d While Gove and Jeremy Hunt have issued attacks on rivals\u2019 \u201cseriousness\u201d or suggested one candidate could be divisive \u2013 both code for Johnson \u2013 Stewart has been prepared to outflank them, at one point openly questioning whether Johnson could be trusted with the nuclear codes. Stewart says he has been told by other campaigns that his willingness to float his policy ideas to members of the public on his walks around the country has scuppered some of their plans for major announcements. One campaign was reportedly planning to launch the idea of a national citizens service after months of debating its merits. Stewart breezily announced his version on handheld camera after a walkabout in Derby. His campaign benefited at the start from low expectations, and for days leading up to the first vote his tally of supporters was in single figures. When he met the threshold he looked like the insurgent because so many had assumed he would be knocked out. Stewart\u2019s unexpected success was the nail in the coffin for Hancock, who had hoped to hoover up Stewart\u2019s supporters in the next round but instead found his base being cannibalised. One big gain for Stewart\u2019s campaign has been the support of the justice secretary, David Gauke, a heavyweight who has been prepared to go out to bat for him on the airwaves and on Twitter, where he has made spicy comments about the fitness of Johnson to steward the economy. The campaign has also won the support of David Lidington, the deputy prime minister. \u201cLidington was obviously a huge gain for us, we are the only ones picking up those high-profile backers in recent days apart from Boris,\u201d one source on the Stewart campaign said. Other MPs will point out that his supporters are not anything like a solid bloc vote, more a ragtag of those on the party\u2019s centre-left, remain supporters, the last of the Theresa May loyalists and some personal friends. One MP, a member of the One Nation group of Tory centrists, which was founded by Amber Rudd, said they could never back Stewart because he was so divisive. \u201cHe effectively told one half of the party that they are stupid,\u201d the MP said. \u201cThat is not how you unite the party. He seems to care far more about winning likes on Twitter than persuading colleagues that he can heal the party\u2019s wounds and beat [Labour\u2019s Jeremy] Corbyn.\u201d Stewart\u2019s backers believe he will have transformed the contest, win or lose. \u201cHe shows the potential for the Conservative party to broaden its base and he has injected some realism into the debate around Brexit. That has changed the terms,\u201d one campaign source said.",

Nonetheless, it is worth recalling that Stewart\u2019s central proposition is to revive May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, which went down to the greatest defeat in parliamentary history. For all the damage Stewart has done to a future Johnson premiership, he still advocates for a Brexit far from the fantasies of 2016 and whose principal purpose is the survival of the Conservative party, rather than the interests of the country. And for that, he still deserves opprobrium rather than praise. \u2022 Tom Kibasi is director of the Institute for Public Policy Research and chair of the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice",

Its majority owner, Novalpina Capital, a UK private equity firm, has promised a \u201csignificant enhancement of respect for human rights\u201d at NSO Group, whose Pegasus software was recently alleged to have infected phones through a glitch in the WhatsApp messaging software. The announcement was made shortly after the Guardian revealed NSO Group\u2019s ownership structure. Documents show Yana Peel, a human rights advocate, has a one-third stake in Novalpina Capital, which was founded by her husband Stephen Peel. In a lengthy statement about the changes at NSO group, he said: \u201cNovalpina is committed to do whatever necessary to ensure NSO\u2019s technology is used only for its intended lawful purpose\u201d.

It followed multiple allegations that NSO has licensed its powerful surveillance technology, Pegasus, to authoritarian regimes and other governments that have allegedly used it to target journalists, dissidents and political activists. The alleged targets include Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident based in Canada, who claimed in a lawsuit filed in Israel that Saudi spies used NSO software to hack his phone and access his conversations with Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post journalist who was murdered by Saudi government operatives last year. The initial response to NSO\u2019s announcement from activists and researchers who closely monitor the company was sceptical. \u201cYou don\u2019t do human rights by press release, and you don\u2019t commit to openness by listing all the ways you reserve the right to not be open,\u201d said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the independent research group Citizen Lab, at the University of Toronto.

The Tories were barged aside by the Brexit party, which didn\u2019t exist a few months previously. Its boast to plucky newcomer status is a bit overblown, since it neglects Nigel Farage\u2019s hardy perennial appearance in pretty much every campaign since the turn of the century. But that suggests his party won\u2019t evaporate when the sun rises on Britain\u2019s first day outside the EU.</p> <p>Farage\u2019s mission is to hunt down betrayal of the true Brexit vision, and he will sniff it out in any compromise any government makes to manage an orderly withdrawal. A significant portion of Tory members and an implacable cadre of MPs share that bottomless appetite for anti-Brussels grievance, infused with paranoid millenarian nationalism. These are people who doubt even Michael Gove\u2019s commitment to the leave cause. They are waiting for a Brexit rapture that no prime minister can deliver.</p> <p>Such fanaticism drives moderate Tories to the Liberal Democrats who, along with the Greens, are capitalising on Labour\u2019s Brexit incoherence. Plaid Cymru are doing the same in Wales. There is no sign of revival for Scottish Labour, bulldozed by the Scottish National party. Boris Johnson would sabotage what progress Ruth Davidson has made for the Tories in Scotland. Running Britain is a game of Commons arithmetic, and when numbers stack up as they do now, in multiple columns, it is trickier for the two main English parties to reach commanding heights.</p> <p>It is an irony of Brexit that the ambition to detach Britain from Europe has made UK politics look more continental: a spectrum of parties, none of which can govern alone. But even a slender majority would produce unstable government because the parties themselves are dysfunctional families, always on the verge of irreparable estrangement. There are Tory MPs who find the prospect of being led by Johnson repugnant and Labour MPs who think Jeremy Corbyn is unfit to be prime minister. Those dissenters might also be ambitious cowards who would stick around for the ride if their reviled leader wound up in power, but they would not be easy passengers.In such conditions, an essential quality of leadership is the capacity to build coalitions, between parties and within them. It is a clear lesson of May\u2019s time in office that many Tory MPs ignore. They think her deficiency was in the performance side of politics and, having misdiagnosed the ailment, are ready to prescribe the wrong medicine. May\u2019s most profound failing was in diplomacy and empathy. She could not cultivate relationships or nurture alliances and mostly refused to try. That narrowed her negotiating bandwidth in Brussels, and made it impossible to sell the deal she got back home. She could not even square it with the Democratic Unionist party, on whose support she spent buckets of public money.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Majorities have been declared impossible on the eve of polls that produced them. But that already feels like a long time ago</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Johnson is certainly clubbable, but even his club mates think he is an untrustworthy narcissist. Rory Stewart is the candidate offering some remedy to May\u2019s shrivelled parochialism, simply by recognising that Brexit means accommodating interests beyond the tribal boundary of Conservative activism. In today\u2019s cultural taxonomy, Stewart is Tory to his fingertips \u2013 fiscally disciplined, Eurosceptic, Etonian to boot. But he has confessed to Labour party membership in his youth (and tendencies that way in adulthood). His ecumenical style has engaged the imagination of at least 37 of his colleagues \u2013 the number that kept him in the contest in a second round of voting tonight \u2013 and some non-Tory audiences. It will still struggle to overcome the sectarian mood in the wider party.</p> <p>The Tories are not ready for bridge-building, so they imbue Johnson with powers to arrange an electoral coalition by pure charisma. His magnetism must somehow lure both irate nationalists and despairing liberals. There was a time when Corbyn was similarly vaunted by his supporters as a man with a unique, gravity-defying capacity for political evangelism. That claim is heard less often now. The Labour leader talks about healing the nation\u2019s European schism, yet his technique for doing it is obscure. He is polite to dissenters but closed to the opinions of anyone whose left trajectory has ever deviated from his own.</p> <p>The Corbynite strategy looks more like a waiting game, being prepared to take a polling hit from disappointed remainers if the damage done to the other side by Brexit infighting is more savage. Underlying that calculation is a view that voters on the liberal-left, who protest in mid-term ballots, come \u201chome\u201d to Labour in general elections in order to thwart the hated Tories. Conservatives are thinking along similar lines. When their traditional supporters contemplate Corbyn in Downing Street they are supposed to quit dallying with Farage and come \u201chome\u201d. What the leaders say or do to make that happen is unclear. Their magical personalities dissolve all contradictions.</p> <p>It would certainly be normal to expect a recovery in Labour and Tory positions in a general election. The two-party system has been written off before. Majorities have been declared impossible on the eve of polls that produced them \u2013 most recently when David Cameron beat Ed Miliband in 2015. But that already feels like a long time ago. The idea of anyone going \u201chome\u201d to Labour or the Tories underestimates the extent to which remain and leave are now many voters\u2019 cultural domiciles. Those identities cannot conveniently be carved up by the established red-blue duopoly, and that makes forming and sustaining a government a lot harder. The Tories are fixated on the idea that their new leader must be a winner, but in this shifting political landscape they have no idea what winning looks like any more.</p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Its boast to plucky newcomer status is a bit overblown, since it neglects Nigel Farage\u2019s hardy perennial appearance in pretty much every campaign since the turn of the century. But that suggests his party won\u2019t evaporate when the sun rises on Britain\u2019s first day outside the EU. Farage\u2019s mission is to hunt down betrayal of the true Brexit vision, and he will sniff it out in any compromise any government makes to manage an orderly withdrawal. A significant portion of Tory members and an implacable cadre of MPs share that bottomless appetite for anti-Brussels grievance, infused with paranoid millenarian nationalism. These are people who doubt even Michael Gove\u2019s commitment to the leave cause. They are waiting for a Brexit rapture that no prime minister can deliver. Such fanaticism drives moderate Tories to the Liberal Democrats who, along with the Greens, are capitalising on Labour\u2019s Brexit incoherence. Plaid Cymru are doing the same in Wales. There is no sign of revival for Scottish Labour, bulldozed by the Scottish National party. Boris Johnson would sabotage what progress Ruth Davidson has made for the Tories in Scotland. Running Britain is a game of Commons arithmetic, and when numbers stack up as they do now, in multiple columns, it is trickier for the two main English parties to reach commanding heights. It is an irony of Brexit that the ambition to detach Britain from Europe has made UK politics look more continental: a spectrum of parties, none of which can govern alone. But even a slender majority would produce unstable government because the parties themselves are dysfunctional families, always on the verge of irreparable estrangement. There are Tory MPs who find the prospect of being led by Johnson repugnant and Labour MPs who think Jeremy Corbyn is unfit to be prime minister. Those dissenters might also be ambitious cowards who would stick around for the ride if their reviled leader wound up in power, but they would not be easy passengers.In such conditions, an essential quality of leadership is the capacity to build coalitions, between parties and within them. It is a clear lesson of May\u2019s time in office that many Tory MPs ignore. They think her deficiency was in the performance side of politics and, having misdiagnosed the ailment, are ready to prescribe the wrong medicine. May\u2019s most profound failing was in diplomacy and empathy. She could not cultivate relationships or nurture alliances and mostly refused to try. That narrowed her negotiating bandwidth in Brussels, and made it impossible to sell the deal she got back home. She could not even square it with the Democratic Unionist party, on whose support she spent buckets of public money. Johnson is certainly clubbable, but even his club mates think he is an untrustworthy narcissist. Rory Stewart is the candidate offering some remedy to May\u2019s shrivelled parochialism, simply by recognising that Brexit means accommodating interests beyond the tribal boundary of Conservative activism. In today\u2019s cultural taxonomy, Stewart is Tory to his fingertips \u2013 fiscally disciplined, Eurosceptic, Etonian to boot. But he has confessed to Labour party membership in his youth (and tendencies that way in adulthood). His ecumenical style has engaged the imagination of at least 37 of his colleagues \u2013 the number that kept him in the contest in a second round of voting tonight \u2013 and some non-Tory audiences. It will still struggle to overcome the sectarian mood in the wider party. The Tories are not ready for bridge-building, so they imbue Johnson with powers to arrange an electoral coalition by pure charisma. His magnetism must somehow lure both irate nationalists and despairing liberals. There was a time when Corbyn was similarly vaunted by his supporters as a man with a unique, gravity-defying capacity for political evangelism. That claim is heard less often now. The Labour leader talks about healing the nation\u2019s European schism, yet his technique for doing it is obscure. He is polite to dissenters but closed to the opinions of anyone whose left trajectory has ever deviated from his own. The Corbynite strategy looks more like a waiting game, being prepared to take a polling hit from disappointed remainers if the damage done to the other side by Brexit infighting is more savage. Underlying that calculation is a view that voters on the liberal-left, who protest in mid-term ballots, come \u201chome\u201d to Labour in general elections in order to thwart the hated Tories. Conservatives are thinking along similar lines. When their traditional supporters contemplate Corbyn in Downing Street they are supposed to quit dallying with Farage and come \u201chome\u201d. What the leaders say or do to make that happen is unclear. Their magical personalities dissolve all contradictions. It would certainly be normal to expect a recovery in Labour and Tory positions in a general election. The two-party system has been written off before. Majorities have been declared impossible on the eve of polls that produced them \u2013 most recently when David Cameron beat Ed Miliband in 2015. But that already feels like a long time ago. The idea of anyone going \u201chome\u201d to Labour or the Tories underestimates the extent to which remain and leave are now many voters\u2019 cultural domiciles. Those identities cannot conveniently be carved up by the established red-blue duopoly, and that makes forming and sustaining a government a lot harder. The Tories are fixated on the idea that their new leader must be a winner, but in this shifting political landscape they have no idea what winning looks like any more. \u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The head of London\u2019s newly formed violence reduction unit has said Londoners feel powerless about levels of street crime but insisted that increased use of stop and search powers had been successful. Lib Peck, the former leader of Lambeth council who was appointed to the role in January, made the comments while on a two-day fact-finding trip to Glasgow, visiting some of the Scottish unit\u2019s key projects and meeting senior officials. Set up in 2005, Glasgow\u2019s VRU famously treated violence as a public health issue and reduced stabbing deaths while unravelling the deeply rooted gang culture in a city which at the time had the second highest murder rate in western Europe. Responding to the recent wave of violence that left four people dead in the capital, Peck said: \u201cIt does mean people feel a bit hopeless about the situation that we\u2019re in and feel incredibly sad and powerless. But what we also know is that we\u2019ve got to do things differently. To that extent the London VRU is copying some of the work that the Glasgow VRU is doing and looking at things in a much longer term perspective.\u201d Peck said new stop and search powers have been successful after a five-fold increase in their use over the past year. At the beginning of June, the Metropolitan police deputy commissioner, Sir Steve House, told the London assembly police and crime committee that the number of stop and searches under section 60 powers, which allow the police to search people in a designated area without suspicion, had increased from 1,836 in 2017-18 to 9,599 in 2018-19. House faced criticism in his previous role at head of Police Scotland in 2015, when figures emerged showing excessive use of informal powers to search people, including tens of thousands of children, without any evidence they had committed a crime. Independent monitoring has found that stop and search powers disproportionately target black people. Peck said: \u201cThere\u2019s a combination of enforcement as well as long term prevention work that has to go hand in hand. Stop and search has been successful in terms of the numbers of weapons it has revealed, and it is worth noting that violence has started to come down in London not that there\u2019s any complacency around that.\u201d She added: \u201cI do think there is something around making sure you\u2019ve got the trust of communities who are absolutely critical to successful violence prevention work. And you\u2019ve got to be very aware of the impact of stop and search on those communities\u201d. The co-founders of Scotland\u2019s VRU have previously described the benefits of their arms-length relationship with politicians, and of being able to start their work away from the media glare. Accepting that the intensity of public, political and media scrutiny around knife crime in London makes her role very different, Peck said: \u201cIt makes it more difficult but I do think it\u2019s all about building confidence in what we\u2019re trying to do. There are huge number of organisations across London doing schemes which are making a positive difference. There is a huge appetite from the public not to see violence become the norm, as there is across the whole of England, it\u2019s not just a London phenomenon.\u201d Peck\u2019s visit took place as the home secretary, Sajid Javid, announced he was giving \u00a335m from the \u00a3100m serious violence fund announced by the government in March to police and crime commissioners in 18 local areas to set up their own local violence reduction units. Niven Rennie, director of Scotland\u2019s VRU acknowledged that stop and search was \u201can emotive issue\u201d in London and emphasised the need for local engagement to avoid the situation where \u201cpeople think they are being searched for the sake of it because they happen to be black\u201d. He added that a key element of the VRU\u2019s early work in Glasgow was \u201cyou can\u2019t have enforcement without search\u201d. \u201cWhat I say to Lib and her colleagues is that you have to stop people dying before you can start making improvements, and then prevention comes after that.\u201d While Scotland\u2019s VRU has no official affiliation with the London unit, its team regularly hosts visits from other parts of the UK and beyond. Rennie said: \u201cWhen I go down south I get all the time \u2018it\u2019s different down here, it\u2019s drugs and race, but if you raise it up to strategic level it\u2019s poverty and exclusion. All the social factors that you associate with city present in violence. If we get tied up with the differences, we won\u2019t make much progress.\u201d",

The Irish genius has won this three times in four years but his only runner this time, Buildmeupbuttercup, would be a 20-1 shot if trained by anyone else. Instead, she\u2019s favourite with some firms. Mancini makes some appeal, having been a game second after chasing a hot pace at York last time. But preference is for <strong>The Grand Visir</strong>, whose form with two previous yards gives him every chance here. He showed promise over a shorter trip on his recent reappearance and should be the better for that. </p> <p>Mengli Khan is not far short of top class over jumps but his finishing effort isn\u2019t always the heartiest and it\u2019s a fair question whether he\u2019ll want to go this far in a Flat race. I seem to remember tipping Coeur De Lion for this race last year, when he was a one-paced sixth; listen for the sound of teeth-grinding if he pulls it off this time. His Chester Vase win last time was a career best but heavy ground may have helped and he doesn\u2019t get that this time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c4590c46be59b7e1bde38ad9445cecfe904ecdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c4590c46be59b7e1bde38ad9445cecfe904ecdd/0_56_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Is he wearing no socks?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is he wearing no socks?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Rooke/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0902988f08374cc57907b7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T15:29:19.465Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">St James's Palace Stakes (4.20pm) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>1 <strong>Circus Maximus</strong> (R L Moore) 10-1 <br>2 <strong>King Of Comedy</strong> (A Kirby) 4-1 <br>3 <strong>Too Darn Hot</strong> (L Dettori) 2-1 Fav <br>11 ran </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a688295f1bfb9c0b6f49353f000c2bc735c187d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a688295f1bfb9c0b6f49353f000c2bc735c187d/0_0_4428_2724/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Circus Maximus and Ryan Moore winning the St James Palace Stakes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"615\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Circus Maximus and Ryan Moore winning the St James Palace Stakes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T15:41:45.440Z\">at 4.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d0901678f08532f138d4048\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T15:23:22.450Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">St James's Palace Stakes (4.20pm)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And they\u2019re off ...

O\u2019Brien said: \u201cHe was very green the first day and progressed a lot the next time and won very easily, but he probably didn\u2019t learn a lot because of that. This was the first day he had to learn. He was a little bit slowly away, a little bit lost through the race, but came home really well, so I\u2019m delighted. </p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d imagine he\u2019d get a mile. He\u2019s probably quicker than he lets on. He\u2019s still a baby and when he won at the Curragh we thought if he was eligible for the Chesham we\u2019d have had no problem running him in it. That type of horse can get quicker when they learn. He was babyish in the race and still came home well. He\u2019d have learnt plenty today.\u201d </p> <p>Richard Hannon said of runner-up Threat: \u201cHe is a good horse. We came here to learn that, and we have. There are no excuses. He is a Group One horse and we can\u2019t wait for the rest of the year. The six furlongs suited him. Maybe (we could go to Newmarket), he is the sort of horse that will come out of the race great. He is strong and mature and hopefully we will have a good year with him.\u201d </p> <p>Archie Watson was thrilled with third-placed Guildsman, saying: \u201cI\u2019m delighted. They have probably gone quick in front and they\u2019ve set the race up for Arizona and us. I thought the second horse\u2019s run on the other side of the track was full of merit. I couldn\u2019t be happier with my lad. There is a very defined path for horses like him as he is a ready-made two-year-old. Six furlongs is his trip and if we are happy with him we will be looking at races like the July Stakes and the Richmond.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed7b98bebdb71ca7a5cb6e6295cd5d9e343d7ebd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed7b98bebdb71ca7a5cb6e6295cd5d9e343d7ebd/0_204_4745_2847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arizona wins the Coventry Stakes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arizona wins the Coventry Stakes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Webb/racingfotos.com/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d08f9118f08532f138d3fd4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T14:51:16.740Z\">3.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">St James's Palace Stakes (4.20pm) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The big question for punters on day one at this Royal Ascot is this: how many excuses do you make for a horse who was brilliant last year but has yet to show it this season? Too Darn Hot is the animal in question and he probably still has bundles of talent, despite having been runner-up in both starts this year. </p> <p>But <strong>Phoenix Of Spain</strong> beat him fair and square in the Irish Guineas and I hope to see Charlie Hills\u2019s grey confirm the form of that three-length success here. Reportedly, he had a troubled preparation for that outing and may well be better for the run. He got within two lengths of Too Darn Hot in September, looking very much like a horse who would do better with time, so there surely was no fluke about his Classic success. </p> <p>The progressive King Of Comedy could be a threat and his trainer, John Gosden, pinched this race with an animal of modest talent last year but this renewal looks stronger. Circus Maximus wasn\u2019t far behind Phoenix Of Spain in October but doesn\u2019t look a specialist miler and the fitting of blinkers suggests his trainer worries he may be short of the necessary speed. </p> <p>Fox Champion, winner of the German Guineas, is progressive and in danger of being underestimated at 20-1, though he\u2019d have to outrun his pedigree to win this. The French raider Shaman has been beaten only by Persian King in his last four starts, so has to be taken seriously.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bf93ba49d8ed24b0206be17fd05c24e3872e01b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bf93ba49d8ed24b0206be17fd05c24e3872e01b/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"It\u2019s properly raining now.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It\u2019s properly raining now.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d08f8648f08532f138d3fce\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T14:45:17.068Z\">3.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">King's Stand Stakes (3.40pm) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>1 <strong>Blue Point</strong> (James Doyle) 5-2 <br>2 <strong>Battaash</strong> (Jim Crowley) 2-1 Fav <br>3 <strong>Soldier\u2019s Call </strong>(D Tudhope) 16-1 <br>12 ran </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d01b59a3cce150d31381d9a6ec35ca0254584149\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d01b59a3cce150d31381d9a6ec35ca0254584149/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blue Point and James Doyle winning the Kings Stand Stakes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blue Point and James Doyle winning the Kings Stand Stakes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T14:53:08.229Z\">at 3.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d08f79f8f08263b930f1ec5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T14:40:43.850Z\">3.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">King's Stand Stakes (3.40pm)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And they\u2019re off ...

David O\u2019Meara\u2019s grey, who disappointed badly last time out in the Lockinge Stakes, was winning at the highest level for the first time in his career.</p> <p>His fortunes could not have contrasted more with last year\u2019s winner Accidental Agent, who refused to come out of the stalls. The popular Laurens made a bold bid for home and hit the front two furlongs out, but she could never put much daylight between her pursuers. William Haggas\u2019 One Master came swooping through, showing the pace that won her the Prix de la Foret last season, and certainly hit the front, before her run she faltered inside the final 100 yards. </p> <p>That left Beat The Bank, another who ran poorly in the Lockinge, and Lord Glitters (14-1) to fight it out, with Danny Tudhope managing to get his grey head in front by a neck. O\u2019Meara said: \u201cHe always runs well here, he loves the track. \u201cIn the Lockinge he had no cover and over-raced a touch, but I thought today Danny gave him a perfect ride from the word go. Watching the race it was one of the easiest Royal Ascot runners we\u2019ve ever had to watch because there was never a moment I thought he was in trouble. He had a programme last year and he\u2019ll follow something similar this season, I would have thought.\u201d <strong>PA</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2f818f7b751a23cf9e540fe4d81920b731616d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2f818f7b751a23cf9e540fe4d81920b731616d8/85_471_5266_3160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Glitters wins the Queen Anne Stakes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord Glitters wins the Queen Anne Stakes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Watts/racingfotos.com/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T14:37:38.168Z\">at 3.37pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d08f5d68f08263b930f1eba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T14:34:15.510Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The train strike is not having much of an impact according to <a href=\"https://www.racingpost.com/news/royal-ascot/royal-ascot-racegoers-delighted-as-train-strike-causes-little-disruption/385961?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=RP%20-%20News&amp;utm_content=Train%20strike&amp;utm_term=Null\">this report in the Racing Post</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e44159476bbd196dad7ca913ab4d5acbab860e9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e44159476bbd196dad7ca913ab4d5acbab860e9b/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The train is taking the strain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The train is taking the strain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d08f3c48f08532f138d3f9a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T14:27:26.665Z\">3.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">King's Stand (3.40pm) betting</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <ul> <li>Battaash \u2013 9/4</li> <li>Blue Point \u2013 5/2</li> <li>Mabs Cross \u2013 7/1</li> <li>Imprimis \u2013 9/1</li> <li>Sergei Prokofiev \u2013 14/1</li> <li>Soldier\u2019s Call \u2013 20/1</li> <li>Houtzen \u2013 25/1</li> <li>Equilateral \u2013 25/1</li> <li>Fairyland \u2013 28/1</li> <li>Signora Cabello \u2013 80/1</li> <li>Judicial \u2013 100/1</li> <li>Enzo\u2019s Lad \u2013 100/1</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.oddschecker.com/horse-racing/ascot/15:40/winner\">Full betting at Oddschecker here</a><br><br>The best tip for punters who have access is to check the betting on Oddschecker.

It\u2019s interesting that the market appears dazzled by the brilliance Battaash showed at Haydock last month and he appears the more talented of the pair, at his very best. But a strike-rate of two from five last year shows he often underperforms and he did not seem to enjoy the big-day atmosphere here last year. <strong>Blue Point </strong>is taken to come out on top once more. Encouragingly, the Charlie Appleby yard had a double in Group races on Sunday, having gone a couple of months without success at that level.</p> <p>Sergei Prokofiev, third to Calyx in the Coventry on this day last year, has fallen well short at Group One level so far and was a disappointing favourite behind Mabs Cross in the Palace House last month. Mabs Cross was in turn well held by Battaash at Haydock but she was a close third in this race a year ago and had her big day in the Prix de l\u2019Abbaye when Battaash flopped in fourth.

There should be plenty more to come from this chestnut, whose grand-dam is Shiva, a Group One winner for Sir Henry Cecil. </p> <p>Arizona won well on his second start but it\u2019s open to question what he achieved, having started at odds of 8-15 that day. The runner-up, a stablemate of his called King Of Athens, was pretty green on his first start that day but is really well bred and could take quite a step forward here, so there are worse each-way options at 40-1.

That thought is something of a brake on enthusiasm for his most recent Lockinge winner, <strong>Mustashry</strong>, but it is hard to forget the powerful finish that one produced at Newbury last month and this steady improver is fairly priced at around 5-1; he\u2019s Stoute\u2019s only runner on Day One. </p> <p>Barney Roy is an unknown quantity, having had two runs at a much lower level since his comeback from a year off. He will be remembered as the St James\u2019s Palace winner of 2017, earning himself a chance at stud and doubtless he would rather still be there. Alas for fertility issues. Even his best form leaves him a smidgen to find. Le Brivido is finally drifting to a reasonable price, having been a slightly perverse choice of favourite for this race until Monday. He finished strongly in the Lockinge but still has more to prove and hasn\u2019t won for two years, though he was impressive in this week two years ago when powering home in the Jersey. </p> <p>The very likeable Laurens has won five Group Ones confined to fillies and mares and was a fine second to Mustashry in the Lockinge. He had the advantage of a previous run that day and she\u2019ll be a big danger if sharper this time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffa283c15e6e78056dc6d3a435cde2cde30b60f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffa283c15e6e78056dc6d3a435cde2cde30b60f0/0_57_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Who is that Chris Cook tipping?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Who is that Chris Cook tipping?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d08dfe58f08374cc57905af\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T13:00:11.928Z\">2.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Queen's Hat Stakes (2pm) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>1st Blue evens fav</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a783ca0e168e264305e7c2a00b4a47ed38fde1eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a783ca0e168e264305e7c2a00b4a47ed38fde1eb/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One was on.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One was on.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T13:03:26.429Z\">at 2.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d08df358f08532f138d3e5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T12:55:33.262Z\">1.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f174863b880a25e2d726752da8a0ccb0aebfa3f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f174863b880a25e2d726752da8a0ccb0aebfa3f0/0_67_4040_2423/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Model Georgia Fowler is at the races.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Model Georgia Fowler is at the races.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images for Ascot Racecourse</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T13:06:57.010Z\">at 2.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d08de428f08374cc5790594\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T12:52:21.562Z\">1.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Times racing corr knows who the must-read writers are ;)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paddyvb/status/1140963370394411009\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Good of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Greg_Wood_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Greg_Wood_</a> to write today\u2019s press round-up at Royal Ascot <a href=\"https://t.co/ZUHkO8cqkZ\">pic.twitter.com/ZUHkO8cqkZ</a></p>&mdash; Paddy von Behr (@paddyvb) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paddyvb/status/1140963370394411009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 18, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d08dce88f08374cc5790581\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T12:46:38.858Z\">1.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Important news for the Queen Mary Stakes tomorrow.

I attended a Serpentine gallery exhibition by artist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Wallinger\">Mark Wallinger</a> back in 1994 when one of his installations, called \u2018<a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/wallinger-royal-ascot-t12810\">Royal Ascot</a>\u2019, consisted of a series of video monitors on top of wheeled flight cases, each isolating the royal carriage\u2019s leisurely progress down the track on the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (respectively, as it was then) of the meeting with the added TV commentary.</p> <p><a href=\"http://collection.britishcouncil.org/collection/theme/6/74/object/44787/0\">The British Council described the work thus:</a> \u2018Simultaneous footage exposes precise choreography: the Queen\u2019s frozen smile and rigid curls, the tilt of her head, her gloved wave, the Duke of Edinburgh raising his top hat, the national anthem striking up. Appropriately for an event whose media coverage focuses on the parade of hats and dresses rather than the sport, here we have a close-up on clothes, on the Queen\u2019s dolly mixture of pinks, tangerines, limes; the difference from day to day is barely discernible, just as the four BBC commentaries merge in a confused blather. This repetition of imagery, all backed by bright green turf, brings into play Andy Warhol\u2019s late screenprints of Elizabeth II from his <a href=\"https://www.masterworksfineart.com/educational-resources/andy-warhol/warhol-reigning-queens-series-1985/\">\u2018Reigning Queens\u2019 series</a> (1985), a quartet of the postage stamp icon in camp conjugations of Hollywood make-up and bubblegum colours.\u2019</p> <p>The Duke of Edinburgh, who has retired from royal duties and apparently hated his trips down the road from Windsor Castle to the races, is missing but little else has changed including the blather.

Unlike Frankel, however, he has not progressed at all so far this year. John Gosden, his trainer, has blamed himself for choosing the wrong path through the early months of the campaign after Too Darn Hot suffered an injury which kept him out of the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, and also feels that his colt is as well as he has had him all year ahead of this race. But even so, the money that has forced him down to 9-4 clear favourite at the top prices in the market, with Phoenix Of Spain out to 5-2, seems to bear little relation to this season\u2019s form.<br><br><strong>Mustashry</strong> briefly displaced <strong>Le Brivido</strong> as favourite for the opening Queen Anne Stakes this morning but they are now joint-favourites at 11-2, while last year\u2019s 33-1 winner, Accidental Agent, is on the drift and out to 14-1 from 12-1 overnight. There is currently a clear favourite in the Coventry Stakes too, with money arriving for Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s <strong>Arizona</strong> (11-4 from 3-1 overnight) and Threat, who was also 3-1 overnight, now out to 100-30 and even 7-2 in a place. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7be6cde7168e371b90ccf802077bd7413b6a82d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7be6cde7168e371b90ccf802077bd7413b6a82d/0_24_4680_2809/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colour co-ordinated couple during day one of Royal Ascot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colour co-ordinated couple during day one of Royal Ascot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d08c40d8f08263b930f1ba1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T11:00:24.721Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bookmakers at the track are fighting shy of the blue wave too as everyone wants to be on that colour for the Queen\u2019s Hat Stakes at 2pm ...<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GBRacing/status/1140935855269437440\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bookmakers clearly fancy The Queen to be wearing a blue hat today\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc51 <a href=\"https://t.co/QJE0wag0Ec\">pic.twitter.com/QJE0wag0Ec</a></p>&mdash; Great British Racing (@GBRacing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GBRacing/status/1140935855269437440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 18, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d08be2f8f08374cc57903d4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-18T10:51:13.966Z\">11.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The Queen's Hat Stakes (2.00)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bit early with this today as there is already news of a \u2018plunge\u2019. Apparently blue is the colour and there is word of the bookies suspending betting after that colour was backed to be the Queen\u2019s choice this afternoon. I spoke to royal reporter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theroyaleditor\">Robert Jobson</a> who told me: \u201cOnly Angela Kelly, her designer, the Royals and their guests know the colour of her hat.\u201d </p> <p>A <a href=\"https://bookmakers.tv/\">Bookmakers.TV</a> spokesperson said: \u201cThe market on the colour of Her Majesty\u2019s titfer is a unique one in that without the guide of the exchanges odds compilers have to roll back the years and bet to their opinion which gives rise to differing favourites in a quickly moving market. </p> <p>\u201cFor long running fans of the royal meeting the speculation is an essential part of the day but newer audiences, less likely to be consuming the spectacle as a whole off course, are seemingly less interested. Still, the popularity of the market - which serves primarily as a PR excercise - in sections of the media is showing no sign of waning which is music to the ears of Royal Ascot purists.</p> <p>\u201cAs for day one, the vibes are Her Majesty will opt for a blue number and if that materialises the market vibes will have been spot on. The other two colours we are likely to see this week are green and white, which Her Majesty has worn 11 times since 2005.\u201d <br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bettingexpert.com/racing/royal-ascot\">bettingexpert</a> have given us a form guide (below) for all the hat colours worn by the Queen since 2005.

Well, it might be a little different on the way home this evening but thus far, it\u2019s a winner, on the 09.28 from Clapham Junction at any rate. Betting-wise, I should probably quite now while I\u2019m ahead. But it won\u2019t be easy with the best five days of the Flat season now just a few hours\u2019 distant.</p> <p>The Tuesday card at Ascot is the one that is often referred to as the purist\u2019s afternoon at the Royal meeting, which is another way of saying that it is top-loaded with three of the meeting\u2019s eight Group One races and also tends to attract the smallest crowd of the five days.</p> <p>The scheduling remains a bit of a puzzle, as it means that almost half of the week\u2019s biggest events have been run by 4.15pm on the first afternoon, and in terms of boosting the live audience for the showpiece races, it might make sense to shift one of the Group Ones towards the end of the week. Change is glacial at Royal Ascot, though, and the counter-argument is that Thursday to Saturday will sell out in any case. The status quo keeps the purists happy too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/17/why-bookie-bashing-royal-ascot-may-add-to-horse-racing-money-misery\">Why a bookie-bashing Royal Ascot may add to racing\u2019s money misery</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My colleague Chris Cook\u2019s tips for the opening day are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jun/17/talking-horses-phoenix-of-spain-reign-first-day-royal-ascot-horse-racing-tips\">here</a>, while punters might like to know that pool betting with the Tote promises to offer a little more value this year as an alternative to the bookmakers.</p> <p>This year\u2019s meeting marks the debut of World Pool, a co-mingling exercise between the Tote\u2019s UK operation and the hugely popular pari-mutuel system in Hong Kong. Tote bets placed in either jurisdiction will go into the same pot, which should ensure much stronger pools and therefore more certainty for punters that they will be getting fair odds for their money when the dividend is declared. Nothing, after all, puts a punter off the Tote more thoroughly than a 33-1 winner that pays \u00a316.60 on the machine.</p> <p>There are a few minor caveats. The Hong Kong tote cannot support races with more than 25 runners, so the Royal Hunt Cup and Saturday\u2019s Wokingham, probably the two biggest betting races of the week, will have only a local pool. It might also not be the best way to back one of this week\u2019s runners from Asia - Lim\u2019s Cruiser goes in the Diamond Jubilee on Saturday and Deirdre, from Japan, runs in tomorrow\u2019s Prince Of Wales\u2019s Stakes. But for a sport looking for ways t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/17/why-bookie-bashing-royal-ascot-may-add-to-horse-racing-money-misery?CMP=share_btn_tw\">o boost its income from betting</a>, World Pool does offer a small sliver of hope.</p> <p>The Queen will be arriving at around 2pm BST and the first race, as ever, is due off at 2.30pm. As yet, there is little sign of the thunderstorms that were threatened in the overnight forecast \u2013 though of course, it\u2019s in their nature to pop up from nowhere \u2013 and ground is officially good and good-to-soft in places on the round course.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for the first day. Last year Tuesday was dominated by Frankie Dettori, this year it\u2019s Aidan O\u2019Brien who ended with a double in the St James\u2019s Palace and Coventry Stakes. Tomorrow the Prince Of Wales\u2019s promises to be a thriller. Let\u2019s hope for less rain and Sea Of Class getting the go ahead to run. William Haggas is not sure if Sea Of Class will line up for tomorrow\u2019s Prince Of Wales\u2019s Stakes which would be a big blow as that would mean being denied the mouthwatering clash with Magical. The trainer has told Oli Bell on ITV Racing that he will walk the track tomorrow before racing to decide if the filly takes her chance. Ian Williams enjoyed his first success at Royal Ascot when The Grand Visir defied top-weight in the Ascot Stakes and for good measure addled the third, Time To Study. \u201cThe Grand Visir\u2019s hurdling career is still open to interpretation. We ran him back on the turf earlier in the month and he ran very well,\u201d said Williams. \u201cHe was dropped 1lb which allowed him into this race, which was fortunate. We weren\u2019t sure he\u2019d stay the trip, but Richard (Kingscote) gave him a lovely, patient ride into the race. \u201cTurning for home there were only two horses travelling well and that was Time To Study and him. Time To Study probably didn\u2019t stay and he has, all the way to the line. It\u2019s a huge result and great to have a Royal Ascot winner.\u201d PA 1 Addeybb (D Tudhope) 5-1 2 Magic Wand (R L Moore) 9-2 Fav 3 Elarqam (Jim Crowley) 5-1 16 ran And they\u2019re off ...

The progress he\u2019s made in just four starts suggests he has every chance of upholding family honour and he represents the John Gosden/Frankie Dettori team that won this race when it first shed its handicap tag a year ago. Elarqam seemed to appreciate the step up to this distance last time and perhaps this stiffer course will help him some more. Magic Wand hasn\u2019t been able to win since her Ribblesdale success here last June and would have liked a faster surface. Latrobe has been campaigned unconventionally for an Irish Derby winner and surely wants further than this to be seen at his best. 1 The Grand Visir (R Kingscote) 12-1 2 Buildmeupbuttercup (R L Moore) 7-1 3 Time To Study (Jim Crowley) 16-1 4 Fun Mac (P J McDonald) 11-1 19 ran Also: 13-2 Fav Mancini Non Runner: 20 And they\u2019re off ...

Here\u2019s Chris Cook\u2019s report on the victory of Circus Maximus in the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes: Buildmeupbuttercup \u2013 7/1 Coeur de Lion \u2013 7/1 Mangli Khan \u2013 15/2 Batts Rock \u2013 12/1 Snow Falcon \u2013 14/1 Mancini \u2013 14/1 Gunnery \u2013 14/1 Fun Mac \u2013 14/1 Kerosin \u2013 16/1 Time to Study \u2013 16/1 The Grand Visir \u2013 18/1 Ulster \u2013 25/1 Arctic Fire \u2013 28/1 Not Never \u2013 33/1 Mixboy \u2013 33/1 Yabass \u2013 50/1 Jukebox Jive \u2013 66/1 Cosmelli \u2013 66/1 Percy Street \u2013 150/1 Full betting here at Oddschecker Have we reached the stage where we\u2019ll back anything Willie Mullins sends over for this? The Irish genius has won this three times in four years but his only runner this time, Buildmeupbuttercup, would be a 20-1 shot if trained by anyone else. Instead, she\u2019s favourite with some firms. Mancini makes some appeal, having been a game second after chasing a hot pace at York last time. But preference is for The Grand Visir, whose form with two previous yards gives him every chance here. He showed promise over a shorter trip on his recent reappearance and should be the better for that. Mengli Khan is not far short of top class over jumps but his finishing effort isn\u2019t always the heartiest and it\u2019s a fair question whether he\u2019ll want to go this far in a Flat race. I seem to remember tipping Coeur De Lion for this race last year, when he was a one-paced sixth; listen for the sound of teeth-grinding if he pulls it off this time. His Chester Vase win last time was a career best but heavy ground may have helped and he doesn\u2019t get that this time. 1 Circus Maximus (R L Moore) 10-1 2 King Of Comedy (A Kirby) 4-1 3 Too Darn Hot (L Dettori) 2-1 Fav 11 ran And they\u2019re off ...

O\u2019Brien said: \u201cHe was very green the first day and progressed a lot the next time and won very easily, but he probably didn\u2019t learn a lot because of that. This was the first day he had to learn. He was a little bit slowly away, a little bit lost through the race, but came home really well, so I\u2019m delighted. \u201cYou\u2019d imagine he\u2019d get a mile. He\u2019s probably quicker than he lets on. He\u2019s still a baby and when he won at the Curragh we thought if he was eligible for the Chesham we\u2019d have had no problem running him in it. That type of horse can get quicker when they learn. He was babyish in the race and still came home well. He\u2019d have learnt plenty today.\u201d Richard Hannon said of runner-up Threat: \u201cHe is a good horse. We came here to learn that, and we have. There are no excuses. He is a Group One horse and we can\u2019t wait for the rest of the year. The six furlongs suited him. Maybe (we could go to Newmarket), he is the sort of horse that will come out of the race great. He is strong and mature and hopefully we will have a good year with him.\u201d Archie Watson was thrilled with third-placed Guildsman, saying: \u201cI\u2019m delighted. They have probably gone quick in front and they\u2019ve set the race up for Arizona and us. I thought the second horse\u2019s run on the other side of the track was full of merit. I couldn\u2019t be happier with my lad. There is a very defined path for horses like him as he is a ready-made two-year-old. Six furlongs is his trip and if we are happy with him we will be looking at races like the July Stakes and the Richmond.\u201d The big question for punters on day one at this Royal Ascot is this: how many excuses do you make for a horse who was brilliant last year but has yet to show it this season? Too Darn Hot is the animal in question and he probably still has bundles of talent, despite having been runner-up in both starts this year. But Phoenix Of Spain beat him fair and square in the Irish Guineas and I hope to see Charlie Hills\u2019s grey confirm the form of that three-length success here. Reportedly, he had a troubled preparation for that outing and may well be better for the run. He got within two lengths of Too Darn Hot in September, looking very much like a horse who would do better with time, so there surely was no fluke about his Classic success. The progressive King Of Comedy could be a threat and his trainer, John Gosden, pinched this race with an animal of modest talent last year but this renewal looks stronger. Circus Maximus wasn\u2019t far behind Phoenix Of Spain in October but doesn\u2019t look a specialist miler and the fitting of blinkers suggests his trainer worries he may be short of the necessary speed. Fox Champion, winner of the German Guineas, is progressive and in danger of being underestimated at 20-1, though he\u2019d have to outrun his pedigree to win this. The French raider Shaman has been beaten only by Persian King in his last four starts, so has to be taken seriously. 1 Blue Point (James Doyle) 5-2 2 Battaash (Jim Crowley) 2-1 Fav 3 Soldier\u2019s Call (D Tudhope) 16-1 12 ran And they\u2019re off ... Soldier\u2019s Call was fast away ... Battaash is held up ... Battaash and Blue Point fight it out with the same result as last year when Blue Point beats off his rival. Last year\u2019s runner-up Lord Glitters just prevailed in a blanket finish to the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot. David O\u2019Meara\u2019s grey, who disappointed badly last time out in the Lockinge Stakes, was winning at the highest level for the first time in his career. His fortunes could not have contrasted more with last year\u2019s winner Accidental Agent, who refused to come out of the stalls. The popular Laurens made a bold bid for home and hit the front two furlongs out, but she could never put much daylight between her pursuers. William Haggas\u2019 One Master came swooping through, showing the pace that won her the Prix de la Foret last season, and certainly hit the front, before her run she faltered inside the final 100 yards. That left Beat The Bank, another who ran poorly in the Lockinge, and Lord Glitters (14-1) to fight it out, with Danny Tudhope managing to get his grey head in front by a neck. O\u2019Meara said: \u201cHe always runs well here, he loves the track. \u201cIn the Lockinge he had no cover and over-raced a touch, but I thought today Danny gave him a perfect ride from the word go. Watching the race it was one of the easiest Royal Ascot runners we\u2019ve ever had to watch because there was never a moment I thought he was in trouble. He had a programme last year and he\u2019ll follow something similar this season, I would have thought.\u201d PA The train strike is not having much of an impact according to this report in the Racing Post.

Taking the odds from all the bookmakers on the site, the average percentage difference between the best and worst odds of every winning horse (taken at 11am each day) at Royal Ascot in 2018 was 28%. The first and second from last year\u2019s race, Blue Point and Battaash, seem the two to focus on once again. It\u2019s interesting that the market appears dazzled by the brilliance Battaash showed at Haydock last month and he appears the more talented of the pair, at his very best. But a strike-rate of two from five last year shows he often underperforms and he did not seem to enjoy the big-day atmosphere here last year. Blue Point is taken to come out on top once more. Encouragingly, the Charlie Appleby yard had a double in Group races on Sunday, having gone a couple of months without success at that level. Sergei Prokofiev, third to Calyx in the Coventry on this day last year, has fallen well short at Group One level so far and was a disappointing favourite behind Mabs Cross in the Palace House last month. Mabs Cross was in turn well held by Battaash at Haydock but she was a close third in this race a year ago and had her big day in the Prix de l\u2019Abbaye when Battaash flopped in fourth. Providing international flavour are runners from the US (Imprimis), Australia (Houtzen) and New Zealand (Enzo\u2019s Lad). All three seem short of top-class so far, though Imprimis is certainly heading in that direction. Eve Johnson-Houghton is putting on a brave face after Accidental Agent refused to race in the Queen Anne Stakes. 1 Arizona (R L Moore) 15-8 Fav 2 Threat (Tom Marquand) 4-1 3 Guildsman (Oisin Murphy) 6-1 17 ran And they\u2019re off ...

That being said, the time of that first race suggests the going description of \u2018good\u2019 ground is accurate. The Hannon yard has been out of luck in this since the back-to-back victories of Canford Cliffs and Strong Suit (2009, 2010) but they know a Royal Ascot juvenile when they get one. This race was immediately named as the target when Threat was an impressive winner on Guineas weekend, showing professionalism to beat an odds-on favourite and proving hard to pull up. There should be plenty more to come from this chestnut, whose grand-dam is Shiva, a Group One winner for Sir Henry Cecil. Arizona won well on his second start but it\u2019s open to question what he achieved, having started at odds of 8-15 that day. The runner-up, a stablemate of his called King Of Athens, was pretty green on his first start that day but is really well bred and could take quite a step forward here, so there are worse each-way options at 40-1. Guildsman, from a stable that excels with two-year-olds, won handily on his debut at Goodwood but may have relished the soft ground that day and meets a drier surface this time. 1 Lord Glitters (D Tudhope) 14-1 2 Beat The Bank (S De Sousa) 20-1 3 One Master (P C Boudot) 20-1 16 ran And they\u2019re off ...

Lord Glitters came late to snatch the victory. Any French visitors at Ascot today may be amused to note, as they scan through their Racing Posts, that a horse called Je M\u2019En Fous is to run at Brighton tonight. Her name translates roughly as \u2018I Don\u2019t Give A Stuff\u2019. I seem to remember being told at school, eons ago, that this was an extremely rude phrase that should not be used in polite company, but the BHA\u2019s naming team are satisfied that nothing inappropriate has occurred.

The Hong Kong Jockey Club is producing extensive form guides for every day of the meeting which can be viewed or downloaded for free here. It\u2019s somewhat surprising to see that Sir Michael Stoute has won this race just three times, the most recent of which was 17 years ago, especially as he has a record eight wins in the Lockinge, the most obvious trial for this. That thought is something of a brake on enthusiasm for his most recent Lockinge winner, Mustashry, but it is hard to forget the powerful finish that one produced at Newbury last month and this steady improver is fairly priced at around 5-1; he\u2019s Stoute\u2019s only runner on Day One. Barney Roy is an unknown quantity, having had two runs at a much lower level since his comeback from a year off. He will be remembered as the St James\u2019s Palace winner of 2017, earning himself a chance at stud and doubtless he would rather still be there. Alas for fertility issues. Even his best form leaves him a smidgen to find. Le Brivido is finally drifting to a reasonable price, having been a slightly perverse choice of favourite for this race until Monday. He finished strongly in the Lockinge but still has more to prove and hasn\u2019t won for two years, though he was impressive in this week two years ago when powering home in the Jersey. The very likeable Laurens has won five Group Ones confined to fillies and mares and was a fine second to Mustashry in the Lockinge. He had the advantage of a previous run that day and she\u2019ll be a big danger if sharper this time. 1st Blue evens fav The Times racing corr knows who the must-read writers are ;) Important news for the Queen Mary Stakes tomorrow.

More from the soaraway Sun here ... It\u2019s almost that time ... for the details of who will be in the royal procession down the centre of the track. I attended a Serpentine gallery exhibition by artist Mark Wallinger back in 1994 when one of his installations, called \u2018Royal Ascot\u2019, consisted of a series of video monitors on top of wheeled flight cases, each isolating the royal carriage\u2019s leisurely progress down the track on the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (respectively, as it was then) of the meeting with the added TV commentary. The British Council described the work thus: \u2018Simultaneous footage exposes precise choreography: the Queen\u2019s frozen smile and rigid curls, the tilt of her head, her gloved wave, the Duke of Edinburgh raising his top hat, the national anthem striking up. Appropriately for an event whose media coverage focuses on the parade of hats and dresses rather than the sport, here we have a close-up on clothes, on the Queen\u2019s dolly mixture of pinks, tangerines, limes; the difference from day to day is barely discernible, just as the four BBC commentaries merge in a confused blather. This repetition of imagery, all backed by bright green turf, brings into play Andy Warhol\u2019s late screenprints of Elizabeth II from his \u2018Reigning Queens\u2019 series (1985), a quartet of the postage stamp icon in camp conjugations of Hollywood make-up and bubblegum colours.\u2019 The Duke of Edinburgh, who has retired from royal duties and apparently hated his trips down the road from Windsor Castle to the races, is missing but little else has changed including the blather. This is last year\u2019s opening day procession, presented by Mike Vince. See if you can spot the difference this year ... It\u2019s raining ... and our snapper Tom Jenkins has captured the action ... The most obvious betting move this morning is that Too Darn Hot, beaten on both of his starts so far this year including in the Irish 2,000 Guineas last time, has replaced Phoenix Of Spain, who beat him by three lengths at The Curragh, as the favourite for the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes, Tuesday\u2019s feature event. Too Darn Hot was the top-rated juvenile last year, earning the same rating as the great Frankel at the end of his two-year-old campaign. Unlike Frankel, however, he has not progressed at all so far this year. John Gosden, his trainer, has blamed himself for choosing the wrong path through the early months of the campaign after Too Darn Hot suffered an injury which kept him out of the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, and also feels that his colt is as well as he has had him all year ahead of this race. But even so, the money that has forced him down to 9-4 clear favourite at the top prices in the market, with Phoenix Of Spain out to 5-2, seems to bear little relation to this season\u2019s form. Mustashry briefly displaced Le Brivido as favourite for the opening Queen Anne Stakes this morning but they are now joint-favourites at 11-2, while last year\u2019s 33-1 winner, Accidental Agent, is on the drift and out to 14-1 from 12-1 overnight. There is currently a clear favourite in the Coventry Stakes too, with money arriving for Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Arizona (11-4 from 3-1 overnight) and Threat, who was also 3-1 overnight, now out to 100-30 and even 7-2 in a place. Bookmakers at the track are fighting shy of the blue wave too as everyone wants to be on that colour for the Queen\u2019s Hat Stakes at 2pm ... Bit early with this today as there is already news of a \u2018plunge\u2019. Apparently blue is the colour and there is word of the bookies suspending betting after that colour was backed to be the Queen\u2019s choice this afternoon. I spoke to royal reporter Robert Jobson who told me: \u201cOnly Angela Kelly, her designer, the Royals and their guests know the colour of her hat.\u201d A Bookmakers.TV spokesperson said: \u201cThe market on the colour of Her Majesty\u2019s titfer is a unique one in that without the guide of the exchanges odds compilers have to roll back the years and bet to their opinion which gives rise to differing favourites in a quickly moving market. \u201cFor long running fans of the royal meeting the speculation is an essential part of the day but newer audiences, less likely to be consuming the spectacle as a whole off course, are seemingly less interested. Still, the popularity of the market - which serves primarily as a PR excercise - in sections of the media is showing no sign of waning which is music to the ears of Royal Ascot purists. \u201cAs for day one, the vibes are Her Majesty will opt for a blue number and if that materialises the market vibes will have been spot on. The other two colours we are likely to see this week are green and white, which Her Majesty has worn 11 times since 2005.\u201d bettingexpert have given us a form guide (below) for all the hat colours worn by the Queen since 2005. Pink and blue have made up 57% of her choices on the Tuesday in that time, while pink has also featured most on the Wednesday and Thursday of the five-day meeting. Green, which the Queen has worn 11 times since 2005, and white, also 11, are her next most-fancied hat colours and look likely to get a showing this week. Last night William Hill were betting: 3-1 Blue, Pink, 4-1 Green, 6-1 Yellow, 7-1 Purple, 8-1 White, 14-1 Orange, 25-1 Black, Brown and Red. If I get some updated betting I\u2019ll post it here. Sir Michael Stoute 79 Aidan O\u2019Brien 65 John Gosden 47 Mark Johnston 43 Saeed bin Suroor 36 Paul Cole 21 Mick Channon 18 Dermot Weld 17 David Elsworth 16 Roger Charlton 10 James Fanshawe 10 Wesley Ward 10 Aidan O\u2019Brien seeks to be top trainer here for the 10th time, having come out on top for the last four years, during which time he and Ryan Moore have come to dominate the thoughts of Ascot punters. Sir Michael Stoute\u2019s four winners last year finally secured him the all-time record among trainers, carrying him clear of the mark of 75 set by Sir Henry Cecil. He has been top trainer here six times, most recently in 2014, while John Gosden has done it just once, in 2012. Mustashry, fancied for the Queen Anne, is Stoute\u2019s only runner on Day One. Gosden is busier with four, including two of the top three in the betting for the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes. But all Flat trainers are jealous of Aidan O\u2019Brien, who gets to saddle 11 runners today, though only Arizona is likely to start favourite. Big claim this ... Frankie Dettori 60 Ryan Moore 53 Jamie Spencer 26 William Buick 23 Olivier Peslier 16 James Doyle 10 The last person other than Ryan Moore to be top jockey at Royal Ascot was ... ? Yes, Johnny Murtagh in 2013, you knew that. Moore has come out on top here for the last five years and eight times in all, a Piggott-esque period of dominance. He\u2019s 8-11 for a repeat. Dettori, a 3-1 shot this time, has been top jockey here five times but not since 2004. His four winners last year was a spirited effort for a man in his late 40s who likes to take it easy. Actually, that\u2019s unfair on the strength of today\u2019s card, since the Italian has got himself a ride in every race, as (more predictably) has Moore. Here\u2019s how the big two match up for rides today. Moore has the better strength in depth but Dettori has the best chance in Too Darn Hot. He\u2019d be especially sick to see Moore going past on Circus Maximus, as Dettori rode that one in the Derby a fortnight ago. 2.30 Dettori: Hazapour 9-1 Moore: Le Brivido 6-1 3.05 Dettori: Light Angel 20-1 Moore: Arizona 3-1 3.40 Dettori: Imprimis 12-1 Moore: Sergei Prokofiev 10-1 4.20 Dettori: Too Darn Hot 9-4 Moore: Circus Maximus 14-1 5.00 Dettori: Batts Rock 12-1 Moore: Buildmeupbuttercup 13-2 5.35 Dettori: Star Of Bengal 10-1 Moore: Magic Wand 5-1 If you fancy someone else to ride most winners this week, the best odds available are: 5-1 James Doyle, 20-1 Jim Crowley, 33-1 Silvestre De Sousa, 40-1 Oisin Murphy and Donnacha O\u2019Brien, 66-1 or bigger the rest.

The GoingStick readings are interesting: stands side 8.9, centre 8.9, far side 8.7 and the round course 7.4. That suggests the round course is a fair bit slower than the straight, but also that the straight is borderline good-to-firm. The only non-runner so far today, incidentally, is The Cashel Man in the Ascot Handicap at 5.00. He\u2019s lame. Hello and welcome to five days of frippery, fantastic racing and financial ruin or riches depending on how your wagers work out on the track.

My first big gamble of Royal Ascot week was taking the train to the course despite all the warnings of chaos thanks to a strike on South West Trains, co-incidentally called for the busiest week of the year on the Waterloo-Reading line. The result? Well, it might be a little different on the way home this evening but thus far, it\u2019s a winner, on the 09.28 from Clapham Junction at any rate. Betting-wise, I should probably quite now while I\u2019m ahead. But it won\u2019t be easy with the best five days of the Flat season now just a few hours\u2019 distant. The Tuesday card at Ascot is the one that is often referred to as the purist\u2019s afternoon at the Royal meeting, which is another way of saying that it is top-loaded with three of the meeting\u2019s eight Group One races and also tends to attract the smallest crowd of the five days. The scheduling remains a bit of a puzzle, as it means that almost half of the week\u2019s biggest events have been run by 4.15pm on the first afternoon, and in terms of boosting the live audience for the showpiece races, it might make sense to shift one of the Group Ones towards the end of the week. Change is glacial at Royal Ascot, though, and the counter-argument is that Thursday to Saturday will sell out in any case. The status quo keeps the purists happy too. My colleague Chris Cook\u2019s tips for the opening day are here, while punters might like to know that pool betting with the Tote promises to offer a little more value this year as an alternative to the bookmakers. This year\u2019s meeting marks the debut of World Pool, a co-mingling exercise between the Tote\u2019s UK operation and the hugely popular pari-mutuel system in Hong Kong. Tote bets placed in either jurisdiction will go into the same pot, which should ensure much stronger pools and therefore more certainty for punters that they will be getting fair odds for their money when the dividend is declared. Nothing, after all, puts a punter off the Tote more thoroughly than a 33-1 winner that pays \u00a316.60 on the machine. There are a few minor caveats. The Hong Kong tote cannot support races with more than 25 runners, so the Royal Hunt Cup and Saturday\u2019s Wokingham, probably the two biggest betting races of the week, will have only a local pool. It might also not be the best way to back one of this week\u2019s runners from Asia - Lim\u2019s Cruiser goes in the Diamond Jubilee on Saturday and Deirdre, from Japan, runs in tomorrow\u2019s Prince Of Wales\u2019s Stakes. But for a sport looking for ways to boost its income from betting, World Pool does offer a small sliver of hope. The Queen will be arriving at around 2pm BST and the first race, as ever, is due off at 2.30pm. As yet, there is little sign of the thunderstorms that were threatened in the overnight forecast \u2013 though of course, it\u2019s in their nature to pop up from nowhere \u2013 and ground is officially good and good-to-soft in places on the round course.",

The undisclosed settlement to Bank Mellat on the eve of what was expected to be a five-week trial raises questions about how big the UK taxpayer\u2019s bill is likely to be, as well as how the UK will transfer the payment to circumvent the comprehensive sanctions regime imposed by the US, which affects the bank. The Iranian government owns 20% of Bank Mellat, while the remaining 80% is held by the private sector. In 2009, the UK Treasury alleged that the Tehran-based bank was involved in financing firms involved in Iran\u2019s nuclear programme \u2013 allegations that the bank denies \u2013 and imposed sanctions on Bank Mellat. The settlement comes six years after the supreme court ruled that the sanctions had been unlawful and that the government\u2019s response had been \u201carbitrary and irrational\u201d, and \u201cdisproportionate\u201d. Bank Mellat argued that the sanctions had damaged its reputation and goodwill in Britain and internationally, and caused significant loss.

Last week, the Canadian rapper Drake wore a watch bearing an explicit message to a basketball game. His unusual, eye-wateringly expensive timepiece, by the Swiss brand Richard Mille, came with an inbuilt phrase generator \u2013 meaning that while on this occasion it displayed something we shan\u2019t print, it could just as easily have read, at the milder end: \u201cI need to devour you madly,\u201d or: \u201cI long to explore you tonight.\u201d It may sound totally preposterous, but \u201cerotic watches\u201d have an unexpectedly long history \u2013 albeit watches that displayed pictures, rather than words.

As in a flickering newsreel from a former age, complex events are reduced to symbolic emblems of right and wrong.

In the present US-Iran crisis, they supposedly provide official \u201cproof\u201d of nefarious intent. They can be seen to justify escalatory US actions that might previously have appeared unreasonable and provocative. They place pressure on reluctant allies to fall in behind the advancing American columns. Most of all, since democratic consent apparently still counts for something, they are intended to rally public support.</p> <p>We have seen this badly made movie before. And today, as in 2003, it presents a shadowy, unconvincing picture that no amount of White House manipulation and rhetoric can clarify. The fact is, the current crisis was conceived, manufactured and magnified in Washington. It has been whipped up by a group of hawkish policymakers around Donald Trump whose loathing for the Tehran regime is exceeded only by their recklessness.</p> <p>The crisis has been building inexorably since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/iran-deal-trump-withdraw-us-latest-news-nuclear-agreement\" title=\"\">President Trump\u2019s foolish renunciation last year</a> of the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/09/eu-rejects-iran-two-month-ultimatum-on-nuclear-deal\" title=\"\">imposition of swingeing sanctions</a>, and a campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d to isolate and weaken Iran\u2019s leadership. It looks and smells like a crude bid for regime change. And although Trump insists he does not want it, his actions could soon trigger another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/09/donald-trump-iran-nuclear-deal-blame\" title=\"\">calamitous Middle East war</a>.</p> <p>That\u2019s not a risk most people or states are ready to countenance. And so far, at least, Washington\u2019s parallel, virtual battle for consent and support is not going the way American hawks hoped. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/16/mike-pompeo-iran-tanker-attacks-we-dont-want-war\" title=\"\">Mike Pompeo</a>, the bully-boy evangelist who doubles as US secretary of state, rarely loses an opportunity to demonise Iran. Aware of post-Iraq scepticism over US intelligence claims, he noisily insists, with a creeping tinge of panic, on the accuracy and veracity of his \u201cevidence\u201d.</p> <p>Yet the problem for Pompeo, and fellow Iranophobe, national security adviser John Bolton, is that while most western governments probably believe that hardline elements within Iran, or Iranian-backed proxy forces, initiated last week\u2019s tanker attacks and similar incidents last month, they also believe gratuitous US provocations may have forced Iran\u2019s hand.

      "bodyText": "In Washington, at times of stress, international crises play out in black and white. As in a flickering newsreel from a former age, complex events are reduced to symbolic emblems of right and wrong. Grainy video images of \u201cevil-doers\u201d, George W Bush\u2019s favoured term, purport to show faceless Iranians acting suspiciously around a burning oil tanker in the Gulf last week. As new Middle East troop deployments are announced, US battleships are pictured bravely patrolling freedom\u2019s frontline. Monochromatic simplifications of this type suit multiple purposes. In the present US-Iran crisis, they supposedly provide official \u201cproof\u201d of nefarious intent. They can be seen to justify escalatory US actions that might previously have appeared unreasonable and provocative. They place pressure on reluctant allies to fall in behind the advancing American columns. Most of all, since democratic consent apparently still counts for something, they are intended to rally public support. We have seen this badly made movie before. And today, as in 2003, it presents a shadowy, unconvincing picture that no amount of White House manipulation and rhetoric can clarify. The fact is, the current crisis was conceived, manufactured and magnified in Washington. It has been whipped up by a group of hawkish policymakers around Donald Trump whose loathing for the Tehran regime is exceeded only by their recklessness. The crisis has been building inexorably since President Trump\u2019s foolish renunciation last year of the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, his imposition of swingeing sanctions, and a campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d to isolate and weaken Iran\u2019s leadership. It looks and smells like a crude bid for regime change. And although Trump insists he does not want it, his actions could soon trigger another calamitous Middle East war. That\u2019s not a risk most people or states are ready to countenance. And so far, at least, Washington\u2019s parallel, virtual battle for consent and support is not going the way American hawks hoped. Mike Pompeo, the bully-boy evangelist who doubles as US secretary of state, rarely loses an opportunity to demonise Iran. Aware of post-Iraq scepticism over US intelligence claims, he noisily insists, with a creeping tinge of panic, on the accuracy and veracity of his \u201cevidence\u201d. Yet the problem for Pompeo, and fellow Iranophobe, national security adviser John Bolton, is that while most western governments probably believe that hardline elements within Iran, or Iranian-backed proxy forces, initiated last week\u2019s tanker attacks and similar incidents last month, they also believe gratuitous US provocations may have forced Iran\u2019s hand. They don\u2019t believe Trump when he says he merely wants Iran to act \u201cnormal\u201d. But they do suspect the ultimate Bolton-Pompeo aim is a putsch. The foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, to Britain\u2019s shame, has tamely applauded Washington\u2019s dodgy video dossier. But the Europeans, rightly, don\u2019t buy it. The EU backs diplomacy, not sabre-rattling, and is still pursuing alternative barter arrangements to circumvent US sanctions. Russia, naturally, opposes the US. But China, in an unusually outspoken rebuff, said Washington\u2019s destabilising, unilateral behaviour \u201chas no basis in international law\u201d.

When he decided to quit Invesco and go it alone in 2013 it was a huge shock for the fund management industry. Invesco shares slumped by 7% on the day he announced his departure.</p>\n    <p>At Invesco Woodford held control of huge stakes in some of the UK\u2019s biggest firms, and his opinions mattered. His criticism of AstraZeneca chief executive David Brennan in the 2012 shareholder spring was widely regarded to have cost him his job, and his critique of BAE\u2019s attempted \u00a328bn merger with Airbus is acknowledged as one of the reasons the deal collapsed.</p>\n    <p>Woodford, who was widely referred to in the media as an investment \u201chero\u201d and fund management \u201cstar\u201d, had done exceedingly well over his quarter century there. A \u00a31,000 investment placed when he started at the firm in 1988 would have risen to \u00a323,000 by the time he left.</p>\n    <p>Woodford accidentally fell into fund management and hadn\u2019t heard of the term until he rocked up in the City in the 1980s sleeping on his brother\u2019s floor while looking for a job. He got his first break in insurance, before drifting into fund management. He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn\u2019t pass the RAF\u2019s aptitude test, and instead read economics and agricultural economics at the University of Exeter.</p>\n    <p>Feeling he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, he set up his own firm Woodford Investment Management in 2014, on an industrial estate near Oxford. Within two weeks of launching, he had raised \u00a31.6bn, a UK record, and it quickly grew to \u00a316bn. In its first full year his flagship fund returned 16% and Woodford, a devotee of veteran US investor Warren Buffett, was dubbed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/oracle-of-oxford-sees-red-as-stock-picking-powers-misfire\">\u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p>Asked if he ever doubted his judgment, Woodford once said: \u201cDaily. You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying \u2018everybody go away, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u2019. You\u2019ve always got to expose yourself to criticism and the analysis that you may be wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Woodford went on to say that the secret of successful fund management was a balance of arrogance and humility. \u201cYou have to have a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction. If you didn\u2019t, you would end up with a portfolio that looks very much like the index. But, equally, you must have the humility to accept that you will get things wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rupertneate\"><b>Rupert Neate</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At the end of March, Bailey wrote, the watchdog became \u201caware of press articles\u201d about some investments in the Equity Income Fund being listed on the Guernsey exchange. That move, which is entirely legal, allowed the fund to stay within the 10% EU limit for the proportion of unlisted investments which can be held in such a fund.</p> \n<p>The letter also revealed that from 24 April this year Link was providing daily updates about the rate of withdrawals from the underperforming fund.</p> \n<p>Bailey said Woodford was allowed to earmark unlisted shares for a listing in Guernsey to avoid falling foul of the rules, but that the rules should be revisited, because a listing on the Guernsey exchange did not necessarily mean the shares could be sold more easily.</p> \n<p>Bailey and the FCA chairman, Charles Randell, will be grilled over the Woodford debacle next week when they give evidence to the Treasury select committee.</p> \n<p>The news of the formal investigation came as Fidelity banned its customers from putting money into another of Woodford\u2019s funds.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The investment platform, one of Britain\u2019s biggest said it was halting new investments in the \u00a3325m Woodford Income Focus Fund, a sister fund to the Equity Income Fund.

We are going to keep watching it and if it ever gets to the point where there\u2019s substantial assets in a vehicle like that, that could give rise to widespread spillovers, we\u2019d have to do something about it.\u201d</p> \n<p><br></p>",

It was finally gated when Kent county ouncil asked for the return of \u00a3263m. In his letter, Bailey said the watchdog had been in contact with Link \u2013 the authorised administrator of the fund \u2013 since February 2018. Between April and December last year the FCA had held monthly monitoring discussions. In February this year, the FCA said, it was told about the sale of a number of unlisted and illiquid investments in the fund to another Woodford fund \u2013 his Patient Capital Investment Trust. At the end of March, Bailey wrote, the watchdog became \u201caware of press articles\u201d about some investments in the Equity Income Fund being listed on the Guernsey exchange. That move, which is entirely legal, allowed the fund to stay within the 10% EU limit for the proportion of unlisted investments which can be held in such a fund. The letter also revealed that from 24 April this year Link was providing daily updates about the rate of withdrawals from the underperforming fund. Bailey said Woodford was allowed to earmark unlisted shares for a listing in Guernsey to avoid falling foul of the rules, but that the rules should be revisited, because a listing on the Guernsey exchange did not necessarily mean the shares could be sold more easily. Bailey and the FCA chairman, Charles Randell, will be grilled over the Woodford debacle next week when they give evidence to the Treasury select committee. The news of the formal investigation came as Fidelity banned its customers from putting money into another of Woodford\u2019s funds. The investment platform, one of Britain\u2019s biggest said it was halting new investments in the \u00a3325m Woodford Income Focus Fund, a sister fund to the Equity Income Fund. The Income Focus Fund is not suspended and investors can still withdraw their cash. A Fidelity said: \u201cWe believe this is in the best interest of our platform clients, unless and until, uncertainties are resolved.\u201d It said the restrictions were \u201ctemporary and precautionary.\u201d A Woodford spokesperson said: \u201cThe fund was set up with the aim to deliver an income of 5p per share per annum, which it has achieved. The fund mainly invests in companies that pay a dividend and, ever since its launch, the portfolio has contained a combination of large, mid- and small-sized companies. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any exposure to illiquid or unquoted securities and consequently isn\u2019t exposed to the same issues that the Woodford Equity Income Fund is. \u201d Shares in Woodford\u2019s FTSE 250-listed vehicle, Patient Capital Trust, slumped to a fresh low of 51.8p on Tuesday. They have fallen almost 33% since Woodford\u2019s flagship fund was suspended. Fidelity\u2019s move emerged as Bank of England policymaker Anil Kashyap warned that if the Woodford debacle were to undermine confidence in the financial system, it could become a very big problem, and that the central bank was watching closely. Kashyap told Morgan\u2019s Treasury select committee: \u201cI don\u2019t think Woodford per se creates financial stability risk, but if it undermines confidence in the system it could be a very big problem.\u201d Kashyap, a member of the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee, added: \u201cIt\u2019s a very visible thing, it\u2019s got people worrying about whether or not this is going to be present elsewhere. We are going to keep watching it and if it ever gets to the point where there\u2019s substantial assets in a vehicle like that, that could give rise to widespread spillovers, we\u2019d have to do something about it.\u201d",

His first was for the MCC against Surrey in Dubai in March. But he feathered an inside-edge onto middle stump off Patterson to spark an evening collapse of four for 27 inside eleven overs as the visitors fell from 139 for one to 166 for five.

Craig Miles and Oliver Hannon-Dalby were particularly impressive in sharing seven wickets in seamer-friendly; swing, seam, pace and carry. But there is no doubt that Yorkshire, despite losing five wickets for eight runs at one stage to slip from 93 for 1 to 101 for 6, are still very much in this game. </p> <p>That is largely thanks to Gary Ballance\u2019s fifth score of 50-plus in Championship cricket this season \u2013 54 \u2013 and a 60-run stand between Steve Patterson and David Willey for the eighth wicket, recovering from 145 for 7.</p> <p>Elsewhere, wickets fell like nine pins. At Chelmsford, Essex, who posted only 214, won by an innings against Hampshire, with Simon Harmer taking 12 wickets in the match. That result is particularly good news for leaders Somerset, who now lead the table by 23 points from second-placed Hampshire with a game in hand. They are 30 clear of Essex, both having played six. The two meet at Chelmsford next week, with Dom Bess likely to play as a second spinner after returning from his loan spell at Yorkshire. </p> <p>There are now only two Division One fixtures in play, with Kent posting 309 against Nottinghamshire at Tunbridge Wells, recovering superbly from 81 fpr 4 and 100 for 5 through the opener Zak Crawley\u2019s 111. Cliche alert: James Pattinson fired an Ashes warning with six wickets in his last outing for Notts before linking up with the Australia A squad. Notts closed on 30 for 0.</p> <p>In Division Two, Jimmy Anderson\u2019s excellent pre-Ashes form continued with 5 for 18 from 17 overs against Derbyshire at Derby. The hosts were bowled out for 153, with Graham Onions claiming three to move to 698 career first-class wickets. The leaders, Lancashire, closed on 8 for 1 in reply, with only 59 overs of play possible there. Amazingly, Anderson\u2019s record this season stands at 24 Championship wickets in his fifth match at an average of 8.87 with an economy rate of 1.69. He has taken two five-wicket hauls.</p> <p>At the halfway stage of the match between Middlesex and Glamorgan at Radlett, Dawid Malan\u2019s side hold sway having posted 410 and restricted Glammy to 112-3. Sam Robson and Paul Stirling posted centuries, and Glamorgan will hope Billy Root continues his excellent recent form (16 not out). Leicestershire, after one day at Grace Road, have the early advantage over Gloucestershire at 343-5 - hundreds for Hassan Azad and Neil Dexter.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Dom Sibley would be viewed by most England followers as a left field selection for an opening berth in this summer\u2019s Ashes, but Warwickshire\u2019s tall right-hander is building a strong case nonetheless, highlighted by a polished 67 during an enthralling day two at Clifton Park. Sibley was underpinning a healthy response to Yorkshire\u2019s first-innings 259, with a second-wicket stand of 101 with teenager Rob Yates from early afternoon to mid-evening threatening the home side\u2019s unbeaten start to the summer during a week they will remember fondly whatever the outcome given it is the first county fixture in York since 1890. However, Sibley, particularly confident off his legs, was the first of three quick evening wickets for the highly valuable White Rose captain Steve Patterson, who had earlier completed a fine 60 \u2013 his fourth first-class fifty. Sibley, 23, has scored 640 first-class runs this season, including three centuries \u2013 all against county opposition. His first was for the MCC against Surrey in Dubai in March. But he feathered an inside-edge onto middle stump off Patterson to spark an evening collapse of four for 27 inside eleven overs as the visitors fell from 139 for one to 166 for five. Industrious Patterson, a Yorkshireman for all seasons, claimed three and David Willey the other in front of a 3,021 crowd. Warwickshire closed on 192 for five from 76 overs. Lancashire\u2019s former England fast bowler Graham Onions claimed his 700th first-class wicket, Wayne Madsen bowled, as the Division Two leaders took control against Derbyshire at the County Ground. Lancashire, replying to a first-innings 153, reached 236. Onions then claimed three wickets as Derby responded with 19 for four. Division One strugglers Nottinghamshire, chasing their first win of 2019, are handily placed (208 for four) in reply to Kent\u2019s 309 at Tunbridge Wells. Back in Division Two, day three rain at Radlett has significantly threatened Middlesex\u2019s chances of beating Glamorgan, who narrowly avoided having to follow-on at 274 for nine in reply to 410. The wicketkeeper Tom Cullen hit a crucial 50. Leicestershire are on top at the halfway stage against Gloucestershire at Grace Road, while Worcestershire\u2019s South African seamer Wayne Parnell claimed four wickets on day one at Kidderminster to leave Sussex at 185 for six. Sibley has gone for 67. It seems like he might have played on, just a feather of an inside edge against Patterson. Warwickshire are 139 for 2, with a 101-run stand between him and Yates (43) ended. Sibley has now scored 640 first-class runs this season. And that\u2019s 700 for Onions. He\u2019s bowled Wayne Madsen. Jimmy Anderson has also struck. Derbyshire are 17 for 3. Graham Onions on 699 career first-class wickets. Derbyshire are 13 for 1 in the fifth over of their second innings, trailing by 70. Tom Lace has been caught behind. Lancashire are all out for 236 at Derby, a lead of 83. Luis Reece finished with 6 for 83, taking the new ball against his former county, while Gloucestershire have lost three early ones (28 for 3) in reply to Leicestershire\u2019s 487. Muhammad Abbas has taken all three. Here at York, Dom Sibley has just passed 50. A late Ashes contender? Warwickshire 116 for 1. A strange old session here at York. First things first, Warwickshire will be delighted with their position at 109 for 1 in reply to 259, with Sibley (48) and Yates (32) sharing an unbroken 71. So in that sense it was a dominant session, with the Bears losing only one wicket. But Yorkshire did manage to keep things in check, conceding only 13 runs in the last 10 overs of the session. Left-arm spinner James Logan has looked dangerous in his first eight overs, playing only his second match. But the bare facts are that Yorkshire need a wicket. Important lower order resistance from Glamorgan at Radlett, as they avoid the follow-on. Considering their game against Middlesex is halfway through day three, the hosts have it all to do to claim victory. Tom Cullen posted 50 and Graham Wagg 37 not out. At 274 for 9, they trail by 136. Yorkshire really need a wicket. Warwickshire are 74 for 1 replying to 259. Batting has looked much easier today, and Dom Sibley is strengthening that theory with the help of Rob Yates. They have taken the score from 38 for 1 and have 27 and 19 respectively. It\u2019s interesting that both camps were thinking Yorkshire\u2019s 259 was a bit over par. It doesn\u2019t look it at the moment. The left-arm spinner James Logan is currently operating from the Shipton End of this ground. His run-up is more of a creep in to the crease. There\u2019s a bit of rain around, with play delayed at Radlett (Glamorgan 233 for 7 in reply to Middleesex\u2019s 410), although they are due to restart in 10 minutes or so. They are also off at Grace Road, where Gloucestershire have finally wrapped up the Leicestershire first innings on 487. Logan chips in. Oh Logan van Beek, you spoil sport! I jest. Luis Reece wasn\u2019t that close to all 10 wickets, was he. Anyway Van Beek, the former under-19s NZ Basketball international, has removed Liam Livingstone at Derby. Lancashire 126 for 5, trailing by 27. New Zealand Basketball, for me, has the best sports team nickname in the world. The Tall Blacks. If this was a post-watershed blog, I wouldn\u2019t have to let you do your own research on the former nickname of the Kiwi Badminton team. Where there\u2019s a Will... Not a bad way to start the afternoon for Warwickshire, who have moved to 38 without loss. Will Rhodes has just flicked former teammate Ben Coad over backward square leg, perhaps more wide long leg. He has 28. Or rather, had 28. He\u2019s gone. Caught at third slip by Jack Leaning off Coad. It\u2019s 38 for 1. Division One Notts 104-2 at Tunbridge Wells v Kent (309) \u2013 morning wickets for Milnes and Mulder, a combination which sounds like a classic detective series to me. Warwickshire 23-0 in reply to Yorkshire\u2019s 259 - Will Rhodes unbeaten on 16 against his former county. He\u2019s played much of his league cricket up the road at Stamford Bridge. Division Two Glamorgan 214-6 against Middlesex (410) on day three at Radlett - Steven Finn has four-for. It\u2019s a similar tale at Derby (back to day two starts now) where Lancashire are 94-4 in reply to Derbyshire\u2019s 153. Luis Reece has four wickets against his former county. Leicestershire are still going strong against Gloucestershire at Grace Road \u2013 441-7. Colin Ackermann, the South African Dutchman, is 38 not out. At Kidderminster, on day one, Sussex are 89-5 \u2013 three wickets for Wayne Parnell. Reece on a roll. Luis Reece is on course for all 10 at Derby against his former county. He has four-for, Haseeb Hameed his latest victim, caught at second slip for nine. Lancashire 93 for 4. Yorkshire are all out for 259. Oliver Hannon-Dalby bowls Ben Coad to finish with 5 for 76 against his home county \u2013 he\u2019s a Halifax lad. James Logan is unbeaten on 20. Warwickshire\u2019s openers are going to have an awkward 20 minutes of batting to do before lunch. Fair play to Derbyshire, who are sticking with the runaway Division Two leaders Lancashire at Derby. They have struck twice this morning through Luis Reece, the former Red Rose all-rounder, to restrict their visitors to 74 for 3 in reply to 153. Yesterday Derby were 91 for 8 before recovering. Given the strength of Lancashire\u2019s team this season, especially their bowling attack, I would slate them as the second strongest in county cricket this season behind Somerset. Steve Patterson chops Oliver Hannon-Dalby onto his stumps for 60 and gets a rapturous reception from the York faithful following a super knock. Yorkshire 253 for 9. A fourth wicket for the former Yorkshire seamer. It\u2019s been a pretty miserable season so far for Notts, but there is encouragement in the start to their first-innings reply to Kent\u2019s 309. They are currently 71 for 1 at Tunbridge Wells. Ben Slater (31 not out) and Ben Duckett, the latter out for 33, have been the main protagonists. Early success for Worcester at Kidderminster \u2013 Sussex are 43 for 2. Steve Patterson has just reached his fourth career first-class fifty, his first in almost three years and his second against Warwickshire. This one comes off 77 balls with six fours. Yorkshire have made a very useful start to day two, advancing from 208 for 8 overnight to 234 for 8. Batting does look easier today, which neither side were expecting. Steve Finn has taken a couple of early poles at Radlett, bowling Billy Root \u2013 a huge wicket given his current form \u2013 and getting Owen Morgan caught behind. That game is into its third day, but Glamorgan have work to do at 126-5 replying to 410. The Clifton Park venue here is a massive site, including four or five Rugby pitches and another cricket ground, which is used by the Clifton Alliance club, who once fielded Aaron Finch as a young overseas pup learning his game. The boundaries would be too short for him now. On the main oval, Yorkshire are 218 for 8. Ah, the weird and wonderful nature of the ECB\u2019s toss rule in Championship cricket. Sussex opt for a toss obviously wanting to bat at Kidderminster, only for Worcestershire to win it and choose to bowl. Everyone gets what they want. Mind you, had it been at New Road, it would have been win the toss and swim. Sussex 7 for 0 in the third over. Some early news from York, and it is good news for Yorkshire. They are reporting no significant damage to the hip injury suffered by Duanne Olivier against Surrey at Guildford last week. He is sitting out this game, but the big South African quick is expected to play in the return match with Surrey at Scarborough, which starts a week on Sunday. We are just about to get underway at York \u2013 104.2 overs to be bowled in the day. Good morning from Clifton Park. Monday proved to be a historic day for York CC as county cricket returned to the Minster City for the first time in 129 years and, despite rain costing us 29 overs, it proved to be an intriguing opening day\u2019s play as Yorkshire reached 208 for 8 from 66.4 overs. Craig Miles and Oliver Hannon-Dalby were particularly impressive in sharing seven wickets in seamer-friendly; swing, seam, pace and carry. But there is no doubt that Yorkshire, despite losing five wickets for eight runs at one stage to slip from 93 for 1 to 101 for 6, are still very much in this game. That is largely thanks to Gary Ballance\u2019s fifth score of 50-plus in Championship cricket this season \u2013 54 \u2013 and a 60-run stand between Steve Patterson and David Willey for the eighth wicket, recovering from 145 for 7. Elsewhere, wickets fell like nine pins. At Chelmsford, Essex, who posted only 214, won by an innings against Hampshire, with Simon Harmer taking 12 wickets in the match. That result is particularly good news for leaders Somerset, who now lead the table by 23 points from second-placed Hampshire with a game in hand. They are 30 clear of Essex, both having played six. The two meet at Chelmsford next week, with Dom Bess likely to play as a second spinner after returning from his loan spell at Yorkshire. There are now only two Division One fixtures in play, with Kent posting 309 against Nottinghamshire at Tunbridge Wells, recovering superbly from 81 fpr 4 and 100 for 5 through the opener Zak Crawley\u2019s 111. Cliche alert: James Pattinson fired an Ashes warning with six wickets in his last outing for Notts before linking up with the Australia A squad. Notts closed on 30 for 0. In Division Two, Jimmy Anderson\u2019s excellent pre-Ashes form continued with 5 for 18 from 17 overs against Derbyshire at Derby. The hosts were bowled out for 153, with Graham Onions claiming three to move to 698 career first-class wickets. The leaders, Lancashire, closed on 8 for 1 in reply, with only 59 overs of play possible there. Amazingly, Anderson\u2019s record this season stands at 24 Championship wickets in his fifth match at an average of 8.87 with an economy rate of 1.69. He has taken two five-wicket hauls. At the halfway stage of the match between Middlesex and Glamorgan at Radlett, Dawid Malan\u2019s side hold sway having posted 410 and restricted Glammy to 112-3. Sam Robson and Paul Stirling posted centuries, and Glamorgan will hope Billy Root continues his excellent recent form (16 not out). Leicestershire, after one day at Grace Road, have the early advantage over Gloucestershire at 343-5 - hundreds for Hassan Azad and Neil Dexter.",

      "bodyText": "There have been fresh calls to bring 10,000 child refugees to safety in the UK amid events celebrating the 80th anniversary of the Kindertransport trains that saved many children from the Nazis. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, announced a new resettlement scheme for the most vulnerable refugees on Monday but did not say how many children would be included. The charity Safe Passage said it had secured pledges from local authorities to support 1,170 child refugees and questioned why the government had so far brought just a few hundred to the UK when so many more local authority places were available for children in need of refuge. The global refugee crisis shows no sign of abating, with more than 68.5 million people forced from their homes and nearly 25.4 million refugees, more than half of whom are under the age of 18. Lord Dubs, whose life was saved when he came to the UK on the Kindertransport as a small child, spoke on Tuesday at a rally outside parliament organised by Safe Passage and another charity, Help Refugees. He appealed to the government to resettle 10,000 child refugees in the next 10 years. He said Theresa May had previously urged him to drop his amendment to the Immigration Act 2016, known as the Dubs amendment, to allow some of the most vulnerable child refugees to come to the UK because she feared \u201cothers would follow\u201d. \u201cWe parted without agreement,\u201d said Dubs. The government has two schemes to bring child refugees to the UK \u2013 the vulnerable children\u2019s resettlement scheme (VCRS) to bring 3,000 refugees from conflict zones in the Middle East, and the Dubs scheme to bring 480 vulnerable unaccompanied child refugees from Europe. Safe Passage\u2019s chief executive, Eleanor Harrison, welcomed the home secretary\u2019s announcement of a new resettlement scheme but said she remained concerned by the lack of assurances regarding safe and legal routes for children. \u201cIn 2018 we discovered that just 20 unaccompanied children had been resettled as part of the vulnerable children\u2019s resettlement scheme, despite up to 3,000 places being made available,\u201d she said. Alongside Dubs, Safe Passage has been campaigning for a commitment from the government to welcome 10,000 children over 10 years from conflict zones and Europe. At the start of the global Refugee Week on Monday, Javid confirmed the UK planned to resettle about 5,000 of the world\u2019s most vulnerable refugees in the first year under a scheme launching in 2020. The scheme will consolidate the vulnerable persons\u2019 resettlement scheme, the VCRS and the gateway protection programme, which offers a legal route for up to 750 refugees to settle in the UK each year and is run with the UN high commission for refugees, into one global scheme. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cSince 2016, Britain has resettled more refugees from outside Europe than any other EU state and we will continue to do all we can to help the world\u2019s most vulnerable. \u201cOur new global resettlement scheme will help thousands more people fleeing conflict and persecution, including children, to build a new life in the UK. \u201cWe remain fully committed to relocating 480 children under section 67 of the Immigration Act (the Dubs amendment) and are determined to deliver on that.\u201d",

There is one chap in his mid-70s who we see at events on a regular basis \u2013 and it\u2019s not Mick Jagger, <a href=\"https://www.clashmusic.com/news/mick-jagger-partied-at-horse-meat-disco-over-the-weekend\" title=\"\">who was spotted partying at south London spot Horse Meat Disco</a> last month.</p> <p>We are not alone. A poll of 2,000 adults by the ticket platform Eventbrite found that 2.6 million Britons over the age of 45 go clubbing at least once a week and 40% say they have more stamina than ravers half their age. Part of it is that the clubbing population has aged and they are continuing to go to the events.</p> <p>I started raving in the late 80s, when you\u2019d turn up at a service station, follow the leader around the motorway and end up at an abandoned barn somewhere in the middle of nowhere. I stopped going in my late 40s, about the time I met Tonia and moved in with her and her four-year-old son. She was also caring for her father, so we didn\u2019t do a lot of the going out together that most couples do at the start of a relationship.</p> <p>One of the events I used to go to was the Gatecrasher night in Sheffield. In 2016, they had a 23rd anniversary event, and Tonia agreed to come. She had done a lot of clubbing, so she wasn\u2019t averse to the idea of going out dancing all night.</p> <p>For me, it was like coming home. It\u2019s a very welcoming, warm atmosphere and I didn\u2019t feel awkward being one of the oldest people there. People usually ask me how old I am, then tell me that I\u2019m inspirational and that they hope they\u2019re still enjoying partying when they\u2019re my age. It\u2019s lovely, but it can be a bit of a nuisance when what would be a three-minute walk between rooms takes 20 minutes because so many people want to talk to us.</p> <p>A night out is also exhausting. A typical event will last eight or nine hours. We pace ourselves and we\u2019ll dip in and out and drink plenty of water. But the music and atmosphere energises me. I couldn\u2019t run a mile, but this gives me loads of exercise. Since I\u2019ve been going, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s contributed to me losing more than five stone.</p> <p>I love the music \u2013 trance in particular tends to be quite melodic. There will be a point in the tune where it gets a little bit floaty, then it builds up and there\u2019s a great big wallop, and it\u2019s very hard for me to stand still for it. But mostly I love it because of the people \u2013 we\u2019ve made friends from all over the world through it. When we got married last year, we hosted a trance event in a local club.</p> <p>When I was younger, as long as the music was reasonably fast and I could jump up and down to it, I wasn\u2019t that picky. Nowadays, I tend to go more to the trance nights because I think a whole event of hardcore \u2013 which has a really fast tempo \u2013 would actually kill me.</p>",

One of the events I used to go to was the Gatecrasher night in Sheffield. In 2016, they had a 23rd anniversary event, and Tonia agreed to come. She had done a lot of clubbing, so she wasn\u2019t averse to the idea of going out dancing all night. For me, it was like coming home. It\u2019s a very welcoming, warm atmosphere and I didn\u2019t feel awkward being one of the oldest people there. People usually ask me how old I am, then tell me that I\u2019m inspirational and that they hope they\u2019re still enjoying partying when they\u2019re my age. It\u2019s lovely, but it can be a bit of a nuisance when what would be a three-minute walk between rooms takes 20 minutes because so many people want to talk to us. A night out is also exhausting. A typical event will last eight or nine hours. We pace ourselves and we\u2019ll dip in and out and drink plenty of water. But the music and atmosphere energises me. I couldn\u2019t run a mile, but this gives me loads of exercise. Since I\u2019ve been going, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s contributed to me losing more than five stone. I love the music \u2013 trance in particular tends to be quite melodic. There will be a point in the tune where it gets a little bit floaty, then it builds up and there\u2019s a great big wallop, and it\u2019s very hard for me to stand still for it. But mostly I love it because of the people \u2013 we\u2019ve made friends from all over the world through it. When we got married last year, we hosted a trance event in a local club. When I was younger, as long as the music was reasonably fast and I could jump up and down to it, I wasn\u2019t that picky. Nowadays, I tend to go more to the trance nights because I think a whole event of hardcore \u2013 which has a really fast tempo \u2013 would actually kill me.",

      "body": "<p>In a bit of news that, unusually for these times, doesn\u2019t make one want to hunker down underground never to resurface, a study has been released about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/17/how-dogs-capture-your-heart-evolution-puppy-dog-eyes\" title=\"\">adorableness of dogs</a>. Everyone loves an animal study. One of my recent favourites was reported with the headline: <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/27/cats-nice-enjoy-spending-time-humans-study-finds/\" title=\"\">\u201cCats are nice and enjoy spending time with humans,\u201d</a> which I presume was commissioned and carried out by cats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/17/how-dogs-capture-your-heart-evolution-puppy-dog-eyes\">How canines capture your heart: scientists explain puppy dog eyes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This week, thanks to a UK-US team of scientists, we learn that the archetypal puppy-dog-eyes expression that makes us so susceptible to doggies\u2019 charms and desires is down to the evolution of a forehead muscle. This is found in domestic dogs we keep as pets but not their ancestors, wolves. </p> <p>Dogs, according to Prof Bridget Waller, director of the Centre for Comparative and Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Portsmouth, \u201care very powerful animals in how they capture our hearts\u201d. The muscle that has developed (<em>levator anguli oculi medialis</em>, which should be but isn\u2019t, in fact, the name of a spell from Harry Potter) has resulted in domestic dogs\u2019 ability to raise their eyebrows, eliciting a \u201cnurturing response\u201d in humans.</p> <p>This very much explains why my childhood dog, a black labrador named Ben, captured my young heart. When my dad picked Ben up as a tiny pup, he told me he could fit him in his pocket. This was true, though he was wearing a Regatta waterproof at the time, with pockets the size of caves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8d6eae3235dda361a5a154a456c3d844148bae8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8d6eae3235dda361a5a154a456c3d844148bae8/0_360_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bichon frise, yesterday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bichon frise, yesterday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PetStockBoys/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Circumstances meant I only had a couple of years with Ben, but he was my first canine love. The cock of his head and the inquisitive look, we now know are the result of 32,000 years of evolution.

      "bodyText": "In a bit of news that, unusually for these times, doesn\u2019t make one want to hunker down underground never to resurface, a study has been released about the adorableness of dogs. Everyone loves an animal study. One of my recent favourites was reported with the headline: \u201cCats are nice and enjoy spending time with humans,\u201d which I presume was commissioned and carried out by cats. This week, thanks to a UK-US team of scientists, we learn that the archetypal puppy-dog-eyes expression that makes us so susceptible to doggies\u2019 charms and desires is down to the evolution of a forehead muscle. This is found in domestic dogs we keep as pets but not their ancestors, wolves. Dogs, according to Prof Bridget Waller, director of the Centre for Comparative and Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Portsmouth, \u201care very powerful animals in how they capture our hearts\u201d. The muscle that has developed (levator anguli oculi medialis, which should be but isn\u2019t, in fact, the name of a spell from Harry Potter) has resulted in domestic dogs\u2019 ability to raise their eyebrows, eliciting a \u201cnurturing response\u201d in humans. This very much explains why my childhood dog, a black labrador named Ben, captured my young heart. When my dad picked Ben up as a tiny pup, he told me he could fit him in his pocket. This was true, though he was wearing a Regatta waterproof at the time, with pockets the size of caves. Circumstances meant I only had a couple of years with Ben, but he was my first canine love. The cock of his head and the inquisitive look, we now know are the result of 32,000 years of evolution. His giant paws were like novelty slippers. The dogs in my life today are no less emotionally manipulative, which is how I am choosing to describe them rather than giving them the benefit of \u201cthe cute factor\u201d, in the words of the scientists. I also find it impossible to ignore dogs when roaming in my local park. They get you from both ends: the wagging tails, the doleful eyes. Often I feel bad because I tend to address the dogs before the owners. Perhaps the most famous example in recent years of the dog\u2019s evolved expression is the golden retriever that the broadcaster Kay Burley tweeted a picture of after the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks with the caption: \u201cSadness in his eyes\u201d. This was widely mocked \u2013 because the idea of the dog being at all aware of the chaos that had unfolded was rightly ludicrous \u2013 but also, there was sadness in his eyes. (Or maybe her eyes, who is to say, really?) One scientist who was involved in the latest study, Dr Juliane Kaminski, suggested that the wide-eyed and eyebrow-raising expression \u201cis significant in the human-dog bond because it might \u2026 create the illusion of human-like communication\u201d.

      "body": "<p>When safari tourists drive to the Serengeti national park in Tanzania, few realise they are passing one of the world\u2019s most contentious goldmines.</p> <p>From the escarpment above the plain, the North Mara facility is so large that it at first resembles a bare hillside. But look closer and the artificial mound is made up of tiers of reddish brown earth, from which a thin grey plume of smoke drifts up to the sky.</p> <p>Nearer still, you find a vast tailings reservoir filled with contaminated wastewater. Locals live in huts under the shadow of its mud and rock banks.</p> <p>Welcome to North Mara, one of the biggest mines in Tanzania, which since 2006 has been operated by London-listed <a href=\"https://www.acaciamining.com/\">Acacia</a> Mining and predominantly owned by the world\u2019s biggest goldmining company, Barrick, a Toronto-based firm that holds a 63.9% stake.</p> <p>For the past two decades, this mine has been a place of danger, extreme violence and allegations of environmental contamination. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"390bf2703a480a445b6be40b2525e4ab78240e30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/390bf2703a480a445b6be40b2525e4ab78240e30/0_156_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Villagers search for pieces of gold contained in discarded waste rock from the North Mara mine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Villagers search for pieces of gold contained in discarded waste rock from the North Mara mine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trevor Snapp/Bloomberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Tanzania is nominally at peace, over the years police and security guards <a href=\"https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/tanzania-deaths-injuries-at-barrick-mine-linked-to-displacement-loss-of-livelihoods\">have been accused of killing</a> dozens \u2013 possibly hundreds \u2013 of local people, injuring many more and raping countless women.</p> <p>There have also been reports of contamination from mining chemicals, but journalists and human rights activists who have tried to investigate these cases have sometimes found themselves the subject of intimidation, harassment and even threats of deportation from police and state authorities. Acacia says it is not involved in any crackdown on the media and it promotes transparency.</p> <p>Since a legal challenge in 2015, the company has worked with authorities to improve the human rights situation. It erected walls in some areas, enhanced staff training, and <a href=\"https://www.acaciamining.com/sustainability/grievance-process/gp-english.aspx\">put in place a grievance system</a>.</p> <p>But an investigation by the Guardian and its partners in the Forbidden Stories journalism collective has been told violence continues \u2013 albeit at a lower level \u2013 while the health problems associated with possible chemical pollution remain a concern.</p> <p>The details have been slow to emerge and remain disputed. Acacia denies any wrongdoing.</p> <p>It is running a vast and remote mine that is a major contributor to the national economy. The disparity of power with local villagers could hardly be greater. Most locals here are from the Kuria indigenous community and many are illiterate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"513f53b1cbeb9bac8c0fb6536a98ceffdbb64e9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/513f53b1cbeb9bac8c0fb6536a98ceffdbb64e9c/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trespassers around the North Mara goldmine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trespassers around the North Mara goldmine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Forbidden Stories</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Acacia bought the mine in 2006. It has so far produced 2m ounces of gold, worth $2.6bn at today\u2019s prices, with almost double that amount still underground.</p> <p>But it also inherited violence and widespread resentment.</p> <h2>\u2018Police dump the bodies outside the homes\u2019</h2> <p>The original owner, Afrika Mashariki Gold Mines,<em> </em>acquired the land in the mid-1990s, and was <a href=\"https://www.ecolex.org/details/court-decision/complaint-relating-to-violations-of-fundamental-rights-and-duties-arising-from-forced-evictions-of-artisanal-miners-from-afrika-mashariki-gold-mine-tarime-8b284420-1c52-4b3a-93c4-f063cf291708/\">accused of evicting </a><a href=\"https://www.ecolex.org/details/court-decision/complaint-relating-to-violations-of-fundamental-rights-and-duties-arising-from-forced-evictions-of-artisanal-miners-from-afrika-mashariki-gold-mine-tarime-8b284420-1c52-4b3a-93c4-f063cf291708/\"> residents without compensation</a>.</p> <p>Nearby villagers were forbidden from artisanal mining, which had been an important source of income before the mining company arrived. Locals \u2013 sometimes armed with machetes \u2013 intrude inside the mine to look for granules of gold among the waste rock and on the edge of the tailings pond. The situation is often volatile.</p> <p>On some days, the guards accept bribes and turn a blind eye. </p> <p>On others, they are ordered by their bosses to crack down. The worst period was around 2010-14.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of people get shot, some beside me. We would enter in a group and then run if they see us. We would hear the next day who had died. Police dump the bodies outside the homes,\u201d said one local man who asked to remain anonymous, referring to conflicts at that time. He said tensions remained.</p> <p>\u201cIt happened many times. The villagers get very angry. Why are they treating us like animals?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"613168eac272d7c66e346d7a7ce06ed9b8db894d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/613168eac272d7c66e346d7a7ce06ed9b8db894d/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children near the goldmine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children near the goldmine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Forbidden Stories</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The nearest general hospital in Tarime was treating five to eight cases of gunshot wounds from the mine every week from around 2010 to 2014, according to Dr Mark Nega, a former district medical officer.</p> <p> \u201cI saw so many people shot and killed. Some had gunshot wounds in the back. I think they were trying to run away but they were shot from behind.\u201d</p> <p>Such killings were initially played down or denied. Journalists who tried to investigate found themselves harassed by police, or believed their stories had been spiked following pressure from state authorities.</p> <p>After pressure from activists and lawyers, Acacia acknowledged 32 \u201ctrespasser-related\u201d fatalities between 2014 and 2017. Of these, six died in confrontations with police at the mine.</p> <p>International watchdog groups say at least 22 were killings by guards and police during the same period. Tanzanian opposition politicians have claimed 300 people have been killed since 1999.</p> <p>\u201cFor such a high number of violations to have occurred outside a conflict zone in a business context is shocking and exceptional,\u201d said Anneke van Woudenberg, the executive director of Raid, a UK corporate watchdog. </p> <p> The owners blame police. \u201cThere have been many, many investigations on various allegations, and you can\u2019t hold me accountable for the state authority,\u201d said the Barrick chief executive, Mark Bristow, when asked about the killings.</p> <p> But the authorities work under a <a href=\"http://www.raid-uk.org/sites/default/files/mou_with_police_august_2014.pdf\">memorandum of understanding</a> with the mine whereby local police work at the service of the mine in return for fuel, food, accommodation and daily stipends.</p> <p>After a lawsuit against the company in 2015 by plaintiffs represented by the UK law firm Leigh Day was settled out of court with no recognition of liability, the number of shootings has declined and no rapes have been reported.</p> <p>There is a new wall around operational areas. The mine and local authorities say they are educating guards and police and punishing those who break the law.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"86c6f41b4abe91d0839d1db342c2fef00e2a42c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86c6f41b4abe91d0839d1db342c2fef00e2a42c1/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"North Mara goldmine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The North Mara goldmine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Forbidden Stories</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Security arrangements have been revised and efforts have been made to improve community relations. The number of conflicts has fallen considerably. </p> <p>But the problem seems far from solved.</p> <p>On a recent trip to the area, the Guardian and Forbidden Stories heard of several new cases. On 3 or 4 August 2017, Daniel Chacha Range was reportedly shot and killed at the Nyabigena waste dump, where he was looking for gold.</p> <p>The mine reportedly paid 72m Tanzanian shillings (\u00a325,000) to the family last March. </p> <p>On 1 December last year, a young student \u2013 Amos Chacha \u2013 was injured by a bullet from security personnel. Locals said he was accidentally hit by a volley that was fired to scare villagers near the mine.</p> <p>In both cases, Acacia said it could not comment on individuals, but its guards did not use lethal weapons and it dealt with human rights abuses by other parties, such as the police, through its grievance mechanism.</p> <h2>\u2018It would never happen anywhere in Europe\u2019</h2> <p>Then there are environmental problems that may prove to be Acacia\u2019s enduring legacy long after the gold is mined out. </p> <p>There can be few places in the world where so many people live so close to a vast toxic tailings dam, waste rock dump and chemical processing facility. About 70,000 people live close to the mine, many of them drawn by the prospect of jobs or gold.</p> <p>Walls erected in recent years have improved the situation in some areas, but elsewhere, it is hard to tell where the border is between the village and the mine. Acacia says it has been unable to acquire all the land it needs for a 200-metre buffer zone, but is still trying to do so.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been going on in Tanzania for years,\u201d said Tundu Lissu, a lawyer and activist.</p> <p>\u201cPeople live side by side with the piles of waste from the mine and that is completely illegal in Tanzanian law. It would never happen anywhere in Europe because people simply would not accept that kind of arrangement.\u201d</p> <p>The Earthworks NGO estimates the average gold ring generates 20 tonnes of waste. Heavy metals and other toxins that were previously buried are released into the air and water.</p> <p>Unless carefully managed, this can seep into the soil and rivers with consequences that can last for decades.</p> <p>Locals report frequent spills from the tailings reservoir, including one the week before we arrived. In the past this has caused problems. </p> <p>A doctor, who worked in the general hospital in Tarime for five years until 2010, said he had treated at least 200 people with skin rashes, including 50 children. He also diagnosed an unusually high number of cervical cancer cases even among women without HIV who had never given birth.</p> <p>The doctor, who asked to remain anonymous, said there were three types of skin problems \u2013 a loss of pigmentation, toad-like scales and scurvy-like dryness.</p> <p>He believed the likely cause was chemicals in the mine \u2013 either pollution that leaked into rivers from the tailings pond, or mercury that artisanal miners used with their hands to separate the gold from the rocks. </p> <p>A second doctor said he had dealt with 10 cases of severe skin rashes up until 2014 when he left the area, and many more cases were likely to have been treated by his colleagues.</p> <p>Acacia says previous cases have been thoroughly investigated by the authorities, but it will consider new cases through its grievance mechanism.</p> <p>Villagers appear to have been unaware of the possible risks. Chaina Mwita Bhoke thought she was fortunate when fish started leaping out of the Tigithe River and flapping on the ground in front of her. She cooked some for her family, but soon after her children ate them, she said they were screaming that their skin was on fire. She also suffered.</p> <p>A doctor\u2019s certificate from Nyamongo hospital at that time in 2009 diagnosed skin lesions on her lower limbs caused by \u201ccontamination by poisonous water from North Mara mine\u201d.</p> <p>Others lost their livelihoods. John Nyamboge Ntara, of Matongo village, said that up until September 2017, 168 of his cows had died after grazing on land close to the tailing reservoir. \u201cWe worry for our kids,\u201d he said. Acacia said it had investigated these claims and found no evidence supporting the allegations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc0e0874c82d7d2baedf60f930fe3c905b22b0b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc0e0874c82d7d2baedf60f930fe3c905b22b0b0/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cattle in the Tigite River, near North Mara goldmine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cattle in the Tigite River, near North Mara goldmine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Forbidden Stories</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But pollution concerns have been backed by several studies. In 2012, scientists found arsenic levels were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254218487_Trace_Element_Concentrations_in_Soil_Sediments_and_Waters_in_the_Vicinity_of_Geita_Gold_Mines_and_North_Mara_Gold_Mines_in_Northwest_Tanzania\">an order of magnitude</a>\u201d higher than the drinking water recommendations by the World Health Organization. Four years later, a <a href=\"http://repository.udsm.ac.tz:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/20.500.11810/4812/NorthMaraGoldMine.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">study of Mara river fish</a> found significantly higher concentrations of chromium, nickel, copper and selenium downstream of the mine than upstream.</p> <p>The co-author of a 2009 report, \u00c5sgeir Alm\u00e5s, said the levels of arsenic and other heavy metals had dramatic consequences for the immediate environment. Although he was not allowed inside the mine, he said he had little doubt about where the contamination came from. \u201cThis was likely caused by a spill from the acid-tailings dam,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that time, they had little control of their leaching. I think the dams were not perfectly constructed.\u201d He said that elsewhere exposure to these chemicals had been found to lead to a skin problem called keratosis, miscarriages and cancer.</p> <p>Acacia says many previous cases were related to a major spill in 2009. Since then, it says, it has put in place remedial measures and found no evidence that livestock deaths were related to pollution.</p> <p>More research is under way by the government\u2019s National Environment Management Council. Earlier this year, Acacia was hit by a $2.4m fine for <a href=\"https://www.acaciamining.com/media/press-releases/2019/2019-01-10.aspx\">alleged pollution</a> at North Mara. The Tanzanian environment minister echoed what locals had long been saying: the tailing storage facility had been releasing contaminated water into the wider area for 10 years. He claimed the dam was not built properly and instructed the company to build an alternative tailings reservoir.</p> <p>Bristow, the South African CEO of Barrick, acknowledged there were problems, but insisted nobody had been contaminated because of the mine.</p> <p>\u201cThe environment is an issue and so we are very disturbed about the environment; so is the government of Tanzania. They have engaged with Acacia; I am engaging with Acacia,\u201d he told Forbidden Stories. </p> <p>In a detailed reply to questions raised by the Guardian, Acacia said it took allegations seriously and would assess claims through its grievance systems. Even before the government\u2019s order, the company said, it was looking into the construction of a new tailings dam.</p> <p>It warns that the dispute threatens the economic future of the Tanzanian people. \u201cAs a company, we are and always have been committed to acting responsibly towards the people of Tanzania, their environment and their communities,\u201d reads a statement on the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.acaciamining.com/export-ban-facts.aspx\">homepage</a>.</p> <p>The mine and its owners are under increasing pressure. Since John Magufuli became president of Tanzania in 2015, he and his ministers have accused Acacia of a raft of irregularities, including environmental breaches. Domestic critics say these measures are a ploy to pressurise the company to contribute more funds to public coffers. </p> <p>Lawsuits are under way in the UK, where Acacia is listed. In 2017, the London law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn filed a second suit on behalf of 10 plaintiffs related to incidents at North Mara between 2013 and 2016.

      "bodyText": "When safari tourists drive to the Serengeti national park in Tanzania, few realise they are passing one of the world\u2019s most contentious goldmines. From the escarpment above the plain, the North Mara facility is so large that it at first resembles a bare hillside. But look closer and the artificial mound is made up of tiers of reddish brown earth, from which a thin grey plume of smoke drifts up to the sky. Nearer still, you find a vast tailings reservoir filled with contaminated wastewater. Locals live in huts under the shadow of its mud and rock banks. Welcome to North Mara, one of the biggest mines in Tanzania, which since 2006 has been operated by London-listed Acacia Mining and predominantly owned by the world\u2019s biggest goldmining company, Barrick, a Toronto-based firm that holds a 63.9% stake. For the past two decades, this mine has been a place of danger, extreme violence and allegations of environmental contamination. Although Tanzania is nominally at peace, over the years police and security guards have been accused of killing dozens \u2013 possibly hundreds \u2013 of local people, injuring many more and raping countless women. There have also been reports of contamination from mining chemicals, but journalists and human rights activists who have tried to investigate these cases have sometimes found themselves the subject of intimidation, harassment and even threats of deportation from police and state authorities. Acacia says it is not involved in any crackdown on the media and it promotes transparency. Since a legal challenge in 2015, the company has worked with authorities to improve the human rights situation. It erected walls in some areas, enhanced staff training, and put in place a grievance system. But an investigation by the Guardian and its partners in the Forbidden Stories journalism collective has been told violence continues \u2013 albeit at a lower level \u2013 while the health problems associated with possible chemical pollution remain a concern. The details have been slow to emerge and remain disputed. Acacia denies any wrongdoing. It is running a vast and remote mine that is a major contributor to the national economy. The disparity of power with local villagers could hardly be greater. Most locals here are from the Kuria indigenous community and many are illiterate. Acacia bought the mine in 2006. It has so far produced 2m ounces of gold, worth $2.6bn at today\u2019s prices, with almost double that amount still underground. But it also inherited violence and widespread resentment. \u2018Police dump the bodies outside the homes\u2019 The original owner, Afrika Mashariki Gold Mines, acquired the land in the mid-1990s, and was accused of evicting residents without compensation. Nearby villagers were forbidden from artisanal mining, which had been an important source of income before the mining company arrived. Locals \u2013 sometimes armed with machetes \u2013 intrude inside the mine to look for granules of gold among the waste rock and on the edge of the tailings pond. The situation is often volatile. On some days, the guards accept bribes and turn a blind eye. On others, they are ordered by their bosses to crack down. The worst period was around 2010-14. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of people get shot, some beside me. We would enter in a group and then run if they see us. We would hear the next day who had died. Police dump the bodies outside the homes,\u201d said one local man who asked to remain anonymous, referring to conflicts at that time. He said tensions remained. \u201cIt happened many times. The villagers get very angry. Why are they treating us like animals?\u201d The nearest general hospital in Tarime was treating five to eight cases of gunshot wounds from the mine every week from around 2010 to 2014, according to Dr Mark Nega, a former district medical officer. \u201cI saw so many people shot and killed. Some had gunshot wounds in the back. I think they were trying to run away but they were shot from behind.\u201d Such killings were initially played down or denied. Journalists who tried to investigate found themselves harassed by police, or believed their stories had been spiked following pressure from state authorities. After pressure from activists and lawyers, Acacia acknowledged 32 \u201ctrespasser-related\u201d fatalities between 2014 and 2017. Of these, six died in confrontations with police at the mine. International watchdog groups say at least 22 were killings by guards and police during the same period. Tanzanian opposition politicians have claimed 300 people have been killed since 1999. \u201cFor such a high number of violations to have occurred outside a conflict zone in a business context is shocking and exceptional,\u201d said Anneke van Woudenberg, the executive director of Raid, a UK corporate watchdog. The owners blame police. \u201cThere have been many, many investigations on various allegations, and you can\u2019t hold me accountable for the state authority,\u201d said the Barrick chief executive, Mark Bristow, when asked about the killings. But the authorities work under a memorandum of understanding with the mine whereby local police work at the service of the mine in return for fuel, food, accommodation and daily stipends. After a lawsuit against the company in 2015 by plaintiffs represented by the UK law firm Leigh Day was settled out of court with no recognition of liability, the number of shootings has declined and no rapes have been reported. There is a new wall around operational areas. The mine and local authorities say they are educating guards and police and punishing those who break the law. Security arrangements have been revised and efforts have been made to improve community relations. The number of conflicts has fallen considerably. But the problem seems far from solved. On a recent trip to the area, the Guardian and Forbidden Stories heard of several new cases. On 3 or 4 August 2017, Daniel Chacha Range was reportedly shot and killed at the Nyabigena waste dump, where he was looking for gold. The mine reportedly paid 72m Tanzanian shillings (\u00a325,000) to the family last March. On 1 December last year, a young student \u2013 Amos Chacha \u2013 was injured by a bullet from security personnel. Locals said he was accidentally hit by a volley that was fired to scare villagers near the mine. In both cases, Acacia said it could not comment on individuals, but its guards did not use lethal weapons and it dealt with human rights abuses by other parties, such as the police, through its grievance mechanism. \u2018It would never happen anywhere in Europe\u2019 Then there are environmental problems that may prove to be Acacia\u2019s enduring legacy long after the gold is mined out. There can be few places in the world where so many people live so close to a vast toxic tailings dam, waste rock dump and chemical processing facility. About 70,000 people live close to the mine, many of them drawn by the prospect of jobs or gold. Walls erected in recent years have improved the situation in some areas, but elsewhere, it is hard to tell where the border is between the village and the mine. Acacia says it has been unable to acquire all the land it needs for a 200-metre buffer zone, but is still trying to do so. \u201cIt has been going on in Tanzania for years,\u201d said Tundu Lissu, a lawyer and activist. \u201cPeople live side by side with the piles of waste from the mine and that is completely illegal in Tanzanian law. It would never happen anywhere in Europe because people simply would not accept that kind of arrangement.\u201d The Earthworks NGO estimates the average gold ring generates 20 tonnes of waste. Heavy metals and other toxins that were previously buried are released into the air and water. Unless carefully managed, this can seep into the soil and rivers with consequences that can last for decades. Locals report frequent spills from the tailings reservoir, including one the week before we arrived. In the past this has caused problems. A doctor, who worked in the general hospital in Tarime for five years until 2010, said he had treated at least 200 people with skin rashes, including 50 children. He also diagnosed an unusually high number of cervical cancer cases even among women without HIV who had never given birth. The doctor, who asked to remain anonymous, said there were three types of skin problems \u2013 a loss of pigmentation, toad-like scales and scurvy-like dryness. He believed the likely cause was chemicals in the mine \u2013 either pollution that leaked into rivers from the tailings pond, or mercury that artisanal miners used with their hands to separate the gold from the rocks. A second doctor said he had dealt with 10 cases of severe skin rashes up until 2014 when he left the area, and many more cases were likely to have been treated by his colleagues. Acacia says previous cases have been thoroughly investigated by the authorities, but it will consider new cases through its grievance mechanism. Villagers appear to have been unaware of the possible risks. Chaina Mwita Bhoke thought she was fortunate when fish started leaping out of the Tigithe River and flapping on the ground in front of her. She cooked some for her family, but soon after her children ate them, she said they were screaming that their skin was on fire. She also suffered. A doctor\u2019s certificate from Nyamongo hospital at that time in 2009 diagnosed skin lesions on her lower limbs caused by \u201ccontamination by poisonous water from North Mara mine\u201d. Others lost their livelihoods. John Nyamboge Ntara, of Matongo village, said that up until September 2017, 168 of his cows had died after grazing on land close to the tailing reservoir. \u201cWe worry for our kids,\u201d he said. Acacia said it had investigated these claims and found no evidence supporting the allegations. But pollution concerns have been backed by several studies. In 2012, scientists found arsenic levels were \u201can order of magnitude\u201d higher than the drinking water recommendations by the World Health Organization. Four years later, a study of Mara river fish found significantly higher concentrations of chromium, nickel, copper and selenium downstream of the mine than upstream. The co-author of a 2009 report, \u00c5sgeir Alm\u00e5s, said the levels of arsenic and other heavy metals had dramatic consequences for the immediate environment. Although he was not allowed inside the mine, he said he had little doubt about where the contamination came from. \u201cThis was likely caused by a spill from the acid-tailings dam,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that time, they had little control of their leaching. I think the dams were not perfectly constructed.\u201d He said that elsewhere exposure to these chemicals had been found to lead to a skin problem called keratosis, miscarriages and cancer. Acacia says many previous cases were related to a major spill in 2009. Since then, it says, it has put in place remedial measures and found no evidence that livestock deaths were related to pollution. More research is under way by the government\u2019s National Environment Management Council. Earlier this year, Acacia was hit by a $2.4m fine for alleged pollution at North Mara. The Tanzanian environment minister echoed what locals had long been saying: the tailing storage facility had been releasing contaminated water into the wider area for 10 years. He claimed the dam was not built properly and instructed the company to build an alternative tailings reservoir. Bristow, the South African CEO of Barrick, acknowledged there were problems, but insisted nobody had been contaminated because of the mine. \u201cThe environment is an issue and so we are very disturbed about the environment; so is the government of Tanzania. They have engaged with Acacia; I am engaging with Acacia,\u201d he told Forbidden Stories. In a detailed reply to questions raised by the Guardian, Acacia said it took allegations seriously and would assess claims through its grievance systems. Even before the government\u2019s order, the company said, it was looking into the construction of a new tailings dam. It warns that the dispute threatens the economic future of the Tanzanian people. \u201cAs a company, we are and always have been committed to acting responsibly towards the people of Tanzania, their environment and their communities,\u201d reads a statement on the company\u2019s homepage. The mine and its owners are under increasing pressure. Since John Magufuli became president of Tanzania in 2015, he and his ministers have accused Acacia of a raft of irregularities, including environmental breaches. Domestic critics say these measures are a ploy to pressurise the company to contribute more funds to public coffers. Lawsuits are under way in the UK, where Acacia is listed. In 2017, the London law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn filed a second suit on behalf of 10 plaintiffs related to incidents at North Mara between 2013 and 2016. They allege Acacia\u2019s in-house grievance process is flawed and compensation payouts are inadequate. Lawyers from a Cardiff-based firm, Hugh James, are in Tanzania meeting another group of potential claimants for a third case. At the annual shareholders\u2019 meeting last week, human rights campaigners called for independent and transparent assessment of grievance claims and an end to the memorandum of understanding with police. The company counters that these measures have helped to alleviate human rights problems in the past two years. \u2018I think they were trying to silence us\u2019 Rape victims are also speaking out about their experiences and the waivers they were encouraged to sign in return for modest sums of compensation. The first was Lucia Marembela Mwita, who was caught by guards in 2009. \u201cThey took me to the airstrip in a car. One raped me. The other kept watch. It became a routine for any women they caught.\u201d Another woman, Nyamhanga Kichele Mwita, was ordered to lift up a large rock and told she would be beaten if she dropped it. As she clasped it, they stripped and raped her. She later found she had HIV. Many of the victims say they kept quiet because they were ashamed to tell their husbands. Boke Makolele still has trouble walking because the guards struck her knees, ankles and the small of her back with a kilungo, or wooden baton. \u201cThey beat me a lot because I didn\u2019t want to do it. After they dumped me, I went to hospital in tears. It hurt so much,\u201d she said. \u201cI never told anyone.

      "bodyText": "Electronics companies, including Canon, Apple and Nokia, are re-evaluating their supply chains following reports they may be using gold extracted from a Tanzanian mine that has been criticised for environmental failures. Over the past 10 years, at the North Mara goldmine \u2013 which is operated by London-listed Acacia Mining \u2013 there have been more than a dozen killings of intruding locals by security personnel. More recently, the Tanzanian government has imposed penalties on the mine and ordered the operators to build an alternative to its tailings reservoir, which is used to store the byproducts of mining. Nokia and Canon said they would review their supply chains in the light of findings from the Green Blood investigation by the Guardian in collaboration with a collective of journalists led by Forbidden Stories. Apple said it was \u201cdeeply committed to the responsible sourcing of materials that go into its products\u201d. Under Tanzanian law, no mine should operate within 200 metres of a home or 100 metres of a farm, but Acacia told the Guardian it had not been able to meet this requirement. The company has built a wall in some areas, improved security training and introduced a grievance mechanism, which have led to a marked reduction in conflict over the past two years, but locals claimed there were still accidents and violence as a result of incursions, and toxic wastewater continued to seep from the mine into residential areas and waterways nearby.

We will follow up on information received, to determine further action, and if allegations are confirmed, this smelter will be red-flagged and we will ask our supply chain to divert business from this smelter.\u201d Canon echoed other companies in noting that the MMTC-PAMP smelter had passed the conflict minerals audit conducted by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). \u201cWe are not aware of any relationship between human rights abuse mining in Tanzania and MMTC-PAMP India. We will carefully review your report after it is published and then consult with the RMI (of which Canon is a member) to take appropriate steps as necessary,\u201d a spokesman said. Apple said: \u201cIf a refiner is unable or unwilling to meet our standards, they will be removed from our supply chain.\u201d The US company said it had stopped working with 60 refiners and would continue investigating and holding supply chains to the highest standards. MMTC-PAMP said it conducted due diligence on every supply chain under its responsible precious metals policy, which aims to tackle human rights abuses, conflict, money laundering, terrorist financing and environmental concerns. In the case of North Mara, the refiner said it was satisfied the mine had taken adequate measures to remediate human rights claims, which were mostly historical and largely related to police operating in the mine. But it recognised that more needed to be done on the environment. \u201cAs part of our ongoing compliance monitoring, we take any new allegation very seriously and immediately contacted the mine to ensure that your allegations refer to known historical facts, except for the recent environmental claim,\u201d said Hitesh Kalia, risk and compliance officer at MMTC-PAMP. \u201cWe have also obtained confirmation from the mine that they are addressing the environmental claim promptly. Finally, it goes without saying that should there be any additional information or allegation that is brought to our attention, we will investigate the same and take the necessary action immediately.\u201d MMTC-PAMP is certified by the London Bullion Market Association, the most prestigious trade association in the industry. Yet there are concerns that scrutiny by such bodies focuses on small-scale miners rather than multinationals, that there is not enough attention to environmental standards and local laws, and that responsibility gets diluted along the supply chain. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is trying to improve transparency. \u201cRight now responsible sourcing is clearly part of the cost of doing business. It\u2019s part of the commercial need of a company to access markets and financing, among others,\u201d said Tyler Gillard, due diligence expert from the OECD.",

      "bodyText": "Greece and Cyprus have urged the European Union to take punitive measures against Turkey amid escalating tensions in the eastern Mediterranean over offshore energy reserves. As Ankara upped the ante by announcing it would expand exploration for potentially lucrative gas resources in the region, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, appealed to the EU \u201cto unreservedly condemn the illegal actions of Turkey\u201d. The appeal came days after a state-of the-art Turkish drilling vessel, the Fatih, launched offshore operations in waters considered part of Cyprus\u2019s exclusive economic zone despite warnings from western allies. A statement released on Tuesday by Tsipras\u2019s office following a telephone conversation between the Greek leader and Donald Tusk, the European council\u2019s president, underscored the severity of a situation that is causing growing alarm among diplomats in Athens, Ankara and Nicosia. Raising the spectre of sanctions, it said: \u201cThe prime minister stressed that the European council should examine specific measures against those involved in these illegal activities if Turkey insists on violating international law.\u201d Nicosia also threatened to veto EU enlargement talks if the bloc failed to take action against Ankara. Cyprus and Turkey have been increasingly at odd over natural gas deposits believed to lie deep in the seabed of the eastern Mediterranean. Last week, the government of the Cypriot president, Nicos Anastasiades , issued arrest warrants for the crew of the Fatih, accusing the ship of infringing on the island republic\u2019s sovereign territory. Senior Turkish diplomats hit back, saying Greek Cypriots had not only \u201ccrossed the line\u201d but were \u201cplaying with fire\u201d.\u201d Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has taken an increasingly strident stance on an issue he believes will play well at a time when the Turkish economy is in freefall and his own authority increasingly questioned in the wake of municipal elections earlier this year. Despite expressions of consternation in Washington and other western capitals, the Turkish leader has warned against foreign oil companies participating in what has become an all-out race to tap underwater hydrocarbons. In a move seen as a brazen act of brinkmanship, Turkey dispatched gunboats to prevent the Italian energy company ENI from conducting drilling operations commissioned by the Cypriot government last year. The company ultimately abandoned the search. The standoff has highlighted the fragility of Cyprus, the EU\u2019s most easterly member and the bloc\u2019s only divided state. As regional powerhouse, Ankara has long argued that areas of Cyprus\u2019s maritime zone, known formally as its exclusive economic zone, fall within the jurisdiction of Turkey and the war-partitioned island\u2019s Turkish Cypriot community. Since 1974, when Cyprus was split permanently along ethnic lines after Turkey invaded in the wake of an abortive attempt at union with Greece, Ankara has refused to acknowledge the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot south. On Sunday, as the war of words escalated following a EU summit meeting that chastised Ankara for its actions, the Turkish foreign ministry hit back, saying: \u201cThese [expressions of support] do not have any value, meaning or effect for us.\u201d The Greek Cypriot government in Nicosia, backed by other EU members, has repeatedly claimed it is Cyprus\u2019s sovereign right to drill in waters around the island.

The government itself says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/09/heathrow-third-runway-noise-affect-people-government-documents\" title=\"\">nearly a million households</a> will be affected by the third runway, which will allow another <a href=\"https://www.aef.org.uk/heathrow-the-vote/\" title=\"\">700 flights a day</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The truth is that aviation growth and our expectation of cheap flights cannot continue</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Heathrow\u2019s owners maintain that the airport\u2019s expansion will not significantly alter the UK\u2019s emissions, but only reach this conclusion by <a href=\"https://aec.heathrowconsultation.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/06/11-Volume-1-PEIR-Chapter-9-Carbon-and-greenhouse-gases.pdf\" title=\"\">excluding international aviation emissions</a>. That suggests they missed another memo, this time from the committee on climate change which has said emissions from international aviation should be formally included in the UK\u2019s climate targets.</p> <p>Carbon pollution from flying in Europe has risen <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/news/airlines-are-biggest-carbon-emitters-four-european-countries\" title=\"\">26% in the past five years</a> \u2013 far outpacing any other transport mode. And, while the UK economy has reduced its carbon emissions by 37% since 1990, CO2 from international aviation has increased by around 130%.</p> <p>The government\u2019s own draft aviation strategy is a perfect example of its have-your-cake-and-eat-it approach. The condition attached to this strategy \u2013 \u201cprovided that growth takes place in a sustainable way, with actions to mitigate the environmental impacts\u201d \u2013 is simply unachievable.</p> <p>The IPCC has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\" title=\"\">already warned us</a> that we have only 11 years left to slash global emissions in half, if we are to achieve the Paris agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C. There is no technological magic wand which is going to transform aviation\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels in this time.</p> <p>We are <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/785685/ata-potential-and-costs-reducting-emissions.pdf\" title=\"\">unlikely to see</a> a single electric aircraft big enough to carry passengers any further than the distances easily reached by train until after 2050. And while new aircraft engines are certainly more efficient than the old ones they replace, the environmental benefit is more than wiped out by the expansion in the number of flights.</p> <p>An official strategy which not only wants to build a third runway at Heathrow but also expand regional airports is not going to rein in airline emissions \u2013 which raises the question of whether the government is serious about reducing the UK\u2019s carbon emissions, let alone reaching net zero. And the plan to rely on international carbon offsets to balance the carbon books (as the legislation allows) is simply deceitful. Carbon offsetting will not deliver the net zero future that the science tells us we need to achieve, since all sectors in all countries will need to get as close as possible to zero emissions, and there\u2019s a limit to how much remaining CO2 we can hope to soak up with new forests.</p> <p>The truth is that aviation growth and our expectation of cheap flights cannot continue. The draft aviation strategy is an opportunity to address this, starting with a commitment to ensuring aviation makes a fair contribution to actual reductions in UK carbon emissions.</p> <p>That means capping aviation emissions at current levels as a first step, cancelling plans for airport expansion, and investing in alternatives so that short- to medium-distance travel by train become attractive and affordable for all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/18/environment-journalists-killed\">What happens to environment journalists is chilling: they get killed for their work | Mark Schapiro</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is not only a carbon emissions issue.

      "bodyText": "The bosses at Heathrow must have been visiting another planet last week, or else they missed the government memo about legislating for net zero emissions by 2050. The plans unveiled today for a 50% expansion in the airport by 2050, including a third runway, all to be done in \u201ca sustainable way\u201d, take dissembling to new levels. Heathrow is already the largest single source of carbon emissions in the UK. The outline plans reveal the scale of what\u2019s proposed: building a tunnel for the M25, rerouting rivers, building enormous carparks outside the perimeter of the current airport, destroying local villages. The government itself says nearly a million households will be affected by the third runway, which will allow another 700 flights a day. Heathrow\u2019s owners maintain that the airport\u2019s expansion will not significantly alter the UK\u2019s emissions, but only reach this conclusion by excluding international aviation emissions. That suggests they missed another memo, this time from the committee on climate change which has said emissions from international aviation should be formally included in the UK\u2019s climate targets. Carbon pollution from flying in Europe has risen 26% in the past five years \u2013 far outpacing any other transport mode. And, while the UK economy has reduced its carbon emissions by 37% since 1990, CO2 from international aviation has increased by around 130%. The government\u2019s own draft aviation strategy is a perfect example of its have-your-cake-and-eat-it approach. The condition attached to this strategy \u2013 \u201cprovided that growth takes place in a sustainable way, with actions to mitigate the environmental impacts\u201d \u2013 is simply unachievable. The IPCC has already warned us that we have only 11 years left to slash global emissions in half, if we are to achieve the Paris agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C. There is no technological magic wand which is going to transform aviation\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels in this time. We are unlikely to see a single electric aircraft big enough to carry passengers any further than the distances easily reached by train until after 2050. And while new aircraft engines are certainly more efficient than the old ones they replace, the environmental benefit is more than wiped out by the expansion in the number of flights. An official strategy which not only wants to build a third runway at Heathrow but also expand regional airports is not going to rein in airline emissions \u2013 which raises the question of whether the government is serious about reducing the UK\u2019s carbon emissions, let alone reaching net zero. And the plan to rely on international carbon offsets to balance the carbon books (as the legislation allows) is simply deceitful. Carbon offsetting will not deliver the net zero future that the science tells us we need to achieve, since all sectors in all countries will need to get as close as possible to zero emissions, and there\u2019s a limit to how much remaining CO2 we can hope to soak up with new forests. The truth is that aviation growth and our expectation of cheap flights cannot continue. The draft aviation strategy is an opportunity to address this, starting with a commitment to ensuring aviation makes a fair contribution to actual reductions in UK carbon emissions. That means capping aviation emissions at current levels as a first step, cancelling plans for airport expansion, and investing in alternatives so that short- to medium-distance travel by train become attractive and affordable for all. This is not only a carbon emissions issue. The unsustainable growth in demand for flights is being driven to a significant extent by a minority of wealthy individuals, raising the issue of inequality and fairness too. About 70% of flights are taken by just 15% of the population, and most people don\u2019t fly at all in any given year. It\u2019s not families taking an occasional holiday or business travellers who are fuelling the growth in demand for flying \u2013 it\u2019s a small minority of wealthy individuals taking multiple flights a year. Yet the harms caused by aviation growth, from noise and air pollution to habitat destruction as airports expand, is felt disproportionately by the less well-off. That\u2019s why policies like the frequent flyer levy must be front and centre of the new aviation strategy, so that social justice and environmental protection go hand in hand. The EU\u2019s transport commissioner Violeta Bulc told airline CEOs this month that the aviation industry\u2019s licence for growth would in future be linked directly to perceptions of sustainability. Heathrow\u2019s owners \u2013 and the government \u2013 need to read that memo too. \u2022 Caroline Lucas is the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion",

      "bodyText": "MESSY ADDICKS The Fiver has never been competitive \u2013 chiefly because in the field of unfunny tea-timely publications about football we\u2019ve never had any competition, apart from that time when The Fourer left us Behind The Times with its alpha-male take on The Footer, but that only made our attempts at humour feel mildly successful. Then there was Hatchet Man, the column that went in hardest. The good old days. So, imagine our surprise when, a little after 5pm on Monday, Charlton Athletic published what at first appeared to be the kind of biting satire we haven\u2019t served up since (um, yeah, we\u2019ll get back to you on that one) \u2026 with its behind-the-scenes take on contract negotiations, replete with passive-aggressive accusations of unrealistic wage demands and the influence of Mr 15%s. Only, it turns out it was a real-life actual football club statement. At some stage on Monday, Charlton owner and serial fan-angerer Roland Duch\u00e2telet started emitting words in the fresh and funky style. \u201cLee [Bowyer, the manager] has been offered a one-year extension to his contract at a level which is approximately three times what he had since his last increase when he became permanent manager in September [2018]. It is six times what he earned when he started as assistant manager in 2017 and 50% more than what any Charlton manager previously had (excluding the Premier League years) \u2026 But Lee wanted much more.\u201d Oof! As kicks to the swingers go to a manager who has just taken the club back into the Championship, it was quite a hefty one. The statement then rambled on about Bowyer\u2019s choice of Mr 15% and hinted at a potential conflict of interest before revealing that the club would look for a new manager unless Bowyer chose to stay. You might think after a public doing-over that could only have been made worse had Bowyer been tarred and feathered while being force-fed \u00a350 notes in The Valley centre-circle [or at one end of the ground due to safety concerns \u2013 Fiver Ed], he\u2019d have launched himself through the door marked Do One. However \u2026 \u201cBowyer stays, the journey continues\u201d cheered an Addicks social media disgrace post on Tuesday morning. \u201cThis has been a long process and I never wanted to leave, I love this club,\u201d sniffed Bowyer. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank the owner for giving me the initial opportunity and now for continuing to believe in me,\u201d he added, after scrawling his signature on a one-year extension. Duch\u00e2telet has form when it comes to getting staff members to work for less than what they feel they are worth and it is not clear whether he has been successful in doing this with Bowyer. But in any case, Duch\u00e2telet\u2019s desperation to flog Charlton as soon as possible means Bowyer might have a new boss soon, one who won\u2019t spit his dummy out at every bump in the road or seriously suggest that the Football League, in which the club competes, should buy the team. Miffed Addicks fans will certainly hope so. But this is football, where good owners are as rare as unfunny tea-timely emails about football. So, don\u2019t hold your breath. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Kieran Pender from 8pm BST for flamin\u2019 MBM coverage of Jamaica 0-3 Straya in the World Cup. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cOf all those that have been either arrested, indicted etc, Michel Platini is the saddest and most depressing: he was a footballer, one of us\u201d \u2013 Gary Lineker reacts to news that banned former chief suit of Uefa, Michel Platini, has been detained in Paris over the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. FIVER LETTERS \u201cIf Paul Pogba wants an improvement in the hygiene standards of European dressing rooms (yesterday\u2019s Fiver), he should start by refraining from airing his dirty laundry in public so often. As I\u2019m sure those nice lads in the nappies would have been only to willing to advise him\u201d \u2013 Justin Kavanagh. \u201cI was surprised to read you would limit yourself to Tin-a Colada on the holiday c0cktail menu.

Imagine my relief (tinged with disappointment?) to come face to face with these charming fellows\u201d \u2013 James Brilliant. \u201cA few years ago in the early days of Google\u2019s search engine, I was working in an advertising agency and needed to find some corporate information about Richard Branson\u2019s collection of companies.

      "body": "<p>Last October, in a balmy Roman autumn, the artist Helen Cammock was making prints at the Istituto Centrale della Grafica. The building sits at the back of, and forms the stage-set for, the Trevi fountain: from its windows you can look down to the crowds of tourists staring up at Oceanus and his tritons.

It was a remarkable time of freedom and adventure. \u201cI have never had space to just focus on making work, ever,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always had loads of jobs \u2013 and most artists do.\u201d The reason for this unexpected period was that she <a href=\"https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/about/press/mmap-helencammock/\">won the Max Mara award</a>, which recognises women artists based in the UK. The prize is a tailor-made six-month residency in Italy, followed by exhibitions at the <a href=\"https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/\">Whitechapel Gallery</a> in London and the <a href=\"http://www.collezionemaramotti.org/en\">Collezione Maramotti</a> \u2013 the museum in Reggio Emilia established by Max Mara\u2019s founder, Achille Maramotti.

Before that, she spent a decade in social work in Brighton. She was utterly committed, she tells me, and the work was rewarding \u2013 at least for the first eight years or so. But in the late 1990s, when services were being cut, she became disillusioned. \u201cA couple of times I was putting young people in situations I wasn\u2019t comfortable with,\u201d she says. \u201cI was asked to take a 13-year-old, who had been thrown out by her mother and had no other family, and leave her on her own outside a police station rather than take her inside \u2013 because if I left her outside, the police would have to pay for a place to sleep and if I took her in, social services would have to pay. I was in the car with her, and she was crying and saying, \u2018Helen, don\u2019t leave me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She refused to leave the girl, and had to confront her boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss. It was a turning point. \u201cI thought, \u2018This is it.\u2019 But while I was thinking that I did evening classes in photography. And at the university in Brighton they used to do this thing called Saturday art school, which was a completely different level of teaching, of working with the camera. And I thought, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m going to do this. So I left statutory services. And I did a BA.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>While she was studying, she was still running a multi-agency centre on an estate in Brighton; and even now, though she feels it may be time to stop, she sits on a panel that makes recommendations about the suitability of potential foster carers. After her degree, she was invited to run the <a href=\"https://photofringe.org/\">Brighton Photo Fringe</a>; it was there that a tutor from the Royal College of Art saw a film of hers, left his card at the desk, and suggested she come and study with him. For the work, Character Building, she filmed places where she recalled acts of racism directed at her family from her earliest childhood \u2013 her mother, who was white, being called a \u201cnigger lover\u201d outside Ealing Town Hall; a man coming up to her mother in a Somerset car park and asking, of Cammock and her sister, \u201cWhere did you get them?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"546246851b8527d23b492e6d83a1db0f6365bc08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/546246851b8527d23b492e6d83a1db0f6365bc08/73_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Chorus, part of Che Si Pu\u00f2 Fare by Helen Cammock.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Everything is about me wanting to say something\u2019 \u2026 A still from Chorus, part of Che Si Pu\u00f2 Fare by Cammock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Cammock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She was still working at the Photo Fringe when studying, and ran herself ragged; one of her tutors took her aside and told her to step back, and just try to write something every day. \u201cThat was hugely important, because I started to believe I could write. It underpins everything, it\u2019s the core of everything. Text is everywhere \u2013 not story like a linear narrative but me wanting to say something. Everything is about me wanting to say something.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about confidence. In my 20s, when I was desperately trying to find something creative, I had this huge hole. I started to write a novel. Then I got burgled and they took my laptop and it was all gone. I didn\u2019t want to write again for a while. So I bought some canvas and some acrylic paints. And it was about making marks, about using colour and form. I didn\u2019t take it seriously and I wouldn\u2019t paint now. But now I trust the marks I make and I don\u2019t have to apologise for them.\u201d</p> <p>Her late-blooming confidence in mark-making was apparent in Rome, where she was making etchings in concise, flowing lines for her book. On other legs of her tour she was taking Italian lessons with migrants in Palermo; working with a choreographer in Florence; filming a performance on <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v20/n13/charles-nicholl/screaming-in-the-castle-the-case-of-beatrice-cenci\">Beatrice Cenci</a>\u2019s spinet in Bologna (Cenci was beheaded for murdering her rapist father in 1599); running workshops for migrant women in Reggio Emilia; and taking classical singing lessons in Venice so she could learn music by the great baroque composer <a href=\"https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/barbara-strozzi/\">Barbara Strozzi</a>.

Her mother took her to play at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/folk\">folk club</a> one night, which, she hadn\u2019t realised, was on the West Country touring circuit. She was spotted by a promoter \u2013 and began a teenage life of performing, being driven around clubs in south-west England, chaperoned by her mum.

The name Libra comes from the basic Roman measurement of weight. The abbreviation lb for pound is derived from Libra, and the \u00a3 symbol originally comes from an ornate L in Libra.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is Facebook launching a cryptocurrency?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Facebook claims it wants to reach the 1.7 billion people around the world who do not have access to a bank account.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who is in charge of Libra?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Facebook is likely to run into regulatory hurdles and antitrust concerns. The currency will be serviced by a collective of companies called the 'Libra Association'. It functions as what is known as a 'stablecoin', pegged to existing assets like the dollar or euro, in the aim of making it less subject to the volatility that many cryptocurrencies experience.</p>\n    <p>The Libra Association is described by Facebook as an independent, not-for-profit organisation based in Switzerland. Within the Libra Association will be a governing body called the Libra Association Council, comprised of a representative of each member of the association, which will vote on policy and operating decisions.</p>\n    <p>Facebook claims that although it created the Libra Association and the Libra Blockchain, once the currency is launched in 2020 the company will withdraw from a leadership role and all members of the association will have equal votes in governance of Libra. The companies who contributed a minimum of $10m(\u00a38m) to be listed as founding members of the Libra Association include tech companies such as PayPal, Ebay, Spotify, Uber and Lyft, as well as financial and venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Visa and Mastercard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>However in October 2019 several of the companies that had been backing the initiative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/11/payment-firms-back-out-in-painful-blow-to-facebooks-cryptocurrency-libra\">announced that they were pulling out</a>, including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Stripe.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How and when can I use it?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>With regulators asking questions and backing companies dropping out, it is unclear now if Libra is still viable. Facebook's original plans were that users could download Calibra, a digital wallet, that would allow them to send the currency to anyone with a smartphone. It is no longer clear which countries the coin will launch in first, if at all, though Facebook had said 'almost anybody' in the world with a smartphone would be able to download the app.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kari-paul\"><b>Kari Paul</b></a>&nbsp;in <i>San Francisco</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet the second ambition is more important: the creation of a new global currency, albeit one backed by reserves held in established major currencies, plus a loose promise-cum-threat that the arrival of Libra is \u201cjust the beginning\u201d.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s clearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/18/facebook-libra-launch-cryptocurrency\">directly helpful for Facebook</a> if its 2.5 billion users can be cajoled into adopting Libra for buying goods on Instagram\u2019s shopping service, for example.

It would be absurd if those efforts are sent into reverse by a tech firm\u2019s dream of a \u201cglobal currency\u201d, an idea that no central bank has yet deemed desirable.

      "bodyText": "The parent company of British Airways has announced plans to buy 200 Boeing 737 Max aircraft, the first new sales deal for the passenger jet since it was grounded because of safety fears after two crashes. The short-haul planes would be delivered between 2023 and 2027 and shared among International Airlines Group\u2019s carriers, including Vueling, the low-cost venture Level, and BA, for its flights out of London Gatwick airport. IAG and Boeing revealed a \u201cletter of intent\u201d for the huge order at the Paris airshow, in a significant boost to the US manufacturer after its rival Airbus appeared to be stealing a march on it with big orders and the launch of a competing model. The fleet of planes, a mixture of 737 Max 8 and Max 10 variants, would be valued at about $25bn (\u00a320bn) at list prices but IAG said it had secured a substantial discount, likely to be more than usual considering Boeing\u2019s difficult circumstances. The deal will be seen as a crucial vote of confidence in the troubled airplane. Although more than 5,000 have been ordered, the IAG deal is the first sale of any kind for the 737 Max since it was grounded worldwide in March. Investigators suspected faulty Boeing software was behind the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air disasters that killed 346 people. Willie Walsh, the IAG chief executive, said: \u201cWe have every confidence in Boeing and expect that the aircraft will make a successful return to service in the coming months having received approval from the regulators.\u201d Walsh, a former 737 pilot himself, told reporters in Paris that he would have \u201cno hesitation\u201d in flying on the plane, and voiced confidence in its safety. The manufacturer is still in negotiations with regulators to get a modified version of the plane flying again. Although investigations into the two 737 Max disasters are continuing, problems with sensors and the anti-stall software known as MCAS are believed to have caused both the Ethiopian and Indonesian planes to crash. Pilots in the US have accused Boeing of failing to adequately notify them of changes in the way the aircraft automatically adjusted its angle. No timeline for its return to service has been confirmed but it is expected to be at least August before regulators worldwide agree to lift the ban, should Boeing\u2019s proposed fixes be approved. As well as affirming faith in the 737 Max, the IAG order will have given a boost to Boeing as rival Airbus led the way at the Paris airshow, having unveiled the A321XLR aircraft on Monday. Airbus followed up with a string of announcements of orders for the new plane, a long-range version of its top-selling single-aisle jet. IAG was also among the customers for the A321XLR, placing a firm order for eight planes for Iberia and six for Aer Lingus, plus an option for 14 more. The deal, potentially worth almost $4bn, will see first deliveries in 2023. IAG said each plane will have fully flat seats in a small business cabin and have much the same inflight amenities as traditional, wide-body transatlantic jets.

      "body": "<p>Cyclists have called for a boycott of businesses advertising in a magazine that suggested stringing up razor wire to garrotte people riding bikes on the pavement.</p> <p>The editorial in Grapevine magazine, which is delivered free to 23,000 houses in Sheffield each month, recounted a conversation between the editor, Ian Macgill, and an \u201cold chum\u201d in which the latter said pavement cyclists needed to be \u201ctaught a lesson\u201d using wire at head height.</p> <p>In the article, Macgill said he objected to the idea on the grounds that cyclists may be decapitated \u201cand the pavements will become covered in red slime and gore, which will cause all sorts of health and safety hazards\u201d. He might slip and hurt himself leaving the Grapevine office, he said.</p> <p>Contacted by the Guardian, Macgill said it was just \u201ca piece of whimsy\u201d. \u201cTell people who complained that I\u2019m probably going to recommend landmines next time,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The remarks have gone down badly among the local cycling community. \u201cThis kind of comment \u2013 joking or otherwise \u2013 legitimises the anti-cyclist hatred and rhetoric that groups like Ride Sheffield, Peak District MTB and me \u2013 as well as others such as CycleSheffield have worked hard \u2013 successfully I might add \u2013 to combat,\u201d wrote Chris Maloney on his <a href=\"https://kofthep.com/2019/06/16/i-heard-it-through-the-grapevine-sorry-marvin/\">Keeper of the Peak blog</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMore than that, as well as legitimising the bile, Macgill has gone one step further and suggested ways in which an easily led idiot could cause serious bodily harm. It\u2019s not surprising that there have been a number of people calling for the police to be involved,\u201d Maloney added.</p> <p>He claims acts of \u201ctrail sabotage\u201d \u2013 where routes are booby-trapped with wire or other objects \u2013 are a regular hazard for mountain bikers in Sheffield and beyond. \u201cIf Macgill were even remotely aware of the almost weekly examples of trail sabotage cyclists see he\u2019d have realised just how poor taste his ridiculous column is,\u201d wrote Maloney. \u201cPerhaps he could imagine his kids or grandkids being on the receiving end.\u201d</p> <p>Maloney printed a list of businesses advertising in Grapevine \u2013 which include the Foundry Climbing Centre and wedding venue Tapton Hall \u2013 \u201cshould you wish to make an educated decision on where you next spend your cash\u201d.</p> <p>People then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndyWood10/status/1140508797909262336\">contacted</a> the businesses online to suggest they not advertise with Grapevine again.</p> <p>A number of cyclists across the UK have been hurt by wires in recent years. In Manchester in 2016 Adam Hoult was <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/stretford-dad-scarred-life-after-11616764\">\u201cnearly decapitated</a>\u201d after being caught by a booby trap tripwire on a popular route in Stretford. He was left with a crushed oesophagus and severe burns around his neck which he feared at the time could scar him for life.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/half-car-drivers-think-cyclists-not-fully-human-according-new-study-411816#rMRzIumW1J7UK3lh.99\">A survey </a>of Australian drivers earlier this year suggested more than half think cyclists are not completely human, making it easier to justify hatred or aggression towards them.</p> <p>Macgill was unrepentant and suggested the advertising boycott would not work. He repeated a call from the magazine to make number plates mandatory on bikes \u201cso that we can photograph and report cyclists if they are cycling on the pavement\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cyclists have called for a boycott of businesses advertising in a magazine that suggested stringing up razor wire to garrotte people riding bikes on the pavement. The editorial in Grapevine magazine, which is delivered free to 23,000 houses in Sheffield each month, recounted a conversation between the editor, Ian Macgill, and an \u201cold chum\u201d in which the latter said pavement cyclists needed to be \u201ctaught a lesson\u201d using wire at head height. In the article, Macgill said he objected to the idea on the grounds that cyclists may be decapitated \u201cand the pavements will become covered in red slime and gore, which will cause all sorts of health and safety hazards\u201d. He might slip and hurt himself leaving the Grapevine office, he said. Contacted by the Guardian, Macgill said it was just \u201ca piece of whimsy\u201d. \u201cTell people who complained that I\u2019m probably going to recommend landmines next time,\u201d he said. The remarks have gone down badly among the local cycling community. \u201cThis kind of comment \u2013 joking or otherwise \u2013 legitimises the anti-cyclist hatred and rhetoric that groups like Ride Sheffield, Peak District MTB and me \u2013 as well as others such as CycleSheffield have worked hard \u2013 successfully I might add \u2013 to combat,\u201d wrote Chris Maloney on his Keeper of the Peak blog. \u201cMore than that, as well as legitimising the bile, Macgill has gone one step further and suggested ways in which an easily led idiot could cause serious bodily harm. It\u2019s not surprising that there have been a number of people calling for the police to be involved,\u201d Maloney added. He claims acts of \u201ctrail sabotage\u201d \u2013 where routes are booby-trapped with wire or other objects \u2013 are a regular hazard for mountain bikers in Sheffield and beyond. \u201cIf Macgill were even remotely aware of the almost weekly examples of trail sabotage cyclists see he\u2019d have realised just how poor taste his ridiculous column is,\u201d wrote Maloney. \u201cPerhaps he could imagine his kids or grandkids being on the receiving end.\u201d Maloney printed a list of businesses advertising in Grapevine \u2013 which include the Foundry Climbing Centre and wedding venue Tapton Hall \u2013 \u201cshould you wish to make an educated decision on where you next spend your cash\u201d. People then contacted the businesses online to suggest they not advertise with Grapevine again. A number of cyclists across the UK have been hurt by wires in recent years. In Manchester in 2016 Adam Hoult was \u201cnearly decapitated\u201d after being caught by a booby trap tripwire on a popular route in Stretford. He was left with a crushed oesophagus and severe burns around his neck which he feared at the time could scar him for life. A survey of Australian drivers earlier this year suggested more than half think cyclists are not completely human, making it easier to justify hatred or aggression towards them. Macgill was unrepentant and suggested the advertising boycott would not work. He repeated a call from the magazine to make number plates mandatory on bikes \u201cso that we can photograph and report cyclists if they are cycling on the pavement\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The sophistication of the attacks on two shipping tankers in the Gulf of Oman last week had already led most independent analysts to conclude Iran was responsible for the high-profile explosions. But there has been scepticism from some key countries, including Germany and Japan, after the US initially released a grainy black and white video it said showed Iranian forces removing an unexploded mine from one of the two targeted ships. Iran has denied involvement. The fresh set of colour images released by the US Department of Defense overnight add a little more visual clarity to the diplomatic debate, including an image of an armed speedboat with troops in red life-jackets on board, and life-jacketed personnel by the side of the Japanese vessel that was struck last week. But the principal evidence used to justify Iranian involvement has been the method employed. The two tankers were mined above the waterline \u2013 damaging them, but not sinking them \u2013 prompting the conclusion the actions were designed to make a point. There were no fatalities in either case, with both crews rescued. Jack Watling, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said the attacks were \u201cvery precise, to avoid the risk of an oil spill\u201d, to make the point that \u201cIran can impose a cost on the United States, and that the US can\u2019t police the waterway around the strait of Hormuz\u201d.

The wider argument used to justify Iran\u2019s involvement is that it would make sense as a response by the country to what it perceives as the economic warfare waged by the US in withdrawing from the nuclear deal and imposing sanctions. \u201cThe status quo for Iran is unacceptable,\u201d Watling said.

But he acknowledged the evidence so far suggested it was probable Iran was directly involved. \u201cThey would likely be attempting to strengthen their hand in this standoff by demonstrating their ability to impose costs on their opponents,\u201d the analyst added. The release of the images was followed by the announcement that the US was sending another 1,000 troops to the Middle East, a modest show of strength designed to reinforce Washington\u2019s argument about culpability. A British assessment has also concluded Iranian forces were responsible for the tanker attacks, but there is not understood to be any immediate plans for the UK to step up its military commitment to the region. Watling believes Tehran can avoid further recrimination \u201cas long as there is sufficient ambiguity\u201d, partly because few believe that Donald Trump, who campaigned on an isolationist agenda, wants war \u2013 and because the backing obtained from other countries remains limited.",

      "bodyText": "Mario Draghi made a market-moving speech this morning, signalling the European Central Bank is ready to cut eurozone rates and start buying bonds again. Markets are now pricing in further stimulus. Here are the key quotes from his speech at the ECB\u2019s forum on central banking in Sintra, Portugal: Further cuts in policy interest rates and mitigating measures to contain any side effects remain part of our tools. And the APP (asset purchase program) still has considerable headroom. If the crisis has shown anything, it is that we will use all the flexibility within our mandate to fulfil our mandate \u2014 and we will do so again to answer any challenges to price stability in the future. Draghi\u2019s comments triggered a jump in European markets - in a reversal of earlier losses - with Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 up 1.3% at 383. The FTSE 100 is up 1.4% or 105 points at 7,461. His comments also triggered a drop in the euro, which angered President Trump: Trump has since turned his attentions to China, in more positive comments that are likely to further boost markets: In other news, Facebook announced that it intends to launch its own digital currency, Libra, in 2020. Read our full story on that here. That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for all the comments and please join us again tomorrow. The opening bell has rung on Wall Street and US markets are up: Dow Jones: +0.6+% at 26,269.91 S&amp;P 500: +0.6% at 2,907.63 Nasdaq: +0.9% at 7,916.64 Here in the UK, the once star stock-picker Neil Woodford is under renewed pressure after Fidelity banned its customers from putting new money into a second Woodford fund. Read the full story here: Over in the US, house building slowed in May. Figures from the Commerce Department showed housing starts fell 0.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.269 million homes, amid a drop in the construction of single family housing units. However, data for April was revised up to show 1.281 million homes were started, and not 1.235 million as initially estimated. Markets have received Mario Draghi\u2019s message loud and clear and are now pricing in more stimulus. This is putting a spring in the step of investors across Europe: FTSE 100: +1.2% at 7,442 Germany\u2019s DAX: +1.7% at 12,295 France\u2019s CAC: +1.8% at 5,490 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +2% at 21,036 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.9% at 9,211 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +1.3% at 383 Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, says Mario Draghi was keen to hammer home his message to investors that rate cuts and/or more bond purchases are coming when he spoke earlier in Sintra: Mr Draghi\u2019s speech at the ECB\u2019s conference this morning is the clearest indication yet that the Bank will cut interest rates and relaunch its asset purchase programme in the coming months if, as we expect, measures of inflation and inflation expectations remain very low. The media reported that ECB policymakers were \u201cfrustrated\u201d that investors did not respond to Mr Draghi\u2019s dovish press conference earlier in the month. So he evidently decided to set out the Bank\u2019s plans in words of one syllable today, and this time investors have taken the hint: the euro and Bund yields fell sharply in response. Eurozone inflation fell to 1.2% in May from 1.7% in April, final figures from the Eurostat statistics agency showed. It was the lowest rate in more than a year, and served to strengthen expectations that the European Central Bank will soon inject fresh stimulus into the single currency bloc\u2019s economy. The US President\u2019s comments come a day ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest policy decision. Trump has repeatedly made it clear that he would like to see the Fed cut rates, saying the US economy had the potential to \u201cgo up like a rocket\u201d if borrowing costs were lowered. Thus far Fed chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have resisted his calls and are expected to leave rates unchanged again on Wednesday. But for how long? Ipek Ozkardeskaya at London Capital Group comments: The Fed will give its policy verdict on Wednesday and is expected to maintain its policy unchanged. However, markets are obsessed with the Fed\u2019s next move, since the Fed Governor Jerome Powell said that they are ready to cut the interest rates, if needed. The Fed expectations sharply moved from \u2018patient\u2019 to two-to-three rate cuts within the next twelve months. Now it is time to see whether Powell meant such a drastic policy shift. One thing is clear, the market is positioned for a dovish Fed. The question is, will the Fed sound as dovish as expected by the market? Trump adds: Donald Trump is not happy about Mario Draghi\u2019s suggestion that the ECB will cut eurozone rates. Specifically, he says the resulting drop in the euro puts the US at a disadvantage: Bart Hordijk, a currency analyst at Monex Europe, says that markets are now firmly expecting a rate cut after Mario Draghi\u2019s comments this morning in Sintra: The rate cutting genie is out of the bottle for the European Central Bank after Mario Draghi this morning mentioned that further cuts in the policy rate remain part of ECB\u2019s toolkit. A full ECB rate cut is now priced in by futures markets for 2019 after Draghi showed his concerns about the persistently low inflation in the eurozone and the lingering risks to growth. Also, the ECB President mentioned there is \u201cconsiderable headroom\u201d regarding the asset purchase programme, indicating the ECB armoury is far from exhausted. The euro has fallen after Mario Draghi signalled that the European Central Bank is ready to pump fresh stimulus into the eurozone economy, with more rate cuts and/or bond purchases. The euro is down 0.3% against the dollar at $1.185, and down 0.2% against the pound at 89.28p. The whitepaper on Libra says it will be built on the foundation of blockchain technology, and outlines just how ambitious the plans are: People will be able to send, receive, spend, and secure their money, enabling a more inclusive global financial system. The aim is to make Libra as widely accepted and as easy to use as possible to create a currency that people can use with confidence and convenience in their everyday lives. Backers include PayPal, Spotify, Uber, Lyft, Ebay, Visa and Vodafone. When Libra is launched, users will be able to download Calibra, a digital wallet that will be available in Messenger, WhatsApp, and as a standalone app. Here is our Q&amp;A on what we can expect from Facebook\u2019s ambitious move into cryptocurrencies: Here is our full story on Facebook\u2019s Libra launch: Breaking: Facebook has announced plans to launch its own cryptocurrency in 2020. The currency will be named Libra and will allow the social media site\u2019s billions of users to make financial transactions around the world. It marks a major strategic shift for Facebook, as it seeks to expand beyond social networking and into e-commerce and global payments. More soon... European markets are making notable gains - reversing earlier falls - after Mario Draghi hinted that more interest rate cuts and bond purchases could be on the horizon. Neil Wilson, analyst at markets.com, says the central bank governor is now in \u201cfull dove mode\u201d. He adds: The towel has been thrown in. Building on the last ECB meeting, at which some members discussed reopening quantitative easing, this looks like a clear signal that the central bank is preparing markets to expect monetary policy to become more accommodative this year. Markets across Europe: FTSE 100: +0.5% at 7,394 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.6% at 12,160 France\u2019s CAC: +0.9% at 5,441 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.9% at 20,815 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.2% at 9,153 Mario Draghi has raised expectations that the European Central Bank will pump more stimulus into the eurozone economy. Speaking in Sintra at the ECB\u2019s forum on central banking, Draghi said the door was still open to rate cuts and/or further bond purchases: Further cuts in policy interest rates and mitigating measures to contain any side effects remain part of our tools. And the APP (asset purchase program) still has considerable headroom. If the crisis has shown anything, it is that we will use all the flexibility within our mandate to fulfil our mandate \u2014 and we will do so again to answer any challenges to price stability in the future. Read his full speech here. European markets are mixed this morning. Mining stocks are providing a modest to the FTSE 100, which is up 16 points or 0.2% at 7,374. Elsewhere: Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.7% at 12,006 France\u2019s CAC: +0.1% at 5,395 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.6% at 20,740 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.6% at 9,079 Heathrow has published details of its controversial plans for a third runway, which include lowering part of the M25 so that the runway can cross it, rerouting rivers and relocating huge car parks. The publication marks the beginning of a 12-week public consultation on the plans, which are opposed by climate campaigners who warn of the damaging impact that 700 extra planes will have when the runway is due to open in 2026. Read our full story here: One major opponent to the Heathrow expansion plans is Boris Johnson, the former London mayor and favourite to be the UK\u2019s next prime minister. On his return to parliament in 2015, he vowed that if it came to it, he would lie \u201cin front of those bulldozers and stop the building, stop the construction of that third runway\u201d. On day two of the Paris air show, Bloomberg gives a handy summary of some of the key themes: Here is how the European car industry has fared in recent months: The VW Group continues to have the largest share of the new car sales market in Europe, at just under 25% in May. It is followed by the PSA Group with 17% and Renault with 11%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. New car sales in Europe rose 0.1% in May to 1.4m, ending a run of eight successive months of decline, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. It was hardly a major leap in demand but will be encouraging nonetheless for an industry under serious pressure from a tough consumer backdrop, tighter emissions rules, and the challenges posed by the shift to electric cars and driverless technology. A breakdown of the figures shows a mixed picture for western Europe\u2019s five biggest markets, with sales up in Germany (+9.1%) and France (+1.2%) but down in Spain (-7.3%), the UK (-4.6%) and Italy (-1.2%). The modest rise in May was not enough to halt the trend of falling sales in the year to date, with new car sales in the EU down 2.1% between January and May, compared with the same period in 2018. Germany is the only one of the five big EU markets to post a rise over the period. Also coming up... Facebook is expected to say it is launching its own cryptocurrency, called Libra. It will mark a major shift in strategy for the social network site, and markets and investors will be closely watching as Mark Zuckerberg reveals the details of his latest move. We will bring you the news as it breaks. Heathrow has published the details of its planned (and hugely controversial) third runway as it begins the latest consultation stage. More on that soon.

      "body": "<p>Richard\u2019s colleagues call him their work therapist. He\u2019s empathetic and a good listener, he says \u2013 \u201cso a lot of people tell me about their personal shit\u201d, including the people he works with at his retail management job in the south-eastern US. But when they complain to him about their sex lives, or he sees happy couples hand-in-hand in the shop, \u201cI think: \u2018That\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to happen for me.\u2019\u201d At 31, Richard is a virgin.</p> <p>If it seems as though taboos about sex have lifted in these ostensibly open-minded times, there is one that holds steady: the stigma over never having had sex. While it has become widely unacceptable to criticise someone for having too many partners, being a virgin \u201cstill seems to be something that can be only mocked or shamed or suspect\u201d, says Richard.</p> <p>It may be that later-in-life virginity is dismissed as a problem with an easy fix. Cath Mercer, a principal investigator on the <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/global-health/national-survey-sexual-attitudes-and-lifestyles\" title=\"\">Natsal survey</a> of sexual attitudes and lifestyles in Britain, says the vast majority (95%) of the general population report have made their \u201csexual debut\u201d \u2013 as she rather grandly puts it \u2013 by age 25. And the most recent data available, from 2010-12, suggests that just 2.2% of British men and 1.1% of women were virgins at the age of 30.</p> <p>Yet there are many reasons that a thirty or fortysomething might never have had sex, says Libby, a 37-year-old Canadian. \u201cIt could be tied to mental health issues, ranging from low self-esteem and social anxiety to serious depression. It could be due to a childhood of abuse, or physical health issues like cerebral palsy, or a religious upbringing, or even lack of comprehensive sex education.\u201d</p> <p>Libby connects her virginity to her personality traits (\u201ccynical, private, loud, opinionated and chubby \u2013 though my friends would say I\u2019m being too hard on myself\u201d) and her 10-year struggle with depression and anxiety. \u201cWhen I was sick, I could barely get out of bed, let alone put myself out there to potential partners.\u201d</p> <p>When she was well, she found that medication \u2013 for her mental health, and oral contraceptives to mitigate her very painful periods \u2013 wiped out her libido. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t have the drive, sex isn\u2019t something you pursue,\u201d says Libby. \u201cI don\u2019t blame drugs entirely \u2013 as I said, I never put much effort into dating and sex \u2013 but I do think they play a large part in my story.\u201d</p> <p>Richard also identifies poor mental health as a factor in his virginity. He is now on antidepressants and \u2013 following substance abuse in his 20s \u2013 sober. He guesses that his religious upbringing \u2013 where sex was not discussed beyond \u201cDon\u2019t do it\u201d \u2013 was also influential. But, maybe counterintuitively, he says the reason he has not had sex is that, to him, it\u2019s not just about sex. \u201cIf that was all I wanted to accomplish, I would\u2019ve just gone out and got it over with a long time ago.\u201d He has had \u201ca handful\u201d of chances to lose his virginity, but drunken opportunities at parties when he was younger \u201cjust didn\u2019t feel right\u201d, and his subsequent sobriety put an end to those.</p> <p>Dating apps are no solution \u2013 for him or many others. As Libby puts it: \u201cIf someone is still a virgin after 30, they likely have some issues tied to it, none of which will be solved with a swipe to the right and a random hookup.\u201d</p> <p>Although Richard describes himself as introverted and afraid of intimacy and rejection, he says the reason he struggles to approach strangers cold is \u201cnot because I\u2019m desperate \u2013 it\u2019s because I\u2019m not that desperate\u201d. He is articulate, even wryly humorous, about his virginity, even as he says it causes him day-to-day unhappiness. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to date with an STD that\u2019s not contagious and easily curable, but still puts people off.\u201d</p> <p>Although he desires a relationship more than sex, he says that at a certain point his status can become self-perpetuating. \u201cAt my age, it becomes a red flag for people. I don\u2019t really have interpersonal romantic experience, not even just on a physical level, but on an emotional level, too.\u201d</p> <p>He rejects the stereotype that lack of sexual experience extends to life experience (in the style of Steve Carrell\u2019s naive 40-Year-Old Virgin). \u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot, even for a regular person.\u201d Nor is he a \u201cmopey neckbeard or, even worse, incel\u201d \u2013 the group of overwhelmingly misogynistic men <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/25/raw-hatred-why-incel-movement-targets-terrorises-women\" title=\"\">who blam</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/25/raw-hatred-why-incel-movement-targets-terrorises-women\" title=\"\">e women</a> for their poor sex lives.</p> <p>A few years ago, Richard went to see a sex therapist, but never returned. \u201cHe asked me \u2013 and this will always stick in my head \u2013 \u2018Why don\u2019t you just pay someone if you want to have sex?\u2019 \u201cI said: \u2018Well, I want someone to want me, I want to want them, I want us to want to do this.\u2019 He got really indignant. \u2018It\u2019s just sex \u2013 you need to get over yourself.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The thing is, says Richard, \u201cyou don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to judge you for it or who won\u2019t. There\u2019s no way to tell.\u201d</p> <p>The therapist spent the rest of the hour practising a mindfulness technique, says Richard. \u201c\u2018Like, \u2018Tell me what you think of yourself with regards to relationships \u2013 what would you be without this thought?\u2019 I thought: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t be in your office right now, paying you $200.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Three years ago Richard was pursued by a woman who retreated after learning, via a game of 20 questions over text, that he was a virgin. \u201cWhen I kind of pried, she said that she thought that she would \u2018ruin\u2019 me.\u201d That response is not uncommon, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re dictating your sexuality for you, in a way \u2013 what you are and aren\u2019t ready for, what you can handle emotionally, just based on that one titbit about you.\u201d</p> <p>Julia, from Los Angeles, also comes up against preconceptions. At 31 going on 32, she is an evangelical Christian and still a virgin, as is her boyfriend. People in secular circles are surprised to learn they have never had sex \u2013 \u201cMy boyfriend\u2019s business partner wondered if he\u2019s secretly gay since we\u2019re not doing it\u201d \u2013 but then so are some Christians. These days, she says, most young evangelicals have premarital sex (or rush into marriage). \u201cI was actually surprised that my boyfriend is a virgin \u2013 that\u2019s how common it is.\u201d</p> <p>It is not easy staying chaste, Julia says \u2013 \u201cwe have to be proactively careful about that\u201d, particularly when they are travelling together \u2013 but their church community keeps them accountable. \u201cAnd I have a very full and rich life as a virgin.\u201d</p> <p>That said, she and her boyfriend are seriously discussing marriage; she\u2019s already warned him that they are going to \u201chave sex every day, seven days a week\u201d (although the novelty may wear off, she concedes). \u201cI\u2019m excited to have sex with my future husband. What we lack in experience, we\u2019ll learn together.\u201d</p> <p>But, Julia agrees, as a virgin by choice she is an anomaly. For others the hurdles can seem insurmountable.</p> <p>Jim, a 35-year-old from East Sussex, has never been kissed. He had few friends in secondary school, where his confidence was shot by bullying, and his social circle has dwindled since then. Like Richard, he is sober, thereby missing out on pubs and clubs \u2013 \u201cthe main route for kids in the 90s to have gotten together with someone\u201d. He works in IT, a male-dominated industry, and although he has some hobbies (archery, rock-climbing) he feels women there aren\u2019t open to being approached, if he even knew how. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to seem unwelcome or forceful.\u201d</p> <p>Holding him back, he says, are absence of opportunity, his looks (he describes himself as in shape but balding, and \u201cjust not nice-looking\u201d), his shyness and his lack of self-confidence \u2013 which worsens with each passing year.</p> <p>He has never told anyone that he is a virgin. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that has come up. If it did, I would probably lie and say that I had sex when I was 16 or 18 but that I haven\u2019t had it in ages. It\u2019s never having been in a relationship that bothers me more.\u201d For that reason, he says, he decided against going to a sex worker when he considered it a few years ago. \u201cI got to thinking that if I paid for it, that would probably make me feel even more worthless.\u201d</p> <p>Sex, as he sees it, is a destination, but he is more interested in the journey. \u201cIt\u2019s the getting a girlfriend, a partner \u2013 going to places with someone, who you can talk about your day with, and they\u2019ll be listening. \u2018Virgin\u2019 is the easiest tag to apply, but there\u2019s more to it than that. It\u2019s an experience that\u2019s been missing from me, and from other people.\u201d</p> <p>It bothers him more some days than it does others, he says \u2013 but the number of times he has avoided a town centre because of not wanting to see couples is \u201cworryingly high\u201d. Richard says something similar. \u201cWhen I meet someone or see someone I find attractive, instead of feeling a little spark, there\u2019s just a feeling in the pit in my stomach that says: \u2018Nothing\u2019s ever going to happen.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/15/virgin-japanese-sex-physical-love\">Virgin territory: why the Japanese are turning their backs on sex | Roland Kelts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Libby, however, is feeling good about the future. Over the past few years her health has improved, allowing her to invest in her work, home, family and friendships. At New Year\u2019s, she realised that her only regret about the years she had spent unwell was her lack of dating and sexual experience. She changed medication \u201cand it seems to be the right cocktail.

      "bodyText": "Richard\u2019s colleagues call him their work therapist. He\u2019s empathetic and a good listener, he says \u2013 \u201cso a lot of people tell me about their personal shit\u201d, including the people he works with at his retail management job in the south-eastern US. But when they complain to him about their sex lives, or he sees happy couples hand-in-hand in the shop, \u201cI think: \u2018That\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to happen for me.\u2019\u201d At 31, Richard is a virgin. If it seems as though taboos about sex have lifted in these ostensibly open-minded times, there is one that holds steady: the stigma over never having had sex. While it has become widely unacceptable to criticise someone for having too many partners, being a virgin \u201cstill seems to be something that can be only mocked or shamed or suspect\u201d, says Richard. It may be that later-in-life virginity is dismissed as a problem with an easy fix. Cath Mercer, a principal investigator on the Natsal survey of sexual attitudes and lifestyles in Britain, says the vast majority (95%) of the general population report have made their \u201csexual debut\u201d \u2013 as she rather grandly puts it \u2013 by age 25. And the most recent data available, from 2010-12, suggests that just 2.2% of British men and 1.1% of women were virgins at the age of 30. Yet there are many reasons that a thirty or fortysomething might never have had sex, says Libby, a 37-year-old Canadian. \u201cIt could be tied to mental health issues, ranging from low self-esteem and social anxiety to serious depression. It could be due to a childhood of abuse, or physical health issues like cerebral palsy, or a religious upbringing, or even lack of comprehensive sex education.\u201d Libby connects her virginity to her personality traits (\u201ccynical, private, loud, opinionated and chubby \u2013 though my friends would say I\u2019m being too hard on myself\u201d) and her 10-year struggle with depression and anxiety. \u201cWhen I was sick, I could barely get out of bed, let alone put myself out there to potential partners.\u201d When she was well, she found that medication \u2013 for her mental health, and oral contraceptives to mitigate her very painful periods \u2013 wiped out her libido. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t have the drive, sex isn\u2019t something you pursue,\u201d says Libby. \u201cI don\u2019t blame drugs entirely \u2013 as I said, I never put much effort into dating and sex \u2013 but I do think they play a large part in my story.\u201d Richard also identifies poor mental health as a factor in his virginity. He is now on antidepressants and \u2013 following substance abuse in his 20s \u2013 sober. He guesses that his religious upbringing \u2013 where sex was not discussed beyond \u201cDon\u2019t do it\u201d \u2013 was also influential. But, maybe counterintuitively, he says the reason he has not had sex is that, to him, it\u2019s not just about sex. \u201cIf that was all I wanted to accomplish, I would\u2019ve just gone out and got it over with a long time ago.\u201d He has had \u201ca handful\u201d of chances to lose his virginity, but drunken opportunities at parties when he was younger \u201cjust didn\u2019t feel right\u201d, and his subsequent sobriety put an end to those. Dating apps are no solution \u2013 for him or many others. As Libby puts it: \u201cIf someone is still a virgin after 30, they likely have some issues tied to it, none of which will be solved with a swipe to the right and a random hookup.\u201d Although Richard describes himself as introverted and afraid of intimacy and rejection, he says the reason he struggles to approach strangers cold is \u201cnot because I\u2019m desperate \u2013 it\u2019s because I\u2019m not that desperate\u201d. He is articulate, even wryly humorous, about his virginity, even as he says it causes him day-to-day unhappiness. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to date with an STD that\u2019s not contagious and easily curable, but still puts people off.\u201d Although he desires a relationship more than sex, he says that at a certain point his status can become self-perpetuating. \u201cAt my age, it becomes a red flag for people. I don\u2019t really have interpersonal romantic experience, not even just on a physical level, but on an emotional level, too.\u201d He rejects the stereotype that lack of sexual experience extends to life experience (in the style of Steve Carrell\u2019s naive 40-Year-Old Virgin). \u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot, even for a regular person.\u201d Nor is he a \u201cmopey neckbeard or, even worse, incel\u201d \u2013 the group of overwhelmingly misogynistic men who blame women for their poor sex lives. A few years ago, Richard went to see a sex therapist, but never returned. \u201cHe asked me \u2013 and this will always stick in my head \u2013 \u2018Why don\u2019t you just pay someone if you want to have sex?\u2019 \u201cI said: \u2018Well, I want someone to want me, I want to want them, I want us to want to do this.\u2019 He got really indignant. \u2018It\u2019s just sex \u2013 you need to get over yourself.\u2019\u201d The thing is, says Richard, \u201cyou don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to judge you for it or who won\u2019t. There\u2019s no way to tell.\u201d The therapist spent the rest of the hour practising a mindfulness technique, says Richard. \u201c\u2018Like, \u2018Tell me what you think of yourself with regards to relationships \u2013 what would you be without this thought?\u2019 I thought: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t be in your office right now, paying you $200.\u2019\u201d Three years ago Richard was pursued by a woman who retreated after learning, via a game of 20 questions over text, that he was a virgin. \u201cWhen I kind of pried, she said that she thought that she would \u2018ruin\u2019 me.\u201d That response is not uncommon, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re dictating your sexuality for you, in a way \u2013 what you are and aren\u2019t ready for, what you can handle emotionally, just based on that one titbit about you.\u201d Julia, from Los Angeles, also comes up against preconceptions. At 31 going on 32, she is an evangelical Christian and still a virgin, as is her boyfriend. People in secular circles are surprised to learn they have never had sex \u2013 \u201cMy boyfriend\u2019s business partner wondered if he\u2019s secretly gay since we\u2019re not doing it\u201d \u2013 but then so are some Christians. These days, she says, most young evangelicals have premarital sex (or rush into marriage). \u201cI was actually surprised that my boyfriend is a virgin \u2013 that\u2019s how common it is.\u201d It is not easy staying chaste, Julia says \u2013 \u201cwe have to be proactively careful about that\u201d, particularly when they are travelling together \u2013 but their church community keeps them accountable. \u201cAnd I have a very full and rich life as a virgin.\u201d That said, she and her boyfriend are seriously discussing marriage; she\u2019s already warned him that they are going to \u201chave sex every day, seven days a week\u201d (although the novelty may wear off, she concedes). \u201cI\u2019m excited to have sex with my future husband. What we lack in experience, we\u2019ll learn together.\u201d But, Julia agrees, as a virgin by choice she is an anomaly. For others the hurdles can seem insurmountable. Jim, a 35-year-old from East Sussex, has never been kissed. He had few friends in secondary school, where his confidence was shot by bullying, and his social circle has dwindled since then. Like Richard, he is sober, thereby missing out on pubs and clubs \u2013 \u201cthe main route for kids in the 90s to have gotten together with someone\u201d. He works in IT, a male-dominated industry, and although he has some hobbies (archery, rock-climbing) he feels women there aren\u2019t open to being approached, if he even knew how. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to seem unwelcome or forceful.\u201d Holding him back, he says, are absence of opportunity, his looks (he describes himself as in shape but balding, and \u201cjust not nice-looking\u201d), his shyness and his lack of self-confidence \u2013 which worsens with each passing year. He has never told anyone that he is a virgin. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that has come up. If it did, I would probably lie and say that I had sex when I was 16 or 18 but that I haven\u2019t had it in ages. It\u2019s never having been in a relationship that bothers me more.\u201d For that reason, he says, he decided against going to a sex worker when he considered it a few years ago. \u201cI got to thinking that if I paid for it, that would probably make me feel even more worthless.\u201d Sex, as he sees it, is a destination, but he is more interested in the journey. \u201cIt\u2019s the getting a girlfriend, a partner \u2013 going to places with someone, who you can talk about your day with, and they\u2019ll be listening. \u2018Virgin\u2019 is the easiest tag to apply, but there\u2019s more to it than that. It\u2019s an experience that\u2019s been missing from me, and from other people.\u201d It bothers him more some days than it does others, he says \u2013 but the number of times he has avoided a town centre because of not wanting to see couples is \u201cworryingly high\u201d. Richard says something similar. \u201cWhen I meet someone or see someone I find attractive, instead of feeling a little spark, there\u2019s just a feeling in the pit in my stomach that says: \u2018Nothing\u2019s ever going to happen.\u2019\u201d Libby, however, is feeling good about the future. Over the past few years her health has improved, allowing her to invest in her work, home, family and friendships. At New Year\u2019s, she realised that her only regret about the years she had spent unwell was her lack of dating and sexual experience. She changed medication \u201cand it seems to be the right cocktail. I\u2019m feeling better than I have in a long time and, as an unexpected bonus, my libido woke up.\u201d She has since signed up for two online dating sites and had more good experiences than bad. Until very recently, only her two closest friends knew she was a virgin. \u201cNow that I\u2019m dating, I find myself telling potential interests fairly early on,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to weed out undesirable guys.\u201d She hopes her future partners will be patient, open to teaching, and willing to go at her pace. \u201cI know it won\u2019t be perfect or like a romance novel or a porn video, but it will be my first time, on my terms. And a weight will be lifted off my shoulders.\u201d All names have been changed.",

      "body": "<p>Squatting on the lawn like a moody crow, this year\u2019s Serpentine Pavilion is an enigmatic arrival to Kensington Gardens. Formed from hundreds of pieces of rough Cumbrian slate piled up in a gentle mound, it has the look of a bird hunkered down in a hollow in the landscape, making a protective shelter with its outstretched wings. As you approach, you find the great feathered hill is in fact a thin shell, 62 tonnes of slate effortlessly<strong> </strong>held up on a forest of slender white columns, creating a cave-like space within.</p> <p>Part bird, part spoil heap, the 19th annual pavilion is the work of Japanese architect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/14/junya-ishigami-serpentine-pavilion-london-commission-2019\">Junya Ishigami</a>, 45, who has built an international reputation as an architectural conjuror, concocting daring structures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/03/junya-ishigami-japanese-architect-i-want-to-make-the-sky\">that push the boundaries of what\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/03/junya-ishigami-japanese-architect-i-want-to-make-the-sky\">technically possible</a>. He made a five-storey metal balloon float in a gallery in Tokyo, and constructed a frame in the Barbican so thin it was practically invisible. He is currently building his most audacious structure yet: a student centre in Japan with a 100-metre-long roof made from a continuous plate of 12mm-thick steel, with not a column in sight. So what drove his slate hillock for the Serpentine?</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to create a pavilion that felt primitive and ancient,\u201d says Ishigami, \u201csomething between building and landscape. Slate roofs are found all over the world, so anyone coming here will be able to identify with it as a basic, archetypal form.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5eb11d0504746a2b350acfadb3bf104455511a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5eb11d0504746a2b350acfadb3bf104455511a3/0_58_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Junya Ishigami with his pavilion in front of the Serpentine Gallery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Doesn\u2019t hide his disappointment\u2019 \u2026 Junya Ishigami with his pavilion in front of the Serpentine Gallery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He refers to the Japanese garden idea of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.mnn.com/your-home/organic-farming-gardening/stories/art-shakkei-or-borrowed-scenery\">shakkei</a>\u201d, or borrowed scenery, where the background landscape is incorporated into the design of the garden. Just as a distant mountain might provide a backdrop to a garden of carefully raked gravel, so too does the slate roof of the 1930s Serpentine Gallery (originally built as a tea pavilion) poke up behind Ishigami\u2019s swelling sea of slate.</p> <p>It is strangely fitting and of its place. Of all architects to have been selected for the annual commission, Ishigami\u2019s approach is perhaps most aligned with the 18th century landscape architects who first laid out Kensington Gardens in the picturesque tradition, with avenues framing views of water and strategically placed follies. He always talks about his work as \u201cmaking scenery\u201d, his structures creating artificial landscapes that operate in a world all of their own. Which means they can struggle when they come up against practical realities \u2013 particularly in the form of the Serpentine\u2019s fiendishly tight timeframe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/18/serpentine-galleries-chief-yana-peel-resigns-in-spyware-firm-row\">Serpentine Galleries chief resigns in spyware firm row</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was really, really difficult this year,\u201d says Tim Leigh, marketing director of <a href=\"https://www.stageone.co.uk/\">Stage One</a>, the York-based fabricators who have built the pavilion every year for the last decade. \u201cIshigami is the most conceptual architect we have ever worked with. It was a very strained process.\u201d</p> <p>The final result feels rather lost in translation, the compromised product of a sharp clash of cultures. There are more columns than originally envisaged, and a series of clumsy polycarbonate walls have been installed, following wind analysis by engineers Aecom, to prevent the furniture from blowing away. Ishigami doesn\u2019t hide his disappointment with the walls, which effectively destroy the design, turning the free-flowing space beneath the canopy into a more restricted enclosure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"feba9f7e8fdfbd5be535e246e1c9cb96a732a2a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/feba9f7e8fdfbd5be535e246e1c9cb96a732a2a4/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Clumsy polycarbonate walls destroy the design\u2019 \u2026 Serpentine Galleries\u2019s summer Pavilion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Clumsy polycarbonate walls destroy the design\u2019 \u2026 Serpentine Galleries\u2019s summer Pavilion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was conceived to be accessible from any direction \u2013 with children able to scamper beneath the roof where it swoops down at the lower points \u2013 but Ishigami says that British health and safety regulations put paid to that idea. The fabricators, on the other hand, pointed to the architect\u2019s focus on aesthetics. More time, both agree, would have helped matters.</p> <p>It is a familiar story from years past, particularly when Japanese architects have been involved. Ishigami\u2019s former employer, Sanaa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jul/08/sanaa-summer-pavilion-serpentine\">struggled to realise their seamless reflective canopy in 2009</a>, being forced to include similar paraphernalia of walls, fatter columns and bulkier fixings, while Sou Fujimoto\u2019s beguiling space-frame in 2013 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jun/04/serpentine-gallery-pavilion-sou-fujimoto\">hampered by an excess of balustrades and hand rails</a>. In every case, the architects wished they had more time to resolve such details, which makes you wonder why the gallery hasn\u2019t started appointing them earlier, or making the project biennial, following the lead of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/11/zinging-rainbow-drainage-pipes-dulwich-pavilion-yinka-ilori-pricegore\">the new Dulwich pavilion</a> across the river.</p> <p>Ishigami\u2019s structure is a striking object, but it could have been so much better, and it is a frustrating outcome in what has been a troubled year for the Serpentine. The institution was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/apr/12/hito-steyerl-serpentine-sackler-building-should-be-unnamed\"> criticised for accepting funding from the Sackler family</a> (in light of part of the family\u2019s alleged role in America\u2019s opioid crisis), and berated over the fact that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/22/row-unpaid-interns-serpentine-london-gallery-pavilion-architect-project\"> Ishigami\u2019s practice employed unpaid interns</a> (he insists they were university students on a placement). This week, on the scheduled morning of the pavilion preview on Tuesday, it was announced that the gallery\u2019s CEO, Yana Peel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/18/serpentine-galleries-chief-yana-peel-resigns-in-spyware-firm-row\">has resigned</a>, following the Guardian\u2019s disclosure that she co-owns an Israeli cyberweapons company whose software has allegedly been used by authoritarian regimes to spy on dissidents. Peel said she did not want the Serpentine\u2019s work undermined by \u201cmisguided and personal attacks on me and my family\u201d.</p> <p>Whoever takes Peel\u2019s place would be wise to slow down and rethink exactly what the pavilion programme is for. After almost 20 years of commissioning novelty structures to host summer parties for sponsors \u2013&#xa0;as well as being open to the public, and hosting live and community events \u2013 it feels like the format could do with a rethink and look beyond the bounds of the gallery\u2019s garden, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/16/serpentine-pavilion-second-lives-zaha-hadid-toyo-ito-frank-gehry\">the collectors\u2019 estates where the structures end up</a>. There are schools in need of classrooms, public spaces in need of shelters, and countless other clients crying out for the energy and ingenuity that goes into this diverting annual folly.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article has been updated on 19 June 2019 to reflect the fact that as well as providing the centrepiece for the Serpentine\u2019s summer party, the Serpentine Pavilion is open to the public for free and hosts a variety of live and community events throughout the summer. </p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Squatting on the lawn like a moody crow, this year\u2019s Serpentine Pavilion is an enigmatic arrival to Kensington Gardens. Formed from hundreds of pieces of rough Cumbrian slate piled up in a gentle mound, it has the look of a bird hunkered down in a hollow in the landscape, making a protective shelter with its outstretched wings. As you approach, you find the great feathered hill is in fact a thin shell, 62 tonnes of slate effortlessly held up on a forest of slender white columns, creating a cave-like space within. Part bird, part spoil heap, the 19th annual pavilion is the work of Japanese architect Junya Ishigami, 45, who has built an international reputation as an architectural conjuror, concocting daring structures that push the boundaries of what\u2019s technically possible. He made a five-storey metal balloon float in a gallery in Tokyo, and constructed a frame in the Barbican so thin it was practically invisible. He is currently building his most audacious structure yet: a student centre in Japan with a 100-metre-long roof made from a continuous plate of 12mm-thick steel, with not a column in sight. So what drove his slate hillock for the Serpentine? \u201cI wanted to create a pavilion that felt primitive and ancient,\u201d says Ishigami, \u201csomething between building and landscape. Slate roofs are found all over the world, so anyone coming here will be able to identify with it as a basic, archetypal form.\u201d He refers to the Japanese garden idea of \u201cshakkei\u201d, or borrowed scenery, where the background landscape is incorporated into the design of the garden. Just as a distant mountain might provide a backdrop to a garden of carefully raked gravel, so too does the slate roof of the 1930s Serpentine Gallery (originally built as a tea pavilion) poke up behind Ishigami\u2019s swelling sea of slate. It is strangely fitting and of its place. Of all architects to have been selected for the annual commission, Ishigami\u2019s approach is perhaps most aligned with the 18th century landscape architects who first laid out Kensington Gardens in the picturesque tradition, with avenues framing views of water and strategically placed follies. He always talks about his work as \u201cmaking scenery\u201d, his structures creating artificial landscapes that operate in a world all of their own. Which means they can struggle when they come up against practical realities \u2013 particularly in the form of the Serpentine\u2019s fiendishly tight timeframe. \u201cIt was really, really difficult this year,\u201d says Tim Leigh, marketing director of Stage One, the York-based fabricators who have built the pavilion every year for the last decade. \u201cIshigami is the most conceptual architect we have ever worked with. It was a very strained process.\u201d The final result feels rather lost in translation, the compromised product of a sharp clash of cultures. There are more columns than originally envisaged, and a series of clumsy polycarbonate walls have been installed, following wind analysis by engineers Aecom, to prevent the furniture from blowing away. Ishigami doesn\u2019t hide his disappointment with the walls, which effectively destroy the design, turning the free-flowing space beneath the canopy into a more restricted enclosure. It was conceived to be accessible from any direction \u2013 with children able to scamper beneath the roof where it swoops down at the lower points \u2013 but Ishigami says that British health and safety regulations put paid to that idea. The fabricators, on the other hand, pointed to the architect\u2019s focus on aesthetics. More time, both agree, would have helped matters. It is a familiar story from years past, particularly when Japanese architects have been involved. Ishigami\u2019s former employer, Sanaa, struggled to realise their seamless reflective canopy in 2009, being forced to include similar paraphernalia of walls, fatter columns and bulkier fixings, while Sou Fujimoto\u2019s beguiling space-frame in 2013 was hampered by an excess of balustrades and hand rails. In every case, the architects wished they had more time to resolve such details, which makes you wonder why the gallery hasn\u2019t started appointing them earlier, or making the project biennial, following the lead of the new Dulwich pavilion across the river. Ishigami\u2019s structure is a striking object, but it could have been so much better, and it is a frustrating outcome in what has been a troubled year for the Serpentine. The institution was criticised for accepting funding from the Sackler family (in light of part of the family\u2019s alleged role in America\u2019s opioid crisis), and berated over the fact that Ishigami\u2019s practice employed unpaid interns (he insists they were university students on a placement). This week, on the scheduled morning of the pavilion preview on Tuesday, it was announced that the gallery\u2019s CEO, Yana Peel, has resigned, following the Guardian\u2019s disclosure that she co-owns an Israeli cyberweapons company whose software has allegedly been used by authoritarian regimes to spy on dissidents. Peel said she did not want the Serpentine\u2019s work undermined by \u201cmisguided and personal attacks on me and my family\u201d. Whoever takes Peel\u2019s place would be wise to slow down and rethink exactly what the pavilion programme is for. After almost 20 years of commissioning novelty structures to host summer parties for sponsors \u2013 as well as being open to the public, and hosting live and community events \u2013 it feels like the format could do with a rethink and look beyond the bounds of the gallery\u2019s garden, and the collectors\u2019 estates where the structures end up. There are schools in need of classrooms, public spaces in need of shelters, and countless other clients crying out for the energy and ingenuity that goes into this diverting annual folly. This article has been updated on 19 June 2019 to reflect the fact that as well as providing the centrepiece for the Serpentine\u2019s summer party, the Serpentine Pavilion is open to the public for free and hosts a variety of live and community events throughout the summer.",

      "bodyText": "Dutch prosecutors are to identify suspects and file the first criminal charges over the 2014 downing of flight MH17 over east Ukraine which killed 298 people in the worst atrocity in five years of war between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists. The charges are likely to target members of a Russia-backed separatist movement and may include Russian service personnel who commanded or helped transport the anti-aircraft missile system used to bring down the plane. The charges will raise tensions with Russia, which is unlikely to turn over its citizens, especially those in uniform, to stand trial in a foreign country or at the international criminal court. Russia\u2019s constitution forbids the extradition of its citizens. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) is to present new evidence in the MH17 investigation on Wednesday, and is expected to name its first four suspects in the case. The JIT previously alleged the surface-to-air missile that brought down the plane belonged to the Russian armed forces and had been supplied by the country\u2019s 53rd anti-aircraft brigade in Kursk. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, disregarded those findings, saying the investigation \u201cdid not inspire confidence\u201d and that \u201cseveral versions\u201d of events existed. Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry on Tuesday confirmed that criminal charges would be brought against the suspects named in the JIT\u2019s presentation. \u201cThe names will be announced. Charges will be brought. After that, the criminal court of Schiphol will start working to consider this case,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s deputy minister of foreign affairs, Olena Zerkal, told the news agency Interfax-Ukraine. \u201cThey are only the top. Naturally, then, the number of people who are involved in this will be much larger than the four people who will be named.\u201d The news agency said Zerkal believed the charges could target \u201csenior officers\u201d in the Russian army because the transfer of a surface-to-air missile system \u201cis impossible without the top brass\u2019s permission\u201d. The charges are likely to be brought in the Netherlands because the majority of the passengers onboard the Boeing 777 flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur were Dutch. According to official information, the Malaysia Airlines plane was carrying 193 Dutch, 43 Malaysian, 38 Australian, 12 Indonesian and 10 British passengers, as well as one from New Zealand. The investigative collective Bellingcat, which gathered and analysed open-source data about the attack, will also make a presentation on Wednesday identifying \u201cseparatists involved in the downing of MH17\u201d. Bellingcat has written extensively about the case. Last year it identified one of those allegedly involved as Oleg Ivannikov, a career officer in the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU, who operated undercover in rebel-controlled Luhansk in eastern Ukraine under the cover names \u201cOrion\u201d and \u201cAndrey Ivanovich\u201d, the website said. The downing of the jet came in the early months of a war between Ukraine\u2019s army and Russia-backed separatists that has left more than 13,000 people dead. While Ukraine\u2019s army held air superiority in the conflict, separatist forces mysteriously began shooting down Ukrainian jet fighters and troop transports, and Russia was suspected of providing them with anti-aircraft missile systems. Pro-separatist websites initially welcomed the downing of MH17, believing the plane to be an An-26 troop transport, before realising a passenger jet had been targeted. A Dutch news programme, Nieuwsuur, has named several MH17 suspects, including Sergei Muchkaev, commander of the 53rd anti-aircraft brigade in Kursk, and several alleged members of GRU. It is unclear if they will be among the suspects identified on Wednesday. Dutch authorities have revealed few details about the announcement. The chief prosecutor, Fred Westerbeke, wrote to relatives of the victims last week and invited them to a briefing on Wednesday in Nieuwegein, near Utrecht. The JIT said it would inform them about the latest developments in the criminal case, Westerbeke said. The closed meeting for family members will take place before a press conference at 1pm. The short notice was due to the \u201cimportance of secrecy\u201d, Westerbeke told the relatives.",

      "body": "<p>At the beginning of The Rings of Saturn, the narrator announces that he is setting off \u201cto walk the county of Suffolk, in the hope of dispelling the emptiness that takes hold of me whenever I have completed a long stint of work\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard not to think that he might have been better off going to a Greek island. Especially at the start, heading to the coastal town of Lowestoft on \u201cone of the old diesel trains, grimed with oil and soot up to the windows\u201d on a \u201cgrey, overcast day\u201d. It gets worse when he finally arrives and finds it \u201crun down\u201d and deserted. \u201cI was unprepared for the feeling of wretchedness that instantly seized hold of me,\u201d he says. When he strolls out of town, walking through \u201cblue petrol fumes\u201d and past \u201cdecommissioned and unemployed trawlers\u201d, there is still more desolation in store. The sparse moorlands and dark pebble beaches of Suffolk are hardly a tonic against emptiness \u2013 in fact, they often seem to embody the feeling that Sebald\u2019s narrator is seeking to escape.</p> <p>Still, it could be worse \u2013 for example, he could be in exile with Joseph Conrad\u2019s father Apollo Korzeniowski in Vologoda. There, we are told: \u201cDuring the green winter it rains week in week out.

      "bodyText": "At the beginning of The Rings of Saturn, the narrator announces that he is setting off \u201cto walk the county of Suffolk, in the hope of dispelling the emptiness that takes hold of me whenever I have completed a long stint of work\u201d. It\u2019s hard not to think that he might have been better off going to a Greek island. Especially at the start, heading to the coastal town of Lowestoft on \u201cone of the old diesel trains, grimed with oil and soot up to the windows\u201d on a \u201cgrey, overcast day\u201d. It gets worse when he finally arrives and finds it \u201crun down\u201d and deserted. \u201cI was unprepared for the feeling of wretchedness that instantly seized hold of me,\u201d he says. When he strolls out of town, walking through \u201cblue petrol fumes\u201d and past \u201cdecommissioned and unemployed trawlers\u201d, there is still more desolation in store. The sparse moorlands and dark pebble beaches of Suffolk are hardly a tonic against emptiness \u2013 in fact, they often seem to embody the feeling that Sebald\u2019s narrator is seeking to escape. Still, it could be worse \u2013 for example, he could be in exile with Joseph Conrad\u2019s father Apollo Korzeniowski in Vologoda.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has accused the European Central Bank of unfairly manipulating the euro, further raising the stakes for Washington in its trade and diplomatic disputes around the world. The US president suggested in a tweet that comments by Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB, had triggered an immediate slide in the value of the euro versus the dollar, \u201cmaking it unfairly easier for them to compete against the USA\u201d. Reopening a spat over transatlantic trade with the EU that has repeatedly flared up during Trump\u2019s presidency, he warned Brussels it had been \u201cgetting away with this for years, along with China and others\u201d. Trump\u2019s comments come after Draghi used one of his last major speeches before stepping down as ECB president to say the central bank could act to loosen monetary policy \u2013 cutting interest rates or revamping its quantitative easing bond-buying programme \u2013 to stimulate the eurozone economy. Economic growth in the single currency area has struggled to generate momentum in the past 18 months, while inflation across the bloc has stayed below the ECB\u2019s target level of 2%. Growth in key member states, including Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, has come close to stalling, while Italy slid into recession. \u201cIn the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,\u201d Draghi said, speaking at the ECB\u2019s annual meeting in Sintra, Portugal. The euro weakened across the board on foreign exchanges straight after the speech, dropping by 0.3% against the dollar to trade a two-week low of $1.1182 on Tuesday. A weaker currency can help businesses to sell goods at more competitive prices to overseas buyers. Trump has long complained that the US buys more from EU firms than is sold the other way, similar to his criticism of China. With just four months of his eight-year term left, the slowdown in the eurozone may threaten to unpick Draghi\u2019s legacy. The Italian is widely seen as having saved the euro after a promise in 2012 to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d during the sovereign debt crisis. Draghi\u2019s latest intervention will likely help to reassure markets that the ECB is ready and willing to act despite his forthcoming departure, while laying down the gauntlet to his successor to maintain lower borrowing costs to support the eurozone economy. However, the ECB faces challenges given its limited firepower, with interest rates at record lows of zero and -0.4% for bank deposits. The central bank could cut interest rates deeper into negative territory, or buy more government bonds than previously allowed under its QE programme. Growth in the eurozone has stuttered in recent months in part because of the Trump administration\u2019s trade war with China, which has sapped global trade and cut demand for EU exports. Draghi warned that trade disputes were among factors affecting growth in his speech advocating potential stimulus. \u201cThe risks that have been prominent throughout the past year, in particular geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets have not dissipated,\u201d he said. The US is also approaching a period of weaker growth, after repeated interest rate hikes from the US Federal Reserve served as a headwind, and as support from tax cuts introduced by Trump gradually fades. Investors believe the Fed could be forced into interest rate cuts this year as a consequence. There are, however, hopes of a resolution in the US-China trade dispute, after Trump said he would meet with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at the forthcoming Japan G20 summit next week. In a tweet that prompted financial markets around the world to rally, the US leader said: \u201cHad a very good telephone conversation with President Xi of China. We will be having an extended meeting next week at the G-20 in Japan.\u201d The FTSE 100 closed up more than 85 points at 7,443, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained by more than 300 points on Tuesday afternoon.",

Just over half the land in Wales is affected, and less than a fifth of Scotland.</p> <p>When sites that are particularly sensitive are considered, including special areas of conservation, special protected areas, and sites of special scientific interest, England is worst hit, according to a study from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), with 95% of sites overloaded with the pollutants. In Wales and Northern Ireland 89% and 85% respectively of sensitive sites suffered <a href=\"https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/assets/documents/reports/cat09/1905230854_Trends_Report_2018.pdf\">excess levels of nitrogen</a>.

Lichen, for example, may be killed off by excess ammonia gas, leading to knock-on effects for the wildlife that depend on it for food. Studies have shown grasslands losing species \u2013 which affects pollinating insects \u2013 and fungi that help trees and other plants to grow are being killed off.</p> <p>Simon Bareham, principal adviser on air quality and biodiversity at the Welsh environment agency, Natural Resources Wales, said: \u201cIf we don\u2019t do something we risk losing some of these internationally important [ecological] communities that we have hung on to since the last ice age. In the short term, this poses one of the biggest threats to biodiversity that I\u2019ve come across in my career of over 30 years.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed to sites in Wales where lichens that are sensitive to nitrogen are dying off. This has dire knock-on effects, because the lichens provide habitats for invertebrates which in turn are eaten by birds. They also absorb half of the rainfall in forest ecosystems, preventing flooding and storing water for release in dry periods.</p> <p>Experts and activists are calling for urgent government action to stem the rise of ammonia emissions, nearly 90% of which come from farms. Ammonia is a compound of nitrogen and combines with other pollutants in the air to form fine particulates that pose a grave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/13/ammonia-health-problem-rising-air-pollution\">danger to human health</a>.

It\u2019s clearly vital that the government closes the loophole which means that beef and dairy farms are not monitored. This should be a priority in the environment bill.\u201d</p> <p>But she urged people to look beyond the immediate pollutant effects and press for wider changes in the UK\u2019s food and farming systems. \u201cPressure on farmers is forcing many to adopt more intensive agricultural practices for livestock and crop production, and this will only get worse post-Brexit. We need to move to more sustainable practices. This means less but better meat and dairy production, which would not only improve air quality but also benefit the environment, lead to better public health and improve animal protection.\u201d</p> <p>Civil society groups called for sweeping reforms to the way farms are monitored and regulated. \u201cThe UK must address what\u2019s coming out of our farms as well as our exhaust pipes,\u201d said Kate Nield, clean air lawyer at Client Earth, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/21/high-court-rules-uk-air-pollution-plans-unlawful\">successfully taken ministers to court over air pollution</a>. \u201cUnless urgent action is taken, the government is on track to miss legally binding commitments to reduce ammonia by 2020 and 2030. Relying on voluntary measures will not be enough. If binding rules to limit polluting farm practice aren\u2019t put in place as soon as possible and farmers aren\u2019t made to comply, we will have a major blind spot.\u201d</p> <p>Philip Lymbery, chief executive of Compassion in World Farming, called ammonia \u201ca huge public health and environmental issue that needs to be tackled urgently\u201d, and pointed to the intensification of agriculture in the UK as one of the chief causes. \u201cAction needs to go way beyond simply covering slurry pits and other quick-fix methods to a major root cause: the proliferation of mega farms in the UK,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cLarge-scale factory farms with huge numbers of confined animals mean vast quantities of manure and a surge in air pollution. [The government] needs to get serious about charting a course away from deeply damaging industrial livestock farming.\u201d</p> <p>The number of intensive pig and poultry farms has increased by more than a quarter in recent years, <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-07-17/megafarms-uk-intensive-farming-meat\">previous investigations</a> by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism have shown.

      "bodyText": "Ammonia and nitrogen pollution, mostly from farms, is harming more than 60% of the UK\u2019s land area and hitting the most sensitive habitats for plants and wildlife hardest, a government report has found, despite there being no clear plans to monitor or reduce its impact. More than 85% of England\u2019s total land area receives ammonia concentrations above the critical level set to protect lichens, mosses, liverworts and similar plants \u2013 keystone species that are vital to ecosystems \u2013 while Northern Ireland is even worse, at 88%. Just over half the land in Wales is affected, and less than a fifth of Scotland. When sites that are particularly sensitive are considered, including special areas of conservation, special protected areas, and sites of special scientific interest, England is worst hit, according to a study from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), with 95% of sites overloaded with the pollutants. In Wales and Northern Ireland 89% and 85% respectively of sensitive sites suffered excess levels of nitrogen. Only Scotland had lower levels, with nitrogen above \u201ccritical load\u201d at only 40% of sites in 2014-16. The pollution, which flows into waterways and is deposited into the air, can have a devastating effect on plants and animal life. Lichen, for example, may be killed off by excess ammonia gas, leading to knock-on effects for the wildlife that depend on it for food. Studies have shown grasslands losing species \u2013 which affects pollinating insects \u2013 and fungi that help trees and other plants to grow are being killed off. Simon Bareham, principal adviser on air quality and biodiversity at the Welsh environment agency, Natural Resources Wales, said: \u201cIf we don\u2019t do something we risk losing some of these internationally important [ecological] communities that we have hung on to since the last ice age. In the short term, this poses one of the biggest threats to biodiversity that I\u2019ve come across in my career of over 30 years.\u201d He pointed to sites in Wales where lichens that are sensitive to nitrogen are dying off. This has dire knock-on effects, because the lichens provide habitats for invertebrates which in turn are eaten by birds. They also absorb half of the rainfall in forest ecosystems, preventing flooding and storing water for release in dry periods. Experts and activists are calling for urgent government action to stem the rise of ammonia emissions, nearly 90% of which come from farms. Ammonia is a compound of nitrogen and combines with other pollutants in the air to form fine particulates that pose a grave danger to human health. At least 3,000 deaths a year could be prevented by halving agricultural emissions of ammonia, according to a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. Ammonia \u2013 a pungent gas that in large concentrations can cause stinging in the throat, eye damage and even death to humans \u2013 is associated with animal manure and nitrogen fertilisers. When these fertilisers are used on the land, the nitrogen can also wash off into nearby waterways, where it causes the overgrowth of some plants and the death of others, disrupting natural ecosystems. Caroline Lucas, the UK\u2019s only Green Party MP, said: \u201cWe usually associate air pollution with cities, so it\u2019s shocking to see how much rural areas are affected by ammonia pollution. It\u2019s clearly vital that the government closes the loophole which means that beef and dairy farms are not monitored. This should be a priority in the environment bill.\u201d But she urged people to look beyond the immediate pollutant effects and press for wider changes in the UK\u2019s food and farming systems. \u201cPressure on farmers is forcing many to adopt more intensive agricultural practices for livestock and crop production, and this will only get worse post-Brexit. We need to move to more sustainable practices. This means less but better meat and dairy production, which would not only improve air quality but also benefit the environment, lead to better public health and improve animal protection.\u201d Civil society groups called for sweeping reforms to the way farms are monitored and regulated. \u201cThe UK must address what\u2019s coming out of our farms as well as our exhaust pipes,\u201d said Kate Nield, clean air lawyer at Client Earth, which has successfully taken ministers to court over air pollution. \u201cUnless urgent action is taken, the government is on track to miss legally binding commitments to reduce ammonia by 2020 and 2030. Relying on voluntary measures will not be enough. If binding rules to limit polluting farm practice aren\u2019t put in place as soon as possible and farmers aren\u2019t made to comply, we will have a major blind spot.\u201d Philip Lymbery, chief executive of Compassion in World Farming, called ammonia \u201ca huge public health and environmental issue that needs to be tackled urgently\u201d, and pointed to the intensification of agriculture in the UK as one of the chief causes. \u201cAction needs to go way beyond simply covering slurry pits and other quick-fix methods to a major root cause: the proliferation of mega farms in the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cLarge-scale factory farms with huge numbers of confined animals mean vast quantities of manure and a surge in air pollution. [The government] needs to get serious about charting a course away from deeply damaging industrial livestock farming.\u201d The number of intensive pig and poultry farms has increased by more than a quarter in recent years, previous investigations by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism have shown. There are now about 800 US-style \u201cmega farms\u201d across the country, most of them poultry and pig farms, joined by nearly a dozen cattle \u201cfeedlots\u201d for beef production in the east of England. Local residents living near farms that have moved to intensive production are also often unhappy about the effects. \u201cIt used to be like, it\u2019s a beautiful day and you take a deep breath of fresh air and smell the different herbs, grasses, what\u2019s flowering,\u201d said Sarah Macdiarmid, who lives in north Devon, one of the UK\u2019s main dairy regions. \u201cNot any more. Most days, when you go out, you\u2019ve got a brief window and if the weather is fine, they\u2019re spraying [slurry]. And it stinks, it\u2019s absolutely dire.\u201d A spokesperson for the department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cOur clean air strategy sets out for the first time how we plan to tackle farm ammonia pollution by requiring and supporting farmers to invest in the infrastructure and equipment required to reduce emissions.

      "bodyText": "Los Angeles has sentenced more people to death than any other county in the US, and only people of color have received the death penalty under the region\u2019s current prosecutor, a new report shows. LA county\u2019s district attorney, Jackie Lacey, has won death sentences for a total of 22 defendants, all people of color, and eight of them were represented by lawyers with serious misconduct charges prior or after their cases, according to a new analysis by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Lacey\u2019s office has also continued to pursue death penalty trials this year despite the fact that California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, issued a moratorium on capital punishment, with an executive order officially halting executions in the state. In addition to severe racial disparities and ethical concerns around legal representation, LA\u2019s system is costing taxpayers millions of dollars in pursuit of a punishment the region\u2019s voters and California leaders have rejected, activists said. Some key findings: In California, 222 people currently sentenced to death are from LA county, representing 31% of all death sentences in the state. (The LA population is only 25% of the statewide figure.) LA is one of only three counties in the country to have more than 10 death sentences from 2014 to 2018. In the last five years, LA produced more death sentences per capita than any large county in Texas, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Utah or Washington \u2013 and sent more people to death row than the states of Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Virginia combined. Last year, out of 3,100 counties nationwide, LA was one of only four to have more than one death sentence. Under Lacey\u2019s tenure, which began in 2012, zero white defendants have been sentenced to death, and her capital punishment sentences disproportionately targeted cases involving white victims. Although 12% of homicide victims in LA county are white, 36% of Lacey\u2019s death penalty wins involved white victims. Of the 22 defendants sentenced under Lacey, 13 were Latinx, eight were black and one was Asian. \u201cThis should be profoundly troubling to all of us,\u201d Cassy Stubbs, director of the ACLU Capital Punishment Project, told the Guardian. \u201cLos Angeles is really in a class of its own \u2026 It is just such an enormous producer of death sentences in a way that really does not make sense for where we are today.\u201d Asked about the ACLU\u2019s findings, Lacey sent a general statement to the Guardian on Monday defending her continuing support for capital punishment: \u201cAs a career prosecutor, I believe the death penalty is the appropriate punishment for some crimes \u2013 a serial killer, someone who tortures and kills a young child, the person who rapes and then kills the victim to silence his only witness or someone who kills a police officer trying to do her job safely.\u201d The governor\u2019s moratorium affects the 737 inmates currently awaiting execution in California, who will not be put to death while Newsom is in office. Lacey, however, is continuing to seek the death penalty, despite the fact that a majority of voters in LA county have twice voted in favor of death penalty repeal measures. Defense lawyers in five of the 22 cases under Lacey were suspended or disbarred, which is the most serious discipline for ethics violations, the ACLU said. Defense counsel for two other defendants was put on probation, and the attorney for another is currently facing multiple bar charges. The ACLU, which reviewed lawyer misconduct records, cited one particularly egregious case in which an attorney declined to make an opening statement \u2013 offering no defense at all \u2013 and then repeatedly fell asleep during the trial. \u201cI have serious doubts about the constitutionality of these sentences,\u201d said Stubbs, noting that inadequate representation can have long-lasting consequences. Failures of defense counsel are key contributors to wrongful convictions, but problems with California\u2019s appellate system means these kinds of mistakes are often exposed decades later, the ACLU said. The last two California death row inmates who were exonerated gained their freedom roughly 25 years after conviction, and those delays could get worse, as the state has an expanding backlog of cases and appeals. All five people removed from death row after exoneration in the state were people of color. In California, death penalty expenses total at least $139m per year, and LA county spent an estimated $48.4m seeking executions from 2000 to 2007. Death penalty trials cost over a million dollars, draining county funds that could be used for community anti-violence programs, education and services for families of victims, said Diane Lucas, senior legal counsel with the Justice Collaborative. The LA district attorney\u2019s office has recently defended its continuing efforts to seek the death penalty despite Newsom\u2019s order. In her statement this week, Lacey noted that California voters had not abolished the death penalty, saying: \u201cI will follow the law as prescribed by the citizens of California \u2013 whether that is seeking the death penalty for the most heinous crimes or, with the abolition of the death penalty, life without parole.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office has \u201cextensive review processes\u201d in place to decide whether to pursue the death penalty and makes recommendations \u201cbased on the facts without regard to the race of a defendant or a victim\u201d, Lacey said. Her office sought the death penalty in less than 3% of all eligible cases last year, she said. Lacey has also faced intense scrutiny for her refusal to prosecute police officers who kill civilians, even in the most egregious circumstances. Stubbs said it was within Lacey\u2019s power to immediately halt her death penalty cases, accept outstanding plea agreements, and no longer seek capital punishment in new cases. But if she continued in her current path, the cases would just drag on, said Stubbs, adding: \u201cThe extended delays are painful for a lot of the community, including victims.\u201d",

He made a name for himself as a performer, turning up to parties with two reel-to-reel tape recorders and drum machines, playing live jams that he\u2019d rap and sing over.

Using vinyl records, reel-to-reel tapes and a pitch-controlled cassette deck, he produced live edits on the fly, creating a dramatic, multilayered sound. He ran three record labels with fellow Warehouse resident Armando: Dance Mutha, which focused on \u201cfunky hip\u2013house\u201d tracks, Warehouse \u201cfor the weirdos who couldn\u2019t get released on DJ International or Trax\u201d (the two biggest house labels of the time) and Muzique, for \u201cdeep house grooves with a touch of acid\u201d.</p> <p>For as long as Dunn had been producing house music he\u2019d been producing for rappers, too. But, says Dunn, \u201cNew York City ran the rap game and the Chicago house scene was crazy, so, apart from people like Twista, Crucial Conflict and Do Or Die, nobody wanted to do rap here.\u201d This is why he, Cooper and fellow producer Fast Eddie incorporated their love of funky rap vocals and hip\u2013hop beats into house grooves and came up with hip\u2013house, \u201cbecause we weren\u2019t taken seriously with rap\u201d. But word of his rap production, under the name the Incredible MD, eventually spread to the coasts. A bidding war started between Jimmy Iovine\u2019s Interscope Records and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2017/nov/06/diddy-changes-his-name-brother-love\">Sean \u201cPuffy\u201d Combs</a>\u2019 Bad Boy Records.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"27958630705312fb0d4c587c50eca91671ebea7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27958630705312fb0d4c587c50eca91671ebea7b/0_0_3264_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chicago house producer Mike Dunn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I went underground\u2019 \u2026 Mike Dunn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jos Kottmann</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After choosing to sign with Bad Boy, Dunn\u2019s luck hit a wall. In December 1999, Combs and the rapper Shyne were arrested for their alleged roles in a New York City nightclub shooting. By the spring of 2001, Combs had been acquitted of all charges and Shyne sentenced to 10 years in prison. The tabloid drama created a domino effect at Bad Boy that tipped over Dunn\u2019s deal. \u201cWe never got to the point of releasing anything \u2026 because [Combs] was so concerned about going to jail,\u201d says Dunn. \u201cWe were waiting on the sidelines until he got finished, and when he did he basically got rid of [\u2026] anything that was in that period that was bad for him, and my label was part of that.\u201d He admits, though, that there was \u201cnot correct business on my end,\u201d says Dunn. \u201cI rubbed [Combs] the wrong way.\u201d</p> <p>After the deal collapsed, Dunn kept a low profile. \u201cI was in a real dismal place and I didn\u2019t want nobody seeing me,\u201d he says, \u201cso I went underground.\u201d He started playing at neighbourhood parties again and word spread of his return. \u201cWhen you come back out after a long time, people start appreciating you a little different,\u201d he says. In 2008, he released his most celebrated club track, Phreaky MF, but only after a long delay \u2013 he promised his grandmother that he wouldn\u2019t release it while she was alive, because she disapproved of its hardcore sexual lyrics.</p> <p>\u201cI needed something to play that night at the Warehouse,\u201d Dunn says, \u201cso I just threw the track together, went in the booth, and started talking crazy over it. Nothing was written down or rehearsed \u2013 just me freestyling some wild stuff.\u201d That wild stuff still turns heads in the club in 2019 \u2013 it regards exactly what this enthusiastic and adventurous lover, who goes by the name of Mr 69, would do to you, blending chocolate, whipped cream and saliva with much raunchier fare. His macho kind of sexual bravado has aged surprisingly well on record; the track is a favourite of DJs such as <a href=\"http://www.fourtet.net/\">Four Tet</a>, and has a sonic kinship with the low\u2013slung bombastic funk of groups like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lcd-soundsystem\">LCD Soundsystem</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmq-L0kRCYA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vmq-L0kRCYA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>One of those who noticed his return was Wayne Williams, seasoned label A&amp;R and elder of the Chosen Few, a respected group of house DJs that Williams founded in the late 70s. In 2012, Dunn earned a new nickname, \u201cThe Baby,\u201d as only the second member to be invited to join in 30 years. \u201cIn the last 10 years, there\u2019s been a resurgence of house in Chicago, which was in dire straits before,\u201d says Dunn. He sees the growth of the Picnic, the Chosen Few\u2019s one\u2013day festival that draws upwards of 40,000 people to Chicago\u2019s Jackson Park each July, as a shot in the arm for the dance music community in the US. \u201cIt let people know that it was still alive,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had to get it back to where we were looked at as the birthplace of house, not the graveyard of it.\u201d</p> <p>My House from All Angles features a new, garage\u2013tinged remix of Phreaky MF, but it\u2019s the new tracks that really shine. Going back to those live jams that made his name in Englewood, he punches out tough rhythmic jams on the Roland equipment that defined the sound of Chicago house\u2019s first wave. Guiding the beats are his vocals, deeper and raspier than before. His personal favourite is the track Body Muzik. \u201cIt\u2019s got the funkiness, the old school rapping, the acid and the hard distorted vocals,\u201d he says. \u201cI just love it.\u201d God may have made him funky, but Mike Dunn has kept it going ever since.</p> <p>\u2022 My House from All Angles is out now on Defected / Classic Music Company</p>",

But, says Dunn, \u201cNew York City ran the rap game and the Chicago house scene was crazy, so, apart from people like Twista, Crucial Conflict and Do Or Die, nobody wanted to do rap here.\u201d This is why he, Cooper and fellow producer Fast Eddie incorporated their love of funky rap vocals and hip\u2013hop beats into house grooves and came up with hip\u2013house, \u201cbecause we weren\u2019t taken seriously with rap\u201d. But word of his rap production, under the name the Incredible MD, eventually spread to the coasts. A bidding war started between Jimmy Iovine\u2019s Interscope Records and Sean \u201cPuffy\u201d Combs\u2019 Bad Boy Records. After choosing to sign with Bad Boy, Dunn\u2019s luck hit a wall. In December 1999, Combs and the rapper Shyne were arrested for their alleged roles in a New York City nightclub shooting. By the spring of 2001, Combs had been acquitted of all charges and Shyne sentenced to 10 years in prison. The tabloid drama created a domino effect at Bad Boy that tipped over Dunn\u2019s deal. \u201cWe never got to the point of releasing anything \u2026 because [Combs] was so concerned about going to jail,\u201d says Dunn. \u201cWe were waiting on the sidelines until he got finished, and when he did he basically got rid of [\u2026] anything that was in that period that was bad for him, and my label was part of that.\u201d He admits, though, that there was \u201cnot correct business on my end,\u201d says Dunn. \u201cI rubbed [Combs] the wrong way.\u201d After the deal collapsed, Dunn kept a low profile. \u201cI was in a real dismal place and I didn\u2019t want nobody seeing me,\u201d he says, \u201cso I went underground.\u201d He started playing at neighbourhood parties again and word spread of his return. \u201cWhen you come back out after a long time, people start appreciating you a little different,\u201d he says. In 2008, he released his most celebrated club track, Phreaky MF, but only after a long delay \u2013 he promised his grandmother that he wouldn\u2019t release it while she was alive, because she disapproved of its hardcore sexual lyrics. \u201cI needed something to play that night at the Warehouse,\u201d Dunn says, \u201cso I just threw the track together, went in the booth, and started talking crazy over it. Nothing was written down or rehearsed \u2013 just me freestyling some wild stuff.\u201d That wild stuff still turns heads in the club in 2019 \u2013 it regards exactly what this enthusiastic and adventurous lover, who goes by the name of Mr 69, would do to you, blending chocolate, whipped cream and saliva with much raunchier fare. His macho kind of sexual bravado has aged surprisingly well on record; the track is a favourite of DJs such as Four Tet, and has a sonic kinship with the low\u2013slung bombastic funk of groups like LCD Soundsystem. One of those who noticed his return was Wayne Williams, seasoned label A&amp;R and elder of the Chosen Few, a respected group of house DJs that Williams founded in the late 70s. In 2012, Dunn earned a new nickname, \u201cThe Baby,\u201d as only the second member to be invited to join in 30 years. \u201cIn the last 10 years, there\u2019s been a resurgence of house in Chicago, which was in dire straits before,\u201d says Dunn. He sees the growth of the Picnic, the Chosen Few\u2019s one\u2013day festival that draws upwards of 40,000 people to Chicago\u2019s Jackson Park each July, as a shot in the arm for the dance music community in the US. \u201cIt let people know that it was still alive,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had to get it back to where we were looked at as the birthplace of house, not the graveyard of it.\u201d My House from All Angles features a new, garage\u2013tinged remix of Phreaky MF, but it\u2019s the new tracks that really shine. Going back to those live jams that made his name in Englewood, he punches out tough rhythmic jams on the Roland equipment that defined the sound of Chicago house\u2019s first wave. Guiding the beats are his vocals, deeper and raspier than before. His personal favourite is the track Body Muzik. \u201cIt\u2019s got the funkiness, the old school rapping, the acid and the hard distorted vocals,\u201d he says. \u201cI just love it.\u201d God may have made him funky, but Mike Dunn has kept it going ever since. \u2022 My House from All Angles is out now on Defected / Classic Music Company",

The world\u2019s most powerful nations are increasingly and unabashedly trading on the classic autocrats\u2019 recipe appealing to fear, avarice and resentment. Here in Australia, the recently re-elected conservative government, the \u201cLiberal party\u201d has been ramping up its resistance to climate crisis action and UN humanitarian rules while continually invoking \u201cnational security\u201d as the pretext for ignoring its transparency obligations. In democracies, the traditional conservative claim to be protecting national values has largely withered to become standard xenophobia, as its proponents scrape for some justification of its waxing monopolies of wealth and power. John Hayward Weegena, Tasmania, Australia Tiananmen Square needs to be put into context The revisiting of the terrible events in Tiananmen Square needs to be placed in the context of the long history of violence associated with the struggles over democracy and the rise of capitalism (7 June). Starting with the struggles associated with the rise of Athenian democracy, key turning points include the English civil war, the US civil war, the battle for women\u2019s emancipation and the struggles over slavery, race and democracy, particularly in the US and South Africa. Countless thousands have been killed, injured, imprisoned and tortured over this long-term struggle. The 1989 events in China are not unique, nor are they exclusively associated with a distorted version of communism. They should be condemned, but they need also to be understood in the context of the ongoing struggle for democracy. Stewart Sweeney Adelaide, South Australia Militarisation of space is the ultimate goal In 1969 I was at MIT happily watching a movie when it was rudely interrupted by the foolish US moon landing. I don\u2019t believe for a moment that the main goal of a new US moon landing will be to find rocks to solve geological mysteries about what happened 4bn years ago (Moon shot, 31 May). US governments are willing to spend trillions of dollars chiefly for wars or to maintain their military bases throughout the world. With coincidental planned lunar action also by Russia, China and India, I think we are observing the militarisation of space. Douglas Porteous Victoria, British Columbia, Canada Want to vote? Become a citizen where you live Monique Gallwey (Letters, 7 June) complains that, as an Irish citizen resident in France for the last 20 years, she has no vote in national elections in Ireland or France. The remedy lies probably in her own hands: become a citizen of the country of residence, as I did 20 years ago; since then I have enjoyed full voting rights here. Derek Murphy Bad Pyrmont, Germany The fields of Eton have a great deal to answer for Theresa May\u2019s departure inspires a flock of Tory hopefuls, but Boris Johnson remains the favourite to succeed May as prime minister (14 June). If Boris is the best the playing fields of Eton can produce in this particular hour of need, they have a lot to answer for. Lawrie Bradly Surrey Hills, Victoria, Australia",

      "bodyText": "Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party has been asked to check \u00a32.5m it has received in donations to ensure it has come from legitimate sources. The Electoral Commission will oversee checks carried out by the fledgling political party after criticising the way the party accepts gifts through online payment systems such as PayPal. Money that cannot be traced should be returned to the donor or given to the Treasury. The request follows a report released by the commission last Wednesday that said the party\u2019s structure \u201cleaves it open to a high and ongoing risk of receiving and accepting impermissible donations\u201d. New documents from the commission, which were released on Monday, show the party has been asked to \u201creview all payments, including those of \u00a3500 or below, it has received to date\u201d. The commission has also asked that the party amend its online system for accepting payments so that donors give their full address and contact details and that it use systems in future that will only accept payments from a card where the billing address matches the payer\u2019s address. Appearing before the digital, culture, media and sport committee, the commission\u2019s director of regulation, Louise Edwards, said: \u201cThey need to go back and look at the payments they have received, over or under \u00a3500, and they need to satisfy themselves that they are sure those amounts of money are permissible. And if they are not, they need to forfeit those amounts of money. \u201cIt\u2019s for the party to satisfy themselves of that \u2013 and we\u2019ll be watching them do that work.\u201d The party, which won 29 seats in last month\u2019s European elections, could face penalties unless it overhauls its fundraising system to ensure all donations above \u00a3500 come from the UK, as the law requires. Critics are concerned the party\u2019s present system allows an individual or a foreign power to make many small payments to a party, each less than \u00a3500, with no legal requirement for any details to be submitted. The elections watchdog also fined Labour a total of \u00a31,750 for inaccurate quarterly donations reports and an inaccurate spending return for the last general election. The Conservative party was given a \u00a3200 penalty in Wakefield for the late delivery of its 2017 statement of accounts, which it paid on 23 May. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party received four separate penalties, which it paid on 13 June, after an investigation by the commission. Commenting on the Labour fines, Edwards said: \u201cThe reporting requirements are clear, so it is always disappointing when parties \u2013 especially well-resourced ones \u2013 fail to provide accurate reports. \u201cIt is vital that voters are given an opportunity to see full, accurate data on where parties\u2019 money comes from and how it is spent at elections.

      "bodyText": "The number of British Foreign Office staff overseas has fallen by more than 1,000 since 1989 due to a succession of cuts that have left core diplomatic funding at its lowest for 20 years, according to a report backed by prominent diplomats and former foreign secretaries. Staff numbers in London have been cut by a similar number, the report says. Many Whitehall departments have informal or ad hoc groups to lobby for extra spending in their areas of interest, but the Foreign Office has been squeezed for more than two decades because of a mixture of austerity, increased aid spending and pressure to increase military spending. The report by the British Foreign Policy Group, launched on Tuesday with the support of the Coalition for Global Prosperity, claims the cuts in staffing are inhibiting the Foreign Office\u2019s ability to engage with local populations and may have contributed to the misreading of key recent events, such as the Arab spring and the Ukraine uprising. It also accuses the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, of subterfuge in claiming large-scale staffing increases are under way. Nearly a third of the diplomatic staff in Commonwealth embassies were cut in the four years to 2016, with cuts of similar levels in Asia. In one of its key findings, the report says that since the UK joined the EEC in 1973 core diplomatic spending has fallen from 0.5% of public sector current expenditure to 0.1%. The report finds that if the government continues with its projected cuts, core diplomatic funding will fall to its lowest level in 20 years. The Foreign Office core budget in 2017-18 stood at \u00a31.2bn out of \u00a3306.1bn-worth of departmental expenditure. The proportion of funding available to the FCO to spend at its discretion is described by the report\u2019s authors as capricious and unstable. In one budget cycle alone \u2013 2014-15 to 2015-16 \u2013 the FCO\u2019s administration and programme expenditure was cut by \u00a3178m (17.2%), and, according to the FCO\u2019s own accounts, is yet to return to its 2014-15 level despite the department having been given additional money to prepare for Brexit. Meanwhile, its capital budget lost \u00a3104m (63%) from 2014-15 to 2016-17 and this year is projected to be 25% smaller than in 2013-14. The report cites Sir William Patey, a former British ambassador to Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, saying there simply is \u201cnot time any more\u201d for diplomatic staff to travel the country and engage at length with local people.

      "bodyText": "Some of the best and worst of examples of cycling infrastructure in cities have hit the headlines this week. On Monday, the Bicycle Architecture Biennale \u2013 which celebrates cutting edge designs from around the world \u2013 launched in Amsterdam. Schemes included a 8km bicycle skyway in Xiamen \u2013 China\u2019s first suspended cycle path and the world\u2019s longest aerial cycle lane, and projects from cities as far afield as Australia, the US and of course the Netherlands. Not one of the 15 selected projects, however, were from the UK. In fact, Britain\u2019s cycling commissioners have criticised the government for wasting hundreds of millions of pounds painting white lines on busy roads and calling them cycle lanes, which do nothing to make people feel safer on a bike. Chris Boardman, walking and cycling commissioner for Greater Manchester, said: \u201cIt\u2019s tragic that hundreds of millions of pounds of government money has been spent on substandard cycling and walking infrastructure.\u201d The commissioners are calling for an end to car-centric transport planning and a move towards investment decisions that \u201caccount for the true cost of car use to society\u201d. In another blow to cyclists in the UK, Kensington and Chelsea council last week shelved a scheme to introduce new pedestrian crossings and install protected bike routes on a stretch of busy west London roads.

      "body": "<p>Dominican-American slam poet Elizabeth Acevedo has become the first ever writer of colour to win the UK\u2019s most prestigious children\u2019s books award, the Carnegie medal, which has a history stretching back to 1936 and includes Arthur Ransome, CS Lewis and Neil Gaiman among its former winners.</p> <p>Acevedo, the daughter of Dominican immigrants, took the medal for her debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/08/young-adult-teen-fiction-roundup-suffragette-surface-breaks-nikesh-shukla-david-almond\">The Poet X</a>. A verse novel, it tells of a quiet Dominican girl, Xiomara, who joins her school\u2019s slam poetry club in Harlem and is, according to the judges, \u201ca searing, unflinching exploration of culture, family and faith within a truly innovative verse structure\u201d. Xiomara \u201ccomes to life on every page and shows the reader how girls and women can learn to inhabit, and love, their own skin\u201d.</p> <p>The book is dedicated to \u201call the little sisters yearning to see themselves\u201d, and one of her former students in particular. Acevedo was an eighth-grade English teacher in Maryland when the impetus for the novel struck her: one of her students, Katherine, wouldn\u2019t read any of the books Acevedo offered her, telling her : \u201cNone of these books are about us.\u201d</p> <p>So Acevedo set out to write \u201ca story that sounds like and depicts the same kind of neighbourhood\u201d she and her students are from. \u201cWhen your body takes up more room than your voice / you are always the target of well-aimed rumors, / which is why I let my knuckles talk for me,\u201d she writes in The Poet X. \u201cI\u2019ve forced my skin just as thick as I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis was a girl who physically seemed to be taking up so much space but felt she had to be withdrawn, she was afraid to push the boundaries,\u201d Acevedo said. \u201cHer body takes up so much attention it would be easy to forget all the things she\u2019s thinking, things she won\u2019t say. I wanted to be really close to those feelings and show the everyday magic and beauty that quiet folks can hold.\u201d</p> <p>Acevedo is no longer a teacher but she returns to the school where she taught every year, and knows that her former students, including Katherine, have read her novel. In her speech after winning the medal she said:\u201cI felt like this student had given me a challenge, or at least permission to to write a story about young people who take up space, who do not make themselves small, who learn the power of their own words.\u201d</p> <p>Acevedo\u2019s win comes two years after the prize <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/08/carnegie-and-kate-greenaway-medals-all-white-longlists-prompt-inquiry\">instigated an independent review</a> into its historical lack of racial diversity, following widespread anger at 2017\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/16/all-white-carnegie-medal-longlist-anger-childrens-authors-philip-pullman\">20-book, entirely white</a> longlist.

It also found a dearth of books by writers of colour were being published in the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61f223fc5f8445bde85e22153c022fd7e8d03676\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61f223fc5f8445bde85e22153c022fd7e8d03676/0_0_6378_4346/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kingfisher (1)-3 Illustration from the book The Lost Words\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jackie Morris\u2019s Kingfisher illustration from The Lost Words.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied by Penguin books</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tuesday\u2019s ceremony also saw the illustrator Jackie Morris win the Kate Greenaway medal for illustration for The Lost Words, a response to the Oxford Junior Dictionary\u2019s decision to remove everyday nature words such as \u201cacorn\u201d, \u201cbluebell\u201d and \u201ckingfisher\u201d, as they were not being used enough by children.

      "bodyText": "Dominican-American slam poet Elizabeth Acevedo has become the first ever writer of colour to win the UK\u2019s most prestigious children\u2019s books award, the Carnegie medal, which has a history stretching back to 1936 and includes Arthur Ransome, CS Lewis and Neil Gaiman among its former winners. Acevedo, the daughter of Dominican immigrants, took the medal for her debut, The Poet X. A verse novel, it tells of a quiet Dominican girl, Xiomara, who joins her school\u2019s slam poetry club in Harlem and is, according to the judges, \u201ca searing, unflinching exploration of culture, family and faith within a truly innovative verse structure\u201d. Xiomara \u201ccomes to life on every page and shows the reader how girls and women can learn to inhabit, and love, their own skin\u201d. The book is dedicated to \u201call the little sisters yearning to see themselves\u201d, and one of her former students in particular. Acevedo was an eighth-grade English teacher in Maryland when the impetus for the novel struck her: one of her students, Katherine, wouldn\u2019t read any of the books Acevedo offered her, telling her : \u201cNone of these books are about us.\u201d So Acevedo set out to write \u201ca story that sounds like and depicts the same kind of neighbourhood\u201d she and her students are from. \u201cWhen your body takes up more room than your voice / you are always the target of well-aimed rumors, / which is why I let my knuckles talk for me,\u201d she writes in The Poet X. \u201cI\u2019ve forced my skin just as thick as I am.\u201d \u201cThis was a girl who physically seemed to be taking up so much space but felt she had to be withdrawn, she was afraid to push the boundaries,\u201d Acevedo said. \u201cHer body takes up so much attention it would be easy to forget all the things she\u2019s thinking, things she won\u2019t say. I wanted to be really close to those feelings and show the everyday magic and beauty that quiet folks can hold.\u201d Acevedo is no longer a teacher but she returns to the school where she taught every year, and knows that her former students, including Katherine, have read her novel. In her speech after winning the medal she said:\u201cI felt like this student had given me a challenge, or at least permission to to write a story about young people who take up space, who do not make themselves small, who learn the power of their own words.\u201d Acevedo\u2019s win comes two years after the prize instigated an independent review into its historical lack of racial diversity, following widespread anger at 2017\u2019s 20-book, entirely white longlist. After interviews with more than 600 people, from librarians to children, the review concluded that the UK\u2019s overwhelmingly white librarian workforce, who nominate books for the medal, were mostly unaware of titles by writers of colour. It also found a dearth of books by writers of colour were being published in the UK. Tuesday\u2019s ceremony also saw the illustrator Jackie Morris win the Kate Greenaway medal for illustration for The Lost Words, a response to the Oxford Junior Dictionary\u2019s decision to remove everyday nature words such as \u201cacorn\u201d, \u201cbluebell\u201d and \u201ckingfisher\u201d, as they were not being used enough by children. The book, written by Robert Macfarlane, features his poems alongside Morris\u2019s images of the excised words and has become a cultural phenomenon, with members of the public raising funds to ensure schools around the country have copies. Alison Brumwell, who chaired the panel of librarians who picked the winners, called it an \u201castonishing book which deserves the highest accolades\u201d. \u201cThe illustrations test our acuity and make us all think on a much deeper level about scale, colour and proportion; also, about representations of loss and absence. We are invited to \u2018read\u2019 on more than one level and to reflect upon a world in which change can mean irreparable loss, impoverishing both language and the environment,\u201d said Brumwell. Morris said that she believes the response to The Lost Words has been so strong because \u201cinstinctively, we know that we are not separate from nature, we\u2019re part of it\u201d. \u201cCertainly in urban environments, we\u2019ve almost divorced ourselves from a close connection with it, and I think there is a hunger to return to those connections \u2013 and it\u2019s also an enormous necessity,\u201d she said. Morris ended her acceptance speech on Tuesday with a call to her fellow authors and illustrators, artists and musicians \u201cto help to tell the truth about what is happening to this small and fragile world we inhabit, to re-engage with the natural world, to inspire and to imagine better ways to live. \u201cBecause there is no Planet B and we are at a turning point. And because in order to make anything happen it first needs to be imagined. And as writers and illustrators for children we grow the readers and thinkers of the future,\u201d she said.",

What\u2019s more, the show, which follows the merger of two Yorkshire schools \u2013 one predominately white, the other mostly Asian \u2013 has amassed a devoted young audience that has continued to grow with each season. Channel 4\u2019s figures suggest that 32% of its viewers are aged between 16 and 34, the channel\u2019s highest youth skewing drama since 2015\u2019s This Is England 90. Meanwhile, a robust online presence includes Tumblr sites devoted to various different characters, eager Twitter feeds counting down the days until the show\u2019s return and a savvy social media presence that utilises everything from Instagram to Snapchat.</p> <p>\u201cThe enormous response from younger viewers did really take me by surprise,\u201d says series creator Ayub Khan-Din, best-known for the film East Is East. \u201cI think every school show that\u2019s gone before \u2013 Grange Hill, Waterloo Road \u2013 they\u2019ve all had something to say to the generation that\u2019s watched them, but the thing with this generation is that they\u2019re very tech savvy and so the way in which they communicate their feelings about the show is so different. Of course, it means we have millions of critics, who know the show backwards and let us know instantly if they don\u2019t like something, but I think that\u2019s what makes it exciting.\u201d</p> <p>Channel 4 commissioning editor Manpreet Dosanjh agrees. \u201cWhen the trailer for the third series was released we instantly had superfans breaking it down, creating memes, \u201d she says. \u201cOne of the big reasons that Ackley works is that we hit a sweet spot between outrageous conversations and memorable characters who have viewers going: \u2018I love those characters, they\u2019re like me.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efc736ef37f370b7e5fa189b4745f51b8f49294e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efc736ef37f370b7e5fa189b4745f51b8f49294e/14_0_2813_1688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mandy (Jo Joyner), Mr Evershed (Robert James-Collier) and Sue Carp (Charlie Hardwick)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mandy (Jo Joyner), Mr Evershed (Robert James-Collier) and Sue Carp (Charlie Hardwick)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Penny Woolcock, who has directed a number of episodes, including its pilot, was keen to ensure that Ackley Bridge remained rooted in its Yorkshire community.

His mother, a nurse, and father, a lay minister, also instilled in him an interest in \u201chumanity and society\u201d. His \u201cepiphany moment\u201d came, he says, when he joined Redthread in 2002 and set up a young people\u2019s drop-in health clinic at a GP practice.</p> <p>\u201cI questioned how easy it was going to be to do good relational youth work in a health context \u2026 it sounded like it was going to be a bit clinical,\u201d he says, explaining that he shared a consulting room with the local midwives.

Redthread believes that targeting difficult-to-engage young people at a point of crisis in their lives \u2013 when they have been seriously injured provides a \u201cteachable moment\u201d when they are most likely to be receptive to advice and support. Its <a href=\"https://www.redthread.org.uk/evaluation-yvip-programme/\" title=\"\">own evaluation</a> of its youth violence intervention programme (YVIP) in 2017-18, found that 57% of young people had reduced involvement with violence after working with the charity.</p> <p>The YVIP now operates across three of the capital\u2019s major trauma centre hospitals; an A&amp;E in Hackney, east London; and it commissions the St Giles Trust charity to deliver a similar scheme at the Royal London hospital.</p> <p>And a three-year pilot, supported by the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/serious-violence-strategy\" title=\"\">serious violence strategy</a>, is bringing the model to three hospitals in Birmingham and Nottingham. Yet Poyton is keen to stress that \u201cviolence is a health issue\u201d. He describes Redthread as a health charity, not a \u201cgangs, violence and knife crime organisation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason we\u2019ve scaled the work around violence is because violence is a health issue that doesn\u2019t already have other referral pathwaysor other support mechanisms in place,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/15/sajid-javid-youth-knife-crime-cardiff-model\">Sajid Javid, the answer to youth knife crime lies in hospitals \u2013 and it\u2019s been proven | John Poyton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked what he thinks of the government\u2019s strategy to tackle serious violence, Poyton replies: \u201cThe criminal justice system or the policing system has recognised for quite some time that they can\u2019t arrest their way out of the problem \u2026 that actually this is not just about gangs and criminality, it\u2019s about safeguarding the vulnerable,\u201d he says.

Figures provided by around half of English hospitals showed that more than 4,500 11- to 25-year-olds attended A&amp;E in 2018 after an assault by a knife or other weapon. Redthread believes that targeting difficult-to-engage young people at a point of crisis in their lives \u2013 when they have been seriously injured provides a \u201cteachable moment\u201d when they are most likely to be receptive to advice and support. Its own evaluation of its youth violence intervention programme (YVIP) in 2017-18, found that 57% of young people had reduced involvement with violence after working with the charity. The YVIP now operates across three of the capital\u2019s major trauma centre hospitals; an A&amp;E in Hackney, east London; and it commissions the St Giles Trust charity to deliver a similar scheme at the Royal London hospital. And a three-year pilot, supported by the government\u2019s serious violence strategy, is bringing the model to three hospitals in Birmingham and Nottingham. Yet Poyton is keen to stress that \u201cviolence is a health issue\u201d. He describes Redthread as a health charity, not a \u201cgangs, violence and knife crime organisation\u201d. \u201cThe reason we\u2019ve scaled the work around violence is because violence is a health issue that doesn\u2019t already have other referral pathwaysor other support mechanisms in place,\u201d he says. Asked what he thinks of the government\u2019s strategy to tackle serious violence, Poyton replies: \u201cThe criminal justice system or the policing system has recognised for quite some time that they can\u2019t arrest their way out of the problem \u2026 that actually this is not just about gangs and criminality, it\u2019s about safeguarding the vulnerable,\u201d he says. He welcomes the pledge from the home secretary, Sajid Javid, to follow the successful Scottish approach that treats serious violence as primarily a public health issue, not a crime, as he thinks it will help to break down funding silos between the NHS, the police and other services. \u201cIt\u2019s a good framework as it brings people together to think outside of the box,\u201d he says. Poyton wants Redthread\u2019s YVIP model to be in GP practices, A&amp;Es and all of England\u2019s major trauma centres. \u201cWe ought to be meeting that young person the first time they come through the emergency department,\u201d he says. Although he believes the NHS is \u201camazing\u201d, he feels young people are being let down by it. Because medical training is focused on babies, children and adults, adolescents, he says, have specific needs that are not being met. Redthread runs an adolescent outreach service from King\u2019s College hospital in south-east London, which aims to improve the care of teenagers in hospital. Poyton says: \u201cAn awful lot more work done needs to be done to create equity in the health system for young people.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age: 45. Lives: South London.

The relationship was a brief one, and Michel and his mother settled in London so that she could pursue her acting career. He was educated at the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais in London, Ratcliffe college in Leicestershire and at Queen\u2019s University in Belfast. He first worked for the Prices and Incomes commission as a number cruncher and after five years moved to the Netherlands to work for the EEC\u2019s assistance programme for Africa in a similar role, rising to be deputy head of finance and personnel. He left in 1998, remaining in the Netherlands for a year as a freelance consultant before returning to the UK. In London he spent almost 15 years working for Precise Media Monitoring, responsible for translating French, Dutch and German news stories for clients until he reached retirement age in 2014. In his 20s and 30s he had served as a reservist with the British army. A gentleman with old-fashioned good manners, after retiring he worked part-time as a language exam invigilator. He was also a volunteer and fundraiser for a number of charities, was involved with several amateur dramatic societies, including the Carlton theatre group of Wimbledon, and sang in the Morley College choir in south-east London. His marriage to Christine (nee Swayne), in the early 1980s, ended in divorce a decade later. He is survived by two half-sisters, Anne and Alice, from his father\u2019s marriage to Barbara Windebank. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 June 2019 to clarify family details.",

My wife [Lyn-Z Adams Hawkins] is a multi-X Games gold medalist, my four- and five-year-old girls are already riding bikes, so I know we need to try to do whatever we can to keep everybody healthy. Yes, it\u2019s still dangerous and it still hurts, but mostly it is a calculated risk and the guys can get back up.</p> <p><strong>Is your backyard full of ramps for your kids?</strong> We have airbags, foam-pits and, well, basically, it\u2019s a ramp graveyard.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve broken more than 90 bones and had 25 concussions.

How? </strong>I almost bled to death when I shattered my pelvis when I was 15 and though I didn\u2019t break my spinal cord, it just wasn\u2019t attached to anything. I spent two weeks passing out, got my back fused, then I was in a wheelchair for four months. But six months after that I was back riding and eight months later I was 100%. When I had my ankle injury in 2011, I was barely walking eight months later. So the ankle was worse because it took me off the bike for longer \u2013 which was tough for me mentally.</p> <p><strong>You completed one of the jumps Evel Knievel couldn\u2019t \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/09/travis-pastrana-evel-knievel-jumps-motorcycle-las-vegas\">landing the Caesars Palace fountain jump</a> \u2013 how did it feel to go one better than him?</strong> That was a lot of fun! He was a pioneer of action sports, he showed everyone you could fly a motorcycle and brought the showmanship with it. It was a chance for me to show my father\u2019s generation how far stuntmen have come and to show my kids\u2019 generation where stuntmen came from.

Is that the best way to beat the traffic? </strong>Without a doubt, the flow was great! That was one of the stunts that Mike Metzger, one of the icons of the sport, attempted back in 2006. He broke his back and fell in the water but it made me think: \u2018Ah, could be done.\u2019</p> <p><strong>You once Thelma and Louise-d it into the Grand Canyon on a bike, parachuting clear at the last minute, did you have to go back and tidy up the wreckage? </strong>That was fun but I kinda messed it up and almost died, which wasn\u2019t ideal.

      "bodyText": "You\u2019re bringing the first Nitro World Games to be staged outside the USA to Cardiff in May 2020 \u2013 er, what is it? Basically, the World Games is the big air of action sports. We\u2019ll be bringing the best competitors in the world with us \u2013 these are the world championships \u2013 but this is also the only action sports top tier championship event that has open qualifying. We wanted to find an area in the UK that had mountain biking, surfing and zip lines, so Wales fitted the bill. Also, we needed an enclosed stadium to take out the elements. The Principality Stadium is perfect. You\u2019re going to ride motorbikes all over the pristine Principality Stadium turf. Have you ever faced a big, angry Welsh rugby player before? Ha! We won\u2019t rip anything up, we promise. What\u2019s the allure of doing silly things that might hurt you in front of lots of people? Well, we\u2019re constantly evolving the ramps to make the landings safer, so that aspect of is much smaller than it once was. My wife [Lyn-Z Adams Hawkins] is a multi-X Games gold medalist, my four- and five-year-old girls are already riding bikes, so I know we need to try to do whatever we can to keep everybody healthy. Yes, it\u2019s still dangerous and it still hurts, but mostly it is a calculated risk and the guys can get back up. Is your backyard full of ramps for your kids? We have airbags, foam-pits and, well, basically, it\u2019s a ramp graveyard. You\u2019ve broken more than 90 bones and had 25 concussions. What bits of you are broken, falling off, bent the wrong way or bleeding today? I\u2019m in as good health as I can get at this point! You once separated your spine from your pelvis when a motorbike landing went wrong \u2013 but you reckon breaking your ankle was worse. How? I almost bled to death when I shattered my pelvis when I was 15 and though I didn\u2019t break my spinal cord, it just wasn\u2019t attached to anything. I spent two weeks passing out, got my back fused, then I was in a wheelchair for four months. But six months after that I was back riding and eight months later I was 100%. When I had my ankle injury in 2011, I was barely walking eight months later. So the ankle was worse because it took me off the bike for longer \u2013 which was tough for me mentally. You completed one of the jumps Evel Knievel couldn\u2019t \u2013 landing the Caesars Palace fountain jump \u2013 how did it feel to go one better than him? That was a lot of fun! He was a pioneer of action sports, he showed everyone you could fly a motorcycle and brought the showmanship with it. It was a chance for me to show my father\u2019s generation how far stuntmen have come and to show my kids\u2019 generation where stuntmen came from. It wasn\u2019t about besting Evel Knievel at all. Evel Knievel changed his name from Robert Knievel. Ever been tempted by Bananas Pastrana(s)? Ahahaha! Not yet \u2026 Last time you were in London, you did a backflip across the Thames on a bike. Is that the best way to beat the traffic? Without a doubt, the flow was great! That was one of the stunts that Mike Metzger, one of the icons of the sport, attempted back in 2006. He broke his back and fell in the water but it made me think: \u2018Ah, could be done.\u2019 You once Thelma and Louise-d it into the Grand Canyon on a bike, parachuting clear at the last minute, did you have to go back and tidy up the wreckage? That was fun but I kinda messed it up and almost died, which wasn\u2019t ideal. I wasn\u2019t wearing any pads because I figured either the chute would open and I would be fine, or it wouldn\u2019t and I would be dead. But I hit the ground on a really steep downslope and tumbled through some cactus. The bike exploded at the bottom and there were pieces everywhere, but we did clear it all up. How wise is it to disembark a plane by jumping out of it without a parachute, as you did in 2007? It was kind of pass or fail, that one.

Rob Zombie was the support act and he\u2019s my five-year-old\u2019s favourite. She heard one of his songs in a movie and went from Taylor Swift to Rob Zombie overnight. Favourite TV show? The Simpsons. What would you put into Room 101 [Small Talk explains for the 1,000,000th or possibly 1,000,001st time what Room 101 is, yet still finds itself asking this question]? This is Catch-22 because I survive on social media, but social media. What would you have for a last meal? Ice cream and steak. Most famous person in your phone contacts? Vanilla Ice. Wow. Tell us a joke. What time is it when you go to the dentist? [Small Talk doesn\u2019t know] What time is it when you go to the dentist? Tooth-hurty! Let\u2019s leave it there, Bananas.

The band\u2019s success continued in spite of Mustaine\u2019s drug problems, which saw him enter rehab at the turn of the 90s. Mustaine, who has voiced support for both the Democrats and Republicans in the past, stated in 2012 that he believed Barack Obama was not born in the US despite the publication of Obama\u2019s birth certificate.

      "body": "<p>Thirty years ago, a jury found Kiranjit Ahluwalia guilty of murdering her husband. Her subsequent appeal changed the way that the concept of \u201cprovocation\u201d was applied, and helped shift the attitude of English courts and the public on the impact of domestic violence on women who kill.</p> <p>It led to the later freeing of two other women \u2013 Emma Humphreys and Sara Thornton \u2013 and was also relied on in the recent case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/29/devoted-wife-who-killed-husband-with-hammer-sally-challen\">Sally Challen</a>, who this year successfully appealed against her conviction for murdering her coercive and controlling husband.</p> <p>At the age of 23, Ahluwalia was pushed into an arranged marriage. She gave up studying law and moved to England from India with her husband, Deepak, in 1979. For 10 years she endured violence, rape and sexual abuse from her controlling husband who treated her like a slave. When she could stand it no longer, she set fire to his bedclothes while he slept. Although she had not intended to kill him, he died 10 days later and she was charged with his murder.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/may/28/landmarks-in-law\">Landmarks in law: Sally Bercow and the first major 'Twibel' case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her plea of manslaughter due to provocation was rejected. The jury found her guilty of murder and she was sentenced to life in prison.</p> <p>Ahluwalia recalls: \u201cWhen I got my life sentence and my trial solicitor said there were no grounds of appeal, that was a big blow. I had no lawyer, no family, I ended up with a life sentence. I lost everything.\u201d</p> <p>After a couple of days, she wrote to Pragna Patel, director of the campaigning charity Southall Black Sisters, which this year celebrates its 40th anniversary of fighting for women\u2019s rights. The group, backed by <a href=\"https://www.justiceforwomen.org.uk/\">Justice for Women</a>, won an appeal in 1992 on the grounds that expert evidence and psychiatric reports had not been presented at the original trial.</p> <p>After a retrial, Ahluwalia was found guilty of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility. She was sentenced to three years and four months in prison \u2013 the time she had already served \u2013 and was released immediately. Her story was made into the 2006 film Provoked, starring Aishwarya Rai and Miranda Richardson.</p> <p>At the time of her trial, her plea of provocation \u2013 which is a partial defence to murder \u2013 failed because the law demanded an immediate incident of provocation that acted as a trigger to a loss of self-control. In her case, a few hours had elapsed between her husband\u2019s last attack and her act of retaliation, which was deemed to be a \u201ccooling down\u201d period and not a \u201cboiling over\u201d period, as her defence suggested.</p> <p>Ahluwalia\u2019s case, says Harriet Wistrich, director of Justice for Women, was one of a series of important cases in the early 90s that brought to the fore the issue of victims of domestic violence who kill. \u201cIn legal terms these cases brought changes to the defence of provocation by introducing such concepts as slow-burn provocation and cumulative provocation,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Wistrich explains that they highlighted the fact that the provocation defence had been designed to assist men who lost control and responded with anger. Meanwhile, women were more likely to endure abusive conduct over a longer period, which would accumulate to a stage when they would ultimately lose control.</p> <p>As Patel explains: \u201cThe discriminatory law was based on male standards of behaviour and did not allow for the examination of the abusive, coercive, controlling and constraining context in which abused women kill. Nor did it allow for the very real social, cultural and economic reasons that can prevent exit from abuse.\u201d</p> <p>The case, says Patel, was not just about differences in physical strength and ways in which anger or rage is built up. It was about the social and political realities in which men and women find themselves, and the failure of state agencies to take domestic violence and abuse seriously. \u201cWe were not asking for a licence to kill, but for the contexts in which abused women kill to be better understood,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The groundbreaking case, says Patel, \u201cshone a spotlight on domestic violence in South Asian communities and helped to create awareness of how the patriarchal concepts of honour and shame silence South Asian women\u201d.</p> <p>The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 abolished the defence of provocation and replaced it with loss of control, which, says Patel, \u201cbetter reflects women\u2019s reality while not being lenient on men who claim that they lost self-control due to adultery or in anger\u201d.</p> <p>Despite an improved awareness and response to abused women, Patel insists that the criminal justice system continues to reflect gender bias in the laws of self-defence. But, she adds, the recent case of Challen has helped to develop an even greater judicial and societal awareness of the concepts of coercion and control as a form of domestic abuse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/29/devoted-wife-who-killed-husband-with-hammer-sally-challen\">'I miss him so much': why did a devoted wife kill the man she loved?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Wistrich points out, a lot of the facts of Ahluwalia\u2019s case were mirrored in Challen\u2019s. \u201cIf the words and framework were there at the time, [Ahluwalia\u2019s case] would also have been described as a coercive and controlling relationship,\u201d she suggests.</p> <p>Thirty years on, Ahluwalia reflects: \u201cIt all seems like a bad dream \u2026 People now understand more about the abuse that goes on.

      "bodyText": "Thirty years ago, a jury found Kiranjit Ahluwalia guilty of murdering her husband. Her subsequent appeal changed the way that the concept of \u201cprovocation\u201d was applied, and helped shift the attitude of English courts and the public on the impact of domestic violence on women who kill. It led to the later freeing of two other women \u2013 Emma Humphreys and Sara Thornton \u2013 and was also relied on in the recent case of Sally Challen, who this year successfully appealed against her conviction for murdering her coercive and controlling husband. At the age of 23, Ahluwalia was pushed into an arranged marriage. She gave up studying law and moved to England from India with her husband, Deepak, in 1979. For 10 years she endured violence, rape and sexual abuse from her controlling husband who treated her like a slave. When she could stand it no longer, she set fire to his bedclothes while he slept. Although she had not intended to kill him, he died 10 days later and she was charged with his murder. Her plea of manslaughter due to provocation was rejected. The jury found her guilty of murder and she was sentenced to life in prison. Ahluwalia recalls: \u201cWhen I got my life sentence and my trial solicitor said there were no grounds of appeal, that was a big blow. I had no lawyer, no family, I ended up with a life sentence. I lost everything.\u201d After a couple of days, she wrote to Pragna Patel, director of the campaigning charity Southall Black Sisters, which this year celebrates its 40th anniversary of fighting for women\u2019s rights. The group, backed by Justice for Women, won an appeal in 1992 on the grounds that expert evidence and psychiatric reports had not been presented at the original trial. After a retrial, Ahluwalia was found guilty of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility. She was sentenced to three years and four months in prison \u2013 the time she had already served \u2013 and was released immediately. Her story was made into the 2006 film Provoked, starring Aishwarya Rai and Miranda Richardson. At the time of her trial, her plea of provocation \u2013 which is a partial defence to murder \u2013 failed because the law demanded an immediate incident of provocation that acted as a trigger to a loss of self-control. In her case, a few hours had elapsed between her husband\u2019s last attack and her act of retaliation, which was deemed to be a \u201ccooling down\u201d period and not a \u201cboiling over\u201d period, as her defence suggested. Ahluwalia\u2019s case, says Harriet Wistrich, director of Justice for Women, was one of a series of important cases in the early 90s that brought to the fore the issue of victims of domestic violence who kill. \u201cIn legal terms these cases brought changes to the defence of provocation by introducing such concepts as slow-burn provocation and cumulative provocation,\u201d she says. Wistrich explains that they highlighted the fact that the provocation defence had been designed to assist men who lost control and responded with anger. Meanwhile, women were more likely to endure abusive conduct over a longer period, which would accumulate to a stage when they would ultimately lose control. As Patel explains: \u201cThe discriminatory law was based on male standards of behaviour and did not allow for the examination of the abusive, coercive, controlling and constraining context in which abused women kill. Nor did it allow for the very real social, cultural and economic reasons that can prevent exit from abuse.\u201d The case, says Patel, was not just about differences in physical strength and ways in which anger or rage is built up. It was about the social and political realities in which men and women find themselves, and the failure of state agencies to take domestic violence and abuse seriously. \u201cWe were not asking for a licence to kill, but for the contexts in which abused women kill to be better understood,\u201d she says. The groundbreaking case, says Patel, \u201cshone a spotlight on domestic violence in South Asian communities and helped to create awareness of how the patriarchal concepts of honour and shame silence South Asian women\u201d. The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 abolished the defence of provocation and replaced it with loss of control, which, says Patel, \u201cbetter reflects women\u2019s reality while not being lenient on men who claim that they lost self-control due to adultery or in anger\u201d. Despite an improved awareness and response to abused women, Patel insists that the criminal justice system continues to reflect gender bias in the laws of self-defence. But, she adds, the recent case of Challen has helped to develop an even greater judicial and societal awareness of the concepts of coercion and control as a form of domestic abuse. As Wistrich points out, a lot of the facts of Ahluwalia\u2019s case were mirrored in Challen\u2019s. \u201cIf the words and framework were there at the time, [Ahluwalia\u2019s case] would also have been described as a coercive and controlling relationship,\u201d she suggests. Thirty years on, Ahluwalia reflects: \u201cIt all seems like a bad dream \u2026 People now understand more about the abuse that goes on. Women have started coming out because they know now that there is help.\u201d",

The strike is set to disrupt services for thousands of passengers in London, Berkshire, Surrey, Hampshire, Dorset, Devon, the Isle of Wight and Somerset. A reduced service is running across the network, although extra morning and evening trains were expected to run between London Waterloo and Reading to help ferry racegoers heading to Royal Ascot.

In 2017, May had told Tory party members that she would take the UK out of the single market and a customs union, two pledges that posed the problem of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and maintaining \u201cfrictionless trade\u201d. Rogers said: \u201cI am worried that the longer the sheer lack of seriousness and honesty, the delusion mongering goes on, the more we imperil our long-term prospects. \u201cI was in Brussels running the preparation process for the then prime minister\u2019s first European council in October 2016, and able to feel the severe frost \u2013 and, as I say, also the total internal solidarity - her speech 10 days previously to the party conference had engendered,\u201d Rogers recalled. \u201cWell just think ahead to the October European council this year, three years on, which will be the EU debut, and perhaps the final curtain too, for the next PM, just two weeks after a first party conference leader\u2019s speech. \u201cAnd do we think whoever wins the leadership contest will, in their first leader\u2019s speech to conference, have set out a subtle, nuanced, principled and collaborative approach to sober up the party faithful for the many difficult compromises ahead?\u201d",

In 1981, my friend Dave bought it and let me tape it. I remember hearing Atrocity Exhibition (which we all thought was called \u201castro-city exhibition\u201d) and even before it was finished I\u2019d fallen in love with Joy Division. I spent more time in high school listening to them than I did with my friends and family and the band are a huge influence [on me]. Sonically \u2013 for the way in which they melded traditional instruments with synthesisers and drum machines \u2013 thematically and even aesthetically. I spent years wishing I could live in the empty warehouse where they shot <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuObGsB0No\">the Love Will Tear Us Apart video</a> and then, lo and behold, I spent years living in empty warehouses. In many ways it\u2019s hard to separate Joy Division from New Order, who inspired all of the early techno and house producers, myself included \u2013 I\u2019ve covered New Dawn Fades. Joy Division continue to resonate because of that combination of beauty and brutality. Ian managed to beautifully express what so many of us are unable to.</p> <h2>Zoe Lambert on channelling Joy Division into fiction</h2> <p>Growing up in Manchester, Joy Division were part of the musical landscape. When editor Richard V Hirst was approaching writers for the book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/27/we-were-strangers-stories-inspired-by-unknown-pleasures-joy-division-richard-v-hirst-review\">We Were Strangers:</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/27/we-were-strangers-stories-inspired-by-unknown-pleasures-joy-division-richard-v-hirst-review\"> Stories Inspired by Unknown Pleasures</a>, he said my writing had a northern grimness which reminded him of their music.</p> <p>I was told to choose a song and write a story. I chose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfKXjtakQu0\">She\u2019s Lost Control</a> because the subject matter \u2013 a woman with epilepsy \u2013 dovetailed with things I\u2019d been writing about, such as disability, caring and illness. I listened to Unknown Pleasures while writing. The beat of She\u2019s Lost Control is powerful, like a heartbeat. The song has scenes in the lyrics: \u201cShe walked upon the edge of no escape / And laughed \u2018I\u2019ve lost control.\u2019\u201d I was interested in the myth of Ian Curtis \u2013 the broody young man \u2013 but also, he was married with a baby, and worked as a disablement resettlement officer. The song is almost a memorial about a girl who came in looking for a job and then died. We don\u2019t know her name, that really touched me, and I was thinking about how it impacted him when he developed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/epilepsy\">epilepsy</a>. I wanted to write a story that gave her something \u2013 she finds a job \u2013 but with Joy Division\u2019s element of teenage yearning and desire to leave a mark. The publisher\u2019s fiction editor, Tim Shearer, was at the same school as Ian. He had a fan club even then.</p> <h2>Director Zia Anger on how Joy Division influenced her film, I Remember Nothing</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/108832629\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/108832629?app_id=122963\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In 2007, my father took me to see the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/05/popandrock.joydivision\">Control</a> because we\u2019d learned that somebody in our family had epilepsy, this mysterious disease that is never talked about. The movie was the only time I\u2019d seen a cinematic depiction of epilepsy that didn\u2019t sensationalise it, so when I was making a film about it I started listening to Unknown Pleasures. The song I Remember Nothing was lyrically amazing, and the title fitted a moment in my script where the character says: \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d The script is based on the five stages of a grand mal seizure. I was interested in discussing something unspeakable or unknowable through a creative lens, like Ian was doing. Lack of sleep, alcohol and lights all trigger seizures, so how hard it must be to have this happening for just doing what every other young person is doing. The depression that must result from that really resonated with me, but going back to the lyrics and realising that he was trying to process what was happening to him was powerfully inspiring. The lyrics to I Remember Nothing have the <a href=\"https://www.shortoftheweek.com/2016/03/08/i-remember-nothing/\">poetry that I wanted the character to have</a>, and capture the mystery of being human. I just hope people don\u2019t show up thinking it\u2019s a Joy Division movie.</p> <h2>Curator Matthew Higgs on Joy Division\u2019s influence on visual artists and designers</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f179418bc7b556a3b081289f04e484c324f8cbd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f179418bc7b556a3b081289f04e484c324f8cbd1/0_0_1448_1449/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cover art for Unknown Pleasures.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cover art for Unknown Pleasures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Record Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I grew up near Preston, so saw Joy Division at least five times when I was 14 or 15. I saw the Bury riot gig and the Preston show, a famous bootleg. We used to watch them rehearse on Sunday afternoons. When they went to the pub they\u2019d leave us with their instruments and let us play them. They were unusually accommodating. I went to art school, became director of exhibitions at the Institute of Contemporary Arts and moved to New York to curate at the White Columns gallery because of Joy Division. They were ordinary people who did something extraordinary and after seeing them live, something fundamentally shifted in our aspirations.</p> <p>In 2017, I organised the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/04/true-faith-review-the-exhilarating-art-and-afterlife-of-joy-division-and-new-order\">True Faith exhibition</a> in Manchester with Jon Savage and Johan Kugelberg to draw attention to how Joy Division function as a catalyst for all kinds of people: film-makers, photographers, clothes designers, and artists such as Martin Boyce, Jeremy Deller and Mark Leckey. Glenn Brown dedicated his first three years\u2019 work to Ian and Julian Schnabel made a painting based on the cover of Closer. Our world wouldn\u2019t look the way it does without what [Joy Division sleeve designer] Peter Saville was doing in Manchester. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d have got to art without their help.</p> <h2>Tim Burgess on how Joy Division shaped independent music</h2> <p>Unknown Pleasures is one of my most played records. When I used to listen to it through headphones, trying to understand it, it used to put me in a trance: it did something to me. My friends called it \u201cvampire music\u201d. One of my first bands were called Interzone and we did a cover of New Dawn Fades. Ian is a major influence, as a singer and lyrically; if I try to borrow anything from him directly it doesn\u2019t fit into what I do but he is my favourite frontman.</p> <p>Joy Division created a blueprint for how a band could operate independently. Growing up in Manchester and Cheshire, the fact that they were from Salford and Macclesfield, on an independent label, doing it with their mates, inspired me to form a band with my closest friends, be on an independent and with Closer engineer Chris Nagle producing. I felt I was doing what I\u2019d been taught. Like Joy Division and New Order, I still try to make every setlist different and go with the feeling. I have a tattoo of FAC 33 \u2013 Ceremony, written by Joy Division, performed by New Order, on Factory Records \u2013 on my shoulder bone. It\u2019s recognising something I carry with me for ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"382559109ad71babe11ccc6ab04125e62c3980fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/382559109ad71babe11ccc6ab04125e62c3980fc/0_0_3753_2766/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Curtis and Peter Hook.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"737\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He managed to beautifully express what so many of us are unable to\u2019 ... Ian Curtis and Peter Hook.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Mills/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Dr Jennifer Otter Bickerdike on Joy Division\u2019s impact on academia</h2> <p>I grew up in an Italian Catholic family [in California] where you were supposed to turn to God. I\u2019d had a bit of abuse in my family background and God hadn\u2019t helped but Ian\u2019s vocals touched something deep and dark in me that nothing else could. I\u2019d thought about killing myself lots of times but listening to that music and that voice, I still felt lonely, but not alone. When one of my best friends was murdered, I could not get far enough away. I sold everything to go to England and did a PhD on Joy Division to get a British passport. People at Goldsmith\u2019s thought I was nuts but Joy Division are a gift for academics. I interviewed 28 tribute bands, some as far away as Iran, and today, conferences attract academics from all over the world. The story is uncomfortable \u2013 troubled young man makes beautiful music and no one discovers what it means until he kills himself \u2013 but Ian meant what he was singing. I relate Joy Division to Siegfried Kracauer\u2019s theory, The Mass Ornament \u2013 they are like the centre of a wheel and so much is connected to them.</p> <h2>The Killers\u2019 Dave Keuning on Joy Division\u2019s legacy to rock guitarists</h2> <p>Growing up in middle America, I heard New Order on the radio and worked backwards. The guitar lines in Joy Division are really interesting which is why they\u2019ve inspired generations of guitarists. There\u2019s a lot of rough, out of tune, almost clean but with slightly dirty amps, and stark, angular playing. Bernard Sumner is kind of an underrated guitar player because he\u2019s become known as a singer, but he\u2019s a huge influence on me and you can definitely hear Joy Division all over the Killers.</p> <p>[Director] Anton Corbijn asked us to cover <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbKvxGgFfg\">Shadowplay</a> for Control and we loved doing it so much it stayed in the live set. Theirs is stark and monochrome, very late-70s Manchester. We did our own version but if I cover it again I might learn Bernard\u2019s guitar solo note for note, just to play homage. The Killers got their name from a New Order video and I used to play Crystal a lot in soundcheck, so playing it with them on stage felt like coming full circle. All my friends who know about Joy Division tend to have become musicians or creatives. I don\u2019t meet many average people into Joy Division.</p> <h2>Tim Marshall on how Love Will Tear Us Apart became a terrace favourite</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2qxtmqwqnY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q2qxtmqwqnY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Manchester United fans started singing \u201cGiggs will tear you apart again\u201d to the tune of Love Will Tear Us Apart when Ryan Giggs was [interim] manager in 2014. Most pop songs that become football chants are big commercial hits \u2013 think of White Stripes\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/07/oh-jeremy-corbyn-chant-white-stripes\">Seven Nation Army</a> or Slade songs in the 1970s. It\u2019s more unusual for a chant to come from alternative music, especially from a band not exactly known for exuberance. With Joy Division being from Salford and Macclesfield, they lend themselves to being sung at Manchester United, but now lots of other clubs have versions of the chant. When opposition fans taunted \u201cLeeds are falling apart again\u201d at my team, Leeds United, our fans adopted it ironically and now sing it when they\u2019re winning. I doubt if many people chanting it own Unknown Pleasures or Closer, but Love Will Tear Us Apart is an easy, melodic tune with simple repetitive words. It\u2019s tailor-made for chanting.</p> <p>\u2022 Jon Savage\u2019s oral history of Joy Division <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/24/jon-savage-joy-division-transcend-time-and-place-interview\">This Searing Light, the Sun and Everything Else</a> is published by Faber.

I chose She\u2019s Lost Control because the subject matter \u2013 a woman with epilepsy \u2013 dovetailed with things I\u2019d been writing about, such as disability, caring and illness. I listened to Unknown Pleasures while writing. The beat of She\u2019s Lost Control is powerful, like a heartbeat. The song has scenes in the lyrics: \u201cShe walked upon the edge of no escape / And laughed \u2018I\u2019ve lost control.\u2019\u201d I was interested in the myth of Ian Curtis \u2013 the broody young man \u2013 but also, he was married with a baby, and worked as a disablement resettlement officer. The song is almost a memorial about a girl who came in looking for a job and then died. We don\u2019t know her name, that really touched me, and I was thinking about how it impacted him when he developed epilepsy. I wanted to write a story that gave her something \u2013 she finds a job \u2013 but with Joy Division\u2019s element of teenage yearning and desire to leave a mark. The publisher\u2019s fiction editor, Tim Shearer, was at the same school as Ian. He had a fan club even then. Director Zia Anger on how Joy Division influenced her film, I Remember Nothing In 2007, my father took me to see the film Control because we\u2019d learned that somebody in our family had epilepsy, this mysterious disease that is never talked about. The movie was the only time I\u2019d seen a cinematic depiction of epilepsy that didn\u2019t sensationalise it, so when I was making a film about it I started listening to Unknown Pleasures. The song I Remember Nothing was lyrically amazing, and the title fitted a moment in my script where the character says: \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d The script is based on the five stages of a grand mal seizure. I was interested in discussing something unspeakable or unknowable through a creative lens, like Ian was doing. Lack of sleep, alcohol and lights all trigger seizures, so how hard it must be to have this happening for just doing what every other young person is doing. The depression that must result from that really resonated with me, but going back to the lyrics and realising that he was trying to process what was happening to him was powerfully inspiring. The lyrics to I Remember Nothing have the poetry that I wanted the character to have, and capture the mystery of being human. I just hope people don\u2019t show up thinking it\u2019s a Joy Division movie. Curator Matthew Higgs on Joy Division\u2019s influence on visual artists and designers I grew up near Preston, so saw Joy Division at least five times when I was 14 or 15. I saw the Bury riot gig and the Preston show, a famous bootleg. We used to watch them rehearse on Sunday afternoons. When they went to the pub they\u2019d leave us with their instruments and let us play them. They were unusually accommodating. I went to art school, became director of exhibitions at the Institute of Contemporary Arts and moved to New York to curate at the White Columns gallery because of Joy Division. They were ordinary people who did something extraordinary and after seeing them live, something fundamentally shifted in our aspirations. In 2017, I organised the True Faith exhibition in Manchester with Jon Savage and Johan Kugelberg to draw attention to how Joy Division function as a catalyst for all kinds of people: film-makers, photographers, clothes designers, and artists such as Martin Boyce, Jeremy Deller and Mark Leckey. Glenn Brown dedicated his first three years\u2019 work to Ian and Julian Schnabel made a painting based on the cover of Closer. Our world wouldn\u2019t look the way it does without what [Joy Division sleeve designer] Peter Saville was doing in Manchester. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d have got to art without their help. Tim Burgess on how Joy Division shaped independent music Unknown Pleasures is one of my most played records. When I used to listen to it through headphones, trying to understand it, it used to put me in a trance: it did something to me. My friends called it \u201cvampire music\u201d. One of my first bands were called Interzone and we did a cover of New Dawn Fades. Ian is a major influence, as a singer and lyrically; if I try to borrow anything from him directly it doesn\u2019t fit into what I do but he is my favourite frontman. Joy Division created a blueprint for how a band could operate independently. Growing up in Manchester and Cheshire, the fact that they were from Salford and Macclesfield, on an independent label, doing it with their mates, inspired me to form a band with my closest friends, be on an independent and with Closer engineer Chris Nagle producing. I felt I was doing what I\u2019d been taught. Like Joy Division and New Order, I still try to make every setlist different and go with the feeling. I have a tattoo of FAC 33 \u2013 Ceremony, written by Joy Division, performed by New Order, on Factory Records \u2013 on my shoulder bone. It\u2019s recognising something I carry with me for ever. Dr Jennifer Otter Bickerdike on Joy Division\u2019s impact on academia I grew up in an Italian Catholic family [in California] where you were supposed to turn to God. I\u2019d had a bit of abuse in my family background and God hadn\u2019t helped but Ian\u2019s vocals touched something deep and dark in me that nothing else could. I\u2019d thought about killing myself lots of times but listening to that music and that voice, I still felt lonely, but not alone. When one of my best friends was murdered, I could not get far enough away. I sold everything to go to England and did a PhD on Joy Division to get a British passport. People at Goldsmith\u2019s thought I was nuts but Joy Division are a gift for academics. I interviewed 28 tribute bands, some as far away as Iran, and today, conferences attract academics from all over the world. The story is uncomfortable \u2013 troubled young man makes beautiful music and no one discovers what it means until he kills himself \u2013 but Ian meant what he was singing. I relate Joy Division to Siegfried Kracauer\u2019s theory, The Mass Ornament \u2013 they are like the centre of a wheel and so much is connected to them. The Killers\u2019 Dave Keuning on Joy Division\u2019s legacy to rock guitarists Growing up in middle America, I heard New Order on the radio and worked backwards. The guitar lines in Joy Division are really interesting which is why they\u2019ve inspired generations of guitarists. There\u2019s a lot of rough, out of tune, almost clean but with slightly dirty amps, and stark, angular playing. Bernard Sumner is kind of an underrated guitar player because he\u2019s become known as a singer, but he\u2019s a huge influence on me and you can definitely hear Joy Division all over the Killers. [Director] Anton Corbijn asked us to cover Shadowplay for Control and we loved doing it so much it stayed in the live set. Theirs is stark and monochrome, very late-70s Manchester. We did our own version but if I cover it again I might learn Bernard\u2019s guitar solo note for note, just to play homage. The Killers got their name from a New Order video and I used to play Crystal a lot in soundcheck, so playing it with them on stage felt like coming full circle. All my friends who know about Joy Division tend to have become musicians or creatives. I don\u2019t meet many average people into Joy Division. Tim Marshall on how Love Will Tear Us Apart became a terrace favourite Manchester United fans started singing \u201cGiggs will tear you apart again\u201d to the tune of Love Will Tear Us Apart when Ryan Giggs was [interim] manager in 2014. Most pop songs that become football chants are big commercial hits \u2013 think of White Stripes\u2019 Seven Nation Army or Slade songs in the 1970s. It\u2019s more unusual for a chant to come from alternative music, especially from a band not exactly known for exuberance. With Joy Division being from Salford and Macclesfield, they lend themselves to being sung at Manchester United, but now lots of other clubs have versions of the chant. When opposition fans taunted \u201cLeeds are falling apart again\u201d at my team, Leeds United, our fans adopted it ironically and now sing it when they\u2019re winning. I doubt if many people chanting it own Unknown Pleasures or Closer, but Love Will Tear Us Apart is an easy, melodic tune with simple repetitive words. It\u2019s tailor-made for chanting. \u2022 Jon Savage\u2019s oral history of Joy Division This Searing Light, the Sun and Everything Else is published by Faber. Tim Marshall is the author of Dirty Northern Bastards! And Other Tales from the Terraces: The Story of Britain\u2019s Football Chants.",

Last week, Washington blamed Iran for attacks on two oil tankers, more than a year after Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal and restoring economic sanctions. Nuclear diplomacy. Iran said it would soon exceed limits on how much enriched uranium it has stockpiled, breaching the nuclear deal. Tehran is said to have maintained the terms until now, despite Trump\u2019s withdrawal.

That is how many Facebook users who should be able to exchange dollars and other currencies into digital coins, which can then be used to make purchases on the internet and in shops, or to transfer money. Trump trails Democratic rivals as 2020 campaign begins Donald Trump will formally get his re-election campaign under way today amid a ferocious backlash against his presidency, with polls appearing to favour many of his possible Democratic opponents \u2013 though history urges caution in forecasting results. More than 16 months out from election day in November 2020, Trump will hold a rally at the Amway Center in Orlando, Florida. Democrats will look to challenge proceedings, staging a counter-rally outside the stadium featuring speeches from locals who say they have personally borne the brunt of the president\u2019s policies.

Jones denied the allegations. Brazilian rappers in Make America Great Again hats are providing the soundtrack to Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s far-right presidency, saying he promotes values they believe in despite recognising they have \u201celected a meme\u201d.

Of the 22 people who voted in awarding the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in December 2010, several including Sepp Blatter, Jack Warner, Ricardo Teixeira, Chuck Blazer, Rafael Salguero and Michel Platini have either been banned from football or indicted on corruption charges.</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;Additionally there have been concerns over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/21/qatar-2022-40-a-week-to-build-the-world-cup-stadiums\">human rights abuses of construction workers building the new stadiums</a> needed for the bid, and campaigners have criticised hosting the World Cup in a country where LGBT relationships are banned.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The then Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, has said Platini told him he had changed his vote from the USA to Qatar after the lunch, and that a decisive three further European Fifa executive committee members changed their vote to Qatar.

National links between the two countries were also strengthened; in 2011 Qatar Airways bought 50 A320 neo-family planes made by Airbus at its factory in Toulouse, an order <a href=\"https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2017/12/qatar-airways-reconfirms-and-upsizes-its-order-for-50-a321neo-ac.html\">reaffirmed in December 2017</a>. Gu\u00e9ant and Dion are reported to have been at the November 2010 lunch, as Sarkozy advisers. In 2015, Sarkozy responded to questions about the Elysee palace lunch by scoffing that it was an exaggeration of his power to suggest he could influence Platini.</p> \n<p>Platini and Blatter were banned from football activities after Platini was paid 2m CHF by Fifa in 2011; both men claimed it was in payment for Platini\u2019s work as a Fifa football adviser, which he had finished nine years earlier in 2002. Platini continues to protest his innocence of any wrongdoing in relation to that payment, and has mounted a series of legal appeals against his ban, which is due to expire in October.</p>",

The detention of Platini, who voted for Qatar to host the tournament, represents the first substantial public move in an investigation into the 2022 decision opened two years ago by France\u2019s Parquet National Financier, which is responsible for law enforcement against serious financial crime. According to the judicial sources, the PNF is investigating possible \u201cprivate corruption\u201d, \u201ccriminal conspiracy\u201d and \u201cinfluence peddling and trading in influence\u201d over the December 2010 vote, which are categories of corruption in French law. Platini\u2019s representatives issued a statement stressing he had not been arrested \u2013 which was confirmed by the judicial authorities\u2019 source \u2013 and that the detention was for a \u201ctechnical\u201d reason to maintain the confidentiality of the interview. The statement said Platini had also been questioned about Uefa\u2019s award, by a single vote, of the 2016 European Championship to France. Platini was said to be \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d that he had done nothing wrong and \u201chad nothing to reproach himself for\u201d. A main focus for the investigation is reported in French media to be the lunch Platini has acknowledged publicly he had with Sarkozy and Tamim al-Thani, the current Emir of Qatar, on 23 November 2010, less than a fortnight before the Fifa vote for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosts. At the time, France was seeking strong economic links with mega-wealthy Qatar, and Paris Saint-Germain, the club Sarkozy supports, were in decline and financial difficulties. Platini has said he understood Sarkozy wanted him to wield his Uefa vote for Qatar but denied that he was influenced. In an interview with the Guardian in 2013, Platini said of that lunch: \u201cI knew Sarkozy wanted the people from Qatar to buy PSG. I understood that Sarkozy supported the candidature of Qatar. But he never asked me, or to vote for Russia [for 2018]. He knows my personality. I always vote for what is good for football. Not for myself, not for France.\u201d The then Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, has said Platini told him he had changed his vote from the USA to Qatar after the lunch, and that a decisive three further European Fifa executive committee members changed their vote to Qatar. Platini did say in 2015, when he was a candidate to replace Blatter as president, that he \u201cmight have told\u201d US football delegates previously that he would vote for their bid but he has denied changing his mind because of the lunch. A fortnight ago in Paris before the Fifa congress, Platini told the Guardian that he had made his mind up to vote for Qatar before the lunch. His son, Laurent, in 2012 joined the Qatar sportswear company Burrda, owned by Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), as the chief executive, which Platini has always denied had anything to do with his vote, or represented a conflict of interest. After Qatar\u2019s shock victory in the Fifa vote, QSI did buy PSG in 2011, and the Qatar sovereign fund has since funded the club to a massive degree, enabling them to sign Neymar, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and other stars, and become a European football power. National links between the two countries were also strengthened; in 2011 Qatar Airways bought 50 A320 neo-family planes made by Airbus at its factory in Toulouse, an order reaffirmed in December 2017. Gu\u00e9ant and Dion are reported to have been at the November 2010 lunch, as Sarkozy advisers. In 2015, Sarkozy responded to questions about the Elysee palace lunch by scoffing that it was an exaggeration of his power to suggest he could influence Platini. Platini and Blatter were banned from football activities after Platini was paid 2m CHF by Fifa in 2011; both men claimed it was in payment for Platini\u2019s work as a Fifa football adviser, which he had finished nine years earlier in 2002. Platini continues to protest his innocence of any wrongdoing in relation to that payment, and has mounted a series of legal appeals against his ban, which is due to expire in October.",

      "body": "<p>Like much of what is published on Fifa\u2019s website, its account of what it calls \u201cthe inaugural Women\u2019s World Cup\u201d is served up with a healthy dollop of official spin and doesn\u2019t quite tell the whole story. The basics are all covered, of course: staged in China in 1991 the tournament was contested by 12 teams and won by the USA, who beat Norway in a final staged at Guangzhou\u2019s Tianhe Stadium and played in front of 65,000 people.</p> <p>Fifa boasts that, for the first time in the organisation\u2019s history, six female match officials were appointed to help officiate at the tournament \u201cin keeping with the true spirit of the celebration\u201d. One of them, Claud\u00eda de Vasconcelos of Brazil, was given the honour of refereeing the third-place play-off when Sweden played Germany. There are, however, a number of far more intriguing vignettes that are notable by their absence from the official account of a tournament at which world football\u2019s governing body claims that \u201cwomen\u2019s football celebrated its true coming of age\u201d. They serve to demonstrate just how far the sport had yet to go and has since come.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbeffb7016c3b1e8582359586f27f453d27bff79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbeffb7016c3b1e8582359586f27f453d27bff79/0_353_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The first Fifa all-female referee team line up before the third-place play-off between Sweden and Germany.

At the time, it was called the The Fifa Women\u2019s World Championship For The M&amp;Ms Cup, a none-too-subtle nod to Mars, who had bought the sole sponsorship rights. Fifa had been unwilling to commit its valuable \u201cWorld Cup brand\u201d to the women\u2019s game before a ball had been kicked lest the tournament should turn out to be a commercial failure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d5f73a3c820f3f4a2c4c0f8a61b57fe9b69f069\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d5f73a3c820f3f4a2c4c0f8a61b57fe9b69f069/0_0_1317_872/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Front (top) and reverse of a ticket for the Fifa Women\u2019s World Championship which was held in China in 1991 and sponsored by Mars confectionery company.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Front (top) and reverse of a ticket for the Fifa Women\u2019s World Championship which was held in China in 1991 and sponsored by Mars confectionery company.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Football Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hopes that it would be a success were high, however. Three years before China had staged a Fifa Women\u2019s Invitation Tournament, won by Norway, to test the feasibility of a proper international championship. On the back of what was deemed a huge success, China was subsequently awarded the hosting rights for the inaugural \u201cWorld Cup\u201d, not least because its efforts to secure an Olympics meant it was in its best interests to ensure everything ran smoothly.</p> <p>Matches were well attended in six stadiums ranging in capacity from 12,000 to 65,000. Workers from local factories were press-ganged into attending to ensure no seats were left empty while different sets of \u201cfans\u201d were allocated different teams to support. While 65,000 were present for the final it is unclear how many of those present had much of an idea what they were watching.</p> <p>While Fifa is to be commended for its commitment to further advancing the cause of women\u2019s football, not least because it has turned it into such a popular cash cow, its desperation to make allowances for those playing in China was slightly contradictory. Despite a fairly punishing schedule that meant the finalists, Norway and USA, had to play six matches each across two weeks, it was decided that games would last only 80 minutes in case the players found a full-length game too exhausting.</p> <p>This particular wheeze prompted the USA captain, April Heinrichs, to joke that Fifa was \u201cafraid our ovaries were going to fall out if we played 90\u201d. Before the tournament Fifa also toyed with, but ultimately vetoed, the idea of using smaller footballs than those to which the players were accustomed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"56c3574935f3d6ba6bd0cc08fbbe3066eff5d602\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56c3574935f3d6ba6bd0cc08fbbe3066eff5d602/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Nigeria goalkeeper Oyeka Anna Agumanu and the defender Omon-Love Branch combine to thwart Germany\u2019s Heidi Mohr, who still scored twice in a 4-0 win.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nigeria goalkeeper Oyeka Anna Agumanu and the defender Omon-Love Branch combine to thwart Germany\u2019s Heidi Mohr, who still scored twice in a 4-0 win.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tommy Cheng/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Amateur players like all their rivals, the American players arrived jet-lagged after a 36-hour journey, having taken a series of flights to cut costs. Each player got by on $10 per diems and they played in hand-me-down kit that had been worn by a male youth team. Playing an intense pressing game in searing heat they saw off Sweden, Brazil and Japan to top their group and set up a quarter-final against Taiwan (then Chinese Taipei), whom they swatted aside 7-0. They got five more in the semi-final, beating a Germany side that scored two to set up a final against Norway.</p> <p>Thanksgiving Day fell during the short gap between the semi-final and the final. The Americans gathered for a celebration with family members who had travelled with them and one very special guest, Pel\u00e9, who joined them for turkey with as many of the trimmings as they could find in China. </p> <p>In a recent edition of Sports Illustrated\u2019s Throw Back podcast, hosted by Grant Wahl, Michelle Akers made no secret of her contempt for their opponents in the final. \u201cWe hated those damned Norwegians,\u201d said the team\u2019s star striker, who was part of a three-pronged American attack, known as \u201cthe triple-edged sword\u201d, along with Heinrichs and Carin Jennings. \u201cI loved the Norwegians personally but we hated that team because they were so good and tough and dirty.\u201d She scored both goals in a 2-1 win, and earned the golden boot for her 10 goals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e265d0928a4827322678d41edb4f1ce32db3c5b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e265d0928a4827322678d41edb4f1ce32db3c5b7/0_113_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mia Hamm (second left) clashes with Norway\u2019s Agnete Carlsen during the final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mia Hamm (second left) clashes with Norway\u2019s Agnete Carlsen during the final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tommy Cheng/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite being near exhaustion due to a schedule that was as relentless as their high pressing game, the Americans had won what would eventually be known as the first Women\u2019s World Cup. They did so to little fanfare as minimal broadcast coverage from one cable channel with a very short reach meant few at home could have watched them, even if they had known the tournament was taking place. Not that it bothered the winners. \u201cI was not at all disappointed by anything,\u201d said Heinrichs on Throw Back. \u201cIt meant the world to me. I\u2019m in China, playing in a world event under the Fifa flag with national anthems and full stadiums.\u201d</p> <p>Having been feted by their hosts, Team USA arrived home to be greeted by no more than a handful of people, including two reporters.

      "bodyText": "Like much of what is published on Fifa\u2019s website, its account of what it calls \u201cthe inaugural Women\u2019s World Cup\u201d is served up with a healthy dollop of official spin and doesn\u2019t quite tell the whole story. The basics are all covered, of course: staged in China in 1991 the tournament was contested by 12 teams and won by the USA, who beat Norway in a final staged at Guangzhou\u2019s Tianhe Stadium and played in front of 65,000 people. Fifa boasts that, for the first time in the organisation\u2019s history, six female match officials were appointed to help officiate at the tournament \u201cin keeping with the true spirit of the celebration\u201d. One of them, Claud\u00eda de Vasconcelos of Brazil, was given the honour of refereeing the third-place play-off when Sweden played Germany. There are, however, a number of far more intriguing vignettes that are notable by their absence from the official account of a tournament at which world football\u2019s governing body claims that \u201cwomen\u2019s football celebrated its true coming of age\u201d. They serve to demonstrate just how far the sport had yet to go and has since come. The brainchild of the Brazilian sports administrator, Jo\u00e3o Havelange, the controversial, long-serving Fifa president, this footballing jamboree was only retrospectively awarded its status as the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup 1991\u2122. At the time, it was called the The Fifa Women\u2019s World Championship For The M&amp;Ms Cup, a none-too-subtle nod to Mars, who had bought the sole sponsorship rights. Fifa had been unwilling to commit its valuable \u201cWorld Cup brand\u201d to the women\u2019s game before a ball had been kicked lest the tournament should turn out to be a commercial failure. Hopes that it would be a success were high, however. Three years before China had staged a Fifa Women\u2019s Invitation Tournament, won by Norway, to test the feasibility of a proper international championship. On the back of what was deemed a huge success, China was subsequently awarded the hosting rights for the inaugural \u201cWorld Cup\u201d, not least because its efforts to secure an Olympics meant it was in its best interests to ensure everything ran smoothly. Matches were well attended in six stadiums ranging in capacity from 12,000 to 65,000. Workers from local factories were press-ganged into attending to ensure no seats were left empty while different sets of \u201cfans\u201d were allocated different teams to support. While 65,000 were present for the final it is unclear how many of those present had much of an idea what they were watching. While Fifa is to be commended for its commitment to further advancing the cause of women\u2019s football, not least because it has turned it into such a popular cash cow, its desperation to make allowances for those playing in China was slightly contradictory. Despite a fairly punishing schedule that meant the finalists, Norway and USA, had to play six matches each across two weeks, it was decided that games would last only 80 minutes in case the players found a full-length game too exhausting. This particular wheeze prompted the USA captain, April Heinrichs, to joke that Fifa was \u201cafraid our ovaries were going to fall out if we played 90\u201d. Before the tournament Fifa also toyed with, but ultimately vetoed, the idea of using smaller footballs than those to which the players were accustomed. Amateur players like all their rivals, the American players arrived jet-lagged after a 36-hour journey, having taken a series of flights to cut costs. Each player got by on $10 per diems and they played in hand-me-down kit that had been worn by a male youth team. Playing an intense pressing game in searing heat they saw off Sweden, Brazil and Japan to top their group and set up a quarter-final against Taiwan (then Chinese Taipei), whom they swatted aside 7-0. They got five more in the semi-final, beating a Germany side that scored two to set up a final against Norway. Thanksgiving Day fell during the short gap between the semi-final and the final. The Americans gathered for a celebration with family members who had travelled with them and one very special guest, Pel\u00e9, who joined them for turkey with as many of the trimmings as they could find in China. In a recent edition of Sports Illustrated\u2019s Throw Back podcast, hosted by Grant Wahl, Michelle Akers made no secret of her contempt for their opponents in the final. \u201cWe hated those damned Norwegians,\u201d said the team\u2019s star striker, who was part of a three-pronged American attack, known as \u201cthe triple-edged sword\u201d, along with Heinrichs and Carin Jennings. \u201cI loved the Norwegians personally but we hated that team because they were so good and tough and dirty.\u201d She scored both goals in a 2-1 win, and earned the golden boot for her 10 goals. Despite being near exhaustion due to a schedule that was as relentless as their high pressing game, the Americans had won what would eventually be known as the first Women\u2019s World Cup. They did so to little fanfare as minimal broadcast coverage from one cable channel with a very short reach meant few at home could have watched them, even if they had known the tournament was taking place. Not that it bothered the winners. \u201cI was not at all disappointed by anything,\u201d said Heinrichs on Throw Back. \u201cIt meant the world to me. I\u2019m in China, playing in a world event under the Fifa flag with national anthems and full stadiums.\u201d Having been feted by their hosts, Team USA arrived home to be greeted by no more than a handful of people, including two reporters. Their success, however, laid the groundwork for a subsequent surge in popularity for women\u2019s football in the US while that of the tournament opened Fifa\u2019s eyes to the benefits of making the Women\u2019s World Cup a permanent and increasingly popular fixture in their calendar. \u201cIt was kind of like a silent trigger,\u201d said Heinrichs of a low-key triumph that continues to echo around the women\u2019s football world.",

I shut the whole world out and shut everything down.\u201d</p> <p>But the break \u2013 regardless of the emotions that came with it \u2013 was badly needed. \u201cGaining the perspective to reflect and reassess was paramount,\u201d Virtue says.</p> <p>After discussing a comeback in more detail, they earmarked former Canadian ice-dancers Marie-France Dubreuil and Patrice Lauzon as coaches and were eager to move to Montreal and get things started. But during their first conversation, Lauzon wanted them to explain their motivation for returning. It was a pre-requisite, he told them.</p> <p>\u201cThat floored us,\u201d Moir says. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get out of it by just saying, \u2018We want to win.\u2019 He just said, \u2018Well, that might not be enough. You need more than that if you want to come to our school.\u2019 It came down to the fact that we just felt we had more to give.\u201d</p> <p>In a new place and with a new coaching team, they were determined to push boundaries and rediscover the sport.</p> <p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t conforming to any one thing,\u201d Virtue says. \u201cWe lost this sense of trying to appease everyone else. We were more secure in who we were as people and athletes. We were more secure in what we stood for, what we valued and the art we wanted to create. I always loved skating but you can get hardened by it and it\u2019s discouraging and disheartening. You can lose that spark. Montreal ignited it again.\u201d</p> <p>In September 2016, they stepped into a rink in the Montreal borough of Pierrefonds and competed for the first time in two-and-a-half years at the Skate Canada Autumn Classic. The short dance was an electric, sensual tribute to Prince. Paired with the tenderness and contemporary slant of their free dance, it was a magnetic and thrilling package.</p> <p>Even so, it seemed a long shot that they would get the better of Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron, the French duo who were back-to-back world champions and unbeaten in two years. So, it was astonishing when Virtue and Moir ended the year on top of the Grand Prix podium for the first time in their careers and followed that up with a World Championship gold in 2017.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"26a9f110d4bb01e9f75e70b81b17458553a50701\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26a9f110d4bb01e9f75e70b81b17458553a50701/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir celebrate after becoming Olympic champions\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir celebrate after becoming Olympic champions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think people truly understand how difficult that is,\u201d Moir says. \u201cThree years is a long time. The game had evolved. And we\u2019re back in the arena, with the bright lights and everyone\u2019s faces looking back at us again. We did everything we could to prepare but there were a lot of tough steps. The goal was to not be our old selves. We knew we made a mistake in 2014. We didn\u2019t pick music that was dear to our hearts and weren\u2019t personally invested in a program. We vowed to never do that again.\u201d</p> <p>The new era was exciting but still left Virtue slightly underwhelmed. She was expecting something bigger, more explosive.</p> <p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d have this Ziggy Stardust moment,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018Representing Canada, Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir\u2019 and the whole crowd would turn and gasp and say, \u2018Who? Who\u2019s that blonde girl? That\u2019s not Tessa.\u2019 I thought we would totally reinvent ourselves. But it was finding the balance. \u2018Are we doing things differently just to be different or to be better?\u2019 And that was a constant dialogue between us.\u201d</p> <p>For Moir, the entire process became a safe harbour as he navigated a particularly difficult period.</p> <p>\u201c2017 was probably one of the hardest years of my life,\u201d he admits. \u201cThere were a lot of personal struggles. I lost some very important people. I had a best friend and then a grandfather pass away. Through it all, skating became an anchor. I used to think of it as a job. Now it was getting me through and giving me hope. Through all the heartache, it seemed worth it. Heading into the Olympic season, we were ready for almost anything.\u201d</p> <p>In the build-up to Pyeongchang, they were consistently behind Papadakis and Cizeron, particularly in the free dance. So, they dramatically altered their sombre Moulin Rouge routine to make it more Olympic-friendly.</p> <p>\u201cWe changed about two minutes of our program entirely,\u201d Virtue says. \u201cWe listened to people for eight years telling us we needed a big ending, people on their feet and the music to reach this massive crescendo. That\u2019s the Olympic moment people want. Once we were able to find that, it soared and began to take shape.\u201d</p> <p>It worked.</p> <p>The subsequent free dance performance sits alongside <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwAC1vV38Y\">Torvill and Dean\u2019s 1984 Bolero</a> as the greatest ice-dance moment in history. Those four spellbinding minutes were not only enough to ensure astounding and unlikely Olympic golds for the pair but to also define Virtue and Moir\u2019s legacy.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOEKdWrtz6U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wOEKdWrtz6U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cI had never felt momentum during a performance before,\u201d Virtue says. \u201cWe felt flow in Vancouver [when they won gold in 2010] and we chased that feeling for eight years. I went into the penultimate lift in Pyeongchang and I got chills because I felt the energy and electricity in the building shift.\u201d</p> <p>A different kind of momentum had been growing for a while too.</p> <p>Unlike their French rivals, Virtue and Moir took part in the team figure skating event a week earlier and quickly became viral sensations. In front of a global audience, the intensity of their chemistry, their innate closeness and the suggestiveness of certain choreography whipped new-found fans into a frenzy, especially across social media. When they found out Virtue and Moir were not involved in a romantic relationship, they didn\u2019t really accept it. Instead, they started to fantasize.</p> <p>There are dark corners of the digital sphere devoted to them, including some intense fan fiction. The disciples \u2013 and there are a lot of them \u2013 obsess over every look and every caress. \u201cIt\u2019s probably healthier to avoid it,\u201d Virtue says.</p> <p>But that\u2019s easier said than done. Last year, Moir spoke eloquently about the impact his unique athletic setup had on his personal life and how some partners found it difficult to properly understand his dynamic with Virtue. Before the Olympics, he was already daydreaming about what was on the other side. It\u2019s why he\u2019s so ready to move on to a new post-skating chapter and focus on things he spent so long sacrificing.</p> <p>\u201cI was ready for that transition,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was always skating first and I was finally at a point in my life where I could be a contributing member of my family and actually search for a life partner.\u201d</p> <p>Their relationship is a curious thing. When I ask Virtue to define it, she takes a deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019re the worst at answering this question\u201d, she begins. \u201cI wish we could help ourselves and everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>She speaks uninterrupted for a few minutes. It\u2019s essentially a meandering run-on sentence. Then she apologizes profusely for not supplying the right answer. But, of course, she had done. It\u2019s why the moment of their eyes meeting in Scotland explains so much of their story. Words are limiting and what Virtue and Moir have goes far beyond that, almost existing in the abstract.</p> <p>\u201cWe were made for each other, in a work relationship,\u201d Moir says. \u201cThere\u2019s real love there. We\u2019re so proud of the business relationship we have. And that\u2019s the story we want to tell more than anything. Judging by my girlfriend\u2019s Twitter, I think fans are disappointed a little bit that we\u2019re not a couple but we have a very amazing, unique relationship that hopefully young people can look at and think, \u2018Wow, that should be inspirational in its own right\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>When they stood on the podium immediately after their Olympic victory, Virtue \u2013 normally so poised \u2013 uncharacteristically welled up. \u201cIt was seeing 20 years flash in front of me,\u201d she says. Her voice cracks so she nervously laughs to cover the lump in her throat.</p> <p>\u201cThe little seven and nine-year-old kids who got together, who didn\u2019t speak and who just skated around a rink holding hands. On the world\u2019s biggest stage, with all of that pressure, in that very moment ... I was just very proud of Scott. It\u2019s funny. We both have this thing where it\u2019s hard for us to acknowledge our own success but we\u2019re able to see it in each other.\u201d</p> <p>Currently, there\u2019s an adjustment period. It\u2019s not about the Olympics anymore. There are <a href=\"http://rocktherink.com/\">touring shows</a> to produce and various other projects to plan for. They both admit that fully appreciating what they have and what they\u2019ve gone through together is something that will only come much later.</p> <p>For Moir, he\u2019s still struggling to wrap his head around the last year and a half. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it and I don\u2019t think I even have a proper perspective on it yet,\u201d he says. \u201cIt seems like it was a fairytale when I look back now.\u201d</p>",

Even so, it seemed a long shot that they would get the better of Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron, the French duo who were back-to-back world champions and unbeaten in two years. So, it was astonishing when Virtue and Moir ended the year on top of the Grand Prix podium for the first time in their careers and followed that up with a World Championship gold in 2017. \u201cI don\u2019t think people truly understand how difficult that is,\u201d Moir says. \u201cThree years is a long time. The game had evolved. And we\u2019re back in the arena, with the bright lights and everyone\u2019s faces looking back at us again. We did everything we could to prepare but there were a lot of tough steps. The goal was to not be our old selves. We knew we made a mistake in 2014. We didn\u2019t pick music that was dear to our hearts and weren\u2019t personally invested in a program. We vowed to never do that again.\u201d The new era was exciting but still left Virtue slightly underwhelmed. She was expecting something bigger, more explosive. \u201cI thought we\u2019d have this Ziggy Stardust moment,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018Representing Canada, Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir\u2019 and the whole crowd would turn and gasp and say, \u2018Who? Who\u2019s that blonde girl? That\u2019s not Tessa.\u2019 I thought we would totally reinvent ourselves. But it was finding the balance. \u2018Are we doing things differently just to be different or to be better?\u2019 And that was a constant dialogue between us.\u201d For Moir, the entire process became a safe harbour as he navigated a particularly difficult period. \u201c2017 was probably one of the hardest years of my life,\u201d he admits. \u201cThere were a lot of personal struggles. I lost some very important people. I had a best friend and then a grandfather pass away. Through it all, skating became an anchor. I used to think of it as a job. Now it was getting me through and giving me hope. Through all the heartache, it seemed worth it. Heading into the Olympic season, we were ready for almost anything.\u201d In the build-up to Pyeongchang, they were consistently behind Papadakis and Cizeron, particularly in the free dance. So, they dramatically altered their sombre Moulin Rouge routine to make it more Olympic-friendly. \u201cWe changed about two minutes of our program entirely,\u201d Virtue says. \u201cWe listened to people for eight years telling us we needed a big ending, people on their feet and the music to reach this massive crescendo. That\u2019s the Olympic moment people want. Once we were able to find that, it soared and began to take shape.\u201d It worked. The subsequent free dance performance sits alongside Torvill and Dean\u2019s 1984 Bolero as the greatest ice-dance moment in history. Those four spellbinding minutes were not only enough to ensure astounding and unlikely Olympic golds for the pair but to also define Virtue and Moir\u2019s legacy. \u201cI had never felt momentum during a performance before,\u201d Virtue says. \u201cWe felt flow in Vancouver [when they won gold in 2010] and we chased that feeling for eight years. I went into the penultimate lift in Pyeongchang and I got chills because I felt the energy and electricity in the building shift.\u201d A different kind of momentum had been growing for a while too. Unlike their French rivals, Virtue and Moir took part in the team figure skating event a week earlier and quickly became viral sensations. In front of a global audience, the intensity of their chemistry, their innate closeness and the suggestiveness of certain choreography whipped new-found fans into a frenzy, especially across social media. When they found out Virtue and Moir were not involved in a romantic relationship, they didn\u2019t really accept it. Instead, they started to fantasize. There are dark corners of the digital sphere devoted to them, including some intense fan fiction. The disciples \u2013 and there are a lot of them \u2013 obsess over every look and every caress. \u201cIt\u2019s probably healthier to avoid it,\u201d Virtue says. But that\u2019s easier said than done. Last year, Moir spoke eloquently about the impact his unique athletic setup had on his personal life and how some partners found it difficult to properly understand his dynamic with Virtue. Before the Olympics, he was already daydreaming about what was on the other side. It\u2019s why he\u2019s so ready to move on to a new post-skating chapter and focus on things he spent so long sacrificing. \u201cI was ready for that transition,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was always skating first and I was finally at a point in my life where I could be a contributing member of my family and actually search for a life partner.\u201d Their relationship is a curious thing. When I ask Virtue to define it, she takes a deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019re the worst at answering this question\u201d, she begins. \u201cI wish we could help ourselves and everyone else.\u201d She speaks uninterrupted for a few minutes. It\u2019s essentially a meandering run-on sentence. Then she apologizes profusely for not supplying the right answer. But, of course, she had done. It\u2019s why the moment of their eyes meeting in Scotland explains so much of their story. Words are limiting and what Virtue and Moir have goes far beyond that, almost existing in the abstract. \u201cWe were made for each other, in a work relationship,\u201d Moir says. \u201cThere\u2019s real love there. We\u2019re so proud of the business relationship we have. And that\u2019s the story we want to tell more than anything. Judging by my girlfriend\u2019s Twitter, I think fans are disappointed a little bit that we\u2019re not a couple but we have a very amazing, unique relationship that hopefully young people can look at and think, \u2018Wow, that should be inspirational in its own right\u2019\u201d. When they stood on the podium immediately after their Olympic victory, Virtue \u2013 normally so poised \u2013 uncharacteristically welled up. \u201cIt was seeing 20 years flash in front of me,\u201d she says. Her voice cracks so she nervously laughs to cover the lump in her throat. \u201cThe little seven and nine-year-old kids who got together, who didn\u2019t speak and who just skated around a rink holding hands. On the world\u2019s biggest stage, with all of that pressure, in that very moment ... I was just very proud of Scott. It\u2019s funny. We both have this thing where it\u2019s hard for us to acknowledge our own success but we\u2019re able to see it in each other.\u201d Currently, there\u2019s an adjustment period. It\u2019s not about the Olympics anymore. There are touring shows to produce and various other projects to plan for. They both admit that fully appreciating what they have and what they\u2019ve gone through together is something that will only come much later. For Moir, he\u2019s still struggling to wrap his head around the last year and a half. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it and I don\u2019t think I even have a proper perspective on it yet,\u201d he says. \u201cIt seems like it was a fairytale when I look back now.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday, Facebook announced a digital currency called Libra that will roll out for use in 2020 and allow the platform\u2019s billions of users across the globe to make financial transactions online. The new technology threatens to change the landscape of banking and is already the subject of scrutiny, as Facebook faces increasing calls for regulation and antitrust measures. But regulatory questions aside \u2013 how soon can you use Facebook\u2019s new digital coin to buy coffee? Here\u2019s what you need to know. What is Libra? Facebook says Libra is a \u201cglobal currency and financial infrastructure\u201d. In other words, it is a digital asset built by Facebook and powered by a new Facebook-created version of blockchain, the encrypted technology used by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Why is it called Libra? The name Libra comes from the basic Roman measurement of weight. The abbreviation lb for pound is derived from Libra, and the \u00a3 symbol originally comes from an ornate L in Libra. Why is Facebook launching a cryptocurrency, and are they allowed? Facebook claims it wants to reach the 1.7 billion people around the world who do not have access to a bank account. The company is likely to run into regulatory hurdles and antitrust concerns, especially at a time when many regulators want to break up Facebook, but no specific legislation has been put forth ahead of the launch. Amidst rumours of Facebook\u2019s new financial expansion, members of the US Senate wrote to CEO Mark Zuckerberg in May asking for clarification on privacy concerns. Who is in charge of Libra? The currency will be serviced by a collective of companies called the \u201cLibra Association\u201d. It functions as what is known as a \u201cstablecoin\u201d, pegged to existing assets like the dollar or euro, in the aim of making it less subject to the volatility that many cryptocurrencies experience. The Libra Association is described by Facebook as an independent, not-for-profit organisation based in Switzerland. It serves two main functions: to validate transactions on the Libra blockchain and to manage the reserve Libra is tied to and allocate funds to social causes. Within the Libra Association will be a governing body called the Libra Association Council, comprised of a representative of each member of the association, which will vote on policy and operating decisions. Facebook claims that although it created the Libra Association and the Libra Blockchain, once the currency is launched in 2020 the company will withdraw from a leadership role and all members of the association will have equal votes in governance of Libra. The companies who contributed a minimum of $10m(\u00a38m) to be listed as founding members of the Libra Association include tech companies such as PayPal, Ebay, Spotify, Uber and Lyft, as well as financial and venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Visa and Mastercard.

      "bodyText": "Facebook has announced a digital currency called Libra that will allow its billions of users to make financial transactions across the globe, in a move that could potentially shake up the world\u2019s banking system. Libra is being touted as a means to connect people who do not have access to traditional banking platforms. With close to 2.4 billion people using Facebook each month, Libra could be a financial game changer, but will face close scrutiny as Facebook continues to reel from a series of privacy scandals. Libra could be a welcome lift to Facebook\u2019s profits: analysts are suggesting Libra could be a huge moneymaker for Facebook, arriving as its growth slows. US lawmakers were quick to raise privacy concerns about the new currency. Shortly after Facebook\u2019s announcement, the congresswoman and chair of the House Financial Services Committee, Maxine Waters, called on the company to put a stop to the project until Congress and regulators could review it. She also called on company executives to testify before the committee. \u201cFacebook has data on billions of people and has repeatedly shown a disregard for the protection and careful use of this data,\u201d Waters said in a statement. \u201cWith the announcement that it plans to create a cryptocurrency, Facebook is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.\u201d Technology to make transactions with Libra will be available as a standalone app \u2013 as well as on WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger platforms \u2013 as early as 2020. It will allow consumers to send money to each other as well as potentially pay for goods and services using the Facebook-backed digital currency instead of their local currency. But with the company in the crosshairs over multiple privacy violations, the move is already attracting scrutiny from financial regulators and privacy advocates across the world. Facebook is currently facing a potential $5bn (\u00a34bn) fine from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which opened an investigation in response to the Cambridge Analytica revelations first reported by the Guardian and Observer. US and UK officials have previously expressed concern about Facebook\u2019s move into the financial sector. In May, members of the US Senate committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs wrote to Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO, asking him to answer questions on privacy concerns and financial regulation. \u201cIt is important to understand how large social platforms make data available that can be used in ways that have big implications for consumers\u2019 financial lives,\u201d the letter said. \u201cIt is also important to understand how large social platforms use financial data to profile and target consumers.\u201d Facebook executives claim the Libra system will help the many millions of people without bank accounts but with access to mobile phones to enter the banking world and to more seamlessly send money. While Facebook created the currency, decisions regarding the ongoing maintenance of the Libra platform will be carried out by the Libra Association, a collective of dozens of financial, not-for-profit companies, and commerce firms. To join the new Facebook subsidiary, each of these companies contributed a minimum of $10m to the venture, giving the company more than $1bn to put towards the new currency. Companies involved include Mastercard, PayPal, the crypto exchange Coinbase, and eBay. Also joining the Libra Association are the ride-hailing startups Uber and Lyft and non-profit financial organisations Women\u2019s World Banking, micro-loan platform Kiva, and humanitarian aid group Mercy Corps. The foundation will be headquartered in Geneva and Facebook claims it will be independent from governments and the company itself. In a document outlining how the new cryptocurrency will work, Facebook said its goal is to foster more access to \u201cbetter, cheaper, and open financial services\u201d.

The world may be souring on the company\u2019s leaders, but it is increasingly dependent on the networks. Billions of Facebook and WhatsApp users are not fools. They get value from the services. For many people in diasporas or with family on multiple continents, Facebook and WhatsApp are crucial tools for maintaining relations and relaying crucial information. For refugees around the world, <a href=\"https://qz.com/500062/the-most-crucial-item-that-migrants-and-refugees-carry-is-a-smartphone/\">WhatsApp is a lifeline</a>.</p> <p>This combination of factors creates the core dilemma for critics, reformers and regulators: how can we crack down on the company\u2019s excesses while allowing all the benefits? <br><br>Libra promises to deliver much lower transaction costs and convenience to migrants and their families, letting them hoard and carry less cash. The damage Libra might do in the world is hard to predict and impossible to quantify.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/20111897?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">Remittances</a>, the industry term for this practice of immigrant workers sending money to relatives, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3067778/the-blockchain-is-going-to-save-immigrants-millions-in-remittance-fees\">totalled </a><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3067778/the-blockchain-is-going-to-save-immigrants-millions-in-remittance-fees\">$429 bn in 2016</a> \u2013 three times as much as total government foreign aid that year. Migrant workers in the UK sent home <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/education-46223217\">\u00a38bn </a>in 2016. Workers in the US sent <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2017/06/15/immigrants-around-world-sent-445-billion-back-their-home-countries/\">more than </a><a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2017/06/15/immigrants-around-world-sent-445-billion-back-their-home-countries/\">$27 bn to Mexico</a> in 2016. India received $62.7bn in 2016. China took in $61bn from around the world. </p> <p>This practice is essential to the receiving countries, expensive for the workers who send the money and lucrative for the firms that handle the transactions. According to the World Bank, remittances can amount to as much as <a href=\"https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/blog/cs/sending-money\">20% to 30% of a recipient\u2019s country\u2019s gross domestic product.</a> According to Unesco, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/education-46223217\">average fee for remittance transfers is more than 7% </a> of the amount sent.</p> <p>Billions of people around the world survive \u2013 even thrive \u2013 without formal bank accounts. They do so through a collection of cash, debit cards and money networks, including formal services such as MoneyGram and Western Union as well as <a href=\"https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-issues-report-informal-value-transfer-systems\">informal global networks of trust often called </a><a href=\"https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-issues-report-informal-value-transfer-systems\">hawala </a>or hundis.</p> <p>Because money networks must remain scrutable to major state regulators, the \u201ccrypto\u201d aspects of the Facebook Libra system will not work at all like bitcoin, which can be used as a currency for transactions that fly outside the view of law enforcement. And unlike the encrypted messages people send through WhatsApp, Libra transactions would not be secret. To pass regulatory scrutiny they would have to be visible and verifiably tied to individuals.</p> <p>Any company hoping to manage the monetary transactions of billions of people has to be able to satisfy a tangle of regulators working for nation-states, super-national state collections such as the EU, or individual states such as California or New York.</p> <p>We need not panic about Libra. This network will take years to establish itself. But we should be concerned about further concentration of corporate power. Most seriously, it could wipe out many businesses, small and large, that have been serving people for decades.</p> <p>The long game here is one for which Facebook has long been preparing. There is only one other service in the world that threatens Facebook\u2019s global domination. WeChat, a social network primarily used in China, has offered popular payment systems for many years. In China, one must use WeChat for many transactions. If WeChat moves beyond its current market and challenges Facebook globally, Facebook better had offer a similar, perhaps better payment and money transfer system. Building on the vast market for remittances is the obvious way forward. <br><br>Not too long from now we could face a global financial and communication ecosystem dominated by two or maybe three firms. The full implications of such concentration are beyond our current imaginations.</p> <p><em>Siva Vaidhyanathan is a professor of </em><em>media </em><em>studies at the University of Virginia and the author of Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy (Oxford University Press, 2018)</em></p> <p><br></p>",

For many people in diasporas or with family on multiple continents, Facebook and WhatsApp are crucial tools for maintaining relations and relaying crucial information. For refugees around the world, WhatsApp is a lifeline. This combination of factors creates the core dilemma for critics, reformers and regulators: how can we crack down on the company\u2019s excesses while allowing all the benefits? Libra promises to deliver much lower transaction costs and convenience to migrants and their families, letting them hoard and carry less cash. The damage Libra might do in the world is hard to predict and impossible to quantify. Remittances, the industry term for this practice of immigrant workers sending money to relatives, totalled $429 bn in 2016 \u2013 three times as much as total government foreign aid that year. Migrant workers in the UK sent home \u00a38bn in 2016. Workers in the US sent more than $27 bn to Mexico in 2016. India received $62.7bn in 2016. China took in $61bn from around the world. This practice is essential to the receiving countries, expensive for the workers who send the money and lucrative for the firms that handle the transactions. According to the World Bank, remittances can amount to as much as 20% to 30% of a recipient\u2019s country\u2019s gross domestic product. According to Unesco, the average fee for remittance transfers is more than 7% of the amount sent. Billions of people around the world survive \u2013 even thrive \u2013 without formal bank accounts. They do so through a collection of cash, debit cards and money networks, including formal services such as MoneyGram and Western Union as well as informal global networks of trust often called hawala or hundis. Because money networks must remain scrutable to major state regulators, the \u201ccrypto\u201d aspects of the Facebook Libra system will not work at all like bitcoin, which can be used as a currency for transactions that fly outside the view of law enforcement. And unlike the encrypted messages people send through WhatsApp, Libra transactions would not be secret. To pass regulatory scrutiny they would have to be visible and verifiably tied to individuals. Any company hoping to manage the monetary transactions of billions of people has to be able to satisfy a tangle of regulators working for nation-states, super-national state collections such as the EU, or individual states such as California or New York. We need not panic about Libra. This network will take years to establish itself. But we should be concerned about further concentration of corporate power. Most seriously, it could wipe out many businesses, small and large, that have been serving people for decades. The long game here is one for which Facebook has long been preparing. There is only one other service in the world that threatens Facebook\u2019s global domination. WeChat, a social network primarily used in China, has offered popular payment systems for many years. In China, one must use WeChat for many transactions. If WeChat moves beyond its current market and challenges Facebook globally, Facebook better had offer a similar, perhaps better payment and money transfer system. Building on the vast market for remittances is the obvious way forward. Not too long from now we could face a global financial and communication ecosystem dominated by two or maybe three firms. The full implications of such concentration are beyond our current imaginations.

About 150 jobs are expected to become vacant during the five years and each new female employee will be allocated an additional \u20ac100,000 (\u00a390,000) to be spent on their mentoring and their own research. Baaijens said: \u201cWe attach great importance to equal respect and opportunities for women and men. And it has long been known that a diverse workforce performs better. \u201cIt leads to better strategies, more creative ideas and faster innovation. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve had measures in place for years to increase the low percentage of women among our academic staff, but we\u2019re progressing too slowly. \u201cWe\u2019re aware that we are suffering from an implicit gender bias. We are now using the fact that plans to expand our academic staff considerably in the coming years can be used as a means to make a big step forward in one fell swoop.\u201d The policy will be enforced from 1 July. The university said it wanted at least half of all newly appointed assistant professors to be women over the next five years, with a 35% minimum for recruitment of associate professors and full professors. EU law allows the targeting of recruitment from underrepresented groups. Figures from the European commission suggested there was a majority of female scientists and engineers in only five EU member states: Lithuania (57% female), Bulgaria and Latvia (both 53%), Portugal (51%) and Denmark (just over 50%). In the UK, 41% of scientists and engineers are women \u2013 the EU average. The worst-performing countries include Hungary and Luxembourg (25%), Finland (29%) and Germany (33%), whose chancellor, Angela Merkel, is an accomplished scientist. In the Netherlands, 39% of engineers and scientists are female. There has been a long-running problem of women being attracted to science and engineering degrees only to subsequently fail to find employment. According to the latest statistics, about three-quarters of female graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics find jobs in those sectors after their studies \u2013 10 percentage points lower than the employment rate of men with the same qualification.",

The crew of the Kokuka Courageous had spotted an unexploded mine on the hull and abandoned ship.</p> <p>\u201cLater that day, an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Gashti Class patrol boat approached Kokuka Courageous and was observed and recorded by a US navy MH-60R helicopter removing the unexploded limpet mine from Kokuka Courageous,\u201d said the statement issued by US Central Command.</p> <p>\u201cIran is responsible for the attack based on video evidence and the resources and proficiency needed to quickly remove the unexploded limpet mine.\u201d</p> <p>The statement does not make any claim on why the Iranians removed the mine, for example in an attempt to remove evidence.</p> <p>The US has not presented any evidence of mines being attached, and the head of the company operating the Kokuka Courageous, Yukata Katada, has said the crew had reported that the ship <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/world/middleeast/oil-tanker-attack-gulf-oman.html\">was attacked by a \u201cflying object\u201d</a>.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is also due to visit the Florida headquarters of US Central Command (in charge of all operations in the Middle East) and US special forces.</p> <p>It is unusual for a secretary of state to visit military headquarters, especially as the acting defence secretary is reported to be staying in Washington.

      "bodyText": "Iran has declared it \u201cwill not wage war against any nation\u201d after the US announced that a further 1,000 troops are to be sent to the Middle East amid rising tensions. The US move, announced by the acting defence secretary, Patrick Shanahan, comes after the US blamed Iran for attacks on two oil tanker ships last week, which has raised fears of a confrontation, and Tehran declaring it had increased its rate of uranium enrichment. Shanahan said the troop deployment was for \u201cdefensive purposes\u201d, citing concerns about a threat from Iran. \u201cThe recent Iranian attacks validate the reliable, credible intelligence we have received on hostile behaviour by Iranian forces and their proxy groups that threaten United States personnel and interests across the region,\u201d he said in a statement. The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, replied on Tuesday that Iran had no desire for conflict. \u201cIran will not wage war against any nation,\u201d Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state TV. \u201cThose facing us are a group of politicians with little experience.\u201d He added: \u201cDespite all of the Americans\u2019 efforts in the region and their desire to cut off our ties with all of the world and their desire to keep Iran secluded, they have been unsuccessful.\u201d The US released more photographs on Monday to support its claims that Iran was responsible for attacks on commercial tankers in the Gulf of Oman. One of the pictures appeared to show in colour and sharper focus an incident that had previously been presented in a grainy black and white video \u2013 a patrol boat with black-uniformed sailors alongside one of the tankers, the Kokuka Courageous. A statement accompanying the images said the incident was filmed from a US helicopter and occurred after blasts had hobbled the two ships on 13 June. The crew of the Kokuka Courageous had spotted an unexploded mine on the hull and abandoned ship. \u201cLater that day, an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Gashti Class patrol boat approached Kokuka Courageous and was observed and recorded by a US navy MH-60R helicopter removing the unexploded limpet mine from Kokuka Courageous,\u201d said the statement issued by US Central Command. \u201cIran is responsible for the attack based on video evidence and the resources and proficiency needed to quickly remove the unexploded limpet mine.\u201d The statement does not make any claim on why the Iranians removed the mine, for example in an attempt to remove evidence. The US has not presented any evidence of mines being attached, and the head of the company operating the Kokuka Courageous, Yukata Katada, has said the crew had reported that the ship was attacked by a \u201cflying object\u201d. On Tuesday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is also due to visit the Florida headquarters of US Central Command (in charge of all operations in the Middle East) and US special forces. It is unusual for a secretary of state to visit military headquarters, especially as the acting defence secretary is reported to be staying in Washington. Pompeo has taken the lead role in the administration\u2019s campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Iran, since the US withdrawal from a multilateral nuclear deal in May last year. Tehran on Monday announced it would soon breach limits on how much enriched uranium it can stockpile under the nuclear deal. The accord, which was brokered by Barack Obama and which Iran and the other signatories have maintained following Trump\u2019s withdrawal, caps Iran\u2019s stock of low-enriched uranium at 300kg enriched to 3.67%. But Iran said it had quadrupled the rate of enrichment, so that in 10 days it would bypass the 300kg limit. A spokesman for the White House national security council said this amounted to \u201cnuclear blackmail\u201d. Morgan Ortagus, a spokeswoman for the state department, told reporters on Monday: \u201cWe continue to call on the Iranian regime not to obtain a nuclear weapon, to abide by their commitments to the international community. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that they have made this announcement today. It doesn\u2019t surprise anybody and this is why the president has often said that the JCPOA [joint comprehensive plan of action] needs to be replaced with a better deal.\u201d The US decision to pull out, and Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to foreign policy, appears to have damaged trust with allies, some of whom are seeking stronger proof that Iran was behind the oil tanker attacks. Critics accuse the Trump administration of manufacturing a crisis. Ben Rhodes, former national security adviser to Barack Obama, tweeted: \u201cTrump pulling out of the Iran deal has led directly and predictably to the Iranian nuclear threat getting worse and the risk of war going up.\u201d On Tuesday, China urged restraint, saying the US risked \u201copening a Pandora\u2019s box\u201d in the Middle East. State councillor Wang Yi said \u201cthe US side should alter its extreme pressure methods. Any unilateral behaviour has no basis in international law,\u201d and warned it could create \u201can even greater crisis\u201d. Wang also urged Iran not to abandon the nuclear deal.",

Franco adopted I think six, and flew them back to Rome. As a senator he had a law passed protecting wild dogs. As shooting on Callas Forever neared its end, I learned that, due to his health issues, the insurers had insisted he nominate a replacement should he be unable to finish the film. Unbeknown to me he had put my name in the box. Although, thank God, I was never called upon, that trust cemented our friendship. He was, I suppose, the last director in that great wave of Italian film-making, and both as a friend and a genius, Sin\u00e9ad and I mourn his passing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a052bfcdb65e676a1c357fcec710d9918d539dc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a052bfcdb65e676a1c357fcec710d9918d539dc3/0_123_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fanny Ardant as Maria Callas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artistic richness \u2026 Fanny Ardant as Maria Callas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucherini-Pignatelli/epa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Fanny Ardant on Callas Forever: \u2018A great artistic adventure\u2019</h2> <p>As soon as I met Franco Zeffirelli, I loved him.

I loved to see him laugh, be moved and get angry and I listened to him talk about everything: cities, writers, dogs, flowers and human beings, life and death, his memories of childhood and home, of theatre and painting, his love for life. I loved his sense of irony, his bad faith, his keen eye and ear, his artistic richness, his freedom of thought and his courage. He gave me one of my biggest artistic adventures.</p>",

As shooting on Callas Forever neared its end, I learned that, due to his health issues, the insurers had insisted he nominate a replacement should he be unable to finish the film. Unbeknown to me he had put my name in the box. Although, thank God, I was never called upon, that trust cemented our friendship. He was, I suppose, the last director in that great wave of Italian film-making, and both as a friend and a genius, Sin\u00e9ad and I mourn his passing. Fanny Ardant on Callas Forever: \u2018A great artistic adventure\u2019 As soon as I met Franco Zeffirelli, I loved him. His intelligence, his culture, his generosity, his love for beauty and his passion. I loved to see him laugh, be moved and get angry and I listened to him talk about everything: cities, writers, dogs, flowers and human beings, life and death, his memories of childhood and home, of theatre and painting, his love for life. I loved his sense of irony, his bad faith, his keen eye and ear, his artistic richness, his freedom of thought and his courage. He gave me one of my biggest artistic adventures.",

Brazilian hip-hop has long been a movement associated with the left. Last year, the great and good of Brazilian rap launched a last-ditch attempt to avert the election of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, with a manifesto denouncing him as an authoritarian \u201cwretch\u201d who threatened Brazil\u2019s poor, black and LGBT communities. \u201cHe\u2019s not on your side, he\u2019s not on my side, he\u2019s not on our side,\u201d the Rio rapper BNeg\u00e3o declared at the time. But as Latin America\u2019s largest democracy careens into a new era of conservatism, it is rightist rappers such as Alves who are providing the soundtrack. \u201cBeing progressive is mainstream \u2026 We\u2019re anti-establishment,\u201d proclaimed Alves, one half of the duo Mensageiros da Profecia (Messengers of the Prophecy). Many of Brazil\u2019s rightist rappers are unblushing cheerleaders for Bolsonarismo. Their recordings feature samples of their president\u2019s incendiary speeches, lyrics exalting dictatorship-era generals and torturers such as Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, and shout-outs to Bolsonaro\u2019s US-based guru, Olavo de Carvalho.

Michael Bay is combing the Guinness Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Pop as we speak. And given that the film\u2019s PRs need the surviving band members to do press junkets and turn up on the red carpet, it\u2019s often the manager who\u2019s the softest target in terms of assigning a cinematic antagonist.</p> <p>And why not? The music-biz manager is a modern Mephistopheles: he turns up in a flash of sulphur, drops a million quid in your lap, says \u201csign this\u201d, then extracts his diabolic price during 3am cocaine nosebleeds over the next 20 years. Some might say that managers are simply practical business types who are around at the time when vastly overpaid young people are making their own mistakes. And then inevitably get it in the neck from their mathematically illiterate clients who have blown all their cash on sedan chairs.</p> <p>The latter archetype doesn\u2019t make for a great film plot, however.

      "bodyText": "Since both Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman have cashed in at the box office in the past 12 months, audiences are about to find out just how many heritage acts have a narrative arc with humble-enough childhoods and sufficiently deep rock bottoms. Michael Bay is combing the Guinness Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Pop as we speak. And given that the film\u2019s PRs need the surviving band members to do press junkets and turn up on the red carpet, it\u2019s often the manager who\u2019s the softest target in terms of assigning a cinematic antagonist. And why not? The music-biz manager is a modern Mephistopheles: he turns up in a flash of sulphur, drops a million quid in your lap, says \u201csign this\u201d, then extracts his diabolic price during 3am cocaine nosebleeds over the next 20 years. Some might say that managers are simply practical business types who are around at the time when vastly overpaid young people are making their own mistakes. And then inevitably get it in the neck from their mathematically illiterate clients who have blown all their cash on sedan chairs. The latter archetype doesn\u2019t make for a great film plot, however. Instead, the music manager in cinema has a few key attributes, and none of them is \u201cbasically a decent bloke\u201d. As these recent examples of real-life managers seen on screen prove \u2026 John Reid One thing is for sure: they\u2019re going to need more actors who can do a good John Reid. He turns up in Bohemian Rhapsody as Queen\u2019s manager. And he turns up in Rocketman as Elton John\u2019s manager, lover and tormentor, where, short, tubby and balding, Reid has the good fortune to be played by Richard Madden, tipped to be the next James Bond. Did he get a Hollywood makeover? If anything, he has been underplayed. Reid allegedly got into a fight with a journalist in a nightclub over \u201cthe lack of whisky at a press launch\u201d and was sentenced to a month in jail. In 1984, the day after Elton married Renate Blauel, he apparently beat up another hack; and he once slapped a female hack who reportedly called him a \u201cpoof\u201d. Bottom line: he doesn\u2019t like journalists. Biopic About Another Client Yet to Be Made Riverdance!

      "bodyText": "Labour would set up a new gambling ombudsman to protect consumers, deputy leader Tom Watson will say on Tuesday, citing a string of scandals that have raised concerns about \u201cpredatory\u201d practices in the industry. In a speech at the thinktank Demos, Watson will unveil the latest plank of a plan to overhaul betting regulation via a new Gambling Act, following a party review published last year. The review has spawned a string of policies that Labour has said would help bring down problem gambling rates, including banning betting on credit cards. Watson will say that the new ombudsman would form part of a tripartite system alongside industry regulator the Gambling Commission and the NHS, which would commission research into, education on and treatment of problem gambling. He will say that the existing regulatory regime encourages gambling firms to do \u201cdirty deals\u201d with vulnerable people to avoid falling foul of the Gambling Commission. A Guardian investigation last year exposed how Ladbrokes accepted millions of pounds in bets from a problem gambler who had stolen the money. The bookmaker later agreed to repay the victims of his theft, on condition that both it and the addict signed a non-disclosure agreement that involved withholding information from the regulator. Watson will also highlight the story of a woman who was encouraged by online betting firms LeoVegas and Casumo to keep gambling, with offers of bonuses and free bets, even after she lost \u00a340,000 on a dozen credit cards. He will say: \u201cI cannot think of a single other type of transactional arrangement for goods or financial services that would allow this type of situation: unclear terms and conditions, a lack of transparency, a lack of framework \u2013 and fuelled by predatory bonus offers.\u201d Under the current regulatory regime, the commission can seek to impose financial penalties on firms that breach the terms of their gambling licence, but cannot be the arbiter of whether consumers are compensated. The new ombudsman would be able to impose financial penalties, including redress for individual customers, if bookmakers or online casinos fail to live up to their obligation to prevent problem gambling. It would also oversee clarity of terms and conditions and ensure transparency around how companies use the data they hold about gamblers to target them with offers. Brian Chappell, of campaign group Justice for Punters, said: \u201cIt\u2019s nearly three years since we first discussed an ombudsman for gambling with the powers that be, so we\u2019re delighted it\u2019s now been considered seriously in parliament. It should make gambling fairer and safer, so good for the consumer.\u201d Labour has already proposed a mandatory levy on gambling companies to raise about \u00a3100m a year to pay for research, education and treatment of problem gambling, a measure the government has said is not necessary. The industry currently pays about \u00a310m under a voluntary donation system that has allowed some firms to pay far less than the suggested 0.1% of revenue, or in some cases nothing at all. Watson will say that the new regulatory structure would be required to ensure that money raised from a mandatory levy was well spent and the system properly audited.",

Duch\u00e2telet had cited Bowyer\u2019s desire to use an agent to negotiate a deal as potentially constituting a conflict of interest over transfer policy. \u201cWhat Lee has achieved in his short time at the club is very impressive,\u201d said the owner, who is attempting to sell Charlton to the Cardiff City chairman, Mehmet Dalman. \u201cHe has united the club once again. \u201cI would like to thank Lee for his professionalism during this process. While the negotiations have been ongoing, he has continued to work on building a squad for the club\u2019s Championship campaign. Stability is essential and I am very pleased we now have the best man in place to lead us forward next season.\u201d",

(Kissing a new person after a long marriage is, observes Fleishman, akin to \u201cthe strange feeling of taking ice skates off after wearing them for hours and walking on plain ground\u201d.)</p> <p>It is also an acute portrait of the dynamics of upper-middle-class Manhattan in which everyone is equally hideous. Fleishman is whiny and smug; his ex-wife, Rachel, a wealthy talent agent who talks to her husband as if he is her executive assistant, is neurotic and vile; their friends are mercenary. The novel is otherwise populated by the kinds of terrible people who run around in slogan-based gym wear (sample selection: But First, Coffee; Brunch So Hard Rachel; Eat Sleep Spin Retreat). It goes without saying, meanwhile, that the private school scene on the Upper East Side is the seventh circle of hell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d728013735ec39d1d716ca0f735ad5d061c23069\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d728013735ec39d1d716ca0f735ad5d061c23069/0_240_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taffy Brodesser-Akner in Central Park, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taffy Brodesser-Akner in Central Park, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What redeems Fleishman from being a depressing read is the sympathy and humour with which the characters are treated.

And after having gotten along so well,<strong> </strong>it made me so angry. But the anger was embarrassment that, oh, I thought we were getting along. Awful. I mean, I never hated her.

It\u2019s OK to be born wealthy. It\u2019s very lucky. And also most of the people I know who were born privileged are incredible fuck-ups. They can\u2019t figure out a goal or a motive.

I\u2019m a fine successful person, but next to her ... \u201d</p> <p>By the end of the story, even Paltrow\u2019s posture struck Brodesser-Akner as a rebuke.<strong> </strong>When she asked Paltrow how she managed to keep her back so straight, \u201cshe was like, \u2018You think so?\u2019 She\u2019d never considered it.

      "bodyText": "The journalist who writes a novel has an inhibition to overcome: the reflex guilt about making stuff up. For Taffy Brodesser-Akner, whose first novel, Fleishman Is In Trouble, she wrote while working as a writer at the New York Times magazine, the anxiety of leaving behind fact and transcript was alleviated by the knowledge that at least no one was going to yell at her for hurting their feelings. Not that Brodesser-Akner specializes in hatchet jobs. Her profiles, most famously her deep dive into the world of Gwyneth Paltrow last year, are generous without giving her subjects a free ride. A profile many years ago of the TV anchor Don Lemon, in GQ, was gently satirical without being cruel. At the end of last year, a recalcitrant Bradley Cooper was given the benefit of the doubt by Brodesser-Akner, and the space, quietly, to hang himself. In the case of Gwyneth Paltrow \u2013 with whom, says Brodesser-Akner, she spent so much time that by the end \u201cit started to get embarrassing\u201d \u2013 the piece treated the Goop empire with seriousness, while still providing Paltrow\u2019s critics with enough ludicrous details to carry on hating her. \u201cYou can make fun of it all you want,\u201d says Brodesser-Akner, who went into the project sufficiently open-minded to have converted, these days, to using Paltrow\u2019s zillion-dollar face creams. \u201cBut it\u2019s not good to send someone into a story who\u2019s just disgusted. I think the ambivalence is what people react to.\u201d We are in a cafe near the 43-year-old\u2019s house in New Jersey, 40 minutes from New York. Brodesser-Akner lives here with her husband, Claude, a journalist, and their two children, eight and 11. The novel came about in a burst of frustration after Brodesser-Akner was knocked back by her editor when she suggested doing a long reported piece on the state of divorce, which at the time all of her friends seemed to be going through. \u201cShe said we don\u2019t really do that sort of thing any more. I pulled over into a Pain Quotidien and wrote the first 10 pages of the novel.\u201d Fleishman is in Trouble follows the story of Toby Fleishman, a man in his early 40s whose marriage to Rachel has collapsed. Newly single, he is trying to have a sex life while also earning enough money to meet his ex-wife\u2019s idea of a fulfilling existence and making sure his children get to camp on time. It is a funny critique of the intoxicating life of the recently separated \u2013 specifically those of Brodesser-Akner\u2019s generation, who married before the advent of dating apps and who, upon divorcing, have a weird time adjusting to the new dating economy. (Kissing a new person after a long marriage is, observes Fleishman, akin to \u201cthe strange feeling of taking ice skates off after wearing them for hours and walking on plain ground\u201d.) It is also an acute portrait of the dynamics of upper-middle-class Manhattan in which everyone is equally hideous. Fleishman is whiny and smug; his ex-wife, Rachel, a wealthy talent agent who talks to her husband as if he is her executive assistant, is neurotic and vile; their friends are mercenary. The novel is otherwise populated by the kinds of terrible people who run around in slogan-based gym wear (sample selection: But First, Coffee; Brunch So Hard Rachel; Eat Sleep Spin Retreat). It goes without saying, meanwhile, that the private school scene on the Upper East Side is the seventh circle of hell. What redeems Fleishman from being a depressing read is the sympathy and humour with which the characters are treated. Everyone is disastrous and everyone is human, and the writing is so sharp that one finishes the novel somehow feeling warm towards them all. It is also an excavation of the odd phenomenon of wealthy people who cannot be happy. The \u201cpoor person\u201d in the novel is, in fact, Toby Fleishman himself, a successful doctor who makes almost $300,000 a year \u2013 an enormous amount of money relative to the average, and peanuts in relation to the hedge-funders he and his wife hang out with.

Barack Obama had recently been elected president; one of his early actions, in a reversal of Bush administration policy, was to sign a UN declaration calling for the decriminalisation of homosexuality. Months later, the Matthew Shepard &amp; James Byrd Jr Hate Crimes Prevention Act was passed.

And yet, released into the more hostile environment of Donald Trump\u2019s America, The Lavender Scare plays rather differently. Its Eisenhower-era story of the national witch-hunt that saw scores of homosexual men and women investigated by the state, and subsequently dismissed from their jobs on the basis of their sexuality, has alarming reverberations at a time when Trump\u2019s administration has rolled back certain workplace protections for LGBT people, when transgender people have been banned from serving in the military, and when a homophobic baker refusing to provide a wedding cake to LGBT customers can take the fight all the way to the supreme court, and win.</p> <p>\u201cI did see the lavender scare as an important historical moment that needed to be documented, but I did not anticipate that some of the messages in it would have the relevance that they do have today,\u201d says Howard, a veteran television news producer making his directorial debut with this film. \u201cIt did take me nearly 10 years to finish this film, and I\u2019d like to say that I was planning all along that it would have this additional resonance. But I do think it is valuable that it is coming out now, when we\u2019re able to discuss these issues with a little bit of historical context.\u201d</p> <p>That context, meanwhile, remains relatively little known: although the lavender scare was closely allied with the anti-communist campaign led by Joseph McCarthy, it has received far less historical exposure and analysis than its red counterpart. Somewhat sheepishly, I tell Howard that prior to watching his film, I hadn\u2019t heard of its heroic central figure Frank Kameny, a gay astronomer who, after being fired from the US army map service in 1957, devoted his life to gay rights activism, leading picket lines outside the White House in 1965. Howard in turn admits that he knew little of Kameny (or the discrimination campaign in general) before reading the historian David K Johnson\u2019s book The Lavender Scare in 2009 \u2013 and swiftly deciding there was a film to be made from it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_dlta9qaLU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6_dlta9qaLU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cI thought I knew American history, and I\u2019ve lived through a lot of the gay rights movement, but the idea that the government had this systematic programme of eliminating gay men and lesbian women from the workforce was something I knew nothing about,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are few people who contributed as much to the movement as Frank Kameny did. But gay history is not taught in schools, and there hasn\u2019t been a huge amount written about him. So I was hoping a film would help bring him the wider recognition he deserves.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a good thing Howard acted as quickly as he did, after approaching Johnson in mid-2009 with his documentary idea. The interviews with a still impassioned 85-year-old Kameny, which form the backbone of the film, were conducted in 2010; Kameny died the following year. \u201cI realised at the outset how pivotal Frank was to the story, and he remained willing to talk to anyone and everyone about gay history and gay rights,\u201d he says, \u201cbut there was a sense about him that he deserved recognition, or bitterness that he wasn\u2019t more well-known. In terms of his importance, he was the Rosa Parks of the gay rights movement: a private individual who one day stood up and said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to take this anymore.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Kameny\u2019s story isn\u2019t the only one carrying The Lavender Scare, of course; following Johnson\u2019s lead, Howard interviews a number of other gay men and lesbian women who were victimised by the campaign \u2013 only to emerge proud and triumphant in the present day, as the film details their subsequent professional and personal accomplishments. Did the film-makers seek out these happy endings from a range of different outcomes? Not exactly, Howard says. \u201cWell, Johnson interviewed a couple of dozen people for his book, I listened to all the audio tapes, and some people were still bitter and angry and kind of broken. Yet the people I interviewed were mostly pretty optimistic and had moved on with their lives. And I always wondered if a person\u2019s state of mind has something to do with their longevity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"63fbd58126cc1e9240a080c9e8b8862bdb96d268\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63fbd58126cc1e9240a080c9e8b8862bdb96d268/0_0_3000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A gay man arrested in a still from The Lavender Scare\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A gay man is arrested in a still from The Lavender Scare.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PBS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was more surprised, however, to find several willing interviewees among the surviving men who enforced the policy, chief among them the former state department official John Hanes, whose reflections come compellingly close to a <em>mea culpa</em>, before he pulls curtly back to the brink. \u201c[Hanes] said he wouldn\u2019t do the same thing today because society has changed, but he had no apologies,\u201d says Howard.</p> <p>This turned out to be a recurring sentiment as interviews for the project continued. \u201cEvery government person we spoke to said they believed they did what needed to be done.

The chancellor is unhappy with the prime minister\u2019s decision to set out plans to spend up to \u00a327bn on education over three years, including building new schools and paying teachers higher wages. He is understood to believe May should not be binding the hands of her successor with big spending commitments. The Press Association initially reported Hammond was on the brink of quitting over the row between No 10 and No 11 in what would be an extraordinary move just weeks before the prime minister leaves office. A senior government source told the Guardian Hammond was \u201cfrustrated\u201d and may have threatened to resign but he was unlikely to do so. \u201cIt\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t recognise there are pressures,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe believes strongly that decisions on long-term spending should be made by the next person.

A Downing Street source told PA: \u201cIt is a fact though that school funding in England is at its highest ever level \u2013 rising from almost \u00a341bn in 2017-18 to \u00a343.5bn by 2019-20. \u201cBut while there\u2019s more money going into our schools than ever before, we know they face budgeting challenges. \u201cThe education secretary has been clear he will back headteachers to have the resources they need to deliver a world-class education.\u201d May\u2019s tenure in No 10 will end next month, and she has already sought to define her legacy with pledges to tackle climate change, mental health and modern slavery. On Monday, she set out plans for new teachers to receive training on how to spot the signs of mental health problems in youngsters, under a plan to overhaul society\u2019s approach to the issue.",

It really was the worst thing you could be. I was terrified of being the gay boy. I\u2019d known since the age of about six, but I never spoke about it, never opened up to anyone. It was an intensely lonely experience, and that\u2019s what leads to mental health issues.\u201d</p> <p>The point he wants to drive home is that LGBT issues \u201care everyone\u2019s business, because you can literally save someone\u2019s life by being there for them and supporting them\u201d.</p> <p>At his \u201cvery straight, laddish\u201d school he feigned illness to get out of sport, and didn\u2019t touch alcohol for fear of letting slip the truth about his sexuality. When he got to university things weren\u2019t much easier.</p> <p>\u201cI studied classics at Brasenose College, Oxford. I\u2019d imagined that I would finally be able to come out: but what I hadn\u2019t realised was that after seven years of creating an image of myself as straight, it was very difficult to overthrow that in an environment where, as a state school kid from the north, I already felt a bit of an outsider.\u201d</p> <p>When he eventually shared the truth with a university friend, his world came crashing down. \u201cI got very drunk, told a friend \u2013 and things didn\u2019t go at all well.</p> <p>\u201cI remember walking along a street in Oxford and I\u2019d smashed my phone into some glass and my hand was covered in blood. My friend had rejected me: it was the thing I\u2019d feared all these years. What I desperately needed was for someone to say, it\u2019s all going to be fine. That would have made a world of a difference. I was in such a mess, I can imagine things working out in a very different way.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/26/gay-northern-irish-schools-sissy-report-lgbt-pupils-homophobia\">Gay and Northern Irish: \u2018Teachers called me sissy and compared me to a plague\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ramsey\u2019s parents didn\u2019t have any gay friends, and LGBT issues weren\u2019t discussed at home. His family are close \u2013 he has one sister \u2013 but he says his parents, like many of their generation, had hoped his life would be an enhanced reflection of their own.</p> <p>This is another important part of the raison d\u2019etre of Just Like Us: because LGBT pupils, unlike those from other minorities, often lack support at home. \u201cMany minorities are something you\u2019re born into, but most gay children aren\u2019t born into LGBT+ families, so they have to find their own community. And that\u2019s why the culture around being gay in schools is so crucial, and can make a life-changing difference,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It\u2019s impossible, says Ramsey, to guarantee attitudes towards LGBT issues in the home \u2013 but it should certainly be possible to make schools safe and welcoming places for children, whatever their sexual orientation.</p> <p>After he eventually came out at the age of 25, Ramsey met a man called Ben with whom he shared a very similar background, but whose experience of being gay had been totally different. \u201cHe was like the person I could have been: he was grounded, and happy, and he\u2019d never had to be secretive about who he was.\u201d</p> <p>So what was the difference? \u201cOne important thing was that there was an openly gay teacher at his school.

Protests in Birmingham against the teaching of LGBT equality; Ann Widdecombe\u2019s comments about science finding a cure for homosexuality; and the backing of the one-time Tory leadership hopeful Esther McVey for allowing parents to withdraw their children from lessons around LGBT relationships are all, he says, disquieting. \u201cWhat many people don\u2019t appreciate is how it feels to be surrounded by these debates and controversy,\u201d he says. \u201cIn those Birmingham schools, for example, we could expect one in 10 pupils to be LGBT; and their first experience of these issues will be people protesting at their school gates.\u201d What\u2019s more, a survey commissioned by Just Like Us, the charity Ramsey set up, has found that almost nine in 10 LGBT young people have experienced anxiety (85%, compared with 56% for their non-LGBT peers), that LGBT young people are twice as likely to have experienced discrimination, and that three in four have experienced bullying (as opposed to 52% of their peers).

I\u2019d imagined that I would finally be able to come out: but what I hadn\u2019t realised was that after seven years of creating an image of myself as straight, it was very difficult to overthrow that in an environment where, as a state school kid from the north, I already felt a bit of an outsider.\u201d When he eventually shared the truth with a university friend, his world came crashing down. \u201cI got very drunk, told a friend \u2013 and things didn\u2019t go at all well. \u201cI remember walking along a street in Oxford and I\u2019d smashed my phone into some glass and my hand was covered in blood. My friend had rejected me: it was the thing I\u2019d feared all these years. What I desperately needed was for someone to say, it\u2019s all going to be fine. That would have made a world of a difference. I was in such a mess, I can imagine things working out in a very different way.\u201d Ramsey\u2019s parents didn\u2019t have any gay friends, and LGBT issues weren\u2019t discussed at home. His family are close \u2013 he has one sister \u2013 but he says his parents, like many of their generation, had hoped his life would be an enhanced reflection of their own. This is another important part of the raison d\u2019etre of Just Like Us: because LGBT pupils, unlike those from other minorities, often lack support at home. \u201cMany minorities are something you\u2019re born into, but most gay children aren\u2019t born into LGBT+ families, so they have to find their own community. And that\u2019s why the culture around being gay in schools is so crucial, and can make a life-changing difference,\u201d he says. It\u2019s impossible, says Ramsey, to guarantee attitudes towards LGBT issues in the home \u2013 but it should certainly be possible to make schools safe and welcoming places for children, whatever their sexual orientation. After he eventually came out at the age of 25, Ramsey met a man called Ben with whom he shared a very similar background, but whose experience of being gay had been totally different. \u201cHe was like the person I could have been: he was grounded, and happy, and he\u2019d never had to be secretive about who he was.\u201d So what was the difference? \u201cOne important thing was that there was an openly gay teacher at his school. That made me realise how important role models are.\u201d Ramsey went back to speak at his old school, and off the back of that he launched Just Like Us, and then School Diversity Week. Schools that have signed up to Diversity Week can access an online toolkit with lesson ideas, says Ramsey; some schools run special assemblies, distribute rainbow badges, plant rainbow borders, or allow pupils to dress up in rainbow colours. \u201cIt\u2019s all about underlining the schools\u2019 respect for minority groups in general, and LGBT+ people in particular,\u201d he says. Those that have opted in to the week of action include Catholic and Church of England schools (making up 5% and 9% of the total number of schools respectively), and some schools with large numbers of Muslim pupils. \u201cOne school with a significant number of Muslim pupils that\u2019s been involved from the start is Woodbridge High School in Redbridge, and that was mentioned in its favour in an Ofsted report,\u201d he says. Ramsey is aware, though, that it is the schools that don\u2019t sign up which represent the challenge. \u201cThough taking part in the week can improve what schools are doing for LGBT+ pupils, those are the schools that are already aware of the issues,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very conscious that, though take-up of the week has been high, we\u2019ve got far fewer schools in Wales, North Yorkshire and Cumbria than other areas of the country. \u201cThere\u2019s a real urban/rural divide around all this: in parts of London you get people who genuinely think it\u2019s not even an issue, whereas in other parts of the country, schools haven\u2019t begun to address it.\u201d School Diversity Week this year is taking place throughout England and Wales; next year, Scottish schools will also be invited, and Northern Irish schools will be included at some point in the future. Ramsey knows there may be an uphill battle ahead in some areas but he also knows it is worth it. \u201cI want this to be something children in school don\u2019t need to even think about,\u201d he says. \u201cI want all schools to be places where all children can be themselves, fearlessly.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Galaxy S10e is Samsung\u2019s attempt to offer a flagship smartphone experience in a smaller body and at a lower cost, which mostly works. The formula is simple: take the same processor, reduce the memory a little and squeeze it into a smaller, less complicated body. The AMOLED screen is only 5.8in on the diagonal, only FHD+ and only flat, not curved at the edges. Whether any of those are downsides depends on your view of curved screens. The display isn\u2019t visibly worse than the S10, and it still has the hole-punch notch through which the selfie camera pokes. The display is covered in last year\u2019s Corning Gorilla Glass 5, not 6 as fitted to the regular S10, so it might be a little less scratch resistant or prone to smashing on impact. With rounded metal sides and glass front and back, it looks fairly simple in design terms. Get it in prism white or canary yellow and it\u2019ll stand out from the crowd. The S10e is easy to hold onto at only 69.9mm wide and 142.2mm tall, which makes it one of the smallest flagship phones on the market alongside Google\u2019s Pixel 3. In reality it doesn\u2019t feel all that smaller than the S10 because it\u2019s only 0.5mm narrower and 7g lighter. There\u2019s the lesser-spotted headphone socket in the bottom, next to the USB-C port, and the phone is water resistant to IP68 standards: 1.5m depths of up to 30 minutes. Specifications Screen: 5.8in FHD+ AMOLED (438ppi) Processor: Samsung Exynos 9820 or Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 RAM: 6GB of RAM Storage: 128GB Operating system: One UI based on Android 9 Pie Camera: rear dual camera, front 10MP selfie-camera Connectivity: dual sim, LTE, wifi, NFC, Bluetooth 5, wireless charging and GPS Dimensions: 142.2 x 69.9 x 7.9mm Weight: 150g Performance The Galaxy S10e has the same processor \u2013 the Samsung Exynos 9820 in the EU or the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 in the US \u2013 as the larger, more expensive Galaxy S10 and S10+. The cheaper phone has only 6GB of memory compared with 8GB, but most will likely not notice, as performance was pretty much the same. Only on occasion would an app have to reload when brought back from the recently used apps list. That means the S10e is as fast and fluid as most of the competition, even if it doesn\u2019t quite manage OnePlus 7 Pro-levels of speed. Battery life on the S10e was a disappointing 25 hours between charges, the same as the regular S10. With the always-on display (AOD) setting off, the phone would last from 7am on day one until 9am on day two, which might be enough to get you into work. That was while browsing and using apps for five hours with plenty of push messages and emails, watching 60 minutes of offline video, shooting about five photos a day and listening to about five hours of Spotify using Bluetooth headphones. You will likely have to charge it before a night out so it\u2019ll get you home the other side. Charging is pretty slow too, taking 95 minutes to fully charge via cable and similar via 15W wireless charging. Wireless powershare works well, but is fairly slow \u2013 fine for charging a set of headphones. Samsung One UI The Galaxy S10e runs the same new One UI version of Android 9 Pie as the rest of the S10 line, and is a big improvement on previous versions of Samsung\u2019s customised Android experience. Most of the changes have been made to make using a large phone easier, but given the smaller size of the S10e, they\u2019re less of an improvement. Still, everything looks good and works well. The only area where Samsung is clearly behind the curve is the gesture navigation. Its swipe pads work fine but are harder to reach and less fluid than the competition. I ended up sticking to the traditional navigation buttons. You\u2019ll get about three years of software support from Samsung, but Android version updates will be slower than some of the competition, meaning Android Q will likely only arrive in excess of six months after its release. Fingerprint scanner in the power button Unlike the rest of the S10 line the Galaxy S10e has a traditional capacitive fingerprint scanner built into the power button. It\u2019s fast, accurate and lines up with roughly where your right thumb rests on the side of the phone where you would normally push the power button. But it\u2019s harder to use in your left hand. I found that it was placed too high up on the right side to comfortably hit it with my left index finger in a natural position taking several attempts to unlock the phone. If you\u2019re left handed and want to use a fingerprint scanner, think twice about the S10e. Camera One of the areas where the S10e is inferior to its more expensive siblings is in the camera. There is only two cameras on the back, not three. Still, the main 12-megapixel camera is joined by the 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle camera, leaving zoom to pure digital, which is noticeably worse than the S10 or S10+. That means the S10e is capable of capturing some really good standard and wide-angle shots, with good detail and colour range. It certainly isn\u2019t the best camera on the market, but it keeps up with most of the competition short of the zoom. The selfie camera is excellent; so is video capture. And there are plenty of modes, including manual \u201cPro\u201d mode and a dedicated Instagram camera, to play with. Observations The S10e is really nice to just fiddle with in the hand, more so than the larger S10 The phone comes with a screen protector pre-installed The stereo speakers are pretty good There\u2019s a Bixby key on the left side which can safely be ignored Price The Samsung Galaxy S10e costs \u00a3669 in white, black, green or yellow. For comparison, the 6.1in Galaxy S10 costs \u00a3799, the 6.4in Galaxy S10+ costs \u00a3899, the 5.5in Google Pixel 3 costs \u00a3739, the 6.1in Apple iPhone XR costs \u00a3749 and the OnePlus 7 costs \u00a3499. Verdict With the Galaxy S10e Samsung has mostly managed to condense what is good about its 2019 flagship S10 line into something smaller and cheaper. It\u2019s full of good, but not quite the best features. The screen is great, the camera is good but has no optical zoom, the fingerprint scanner is fast but awkward for left-handers and while performance is great, battery life is a bit weak.

Learning will begin with a \u201cproblem\u201d. According to Graham Woodgate, acting director of <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/basc/\" title=\"\">UCL\u2019s BASc</a>, only his \u201cmore adventurous\u201d students tackle a complex global issue. But at LIS, \u201cproblems\u201d are the starting point.</p> <p>Childhood obesity, malaria, palm oil supply chains, knife crime and more will be taught by 12 faculty heads using maths, engineering, anthropology, psychology, history, neuroscience and environmental science, and include research and campaign methods. Students will tackle a dozen problems in three years, and work placements should reflect that. For instance, the Metropolitan police wants them to help solve knife crime.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/04/young-people-education-political-university-students\">The world is in a bad way. Students need the skills to fix it | Tom Whyman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mary Curnock Cook, former head of Ucas, says the problem-focused curriculum at LIS can uniquely link together different disciplines. Fidoe says: \u201cToo few people can grapple confidently in these areas, because the last time they dealt with that breadth they were 16 years old.\u201d</p> <p>LIS is also unusual in having no A-level requirements; it will consider grades but also scout for teamwork and creativity during assessment days. \u201cThe goal is to have a student body representative of the country \u2013 the Russell Group are nowhere near that,\u201d says Fidoe.</p> <p>Eighty pupils have attended two open days. At the first, 90% were state-educated, and 10% of those were on free school meals. Given its career-focused curriculum, the LIS may succeed in recruiting disadvantaged pupils where many universities have failed. \u201cIf we can create a broader model for admissions other universities can follow, that\u2019s fantastic,\u201d says Fidoe.</p> <p>The LIS will also not enter the Research Excellence Framework, which rates universities for their research, as its focus is on students. Given the \u00a39,000 tuition fee, staff will be chosen for their ability to deliver a \u201ctransformational teaching experience\u201d, says Fidoe. It will enter the new Teaching Excellence and Student Outcomes Frameworks.</p> <p>Investors, which include Innocent Smoothies and Funding Circle, have provided cash for three years. Fidoe is hazy on how the university will demonstrate its success, but says it will check \u201cwhere students are in five, 10 years\u2019 time\u201d.</p> <p>There may, though, be stiff competition for students: UCL\u2019s BASc began with 80 students and recruited 148 this year, but Fidoe wants to fill 120 places straight off. In the same year his doors open, UCL is launching an MASc, an interdisciplinary master\u2019s.</p> <p>At UCL, Woodgate criticises the lack of language study in the LIS programme, and says his students learn one of 10 languages.. Will global problems really be solved only in English, he asks? On the other hand, he says, \u201cUCL isn\u2019t going to have those intensive relationships with companies. LIS will do what it will do, and it will be different.\u201d</p>",

Interdisciplinary degrees aren\u2019t entirely new \u2013 University College London launched an arts and sciences BASc programme in 2012, and according to its director of programmes, almost all students do work placements, too. Combined degrees are growing in popularity. Research by Unifrog, a careers platform, reveals \u201cliberal arts\u201d degrees \u2013 combining humanities and sciences \u2013 shot up to become the most popular shortlisted subject for the 139,400 year 12 pupils using the platform, pushing medicine into second place. But Fidoe\u2019s plan, headed by Prof Carl Gombrich, who set up the UCL course, has some interesting distinctions. Learning will begin with a \u201cproblem\u201d. According to Graham Woodgate, acting director of UCL\u2019s BASc, only his \u201cmore adventurous\u201d students tackle a complex global issue. But at LIS, \u201cproblems\u201d are the starting point. Childhood obesity, malaria, palm oil supply chains, knife crime and more will be taught by 12 faculty heads using maths, engineering, anthropology, psychology, history, neuroscience and environmental science, and include research and campaign methods. Students will tackle a dozen problems in three years, and work placements should reflect that. For instance, the Metropolitan police wants them to help solve knife crime. Mary Curnock Cook, former head of Ucas, says the problem-focused curriculum at LIS can uniquely link together different disciplines. Fidoe says: \u201cToo few people can grapple confidently in these areas, because the last time they dealt with that breadth they were 16 years old.\u201d LIS is also unusual in having no A-level requirements; it will consider grades but also scout for teamwork and creativity during assessment days. \u201cThe goal is to have a student body representative of the country \u2013 the Russell Group are nowhere near that,\u201d says Fidoe. Eighty pupils have attended two open days. At the first, 90% were state-educated, and 10% of those were on free school meals. Given its career-focused curriculum, the LIS may succeed in recruiting disadvantaged pupils where many universities have failed. \u201cIf we can create a broader model for admissions other universities can follow, that\u2019s fantastic,\u201d says Fidoe. The LIS will also not enter the Research Excellence Framework, which rates universities for their research, as its focus is on students. Given the \u00a39,000 tuition fee, staff will be chosen for their ability to deliver a \u201ctransformational teaching experience\u201d, says Fidoe. It will enter the new Teaching Excellence and Student Outcomes Frameworks. Investors, which include Innocent Smoothies and Funding Circle, have provided cash for three years. Fidoe is hazy on how the university will demonstrate its success, but says it will check \u201cwhere students are in five, 10 years\u2019 time\u201d. There may, though, be stiff competition for students: UCL\u2019s BASc began with 80 students and recruited 148 this year, but Fidoe wants to fill 120 places straight off. In the same year his doors open, UCL is launching an MASc, an interdisciplinary master\u2019s. At UCL, Woodgate criticises the lack of language study in the LIS programme, and says his students learn one of 10 languages.. Will global problems really be solved only in English, he asks? On the other hand, he says, \u201cUCL isn\u2019t going to have those intensive relationships with companies. LIS will do what it will do, and it will be different.\u201d",

Rapid-fire cutting, whiplash zooms and tricks with repetition could combine to dilate a single moment in time and make gunfire into a symphony of wanton destruction.

Like that film\u2019s Arthur Penn, he saw America at a chaotic crossroads epitomized by the ongoing warfare in Vietnam and unrest on the home front. In another story of thieves with questionable honor even among themselves, he planted a signpost at the end of an era.</p> <p>John Ford\u2019s The Searchers had set the deconstructive ball rolling in 1956 by uncovering a wounded reactionary soul beneath the leathery, commanding exterior of the cowboy archetype, a pop-cultural revisionism that Peckinpah extended to its most extreme conclusion. He establishes early on that though William Holden, Ernest Borgnine and Ben Johnson may look like the good guys, they\u2019re not here to save the day. The opening scene mocks the expectation for gallantry, dressing the men up in the uniforms of US cavalry soldiers and shooting them like the proud descendants of John Wayne. They\u2019re actually stickup artists keen to relieve a railroad office of its silver reserves, no matter how many civilians have to die in the process, and that\u2019s only the latest feat in a long and illustrious career of criminal activity. Suddenly, the viewer realizes that those clothes had most likely been stripped from the corpses of enemies they\u2019d already killed.</p> <p>We\u2019re dealing with some bad hombres, the kind of cud-chewing sonsabitches who\u2019ll shoot your eye out as soon as look at you. They fit the description the critic Ty Burr once gave of John Wayne\u2019s character in The Searchers: a type of man crucial to \u201cwinning\u201d the west and who had to be left behind if civilization was to follow. Peckinpah and co-writer Walon Green situated their script in the year 1913, as horse-drawn carriages had begun to give way to newfangled automobiles. The principal characters recognize that they\u2019re approaching fossilization \u2013 no spring chicken, that Borgnine \u2013 and plot one final score to get them all set for retirement. An arresting image inserted into the opening credits, that of a scorpion overrun by fire ants, grows into a symbol of one toxic influence succumbing to another.

The Wild Bunch stands out as the first western to go full-bore with its reappraisal of frontier narratives, and remains the most ferociously modern example by virtue of its coal-black heart. The question of integrity\u2019s importance, utility and limits haunts the band of no-goodniks as they cut a dusty swath through the Texas desert. They turn on one another whenever convenient, more than willing to step on each other\u2019s faces to climb out of mortal peril. As Holden\u2019s leading man Pike Bishop growls, \u201c$10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties.\u201d He speaks this crucial line of dialogue to his compatriot Angel, soon to be left for dead as a captive of a sadistic general in the Mexican military. When his change of heart comes, both too little and too late, the abrupt growth of a conscience cues up the bloodbath grand finale. Decency can be a fatal liability in a world without a code.</p> <p>Peckinpah\u2019s notion that mercy and virtue may be outmoded ideas in the hectic, grabby sprawl of the 20th century has ossified into prophecy as we\u2019ve rolled into the 21st. As with seemingly all pop culture predating the now, it\u2019s tempting to project on to the ongoing molasses flood of presidential politics; is the current Republican party not a \u201cwild bunch\u201d of its own, abandoning their principles one by one, throwing each other under the bus for a taste of power? This same concept applies to any fractious group organized around mutual distrust, whether that\u2019s the cowboy heirs shooting from the hip in America\u2019s police force or the divided country harboring them. His work resonates wherever betrayal can be adopted as an acceptable strategy for success.</p> <p>The film\u2019s nihilist streak \u2013 or at least, its cynical suggestion that believing in anything sturdier than nihilism must necessarily be a losing game \u2013 invests it with a spitting, yowling nastiness both formative and alien to the current cinema landscape of blandly gritty antiheroes. Peckinpah\u2019s senseless bloodshed foregrounded its own senselessness to comment on a time losing touch with its humanity; that we now think of this period as the \u201cgood old days\u201d indicates just how far we\u2019ve all fallen. The post-Wild Bunch years saw film-makers in the US rush into an onscreen arms race, detonating ever-greater quantities of squib packs as if in competition with one another. But the depths of its creator\u2019s jaded outlook, his sorrowful elegy for an epoch of American heroism that never really existed, his unsettlingly well-founded fear of a future dominated by self-interest \u2013 that\u2019s still bulletproof.</p> <p>\u2022 The caption to the first image was amended on 20 June 2019 because an earlier version suggested Warren Oates was Ben Johnson and vice versa.

As Holden\u2019s leading man Pike Bishop growls, \u201c$10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties.\u201d He speaks this crucial line of dialogue to his compatriot Angel, soon to be left for dead as a captive of a sadistic general in the Mexican military. When his change of heart comes, both too little and too late, the abrupt growth of a conscience cues up the bloodbath grand finale. Decency can be a fatal liability in a world without a code. Peckinpah\u2019s notion that mercy and virtue may be outmoded ideas in the hectic, grabby sprawl of the 20th century has ossified into prophecy as we\u2019ve rolled into the 21st. As with seemingly all pop culture predating the now, it\u2019s tempting to project on to the ongoing molasses flood of presidential politics; is the current Republican party not a \u201cwild bunch\u201d of its own, abandoning their principles one by one, throwing each other under the bus for a taste of power? This same concept applies to any fractious group organized around mutual distrust, whether that\u2019s the cowboy heirs shooting from the hip in America\u2019s police force or the divided country harboring them. His work resonates wherever betrayal can be adopted as an acceptable strategy for success. The film\u2019s nihilist streak \u2013 or at least, its cynical suggestion that believing in anything sturdier than nihilism must necessarily be a losing game \u2013 invests it with a spitting, yowling nastiness both formative and alien to the current cinema landscape of blandly gritty antiheroes. Peckinpah\u2019s senseless bloodshed foregrounded its own senselessness to comment on a time losing touch with its humanity; that we now think of this period as the \u201cgood old days\u201d indicates just how far we\u2019ve all fallen. The post-Wild Bunch years saw film-makers in the US rush into an onscreen arms race, detonating ever-greater quantities of squib packs as if in competition with one another. But the depths of its creator\u2019s jaded outlook, his sorrowful elegy for an epoch of American heroism that never really existed, his unsettlingly well-founded fear of a future dominated by self-interest \u2013 that\u2019s still bulletproof. \u2022 The caption to the first image was amended on 20 June 2019 because an earlier version suggested Warren Oates was Ben Johnson and vice versa.

The new Tory leader \u2013 and UK prime minister \u2013 should be confirmed by 22 July, at which point parliament will presumably go into recess and the EU27 on holiday.</p> <p>A couple of weeks after MPs return to Westminster in September, conference season starts.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s weekly Brexit briefing, doing its best to make sense of all this nonsense since June 2016. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And you can catch our monthly Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here. Top stories It\u2019s still all about the Tory leadership contest. Frontrunner Boris Johnson launched his campaign, shrugging off his long history of gaffes and blunders and painting himself as a one-nation candidate who could \u201cunite our country and our society\u201d. As widely predicted, the former foreign secretary promptly won the first round, garnering the support of 114 Conservative MPs against 43 for Jeremy Hunt, 37 for Michael Gove, 27 for Dominic Raab, 23 for Sajid Javid and 19 for Rory Stewart. His promise, along with others, to take the UK out of the EU \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d by 31 October came in for much stick. Philip Hammond said it would be impossible, and Rory Stewart threatened to set up an \u201calternative parliament\u201d to prevent it. Ken Clarke said any government backing no deal would be brought down, while the former Tory prime minister John Major reckoned anyone who believed Britain could possibly leave by Halloween was \u201choping for a miracle\u201d. Hunt also said 31 October should not be a \u201chard stop\u201d, warning that Johnson was posing a \u201cstark choice\u201d between no deal and a general election. But Raab said the Tories \u201cwould be toast\u201d if the 31 October deadline was not respected. But candidates hoping to force a \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d Brexit in October were boosted when MPs defeated a Labour-led attempt to prevent a no-deal exit, as opponents of a no-deal departure were warned they are fast running out of options. All the remaining leadership candidates \u2013 bar Johnson, who didn\u2019t fancy a format that allowed the candidates to address each other \u2013 stuck to their respective Brexit lines in a Channel 4 debate and lobby hustings, and health secretary Matt Hancock (who\u2019d pulled out after the first round of voting) came out for Johnson. In Brussels (remember Brussels?), the EU27 stressed for the umpteenth time that the withdrawal agreement would not be reopened, adding that while the bloc would not be able to sue the UK if \u2013 as Johnson has threatened \u2013 it withholds its \u00a339bn divorce bill, Britain\u2019s economy, security and universities would suffer if it did. And over at the Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn is facing a Brexit showdown with his shadow cabinet \u2013 including deputy leader Tom Watson \u2013 amid growing signs of grassroots revolt if he fails to give full backing to a second referendum in which Labour would campaign to remain. What next We can expect few concrete developments for several months. The new Tory leader \u2013 and UK prime minister \u2013 should be confirmed by 22 July, at which point parliament will presumably go into recess and the EU27 on holiday. A couple of weeks after MPs return to Westminster in September, conference season starts. The EU will be preoccupied with winning MEPs\u2019 backing for the new commission by 1 November. A 17-18 October summit, just a fortnight before the Brexit deadline, should help focus minds. While most candidates seem to believe it\u2019ll be a doddle to renegotiate the withdrawal treaty and fix the backstop, that\u2019s not actually going to happen \u2013 and certainly not before 31 October. So it\u2019s either a further extension (which Emmanuel Macron, for one, is not keen on) or no deal (which MPs could probably still block). Brexit: the gift that keeps on giving.

But the legislators in question do not seem particularly worried about a comeuppance in the 2020 election, judging by the extremist quality of their legislating.</p> <p>The legislators realize what a lot of voters still do not: in many places in the US today, the voters don\u2019t choose the politicians. The politicians choose the voters.</p> <p>Thanks to gerrymandering, by which political insiders draw distorted legislative districts to ensure that one party will hold that district, the only elections many seated officials have to worry about are primary challenges from opponents more extreme than they are, creating a kind of ideological arms race that is producing increasingly distorted policy, analysts say.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a direct line between gerrymandering and extreme policy outcomes like these \u2018heartbeat\u2019 abortion bills</p> <footer> <cite>David Daley</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere is a direct line between gerrymandering and extreme policy outcomes like these <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/05/abortion-doctors-fetal-heartbeat-bills-language-misleading\">\u2018heartbeat\u2019 abortion bills</a>,\u201d said David Daley, the bestselling author of Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn\u2019t Count. \u201cAnd not only does gerrymandering create the circumstances that elect such extreme legislatures, but it makes it extraordinarily difficult for voters to get rid of them when they go too far.</p> <p>\u201cThis is how gerrymandering sets up minority rule that voters can\u2019t undo at the ballot box. It\u2019s very dangerous, and we need to be taking this very, very seriously.\u201d</p> <p>As powerfully demonstrated by the passage last month in Alabama by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/14/alabama-abortion-ban-white-men-republicans\">25 white Republican men</a> of the country\u2019s strictest abortion law, minority rule persists as a defining feature of American governance.

      "bodyText": "Public opinion polls in Alabama, Georgia, Ohio and elsewhere have all found that a majority of citizens in those places prefer to keep abortion legal. Yet Republican-controlled legislatures in each of those states have, in the past three months, passed laws that would outlaw abortion in most cases. The customary reward in a democracy for violating the will of voters is ejection from office. But the legislators in question do not seem particularly worried about a comeuppance in the 2020 election, judging by the extremist quality of their legislating. The legislators realize what a lot of voters still do not: in many places in the US today, the voters don\u2019t choose the politicians. The politicians choose the voters. Thanks to gerrymandering, by which political insiders draw distorted legislative districts to ensure that one party will hold that district, the only elections many seated officials have to worry about are primary challenges from opponents more extreme than they are, creating a kind of ideological arms race that is producing increasingly distorted policy, analysts say. \u201cThere is a direct line between gerrymandering and extreme policy outcomes like these \u2018heartbeat\u2019 abortion bills,\u201d said David Daley, the bestselling author of Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn\u2019t Count. \u201cAnd not only does gerrymandering create the circumstances that elect such extreme legislatures, but it makes it extraordinarily difficult for voters to get rid of them when they go too far. \u201cThis is how gerrymandering sets up minority rule that voters can\u2019t undo at the ballot box. It\u2019s very dangerous, and we need to be taking this very, very seriously.\u201d As powerfully demonstrated by the passage last month in Alabama by 25 white Republican men of the country\u2019s strictest abortion law, minority rule persists as a defining feature of American governance. Bulwarks of minority rule range from historical factors such as the disenfranchisement of women and non-white people in the US constitution and the enslavement of African Americans, to today\u2019s dark money in politics and voter suppression schemes. One of the most effective tools, however, for asserting the kind of minority rule on display in the recent flurry of anti-abortion measures \u2013 Republican-controlled legislatures in at least six states have passed strict new anti-abortion laws in the past three months \u2013 is gerrymandering, analysts say. The parties\u2019 strategies for gerrymandering, which as Daley\u2019s book explains has been astonishingly effective on the Republican side over the last 15 years, may be about to be rewritten, if the supreme court rules as expected this month on whether the court should even hear partisan gerrymandering cases (as distinct from gerrymandering based, for example, on race). But whatever the supreme court decides, gerrymandering is too powerful a political tool for the parties to discard anytime soon. \u201cUncompetitive districts can allow [legislators] to pursue more extreme measures without any backlash from the electorate,\u201d said Robynn Kuhlmann, an associate professor of political science at the University of Central Missouri who specializes in state legislative elections. Though Missouri\u2019s legislature last month passed an eight-week abortion ban by a wide margin \u2013 24-10 in the senate, 110-44 in the house \u2013 such an extreme measure is, according to numerous polls, far out of step with public opinion. A 2018 Gallup poll found that 77% of US voters supported abortion access during the first trimester of pregnancy, and only 18% think it should be illegal in all circumstances. The thinktank Data for Progress, using national survey data, concluded that not one state has a majority of voters who support making abortion illegal in all circumstances; it estimated that in Missouri, only 20% of voters support a full ban on abortion. But Missouri is also a state with what Kuhlmann called \u201csweetheart gerrymandering\u201d \u2013 maps agreed upon between the parties that \u201cmaintain the status quo for districts that are essentially uncompetitive\u201d. Tellingly, nearly half of Missouri\u2019s state house elections were uncontested in 2016, \u201cwhich isn\u2019t actually all that different from other state legislatures\u201d, said Kuhlmann, \u201cbut it still illustrates how there\u2019s not even a seat at the table if no one is running against the incumbent\u201d. In Missouri, where Democratic voters are largely concentrated in two urban areas, Kansas City and St Louis, on opposite ends of the state, the status quo favors a veto-proof Republican majority. \u201cIf there is no competition, there is no real need for politicians to be more attentive to constituents and be more attentive to public opinion and polls,\u201d said Kuhlmann. This was the case in Ohio, which passed a six-week abortion ban last month. \u201cI think you can unequivocally state gerrymandering made that happen,\u201d Richard Gunther, professor emeritus of political science at Ohio State University, said of the law. Ohio\u2019s congressional map, which a panel of judges recently found unconstitutional, \u201ccracked\u201d and \u201cpacked\u201d Democratic voters into misshapen districts to ensure a Republican majority of representatives at both the state and federal levels; in 2012, for example, Democratic candidates for the state house received 55,000 more votes than Republicans, yet Republicans won a supermajority of seats (60 out of 99). As maps predetermined the partisan outcome, the onus of the vote shifted from general elections to the primaries, creating what Gunther called a \u201cdynamic of increased polarization, as more moderate members are ousted by more committed ideologues\u201d. But gerrymandering means that \u201cthose who are willing to adopt extreme positions on abortion are in a much stronger position than those who are moderates\u201d, said Gunther. And in turn, moderates like the former Ohio governor John Kasich, who vetoed a six-week abortion bill twice, \u201cwind up losing battles with the legislature, which is dominated by much more extreme individuals who have real ideological commitments\u201d. Similarly, the current map and redistricting procedure in Missouri \u201cmaintains the clear majority of Republicans in the state legislature and allows them to pursue conservative policies without much resistance\u201d, said Kuhlmann. That could change, however, with the implementation of new redistricting plan, known as Clean Missouri, which passed with 62% of the popular vote in 2018. The plan would put Missouri\u2019s redistricting effort in the hands of an independent demographer required by law to draw maps ensuring \u201cpartisan fairness\u201d. The changes have faced stiff opposition from Republicans, including the governor; since the election, five legislative resolutions have unsuccessfully challenged the plan, which is set to go into effect for the 2020 election. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the scariest things,\u201d said Daley. \u201cIn addition to this extreme legislation that we\u2019re seeing pop up around the country, one of the really frightful things we\u2019re watching is how these legislatures feel that they don\u2019t have to listen to the will of the people expressed in constitutional amendments involving democracy and voting rights. \u201cThey feel that way because they know how insulated they are, and they\u2019re determined to stay that way.\u201d Because districts will be redrawn again after the 2020 US census, and with the imminence of the supreme court ruling, the battle over gerrymandering is at an inflection point, Daley said.

Maybe I\u2019m jaded, but I don\u2019t know if enough is being achieved. I think I can live with my lymph undrained. A face massage by hand feels like a better way to increase circulation, while teabags or cucumber slices combat puffiness just as well. (Or even tablespoons straight from the freezer, which I once tried, to reduce my eyebags. They did stick to my eyelids, though.) The saving grace is that this green, elongated hourglass-shaped implement is a gorgeous thing. The soft tone of the stone, the green and gold, are highly alluring. Over the next few weeks, I find myself idly running the facial roller over my neck and cheeks. I like seeing it in the bathroom; I like it touching my skin. Sometimes it traps a beard hair, but that\u2019s my fault for not shaving. Besides, a little pinch is a small price to pay for stress relief. Maybe I have worked out my kink after all. Totally beside the point takeaway Women should definitely be using men\u2019s razors, because they are cheaper and sharper and last longer. Wellness or hellness? Too precious for its own good, to be stone cold. 2/5",

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Incumbent to launch campaign for second term</h2> <p>Hello, it\u2019s Warren Murray bringing you an executive summary of the news.</p> <p>Donald Trump will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/17/vulnerable-trump-begins-2020-campaign-amid-boasts-and-backlash\">launch his 2020 re-election campaign</a> today, taking the stage in Orlando, Florida. The president will seek to project self-confidence but he begins his run for a second term in one of the weakest positions of any incumbent president in modern times. Potential match-ups with Democratic rivals show Trump in trouble, according to polls. He is lagging behind Joe Biden 53% to 40%, Bernie Sanders 51% to 42%, and others as well, according to a Quinnipiac University National Poll. Leaked internal polling from Trump\u2019s campaign showed him trailing Biden by double digits in battleground states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p> <p>In 2016, Trump defied the polls and conventional wisdom to beat Hillary Clinton in the electoral college, though he lost the popular vote by nearly 3m ballots. He goes into 2020 with economic growth above 3% and unemployment at its lowest rate for half a century. George HW Bush was the last incumbent president to lose an election, defeated by Bill Clinton in 1992. The Trump launch is due to take place before a typically raucous 20,000 capacity crowd at the Amway Centre more than 16 months before <a href=\"https://preview.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2019/jun/12/us-election-2020-simple-guide-electoral-college-primaries\">election day in November 2020</a>.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Rip up the whole thing\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Boris Johnson is expected to cement his position as the favourite for the Tory leadership in another round of voting today. Sajid Javid, Rory Stewart and Dominic Raab are all battling to get 33 votes from fellow MPs in order to stay in the race. Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove are already past that threshold. MPs from all camps said Stewart appeared to have some momentum behind him. Those left in the race will compete in a BBC debate at 8pm \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/17/boris-johnson-accused-of-making-mps-contradictory-brexit-promises\">first television appearance by Johnson since the race kicked off</a>. Rivals have accused Johnson of promising \u201call things to all MPs\u201d, especially on getting a Brexit deal. Johnson had been telling hardcore leavers he would \u201crip up the whole thing\u201d said one MP, while also courting centrists by saying a no-deal Brexit is unlikely. A rival camp claimed Johnson seems to be either in favour of the HS2 rail project or against it, depending on who he is talking to at the time.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Troop boost in Gulf \u2013 </strong>The US is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/17/us-to-send-1000-additional-troops-to-the-middle-east-citing-hostile-behavior\">sending about 1,000 more troops to the Middle East</a>, with the Trump administration citing \u201chostile behaviour by Iranian forces and their proxy groups that threaten United States personnel and interests across the region\u201d. Fears of a confrontation between Iran and the United States have mounted since two oil tankers were attacked last week. Iran says it will soon breach limits on its stockpile of enriched uranium, which the White House called \u201cnuclear blackmail\u201d. Donald Trump withdrew the US from a 2015 nuclear deal limiting Iran\u2019s nuclear activities.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Further into destitution\u2019 \u2013 </strong>The number of homeless camps forcibly removed by councils across the UK has more than trebled in five years.

Complaints to councils about homeless encampments have shot up 448% in five years. Some councils seize tents and then charge to give them back. Matthew Downie from the charity Crisis said: \u201cIt drives people further into destitution and makes it more likely people will spend longer on the streets.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a5f82ac7dc80584b368452463f76a0c183d5ff5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a5f82ac7dc80584b368452463f76a0c183d5ff5/0_408_5976_3584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul, who lives in the All Saints church yard in Northampton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul, who lives in the All Saints church yard in Northampton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the gardens opposite Cardiff city hall, cardboard boxes, wooden pallets and discarded plastic bags form a shelter from the rain and wind.

One of them, Ian \u2013 who ended up homeless in Cardiff after his grandparents died \u2013 says: \u201cI would prefer to live in a tent than a scruffy flat. I have clothes and a blow-up bed in here.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Egypt ex-president dies \u2013 </strong>Mohamed Morsi, who has died during court proceedings, made history in 2012 when he became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/17/mohamed-morsi-obituary\">Egypt\u2019s first democratically chosen president</a>. A year later he was overthrown by the military, held in prison on a series of convictions, and his Muslim Brotherhood party banned as a terrorist organisation. Morsi, 67, was undergoing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/17/mohamed-morsi-dead-ousted-president-egypt-collapses-after-court-session\">retrial of charges of espionage</a> for Palestinian Hamas when he collapsed. Shortly before his collapse he is reported to have told the court that he knew \u201cmany secrets\u201d that, if revealed, would enable him to be released, though would not disclose them because doing so would harm Egypt\u2019s security. He insisted that he was still the country\u2019s legitimate president.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Bond with a mollusc \u2013 </strong>A reversible superglue that acts like dried slug mucus has proved strong enough to bear the weight of an 87kg engineering student (the assumption is it will work on other things as well).

      "bodyText": "Top story: Incumbent to launch campaign for second term Hello, it\u2019s Warren Murray bringing you an executive summary of the news. Donald Trump will launch his 2020 re-election campaign today, taking the stage in Orlando, Florida. The president will seek to project self-confidence but he begins his run for a second term in one of the weakest positions of any incumbent president in modern times. Potential match-ups with Democratic rivals show Trump in trouble, according to polls. He is lagging behind Joe Biden 53% to 40%, Bernie Sanders 51% to 42%, and others as well, according to a Quinnipiac University National Poll. Leaked internal polling from Trump\u2019s campaign showed him trailing Biden by double digits in battleground states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In 2016, Trump defied the polls and conventional wisdom to beat Hillary Clinton in the electoral college, though he lost the popular vote by nearly 3m ballots. He goes into 2020 with economic growth above 3% and unemployment at its lowest rate for half a century. George HW Bush was the last incumbent president to lose an election, defeated by Bill Clinton in 1992. The Trump launch is due to take place before a typically raucous 20,000 capacity crowd at the Amway Centre more than 16 months before election day in November 2020. * * * \u2018Rip up the whole thing\u2019 \u2013 Boris Johnson is expected to cement his position as the favourite for the Tory leadership in another round of voting today. Sajid Javid, Rory Stewart and Dominic Raab are all battling to get 33 votes from fellow MPs in order to stay in the race. Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove are already past that threshold. MPs from all camps said Stewart appeared to have some momentum behind him. Those left in the race will compete in a BBC debate at 8pm \u2013 the first television appearance by Johnson since the race kicked off. Rivals have accused Johnson of promising \u201call things to all MPs\u201d, especially on getting a Brexit deal. Johnson had been telling hardcore leavers he would \u201crip up the whole thing\u201d said one MP, while also courting centrists by saying a no-deal Brexit is unlikely. A rival camp claimed Johnson seems to be either in favour of the HS2 rail project or against it, depending on who he is talking to at the time. * * * Troop boost in Gulf \u2013 The US is sending about 1,000 more troops to the Middle East, with the Trump administration citing \u201chostile behaviour by Iranian forces and their proxy groups that threaten United States personnel and interests across the region\u201d. Fears of a confrontation between Iran and the United States have mounted since two oil tankers were attacked last week. Iran says it will soon breach limits on its stockpile of enriched uranium, which the White House called \u201cnuclear blackmail\u201d. Donald Trump withdrew the US from a 2015 nuclear deal limiting Iran\u2019s nuclear activities. * * * \u2018Further into destitution\u2019 \u2013 The number of homeless camps forcibly removed by councils across the UK has more than trebled in five years. Campaigners warn that the rough sleeping crisis is out of control, with the number of tent city clearances rising from 72 in 2014 to 254 in 2018. Complaints to councils about homeless encampments have shot up 448% in five years. Some councils seize tents and then charge to give them back. Matthew Downie from the charity Crisis said: \u201cIt drives people further into destitution and makes it more likely people will spend longer on the streets.\u201d In the gardens opposite Cardiff city hall, cardboard boxes, wooden pallets and discarded plastic bags form a shelter from the rain and wind. Three tents stand a few metres away. The council has given two residents 24 hours to find somewhere else to set up camp. One of them, Ian \u2013 who ended up homeless in Cardiff after his grandparents died \u2013 says: \u201cI would prefer to live in a tent than a scruffy flat. I have clothes and a blow-up bed in here.\u201d * * * Egypt ex-president dies \u2013 Mohamed Morsi, who has died during court proceedings, made history in 2012 when he became Egypt\u2019s first democratically chosen president. A year later he was overthrown by the military, held in prison on a series of convictions, and his Muslim Brotherhood party banned as a terrorist organisation. Morsi, 67, was undergoing a retrial of charges of espionage for Palestinian Hamas when he collapsed. Shortly before his collapse he is reported to have told the court that he knew \u201cmany secrets\u201d that, if revealed, would enable him to be released, though would not disclose them because doing so would harm Egypt\u2019s security. He insisted that he was still the country\u2019s legitimate president. * * * Bond with a mollusc \u2013 A reversible superglue that acts like dried slug mucus has proved strong enough to bear the weight of an 87kg engineering student (the assumption is it will work on other things as well). The hydrogel brewed up by University of Pennsylvania scientists may overcome the problem of glues being weak and reversible, or strong and irreversible, but never both strong and reversible. This stuff has a strong grip when dry but releases when squirted with water. Today in Focus podcast: The rehabilitation of Tony Blair? Tony Blair\u2019s re-entry into the national debate on Brexit comes at a time of a crisis of trust in British politics and a rise in populism. Also: Jim Waterson on the Saudi investment in the Evening Standard. Lunchtime read: \u2018Saudis couldn\u2019t do it without us\u2019 Britain does not merely supply the bombs that fall on Yemen \u2013 it provides the personnel and expertise that keep the war going. But is the government breaking the law? Sport A furious Nigeria manager, Thomas Dennerby, claimed the officials had ruined the match after Wendie Renard\u2019s retaken penalty following a double VAR check ensured France progress to the last 16 of the Women\u2019s World Cup having topped Group A. Elsewhere, Germany sealed top spot in Group B, two penalties assured Norway a place in the last 16 and a goalless draw sent China and Spain through. Eoin Morgan has said the possible stigma surrounding Alex Hales goes against his chances of a dramatic World Cup recall. Manchester United supporters have been involved in more football-related arrests where racism was an aggravating factor or feature than any other club in England in the four seasons to 2017-18. Nick Kyrgios is leading the latest outpouring of disrespect towards tennis\u2019s big three and says he is happy to keep his feud with Novak Djokovic ticking over at Wimbledon next month. Chris Froome was \u201clucky\u201d not to have sustained even greater injuries following his crash last week, according to his teammate Geraint Thomas.

An endless stream of sightseeing coaches and hire cars drive between Cork and Kilkenny, boosting the touristy Ireland of musical pubs and shops crammed with tweed, tea towels and other blarney.</p> <p>The Reeks District itself is a haven inside the Ring, a quiet refuge for families who have lived there for generations as well as newcomers who also love its remoteness, beauty and clear air.</p> <p>One of these is Jens Bachem, a German-Irish marketing consultant who worked in London for 20 years before moving to Kerry with his wife and son in 2017.

      "bodyText": "Halfway through cycling the Ring of the Reeks in Kerry, I realise I am going to make it. Not just the circuit\u2019s full 90km but also the tourist board\u2019s Big Five Challenge, which was launched this month. I started my mission three days earlier with a seven-hour trek to the top of Ireland\u2019s highest peak, 1,039-metre Carrauntoohil in MacGillycuddy\u2019s Reeks, the range of mountains I\u2019m now encircling by bike. The following day\u2019s action included surfing on Inch Beach, kayaking for 6km across Caragh Lake, and night-time paddleboarding on Cloon Lough in Kerry\u2019s Dark Sky Reserve. Today\u2019s ride includes 1,350 metres of climbing over three of Ireland\u2019s highest mountain passes. Moll\u2019s Gap is the second thigh-burning climb of the day and I end up walking the final stretch. It\u2019s my bike\u2019s fault: it has run out of gears. At the top I have a sandwich and a rest while taking in the astounding view of rock and water under ever-changing clouds. Having earned (almost) every metre of height through pedal power, I feel on top of the world. Back in the saddle, it\u2019s an easy spin down a twisting mountain road before another tough climb/walk to the top of the Gap of Dunloe. A break for some chocolate, then one more downhill and the final grind back into the market town of Killorglin where I started more than seven hours earlier. Legs tired, bum sore, but triumphant (it\u2019s a decade since I was on a bike), I know I\u2019ve completed something rather special. Like anyone else who completes the Big Five Challenge in five days, I also have a certificate to prove it and my name on a board at the Reeks District tourist office. This part of south-west Ireland is encircled by the Ring of Kerry, a scenic route now part of the highly promoted Wild Atlantic Way stretching from Donegal in the north down to the Cork coast. An endless stream of sightseeing coaches and hire cars drive between Cork and Kilkenny, boosting the touristy Ireland of musical pubs and shops crammed with tweed, tea towels and other blarney. The Reeks District itself is a haven inside the Ring, a quiet refuge for families who have lived there for generations as well as newcomers who also love its remoteness, beauty and clear air. One of these is Jens Bachem, a German-Irish marketing consultant who worked in London for 20 years before moving to Kerry with his wife and son in 2017. After setting up a holiday let on Caragh Lake, just outside Killorglin, he joined a group of similar small businesses interested in carefully promoting the region. \u201cKillorglin wasn\u2019t mentioned in the Wild Atlantic Way marketing,\u201d he says. \u201cWe thought we should do something about that.\u201d The result was the branding of the Reeks District as \u201cIreland\u2019s adventure playground\u201d. \u201cTogether, we looked at what the area actually had, compared with others,\u201d he says. \u201cWe narrowed that down to five key types of activity \u2013 \u2018boots, bikes, boards, boats, body and mind\u2019 \u2013 with one key signature experience attached to each. The notion of doing them all within five days is a stretch from that, so we\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d Bachem takes me for a drive around Killorglin, the neighbouring village of Glenbeigh and Caragh Lake. The country roads are narrow, many with grass up the middle and infrequent passing places. Fortunately, houses are few and far between so we meet only one or two cars. Stopping for a chat with an oncoming driver or a farmer at his gate is the norm. I can\u2019t take my eyes off the beauty around me: the Atlantic waves rolling in on one side and the Reeks looming on the other \u2013 small fields, wind-sculpted trees and ancient hedgerows, hills and moorland, rocks and lakes, rivers and stone bridges, sheep and horses, dramatic skies and wild sand dunes \u2026 There\u2019s almost a surplus of scenery. At Cromane beach, Jens points to an anonymous industrial shed from where local oysters are exported worldwide. Just across Dingle Bay is Castlemaine Harbour, home to the largest natural mussel bed in Ireland. Wild Atlantic salmon and sea trout are also caught here. Nearby Jack\u2019s Coastguard Restaurant, which looks out to sea, is the perfect place to taste this bounty: oysters that melt in the mouth, and chunky seafood chowder full of rich flavours. Jack\u2019s is one in a surprisingly wide choice of fine local restaurants at which appetites worked up in the Reeks District can be satisfied. Two grand hotels on Caragh Lake, Carrig House and Ard na Sidhe, open their fine dining to non-residents,and in Killorglin there\u2019s Nick\u2019s Seafood Restaurant, the Sol y Sombra Tapas Bar, Bianconi, and Kingdom 1795. Still recovering from my Big Five adventure, I take a leisurely evening drive around the Ring of Kerry. The narrow road twists through villages and around cliffs, seldom losing sight of the sea. With dusk falling, the tourist buses have left, and everyone else has gone to their own sanctuaries. At a remote lookout point, there is one parked car. Two women stand beside it offering smartphones stiff-armed to the reddening sun in the west. The silence after I turn off my engine is filled with birdsong, then a cow mooing. A dog barks in response, and a solitary cockerel crows. I laugh at the cliche. The women drive off, leaving me alone with the view. Below me is a bucolic scene of stonewalled fields and cottages with picture windows facing the ocean. But my eyes are drawn back inland, where the high Reeks behind still catch the light, calling me to a new adventure tomorrow. \u2022 For information on the Big Five, see reeksdistrict.com. A four-night package including B&amp;B and all five activities starts at \u20ac529pp (based on four participants). Guided ascents of Carrauntoohil start at \u20ac55pp; a day\u2019s kayaking from \u20ac65pp; two-hour surfing lessons from \u20ac35pp; a day cycling the Ring of the Reeks from \u20ac100pp (including bike/helmet hire and sandwiches); night-time paddleboarding on Cloon Lough from \u20ac65pp. Accommodation was provided by Kingstons (doubles from \u20ac110 room-only).

In Massachusetts, you can even get the apex predator on your license plate. But now, like the fictional town of Amity in Jaws, Cape Cod worries about what the arrival of deadly attacks will mean for its tourist economy. Greg Skomal, a senior scientist with the state\u2019s department of fish and game and Massachusetts\u2019 leading shark expert, says an increasing number of great whites have traveled to Cape Cod in recent summers, drawn by a rebounding seal population. Hunted relentlessly since European settlers first arrived in New England, the seal population has been recovering since the implementation of the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act, which prohibited the hunting, killing, capturing or harassment of marine mammals like seals and dolphins.

And in the case of the seals, that predator is the white shark,\u201d said Skomal. Massachusetts has always been within the range of great whites, but now they are migrating here from the south in greater numbers every summer. There have already been three shark attacks on people further south, off the coast of North Carolina, this month. Skomal says there are probably more great whites along the rest of New England\u2019s coast, but that Cape Cod\u2019s topography \u2013 like a giant sandbar sticking out in the ocean \u2013 means humans run into the sharks\u2019 hunting paths more often and that sharks get drawn into shallow water more easily.

      "body": "<h2>Andy Williams, co-songwriter</h2> <p>Me and my twin brother Jez used to go to this fair when we were 13. One day I won a prize \u2013 a record \u2013 and we were chased back to the train station by some locals who didn\u2019t like us being there. I played it when I got home, thought it was crap and stuck it at the back of my collection, never to be seen again. It was a version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/feb/26/how-we-made-hair-the-musical\">Hair</a> \u2013 not the official soundtrack but music inspired by the film of the musical. It was pretty dreadful.</p> <p>Skip forward 10 years and Jez, Jimi [Goodwin] and I were in<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_Sub\"> Sub Sub</a>. We\u2019d had a hit with<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC9O32R1BZY\"> Space Face</a> and were looking to follow it up. We used to spend all day smoking weed and playing records, searching for samples we could use on new tracks. Jez put the forgotten record on, we heard <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdAcw3z1Qo8&amp;t=194s\">Good Morning Starshine by Revelation</a> and it stopped us in our tracks. Those bars, the drum breaks. Jimi learned to play the bassline on a Roland Juno-106 keyboard, and the whole track came together quickly.</p> <p>We\u2019d only done instrumentals and we liked what we had created, but thought we should have a stab at doing lyrics. We needed a vocalist. Jimi\u2019s best friend, Joe Roberts, was going out with Melanie [they are now married], who was in a in a Manchester soul band called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temper_Temper_(Temper_Temper_album)\">Temper Temper</a>. We knew she\u2019d be great. She was, and she wrote the third verse.</p> <p>We met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/may/21/guardianobituaries1\">Rob </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/may/21/guardianobituaries1\">Gretton</a>, the Joy Division and New Order manager and co-director of Factory Records. He didn\u2019t believe in contracts and wanted to go 50/50 with us on the record. Virgin had dropped us after Space Face, which turned out to be a blessing \u2013 if we\u2019d been on a major label, we\u2019d have earned hardly anything on Ain\u2019t No Love. It sold 700,000 copies. We\u2019ll be for ever grateful to that song. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doves_(band)\">Doves</a> wouldn\u2019t be operating now without it: it bought us a studio and quite a few years of being able to work on music. And my mum was really pleased, because it meant that me and Jez could finally move out!</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRguEi3wufQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pRguEi3wufQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>We never heard from Revelation after clearing the sample. There is another well-known sample on there \u2013 <em>really </em>well known \u2013 but it\u2019s not musical and I\u2019m not going to tell you what it is in case someone comes after us. It\u2019s a sound, rather than a song, but we\u2019ll never tell.</p> <p>We were simply aiming for it to be successful enough that we wouldn\u2019t have to queue to get into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jul/02/how-we-made-hacienda-club\">the Ha</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jul/02/how-we-made-hacienda-club\">\u00e7ienda</a>. I never listen back to our stuff but I did hear it recently while I was swimming \u2013 it was playing at an aqua aerobics class. It still sounded good.</p> <h2>Melanie Williams, co-songwriter/vocals</h2> <p>I remember the three of them coming to my house in Chorlton with this idea for a song and asking me to do my thing on it. Jimi sang the melody he\u2019d written and I stopped still. It was perfect. Often, the biggest part of collaborating is recognising when something is already good and doesn\u2019t need changing. I think that was my key role in that track, to be honest, not letting them change it. I added lyrics but kept the original melody intact.</p> <p>We recorded it at Revolution Studios in Manchester. They and Dave [Rofe], their manager, kept saying \u201cIt\u2019s wicked,\u201d but I was convinced I sounded terrible. I was always battling with what I thought of my singing. Being mixed race, I think I had to make peace with my voice. There was loads of reverb on it, making the whole track sound really washed out. I got them to take that off and it really punched and became the track we know.</p> <p>We were booked to be on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpz-oem7Ric\">The Word</a> the Friday before the release, but I\u2019d lost my voice while we were filming the video. Everyone knew a good appearance on The Word meant you were set. I spent the week frantically trying to get better.</p> <p>I remember calling into the record label to see how it was doing and they said: \u201cIt\u2019s the highest new entry at No 10. Are you free to do Top of the Pops?\u201d I drove home in a daze and rang everyone but they were all out celebrating. So I did the washing up. It was surreal, there in my Marigolds, thinking about Top of the Pops. </p> <p>I now perform the song as part of Ha\u00e7ienda Classi\u00e7al. It\u2019s lovely that it has a life still \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZOz92OvQKM\">a remix by StoneBridge and Damien Hall</a> was released recently, so it keeps going.</p> <p>I made a pact years ago that I would never complain about the song \u2013 however many times I had to sing it \u2013 or get upset about people not knowing other things that I\u2019ve done, because it was such a privilege to be a part of.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/hacienda-classical-tickets/artist/2176780\">Ha\u00e7ienda Classi\u00e7al are performing live throughout the summer</a>. Doves albums Lost Souls, The Last Broadcast and Some Cities are <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Doves\">out now on vinyl</a>. They tour the UK until 23 August.</p>",

One day I won a prize \u2013 a record \u2013 and we were chased back to the train station by some locals who didn\u2019t like us being there. I played it when I got home, thought it was crap and stuck it at the back of my collection, never to be seen again. It was a version of Hair \u2013 not the official soundtrack but music inspired by the film of the musical. It was pretty dreadful. Skip forward 10 years and Jez, Jimi [Goodwin] and I were in Sub Sub. We\u2019d had a hit with Space Face and were looking to follow it up. We used to spend all day smoking weed and playing records, searching for samples we could use on new tracks. Jez put the forgotten record on, we heard Good Morning Starshine by Revelation and it stopped us in our tracks. Those bars, the drum breaks. Jimi learned to play the bassline on a Roland Juno-106 keyboard, and the whole track came together quickly. We\u2019d only done instrumentals and we liked what we had created, but thought we should have a stab at doing lyrics. We needed a vocalist. Jimi\u2019s best friend, Joe Roberts, was going out with Melanie [they are now married], who was in a in a Manchester soul band called Temper Temper. We knew she\u2019d be great. She was, and she wrote the third verse. We met Rob Gretton, the Joy Division and New Order manager and co-director of Factory Records. He didn\u2019t believe in contracts and wanted to go 50/50 with us on the record. Virgin had dropped us after Space Face, which turned out to be a blessing \u2013 if we\u2019d been on a major label, we\u2019d have earned hardly anything on Ain\u2019t No Love. It sold 700,000 copies. We\u2019ll be for ever grateful to that song. Doves wouldn\u2019t be operating now without it: it bought us a studio and quite a few years of being able to work on music. And my mum was really pleased, because it meant that me and Jez could finally move out! We never heard from Revelation after clearing the sample. There is another well-known sample on there \u2013 really well known \u2013 but it\u2019s not musical and I\u2019m not going to tell you what it is in case someone comes after us. It\u2019s a sound, rather than a song, but we\u2019ll never tell. We were simply aiming for it to be successful enough that we wouldn\u2019t have to queue to get into the Ha\u00e7ienda. I never listen back to our stuff but I did hear it recently while I was swimming \u2013 it was playing at an aqua aerobics class. It still sounded good. Melanie Williams, co-songwriter/vocals I remember the three of them coming to my house in Chorlton with this idea for a song and asking me to do my thing on it. Jimi sang the melody he\u2019d written and I stopped still. It was perfect. Often, the biggest part of collaborating is recognising when something is already good and doesn\u2019t need changing. I think that was my key role in that track, to be honest, not letting them change it. I added lyrics but kept the original melody intact. We recorded it at Revolution Studios in Manchester. They and Dave [Rofe], their manager, kept saying \u201cIt\u2019s wicked,\u201d but I was convinced I sounded terrible. I was always battling with what I thought of my singing. Being mixed race, I think I had to make peace with my voice. There was loads of reverb on it, making the whole track sound really washed out. I got them to take that off and it really punched and became the track we know. We were booked to be on The Word the Friday before the release, but I\u2019d lost my voice while we were filming the video. Everyone knew a good appearance on The Word meant you were set. I spent the week frantically trying to get better. I remember calling into the record label to see how it was doing and they said: \u201cIt\u2019s the highest new entry at No 10. Are you free to do Top of the Pops?\u201d I drove home in a daze and rang everyone but they were all out celebrating. So I did the washing up. It was surreal, there in my Marigolds, thinking about Top of the Pops. I now perform the song as part of Ha\u00e7ienda Classi\u00e7al. It\u2019s lovely that it has a life still \u2013 a remix by StoneBridge and Damien Hall was released recently, so it keeps going. I made a pact years ago that I would never complain about the song \u2013 however many times I had to sing it \u2013 or get upset about people not knowing other things that I\u2019ve done, because it was such a privilege to be a part of. \u2022 Ha\u00e7ienda Classi\u00e7al are performing live throughout the summer. Doves albums Lost Souls, The Last Broadcast and Some Cities are out now on vinyl. They tour the UK until 23 August.",

In St Pete, you could easily be in California \u2013 they lean left big time. In the north part of the county there are a lot of retirees, people who are older, more conservative, and in the middle you have this mix, the older population and young families, who are 30s to 50s.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve pushed south Pinellas, I believe, strongly to be blue, and the middle part is now leaning really blue. And we\u2019re going to turn the north part of this county purple. That\u2019s our plan to deliver Pinellas in 2020.\u201d</p> <p>For Democrats hoping to oust Trump, recent developments have been positive. Charlie Crist, a former state governor, reversed 33 years of Republican dominance to flip Florida\u2019s 13th congressional district, incorporating the lower two-thirds of Pinellas county, in 2016.</p> <p>In last year\u2019s midterms, the county went blue again by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/07/andrew-gillum-fails-florida-first-black-governor-ron-desantis\">backing Andrew Gillum</a> and Bill Nelson in their ultimately unsuccessful statewide campaigns for the governor\u2019s mansion and US Senate seat respectively.</p> <p>Scott, however, insists there is no room for complacency, and soon after becoming county chair following the midterms called together party leaders of neighboring Tampa Bay area counties to discuss strategy for 2020 and beyond in what she calls the \u201cbay blue bloc\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI knew we could do more,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Democrat is not going to get elected by just commenting on how horrible a president Donald Trump is.\u201d</p> <p>A coordinated campaign focused on ground-level canvassing, Scott believes, will be crucial, and activists are already knocking on doors months before a Democrat is even nominated to challenge Trump.</p> <p>\u201cGrassroots is grassroots is grassroots,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re canvassing Democrats who didn\u2019t vote in the midterms, or maybe 2016, and we\u2019re asking \u2018hey, what issues are important to you, what issues would encourage you to vote for a candidate?\u2019, so we can focus our targets for next year when we have that candidate.\u201d</p> <p>Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist who was Obama\u2019s Florida campaign chair, believes the county is crucially significant. \u201cIn 08 and 12, Obama\u2019s first real general election campaigning in Florida was both times in Pinellas, and that wasn\u2019t accidental,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI hesitate to say the person who wins Pinellas wins Florida, but it\u2019s hard to see a scenario where a Democrat loses Pinellas but wins Florida.</p> <p>\u201cPinellas now is a very expensive place to live, so there is that squeeze on people. One of the things we leaned into with Obama was his plan to reform the tax code by cutting middle-class taxes.\u201d</p> <p>Republicans locally agree on the importance of the economy and voters\u2019 personal finances when it comes to making a decision, but believe that works in Trump\u2019s favor.</p> <p>\u201cPinellas proved that you could have a Republican president with a message that reaches the blue-collar, working-class Democrat,\u201d said Anthony Pedicini, a senior GOP strategist and adviser.</p> <p>\u201cThe strategy has to be the proof to those white, male Democratic blue-collar voters that the economy is better, that their situation in life is better, they\u2019re making more money and able to invest in their families and their futures, and that President Trump is the one helping them to do that.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "In November 2016, the morning after Donald Trump was elected president, Pastor Andy Oliver put on his clerical collar and stepped outside the Allendale United Methodist church in St Petersburg with a sign he had stayed up late to make. It read: \u201cWe Choose Love.\u201d The voters of Pinellas county, the biggest and most significant swing county in Florida, had just helped Trump into the White House after backing Barack Obama in two straight elections, and as the day wore on, Oliver\u2019s parishioners joined him in the street with signs echoing his message. \u201cI knew a lot of people were afraid of what was to come. People of color, LBGTQ people, those that practice a different religion, people who live in the margins of society,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had seen some threats, but we didn\u2019t know then what this Trump presidency was going to bring.\u201d Now, with Trump announcing his 2020 re-election bid on Tuesday just 100 miles to the east in Orlando, and with Pinellas set once again to play a pivotal role in that election, Oliver\u2019s church in the historic Allendale neighborhood close to downtown St Pete is a hive of activity. Rainbow-colored Pride banners, Black Lives Matter and Co-exist flags hang outside meeting rooms, nurses gather to discuss collective bargaining rights, affordable housing advocates plot their lobbying strategies - all community groups doing what Oliver calls \u201cthe work of the resistance\u201d. \u201cWe decided as a church to open our space to any group doing work for justice in the community,\u201d he said. \u201cAdvocating healthcare for all, advocacy work around what people of color are experiencing, gun reform, women\u2019s reproductive rights, all those things that are under threat right now.\u201d And while the pastor says the activism is social rather than political \u2013 \u201cwe\u2019d organize equally as hard if a Republican championed these values,\u201d he insists \u2013 the target is unmistakable. Even the public messages on the church\u2019s marquee, which have occasionally landed Oliver in hot water, are focused directly on controversies that Trump has fomented: \u201cWhite Supremacy is the real crisis,\u201d read one, and at Christmas: \u201cWe can\u2019t worship the child in the manger while turning our backs on the child at the border.\u201d \u201cThe best thing about the Trump presidency is that he has motivated a lot of people to pay attention and work together and find tangible ways to love each other,\u201d Oliver said. If history is any guide, whichever way Pinellas county voters swing next November will decide if Trump wins another four years in the White House. The heavily populated county at the western end of Florida\u2019s I-4 corridor has backed every winning presidential candidate, five Republicans and four Democrats, since 1980, the anomaly of the 2000 election excepted. It was also the largest of only four Florida counties, out of 67, that swung to Trump in 2016 after supporting Obama in the two previous contests. \u201cTrump won Pinellas by barely 1% so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re in the middle of a red county,\u201d said Barbara Scott, chair of the Pinellas Democratic party. \u201cThe county is a swatch of America. In St Pete, you could easily be in California \u2013 they lean left big time. In the north part of the county there are a lot of retirees, people who are older, more conservative, and in the middle you have this mix, the older population and young families, who are 30s to 50s. \u201cWe\u2019ve pushed south Pinellas, I believe, strongly to be blue, and the middle part is now leaning really blue. And we\u2019re going to turn the north part of this county purple. That\u2019s our plan to deliver Pinellas in 2020.\u201d For Democrats hoping to oust Trump, recent developments have been positive. Charlie Crist, a former state governor, reversed 33 years of Republican dominance to flip Florida\u2019s 13th congressional district, incorporating the lower two-thirds of Pinellas county, in 2016. In last year\u2019s midterms, the county went blue again by backing Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson in their ultimately unsuccessful statewide campaigns for the governor\u2019s mansion and US Senate seat respectively. Scott, however, insists there is no room for complacency, and soon after becoming county chair following the midterms called together party leaders of neighboring Tampa Bay area counties to discuss strategy for 2020 and beyond in what she calls the \u201cbay blue bloc\u201d. \u201cI knew we could do more,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Democrat is not going to get elected by just commenting on how horrible a president Donald Trump is.\u201d A coordinated campaign focused on ground-level canvassing, Scott believes, will be crucial, and activists are already knocking on doors months before a Democrat is even nominated to challenge Trump. \u201cGrassroots is grassroots is grassroots,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re canvassing Democrats who didn\u2019t vote in the midterms, or maybe 2016, and we\u2019re asking \u2018hey, what issues are important to you, what issues would encourage you to vote for a candidate?\u2019, so we can focus our targets for next year when we have that candidate.\u201d Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist who was Obama\u2019s Florida campaign chair, believes the county is crucially significant. \u201cIn 08 and 12, Obama\u2019s first real general election campaigning in Florida was both times in Pinellas, and that wasn\u2019t accidental,\u201d he said. \u201cI hesitate to say the person who wins Pinellas wins Florida, but it\u2019s hard to see a scenario where a Democrat loses Pinellas but wins Florida. \u201cPinellas now is a very expensive place to live, so there is that squeeze on people. One of the things we leaned into with Obama was his plan to reform the tax code by cutting middle-class taxes.\u201d Republicans locally agree on the importance of the economy and voters\u2019 personal finances when it comes to making a decision, but believe that works in Trump\u2019s favor. \u201cPinellas proved that you could have a Republican president with a message that reaches the blue-collar, working-class Democrat,\u201d said Anthony Pedicini, a senior GOP strategist and adviser. \u201cThe strategy has to be the proof to those white, male Democratic blue-collar voters that the economy is better, that their situation in life is better, they\u2019re making more money and able to invest in their families and their futures, and that President Trump is the one helping them to do that.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u2018People talk about Eskilstuna as the place where nothing new is invented,\u201d says the shopping mall manager Anna Bergstr\u00f6m. An hour\u2019s train ride from Stockholm, the \u201cSheffield of Sweden\u201d has had something of an image problem in recent years. Once a steel-producing powerhouse, the town has fallen on hard times, thanks to the rapid decline in the industry throughout the 1970s. It now has an unemployment rate that is almost double the national average of 8%.</p> <p>But the town has come up with an answer: recycling. Far from the Scandinavian stereotype of glossy modernity, Eskilstuna\u2019s wide-paved, near-deserted grey streets are populated by kitsch 1980s pizzerias, workers\u2019 cafes and gloomy pubs \u2013 not a place where you would expect to find such a radical approach to the environment. Yet since 2012, Eskilstuna has implemented a spate of green initiatives, vying to make it the most environmentally friendly city in Sweden \u2013 and perhaps the world. Public buses and cars are run on biogas and electricity, and the town uses low-carbon combined heat and power plants, which use the thermal energy from electricity production to heat water. Residents sort their waste into seven multicoloured categories at home \u2013 green for food, pink for textiles, grey for metal, yellow for paper, blue for newspaper, orange for plastic and black for mixed \u2013 and for the past four years people have been able to drop off their unwanted goods for recycling at Bergstr\u00f6m\u2019s secondhand mall.</p> <p>Bergstr\u00f6m moved to Eskilstuna in 2012, after becoming disillusioned with the huge waste she encountered during her career in commercial fashion, to run ReTuna (Tuna is the town\u2019s nickname). She says the idea startled people to begin with. \u201cWhen I first came here, no one knew about the mall. And when they did, no one liked it,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a town like this, which has suffered, people are suspicious of change, especially something as radical as a shopping mall where all the goods are donated by the people of the town and then resold to them.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, since the recycling scheme began and ReTuna opened it has been a success, resulting in no domestic waste going to landfill, and potentially providing a second lease of life for the steel city. Despite being a 20-minute drive from the town centre on a Wednesday morning, ReTuna is full of shoppers roaming through secondhand stores, looking at everything from furniture to children\u2019s toys, flowers and clothes. The mall is situated in an unassuming warehouse building in the middle of a field, next to one of the town\u2019s two recycling centres. Residents drop off their goods to be sorted by the 12 staff on hand in the cavernous warehouse beneath the shop floors. Standing in ReTuna\u2019s entrance hall beneath a tree fashioned from recycled cups, Bergstr\u00f6m explains how she won over the town. \u201cEveryone\u2019s minds began to change the day we opened,\u201d she says. \u201cSix thousand people came to visit that day, and since then we average 700 visitors a day and 300 tour groups a year.\u201d</p> <p>The daily tour groups \u2013 which are made up mainly of students \u2013 shows how innovative Eskilstuna\u2019s recycling schemes are. Today\u2019s tour, for instance, is part of an exchange between Indian students from a college in Pune and a local Swedish media school. The teacher from Pune, Sonia Khambete, organised the trip after she heard about ReTuna on social media. \u201cThis is a very inspiring place,\u201d she says. \u201cIn India, we have a huge waste management problem where, as the population grows, we increasingly live in a throwaway culture. We brought our students here because we could all learn a lot from a place like ReTuna.\u201d</p> <p>Mother-and-daughter shoppers Sandra and Elisabeth Jarvinen agree. \u201cWe have lived in Eskilstuna our whole lives,\u201d Sandra says, \u201cand ReTuna has revitalised the town, it\u2019s something for us to be proud of.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"16475012efc25662b9b60e7121947bc1a6c2b69d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16475012efc25662b9b60e7121947bc1a6c2b69d/0_863_3992_4990/800.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Bergstr\u00f6m \u2026 \u2018Everyone\u2019s minds began to change the day we opened.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Bergstr\u00f6m \u2026 \u2018Everyone\u2019s minds began to change the day we opened.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bjorn Gutenberg, who lives 30 miles (50km) outside ReTuna, but comes to shop here at least once a week, says: \u201cWe\u2019re actually addressing the problem. It creates job opportunities, and it\u2019s great for people to see the whole chain of recycling and consumption.\u201d Shoppers come from even further afield, too, says Bergstr\u00f6m who adds that families have visited from France, Japan and even Australia.</p> <p>ReTuna is owned by Eskilstuna\u2019s energy board, which is run by the city municipality, the Swedish version of a local council. To get the project started, the municipality invested 19.5m Swedish kronor (\u00a31.6m) for building works, but also to subsidise rates for the shop owners. In 2018, for the first time, the mall operated without this subsidy and it broke even, but Bergstr\u00f6m knows revenues need to increase to keep the business running. \u201cWe need to make more money to be able to hire people because the shop owners work really hard seven days a week.\u201d</p> <p>One such shop owner is Maria Larsson, who works a 70-hour week to keep her florist open. Alongside preowned items, she sells upcycled pieces, too. \u201cI\u2019ve invested all my money into this shop, and I\u2019m hoping this is the first year I\u2019ll actually get paid,\u201d she says. \u201cI have had to put all the money [it has made] back into the business, and have pretty much been surviving on my fiance\u2019s wages. This mall would maybe work better in a town with more people and more employment.\u201d</p> <p>Larsson, like the other shop owners, has to address the problem of how to price products they have received for nothing \u2013 while still making a profit and paying the costs of running their shops. \u201cPeople assume our products should be cheap, but it\u2019s really hard to price what we do,\u201d she says. \u201cEskilstuna is a workers\u2019 town, so people here are suspicious; they care about functionality over sustainability.\u201d A rummage through the mall finds shirts retailing for 120 kronor, books for 60 kronor and Larsson\u2019s flower pots for 480 kronor.</p> <p>For the workers in the sorting plant, it is an equally demanding job. Matti Koskela, 25, works 10-hour shifts, hauling waste from cars into the ReTuna warehouse. \u201cEverything people bring along is very good,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve shopped in the mall once before, and thought it was great. We all work very hard because people around here don\u2019t have much money. But it\u2019s a lot better than my last job in an incineration plant. I just hope the mall will last.\u201d</p> <p>More than 10% of Eskilstuna\u2019s population of 100,000 is made up of refugees (about 239,000 people sought asylum in the country between 2015 and 2018, <a href=\"https://www.government.se/articles/2017/02/facts-about-migration-and-crime-in-sweden/\">according to the government</a>) and the shopping mall provides opportunities for them to acquire skills, or brush them up. Yusuf al-Aboud from Syria has lived in Sweden for two years and works as a handyman in the ReTuna furniture store. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked making things, doing work with my hands, so this job has been great to help with the environment as well as produce nice products,\u201d he says, smiling, while painting a repurposed dresser. \u201cBack home, we would never throw things away unless they are completely broken, so this work is usual for me.\u201d His residency permit has not been renewed for next year, though, and so he will soon be forced to move on. \u201cThey want me to enrol in university or get some more education, but I already have all the skills I need,\u201d he says. \u201cI wish they would let me keep on working.\u201d</p> <p>Another recent arrival to Eskilstuna is a Glaswegian, Kevin Roxburgh. Having lived in Stockholm for 30 years, Roxburgh moved to Eskilstuna two weeks ago to manage ReTuna\u2019s franchise of the charity shop chain, Stadsmissionen. \u201cI used to work in fashion, like Anna,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I became totally disillusioned with all the waste \u2013 I decided I wanted to help people in their lives instead.\u201d Stadsmissionen employs staff with learning difficulties and long-term unemployed people. It was founded in Roxburgh\u2019s home town, under the name Glasgow City Mission. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised by the mall,\u201d he says, \u201cand I think this recycling system is brilliant \u2013 it\u2019s much better than Stockholm\u2019s and definitely better than the UK\u2019s.\u201d Roxburgh recently gained Swedish citizenship, because of \u201call this Brexit bullshit\u201d, and says he has no plans to move back. \u201cThis is the real community spirit here,\u201d he adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a452b20f51354596719f48825eb7e8f9a6f701ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a452b20f51354596719f48825eb7e8f9a6f701ba/0_204_5976_3584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maria Larsson \u2026 \u2018People assume our products should be cheap.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maria Larsson \u2026 \u2018People assume our products should be cheap.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Any waste, or \u201cresources\u201d, that cannot be resold in ReTuna, finds its way to the Lilla Nyby sorting centre a 20-minute drive away. From the outside, Lilla Nyby is a typical waste plant: heaps of putrid rubbish waiting to be sorted, opportunistic gulls swooping and diggers carving through the mounds. There is a noticeable lack of people at Lilla Nyby, though. Inside the warehouse, the recycling bags whirr through a maze of conveyor belts, passing camera points which recognise their different colours and then swat them off the line accordingly. The result is a seamless trash-maze that allows five people to process 20,000 tonnes of waste a year.</p> <p>Standing beneath the energy board\u2019s logo, which looks like a floating carrot, the manager, Mattias Hellstr\u00f6m, explains how it takes the effort out of recycling: \u201cThe machine is perfect because people are lazy,\u201d he says. Hellstr\u00f6m joined the team 10 years ago, when the plant was being built alongside the covered remains of the town\u2019s landfill. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this whole place change in that time,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore, if you wanted to recycle any waste, you would have to drive it to the bins by the supermarket. With this new system, people seem much more engaged with the environment because it is so easy \u2013 we have more than 97% accuracy in the sorting of waste in the bags.\u201d Although sometimes something unusual turns up: \u201cWe found a dead puppy in one of the blue bags two years ago.\u201d</p> <p>As well as simply sorting the waste, food waste is composted at Lilla Nyby and sold back to residents. \u201cIt\u2019s so high-quality, it sells out,\u201d Hellstr\u00f6m says \u2013 and the biogas from food waste at the plant is used for the city\u2019s buses. In a small, humid shed behind the warehouse, an Uppsala University research project is taking place. They are testing the use of maggot larvae to digest food waste, then using the fattened maggots to feed to livestock, and potentially even humans. The worm has turned.</p> <p>Sorting your household rubbish into seven different categories may sound like a step too far, yet the residents of Eskilstuna, it seems, have become waste aficionados. This might be because to opt out of the multicoloured scheme means doubling the yearly household waste disposal fee of 2,894 kronor. Yet, for new parents Caroline and Marlin Sommerlid, the recycling scheme is a moral obligation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cfc5da37af2f5dc3238160a4f096632b303655b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cfc5da37af2f5dc3238160a4f096632b303655b/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Recycled chairs in ReTuna.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recycled chairs in ReTuna.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re very proud citizens to have this scheme here,\u201d Caroline says, her five-week-old baby resting on her shoulder. \u201cI want my children to grow up in a world that hasn\u2019t been destroyed, and for them to leave it in better shape than they got it in.\u201d</p> <p>We meet in their newly built, eco-friendly house situated in the leafy suburbs of Eskilstuna. \u201cI built this house to fit in with our recycling systems,\u201d construction engineer Marlin says, showing the integrated bins nestled beneath the sink. \u201cCaroline is obsessed \u2013 I came from a place where people didn\u2019t recycle, but her parents were militant.\u201d \u201cWhen I go to places without the sorting systems, I feel as if I\u2019m back in the 80s,\u201d Caroline says.</p> <p>If the scheme is so successful, why hasn\u2019t it been introduced to other municipalities in Sweden, or even to other countries? \u201cThese projects require a lot of land to operate on,\u201d the municipality\u2019s director of energy, Kristina Birath, explains. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason it couldn\u2019t be implemented throughout Sweden though. We just need more bold politicians with a vision to be green.\u201d This may be increasingly difficult with Sweden recently experiencing the resurgence in far-right politics seemingly sweeping throughout Europe. Jimmie \u00c5kesson, leader of the Sweden Democrats, who won 17% of votes in the 2018 elections, has said that Greta Thunberg\u2019s protest against the climate crisis is a \u201cstaged promotional campaign\u201d. Yet Birath is optimistic: \u201cFrom next year, all Swedish municipalities will be legally required to recycle. We have had rightwing governments before, so we\u2019re used to being brave.\u201d</p> <p>The Social Democrat leader of the municipality, Jimmy Jansson, says other Swedish towns are slow to catch up because of a \u201clack of knowledge\u201d. Born and raised in the town, Jansson left school at the height of its deindustrialisation. \u201cWe lost 10,000 inhabitants, and we\u2019re still recovering from that time,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had to find a new identity, and it felt natural to tackle the question of being a dirty industrial town. We had an opportunity to learn from our past mistakes and, even though we have not entirely recovered, it\u2019s not difficult to do the right thing \u2013 it\u2019s our responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>With continued high unemployment, these environmental policies could appear nothing more than a cynical rebrand for a town which, in Jansson\u2019s words, \u201cnobody wanted to come to\u201d. Yet, Birath says, while the new recycling scheme has created 50 new jobs \u2013 a small dent in the almost 15,000 unemployed \u2013 for residents, the radical green action has not just put Eskilstuna back on the map. It has done so in a way that makes them proud.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been a long time coming,\u201d Bergstr\u00f6m says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get a town on board that has been so scarred by change in the past \u2013 so if we can make a success of it here, it could happen anywhere in the world. Where there is waste, there is an opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 June 2019. The original stated that 780,000 people had sought asylum in Sweden since 2015.

      "bodyText": "\u2018People talk about Eskilstuna as the place where nothing new is invented,\u201d says the shopping mall manager Anna Bergstr\u00f6m. An hour\u2019s train ride from Stockholm, the \u201cSheffield of Sweden\u201d has had something of an image problem in recent years. Once a steel-producing powerhouse, the town has fallen on hard times, thanks to the rapid decline in the industry throughout the 1970s. It now has an unemployment rate that is almost double the national average of 8%. But the town has come up with an answer: recycling. Far from the Scandinavian stereotype of glossy modernity, Eskilstuna\u2019s wide-paved, near-deserted grey streets are populated by kitsch 1980s pizzerias, workers\u2019 cafes and gloomy pubs \u2013 not a place where you would expect to find such a radical approach to the environment. Yet since 2012, Eskilstuna has implemented a spate of green initiatives, vying to make it the most environmentally friendly city in Sweden \u2013 and perhaps the world. Public buses and cars are run on biogas and electricity, and the town uses low-carbon combined heat and power plants, which use the thermal energy from electricity production to heat water. Residents sort their waste into seven multicoloured categories at home \u2013 green for food, pink for textiles, grey for metal, yellow for paper, blue for newspaper, orange for plastic and black for mixed \u2013 and for the past four years people have been able to drop off their unwanted goods for recycling at Bergstr\u00f6m\u2019s secondhand mall. Bergstr\u00f6m moved to Eskilstuna in 2012, after becoming disillusioned with the huge waste she encountered during her career in commercial fashion, to run ReTuna (Tuna is the town\u2019s nickname). She says the idea startled people to begin with. \u201cWhen I first came here, no one knew about the mall. And when they did, no one liked it,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a town like this, which has suffered, people are suspicious of change, especially something as radical as a shopping mall where all the goods are donated by the people of the town and then resold to them.\u201d Yet, since the recycling scheme began and ReTuna opened it has been a success, resulting in no domestic waste going to landfill, and potentially providing a second lease of life for the steel city. Despite being a 20-minute drive from the town centre on a Wednesday morning, ReTuna is full of shoppers roaming through secondhand stores, looking at everything from furniture to children\u2019s toys, flowers and clothes. The mall is situated in an unassuming warehouse building in the middle of a field, next to one of the town\u2019s two recycling centres. Residents drop off their goods to be sorted by the 12 staff on hand in the cavernous warehouse beneath the shop floors. Standing in ReTuna\u2019s entrance hall beneath a tree fashioned from recycled cups, Bergstr\u00f6m explains how she won over the town. \u201cEveryone\u2019s minds began to change the day we opened,\u201d she says. \u201cSix thousand people came to visit that day, and since then we average 700 visitors a day and 300 tour groups a year.\u201d The daily tour groups \u2013 which are made up mainly of students \u2013 shows how innovative Eskilstuna\u2019s recycling schemes are. Today\u2019s tour, for instance, is part of an exchange between Indian students from a college in Pune and a local Swedish media school. The teacher from Pune, Sonia Khambete, organised the trip after she heard about ReTuna on social media. \u201cThis is a very inspiring place,\u201d she says. \u201cIn India, we have a huge waste management problem where, as the population grows, we increasingly live in a throwaway culture. We brought our students here because we could all learn a lot from a place like ReTuna.\u201d Mother-and-daughter shoppers Sandra and Elisabeth Jarvinen agree. \u201cWe have lived in Eskilstuna our whole lives,\u201d Sandra says, \u201cand ReTuna has revitalised the town, it\u2019s something for us to be proud of.\u201d Bjorn Gutenberg, who lives 30 miles (50km) outside ReTuna, but comes to shop here at least once a week, says: \u201cWe\u2019re actually addressing the problem. It creates job opportunities, and it\u2019s great for people to see the whole chain of recycling and consumption.\u201d Shoppers come from even further afield, too, says Bergstr\u00f6m who adds that families have visited from France, Japan and even Australia. ReTuna is owned by Eskilstuna\u2019s energy board, which is run by the city municipality, the Swedish version of a local council. To get the project started, the municipality invested 19.5m Swedish kronor (\u00a31.6m) for building works, but also to subsidise rates for the shop owners. In 2018, for the first time, the mall operated without this subsidy and it broke even, but Bergstr\u00f6m knows revenues need to increase to keep the business running. \u201cWe need to make more money to be able to hire people because the shop owners work really hard seven days a week.\u201d One such shop owner is Maria Larsson, who works a 70-hour week to keep her florist open. Alongside preowned items, she sells upcycled pieces, too. \u201cI\u2019ve invested all my money into this shop, and I\u2019m hoping this is the first year I\u2019ll actually get paid,\u201d she says. \u201cI have had to put all the money [it has made] back into the business, and have pretty much been surviving on my fiance\u2019s wages. This mall would maybe work better in a town with more people and more employment.\u201d Larsson, like the other shop owners, has to address the problem of how to price products they have received for nothing \u2013 while still making a profit and paying the costs of running their shops. \u201cPeople assume our products should be cheap, but it\u2019s really hard to price what we do,\u201d she says. \u201cEskilstuna is a workers\u2019 town, so people here are suspicious; they care about functionality over sustainability.\u201d A rummage through the mall finds shirts retailing for 120 kronor, books for 60 kronor and Larsson\u2019s flower pots for 480 kronor. For the workers in the sorting plant, it is an equally demanding job. Matti Koskela, 25, works 10-hour shifts, hauling waste from cars into the ReTuna warehouse. \u201cEverything people bring along is very good,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve shopped in the mall once before, and thought it was great. We all work very hard because people around here don\u2019t have much money. But it\u2019s a lot better than my last job in an incineration plant. I just hope the mall will last.\u201d More than 10% of Eskilstuna\u2019s population of 100,000 is made up of refugees (about 239,000 people sought asylum in the country between 2015 and 2018, according to the government) and the shopping mall provides opportunities for them to acquire skills, or brush them up. Yusuf al-Aboud from Syria has lived in Sweden for two years and works as a handyman in the ReTuna furniture store. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked making things, doing work with my hands, so this job has been great to help with the environment as well as produce nice products,\u201d he says, smiling, while painting a repurposed dresser. \u201cBack home, we would never throw things away unless they are completely broken, so this work is usual for me.\u201d His residency permit has not been renewed for next year, though, and so he will soon be forced to move on. \u201cThey want me to enrol in university or get some more education, but I already have all the skills I need,\u201d he says. \u201cI wish they would let me keep on working.\u201d Another recent arrival to Eskilstuna is a Glaswegian, Kevin Roxburgh. Having lived in Stockholm for 30 years, Roxburgh moved to Eskilstuna two weeks ago to manage ReTuna\u2019s franchise of the charity shop chain, Stadsmissionen. \u201cI used to work in fashion, like Anna,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I became totally disillusioned with all the waste \u2013 I decided I wanted to help people in their lives instead.\u201d Stadsmissionen employs staff with learning difficulties and long-term unemployed people. It was founded in Roxburgh\u2019s home town, under the name Glasgow City Mission. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised by the mall,\u201d he says, \u201cand I think this recycling system is brilliant \u2013 it\u2019s much better than Stockholm\u2019s and definitely better than the UK\u2019s.\u201d Roxburgh recently gained Swedish citizenship, because of \u201call this Brexit bullshit\u201d, and says he has no plans to move back. \u201cThis is the real community spirit here,\u201d he adds. Any waste, or \u201cresources\u201d, that cannot be resold in ReTuna, finds its way to the Lilla Nyby sorting centre a 20-minute drive away. From the outside, Lilla Nyby is a typical waste plant: heaps of putrid rubbish waiting to be sorted, opportunistic gulls swooping and diggers carving through the mounds. There is a noticeable lack of people at Lilla Nyby, though. Inside the warehouse, the recycling bags whirr through a maze of conveyor belts, passing camera points which recognise their different colours and then swat them off the line accordingly.

      "body": "<p>For more than four years, a brutal Saudi air campaign has bombarded Yemen, killing tens of thousands, injuring hundreds of thousands and displacing millions \u2013 creating the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. And British weapons are doing much of the killing. Every day Yemen is hit by British bombs \u2013 dropped by British planes that are flown by British-trained pilots and maintained and prepared inside Saudi Arabia by thousands of British contractors.</p> <p>The Saudi-led military coalition, which includes the UAE, Bahrain and Kuwait, has \u201ctargeted civilians \u2026 in a widespread and systematic manner\u201d, according to the UN \u2013 dropping bombs on hospitals, schools, weddings, funerals and even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/30/air-strike-refugee-camp-houthi-controlled-northern-yemen-kills-at-least-21\" title=\"\">camps</a> for displaced people fleeing the bombing.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia has in effect contracted out vital parts of its war against Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement to the US and the UK. Britain does not merely supply weapons for this war: it provides the personnel and expertise required to keep the war going. The British government has deployed RAF personnel to work as engineers, and to train Saudi pilots and targeteers \u2013 while an even larger role is played by BAE Systems, Britain\u2019s biggest arms company, which the government has subcontracted to provide weapons, maintenance and engineers inside Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>\u201cThe Saudi bosses absolutely depend on BAE Systems,\u201d John Deverell, a former MoD mandarin and defence attache to Saudi Arabia and Yemen, told me. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t do it without us.\u201d A BAE employee recently put it more plainly to Channel 4\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/press/news/britains-hidden-war-channel-4-dispatches\" title=\"\">Dispatches</a>: \u201cIf we weren\u2019t there, in seven to 14 days there wouldn\u2019t be a jet in the sky.\u201d</p> <p>The British bombs that rain down on Yemen are produced in three towns: Glenrothes in Scotland, and Harlow and Stevenage in south-east England. Bombs roll off production lines owned by Raytheon UK and BAE Systems, firms contracted by the government to manufacture Paveway bombs (\u00a322,000 apiece), Brimstone bombs (\u00a3105,000 apiece), and Storm Shadow cruise missiles (\u00a3790,000 apiece) for the Saudi Royal Air Force. BAE, under government contract, also assembles the jets that drop these bombs in hangars just outside the village of Warton, Lancashire.</p> <p>Once these weapons arrive in Saudi Arabia, Britain\u2019s involvement is far from over. The Saudi military lacks the expertise to use these weapons to fight a sustained air war \u2013 so BAE, under another contract to the UK government, provides what are known as \u201cin-country\u201d services. In practice, this means that around 6,300 British contractors are stationed at forward operating bases in Saudi Arabia. There, they train Saudi pilots and conduct essential maintenance night and day on planes worn out from flying thousands of miles across the Saudi desert to their targets in Yemen. They also supervise Saudi soldiers to load bombs on to planes and set their fuses for their intended targets.</p> <p>Around 80 serving RAF personnel work inside Saudi Arabia. Sometimes they work for BAE to assist in maintaining and preparing aircraft. At other times they work as auditors to ensure that BAE is fulfilling its Ministry of Defence contracts. Additional RAF \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2019-03-07.229818.h\" title=\"\">liaison officers</a>\u201d work inside the command-and-control centre, from where targets in Yemen are selected.</p> <p>Aircraft alone have never defeated a guerrilla insurgency. Despite atrocities committed by the Houthis on the ground, the rebel group\u2019s domestic support has only been bolstered by outrage over years of Saudi bombing. Facing up to this reality, last year Saudi Arabia decided to deploy significant ground forces across the border \u2013 and here too, the British have joined the mission. In May 2018, an unknown number of British troops were sent to Yemen to assist Saudi ground forces. Since then, multiple newspapers have <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6843469/Five-British-Special-Forces-troops-wounded-Yemen-advising-Saudi-Arabia-campaign.html\" title=\"\">published</a> <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1088481/british-soldiers-injured-bomb-yemen-sas-aid-humanitarian-mission\" title=\"\">reports</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/27/serious-questions-over-sas-involvement-in-yemen-war\" title=\"\">British special forces</a> wounded in gun battles inside Houthi-controlled territory.</p> <p>Under British law, it is illegal to licence arms exports if they might be used deliberately or recklessly against civilians \u2013 or in legal terms, to violate international humanitarian law. There is overwhelming evidence that the Saudis are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/10/the-guardian-view-on-yemen-and-uk-arms-sales-immoral-whatever-the-law-decides\" title=\"\">flagrantly in violation</a>, and yet when questions are raised in Parliament about Britain\u2019s role in the atrocities occurring in Yemen, Conservative ministers typically limit themselves to three well-worn responses.</p> <p>First, they claim that Britain operates \u201cone of the most robust arms export regimes in the world\u201d. Second, they say that while Britain may arm Saudi Arabia, it does not pick the targets in Yemen. Third, they say that the Saudi-led coalition already investigates its own alleged violations of international humanitarian law.</p> <p>These responses have long since been overtaken by the bloody reality of the Yemen war. In fact, as the conflict has continued, the killing of civilians has actually accelerated. According to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/08/yemen-saudi-airstrike-school-bus/567799/\" title=\"\">Larry Lewis</a>, a former US State Department official who was sent to Saudi Arabia in 2015 in an attempt to reduce civilian harm, the proportion of strikes against civilians by Saudi-led forces almost doubled between 2017 and 2018.</p> <p>The UK government\u2019s argument that it does not pick the targets in Yemen resembles nothing so much as the logic of the American gun lobby, with its infamous claim that it\u2019s not guns that kill people, but the people who use them. Since 2016, many countries have revoked or suspended arms sales to Saudi Arabia \u2013 including Austria, Belgium, Germany, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. But Britain and the US, whose planes constitute the backbone of Saudi Arabia\u2019s combat fleet, are still holding out.</p> <p>This could soon change. Three of Britain\u2019s most senior judges are now mulling whether the government\u2019s licensing of billions of pounds of arms to the Saudi Royal Air Force has been legal. The court of appeal\u2019s judgment, expected this week, could force the government to suspend the licences that keep the bombs and spare parts flowing to Saudi Arabia, which would ground half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s fleet in a matter of weeks.</p> <p>The judiciary may now decide to curtail Britain\u2019s ability to sustain Saudi Arabia\u2019s doomed and destructive air war. The British and Saudi governments may also decide to send more aid to help the 24 million Yemenis now dependent on an underfunded UN <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/world/humanitarian-funding-update-december-2018-united-nations-coordinated-appeals-enar\" title=\"\">relief fund</a>. But a generation of Yemenis who have lost their families, their homes, educations and livelihoods will not get them back.</p> <p>On a 2016 trip to Yemen, the Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell visited a school in the capital. It had been built, he said, with British aid \u2013 only to be destroyed, in all likelihood, by a British bomb. \u201cI asked my host what the children were chanting,\u201d he recalled to me in his Westminster office. His host translated for him: \u201c\u2018Death to the Saudis\u2019, \u2018Death to the Americans\u2019 \u2013 and in respect for your visit today, they have cut out the third stanza.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On 27 March 2015, one day after the first bombs fell on Yemen, foreign secretary Philip Hammond told reporters that Britain would \u201csupport the Saudis in every practical way short of engaging in combat\u201d. This would prove to be an understatement.</p> <p>BAE and Raytheon production lines in Britain sped up to keep up with Saudi bombing. It is impossible to say how many bombs the UK has sent to Yemen, because the government in 2013 and 2014 granted BAE three special arms-export <a href=\"https://www.caat.org.uk/resources/foi-responses\" title=\"\">licences</a> that permit the sale of an unlimited number of bombs to Saudi Arabia without requiring disclosure of how many have been sold. As a result, the full scale of the UK\u2019s rearmament programme has remained hidden.</p> <p>But even discounting this secret trade, British military exports to Riyadh multiplied almost 35-fold in one year, from <a href=\"https://www.caat.org.uk/resources/export-licences/dashboard?date_from=2014-01&amp;date_to=2014-12&amp;region=Saudi+Arabia\" title=\"\">\u00a383</a><a href=\"https://www.caat.org.uk/resources/export-licences/dashboard?date_from=2014-01&amp;date_to=2014-12&amp;region=Saudi+Arabia\" title=\"\">m in 2014</a> to <a href=\"https://www.caat.org.uk/resources/export-licences/dashboard?date_from=2015-01&amp;date_to=2015-12&amp;region=Saudi+Arabia\" title=\"\">\u00a32.9</a><a href=\"https://www.caat.org.uk/resources/export-licences/dashboard?date_from=2015-01&amp;date_to=2015-12&amp;region=Saudi+Arabia\" title=\"\">bn in 2015</a>.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter, can afford to buy these weapons, but it has traditionally lacked the skills and manpower to deploy them. A retired US defence official joked that in the past, all the kingdom\u2019s pilots were selected from the king\u2019s immediate family \u2013 because \u201conly they could be trusted not to drop a bomb on his palace\u201d.</p> <p>British personnel have played a major role in picking up the slack. Government contractors carry out around 95% of the tasks necessary to fight the air war, one former BAE employee told Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches \u2013 an estimate confirmed to me by a former senior British official who worked in Saudi Arabia during the air war.</p> <p>Inside Saudi forward operating bases, there are thousands of British contractors working to keep the war machine moving. British contractors coordinate the distribution of bombs and aircraft parts. They manage climate-controlled armories and work in shifts to ensure bombs are dispatched in a timely manner for fresh raids. Alongside RAF personnel, British contractors train Saudi pilots to conduct hazardous bombing raids in Yemen\u2019s rugged northern mountains and over its cities. They also manage avionics and radar systems to ensure that Saudi planes can get to and from their targets, and conduct the deep aircraft maintenance necessary to keep them circling over Yemen.</p> <p>The British government is keen to stress that it has no role in targeting, and insists that only Saudi Arabia chooses what to hit in Yemen. But there is no disputing the fact that British contractors enable Saudi Arabia to hit its targets \u2013 and that Britain is well aware of the nature of these targets.</p> <p>Michael Knights, a Gulf military expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, has made two visits since the war began to the Saudi airbase at Khamis Mushayt, near the border with Yemen. Planes from this base, he told me, had waged an \u201cout-and-out coercive air campaign\u201d of \u201cterror bombing\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-32677260\" title=\"\">over the city of Sa</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-32677260\" title=\"\">ada</a> in 2015 and 2016. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have hit more civilian targets,\u201d he said. Saudi military chiefs \u201cworked their way down a list of all the national infrastructure targets like we did [when the US and UK bombed Iraq during the Gulf war] in 1991 \u2026 that meant everything: cranes, bridges, ministries \u2026 water treatment plants.\u201d</p> <p>Human rights groups have criticised the Saudi-led coalition for its use of so-called \u201cdouble-tap\u201d attacks \u2013 in which a second bomb is dropped a few minutes after the first, targeting civilians and emergency responders who have rushed to the site of the first explosion. One such staggered attack on 8 October 2016 <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-saudi-un-idUSKCN12K2F1\" title=\"\">hit a funeral</a> in Sana\u2019a, killing 155 mourners and wounding at least 525. Another double-tap strike <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/29/death-toll-from-airstrike-on-yemen-wedding-hits-131\" title=\"\">hit a wedding party</a> in the remote village of Al-Wahijah on 28 Sept 2015, killing 131 civilians. \u201cThe corpses were scattered among the trees,\u201d the father of the groom, Mohammed Busaibis, told the Yemeni human rights group Mwatana, adding that he learned his own mother had died when he saw her familiar scar on a disembodied leg. \u201cWhy did they attack us? There is nothing around here. No military camps, not even a police station.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"760ca09186c0acdc2e2f2a7cc8708763e2f794ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/760ca09186c0acdc2e2f2a7cc8708763e2f794ad/0_137_3400_2040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May and Mohammed bin Salman in London in March 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May and Mohammed bin Salman in London in March 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The former senior British official told me he was aghast at the recklessness of Saudi targeting. \u201cThis is what would happen regularly,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019d be sitting down for lunch and a Yemeni [from the government in exile] would get a WhatsApp message with a pin on Google Maps saying that there will be Houthis here. On that basis, an awful lot of the targeting was conducted without any verification whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>Larry Lewis, the State Department advisor for civilian protection, described Saudi targeting to me as \u201cincredibly loose\u201d. \u201cIn the US and the UK,\u201d he explained, \u201cwe have very formal processes\u201d for airstrikes, but \u201cthis coalition is not using them \u2026 And when you mess up, bad things happen.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis says that in September 2016 \u2013 a few weeks before the funeral strike \u2013 he took his concerns to the chairman of the Saudi armed forces. \u201cI laid out all of the very actionable things he could do to reduce civilian harm,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe chairman didn\u2019t really seem very interested \u2026 he just didn\u2019t respond.\u201d Last July, crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), the architect of the air war, issued a royal decree \u201cpardoning all military personnel who have taken part in Operation Restoring Hope of their respective military and disciplinary penalties.\u201d</p> <p>After Saudi Arabia realised it could not defeat the Houthis with airstrikes alone, it launched a ground operation in northern Yemen, which includes thousands of Saudi troops, a wide assortment of Yemeni and foreign fighters, and British special forces.</p> <p>The presence of British special forces in Yemen has not been officially acknowledged, but has become an open secret in defence circles. A senior British diplomatic source told me that the decision to approve military assistance to Saudi Arabia emerged from a meeting in London between British ministers and Bin Salman during his state visit to the UK in March 2018 \u2013 when he met the Queen and signed a memorandum of intent to buy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/09/uk-typhoon-jet-deal-saudi-arabia-bae-systems\" title=\"\">48 more jets</a> worth \u00a310bn to upgrade his war-ravaged fleet.</p> <p>Two months later, on 23 May 2018, Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, released a carefully worded <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2018-05-23/HCWS716/\" title=\"\">statement</a> committing an undisclosed number of UK troops to provide \u201cinformation, advice and assistance\u201d to \u201cmitigate\u201d the threat to Saudi Arabia from Houthi missiles.</p> <p>The UK government refuses to confirm or deny whether it has deployed troops inside Yemen. In April, when asked in parliament about allegations published in the Mail on Sunday that British special forces were fighting in Yemen alongside Saudi-backed child soldiers, foreign minister Mark Field <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-03-26/debates/72B3E082-2B68-460B-93AB-51DF751C5403/Yemen\" title=\"\">called for an investigation</a>, while refusing to confirm whether British troops were in the country at all.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In March of this year, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, marked the fourth anniversary of Saudi Arabia\u2019s intervention in Yemen with an audacious defence of Britain\u2019s role in the conflict. In <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/conflict-war-un-yemen-crisis-wont-be-solved-by-uk-arms-exports-halt/\" title=\"\">an opinion piece</a> for Politico, Hunt insisted it would be \u201cmorally bankrupt\u201d to cut off the Saudis, with the counterintuitive argument that Britain\u2019s pursuit of peace in Yemen requires the government to continue selling weapons to one of the combatants. Otherwise, he warned, we would \u201csurrender our influence and make ourselves irrelevant to the course of events in Yemen.\u201d</p> <p>In short, UK arms sales buy Britain influence with Saudi Arabia; influence that it can use to sue for peace. Hunt refers obliquely to \u201cfrank conversations\u201d about human rights with his Saudi counterparts, while the government has defended its arms sales in court by citing \u201c<a href=\"https://www.caat.org.uk/resources/countries/saudi-arabia/legal-2016/2017-02-03.defendant-skeleton.pdf\" title=\"\">extensive UK training</a>\u201d provided to Saudi pilots and targeteers in order to reduce civilian harm, along with the presence of RAF liaison officers who work inside the Saudi air operations centre to \u201csupport Saudi compliance with International Humanitarian Law\u201d.</p> <p>But the notion that Britain is a benign influence on the air war is betrayed by the stark fact that the rate of civilian attacks has risen throughout the war, according to <a href=\"https://www.cna.org/CNA_files/PDF/IRM-2019-U-019749-Final.pdf\" title=\"\">a </a><a href=\"https://www.cna.org/CNA_files/PDF/IRM-2019-U-019749-Final.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> analysing air-strike data, authored by Larry Lewis for a US government-backed thinktank and published in May. Other British officials with first-hand experience of Saudi military operations dismiss suggestions that our role on the ground in Saudi Arabia makes any difference.</p> <p>\u201cBollocks\u201d is how the former senior British official who worked in Saudi Arabia put it. \u201cWith MBS, our influence was gone. He was in a hurry, and surrounded himself by people who are not prepared to question his judgment.</p> <p>\u201cMilitaries are like onions. At the very centre is where the final decisions are made on targeting \u2026 but we only had access to the fourth or fifth layer,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe had no access at all to the Saudis who selected the targets. Not even the Yemenis did,\u201d he said \u2013 referring to members of the Yemeni government government in exile, on whose behalf this war is ostensibly being fought.</p> <p>Engagement at senior levels, the official recalled, amounted to reminding the Saudis that Britain had \u201cconcerns\u201d about civilian deaths. \u201cYou\u2019ll say: \u2018My government wants me to stress how important it is that you comply with international humanitarian law \u2013 and if you haven\u2019t got it, here it is printed out in Arabic.\u2019 That will be it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe Brits tend to pussyfoot around, despite having considerable leverage on the Saudis,\u201d I was told by John Deverell, the former director of defence diplomacy at the MoD, who was defence attache to Saudi Arabia and Yemen between 2001 and 2003. Unless Britain is willing \u201cto use the threat of pulling arms sales and personnel linked to the war in Yemen\u201d, Deverell added, any gestures of concern will be ineffectual. \u201cWe are worried that if we do speak truth to power, we will endanger the commercial relationship.\u201d</p> <p>It is this commercial relationship that is keeping Britain firmly ensnared in the Yemen war. Its foundation is an multi-billion pound, government-to-government arms deal signed in 1985 called al-Yamamah. This guarantees British maintenance, training and rearmament of any British aircraft sold to Saudi Arabia, in war and peacetime. The deal is open-ended, which means that its terms, which in the 1980s applied to Tornado aircraft, now cover the export of BAE\u2019s newer Typhoon jets.</p> <p>In response to <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2019-04-01/239317/\" title=\"\">a recent parliamentary question</a>, the government refused to disclose the total income from the Al-Yamamah contract because it \u201cwould, or would be likely to, prejudice relations with another State\u201d \u2013 but former BAE CEO Mike Turner put it at more than \u00a340bn in 2005. Nick Gilby, a researcher who has written a book on the deal, estimates the current sales figure to be \u201cconservatively, \u00a360bn\u201d based on BAE statements and annual reports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f7eabe01df19a61cf7411b7fd189cbbe81091618\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7eabe01df19a61cf7411b7fd189cbbe81091618/0_314_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Typhoon jet at the BAE Systems stand at the Farnborough Airshow in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A BAE Typhoon jet at the Farnborough Airshow in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Under the terms of the deal, Saudi Arabia reimburses the British Ministry of Defence for the costs it incurs by paying BAE to arm and maintain the Saudi air force, plus a 2% fee for the time of civil servants administering the procurement. BAE depends on this state contract for its survival, but it also wields enormous sway with the government as the principal executor of this multi-billion dollar deal. (The former foreign secretary Robin Cook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/08/bae1\" title=\"\">once described</a> the firm as having \u201cthe key to the garden door to No 10\u201d.)</p> <p>Although al-Yamamah does not generate any income per se for the British treasury, it is the bedrock of a deeper financial relationship between London and Riyadh. The House of Saud uses its oil revenues to buy British stocks, bonds and luxury property; it currently has \u00a393bn invested in the British economy. David Wearing, a specialist on UK-Saudi relations at Royal Holloway University, estimates that a fifth of the UK <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v41/n09/tom-stevenson/what-are-we-there-for\" title=\"\">current account deficit</a> is financed by Saudi cash, which \u201cstabilises an increasingly vulnerable pound\u201d.</p> <p>A former Conservative minister told me that just before Saudi Arabia started bombing Yemen in 2015, Riyadh privately communicated that it would squeeze Britain financially if the government wavered in its military cooperation. \u201cAt the outset, the imperative was conveyed that they saw British support of its war as a key test,\u201d the minister recalled. \u201cIf you fail, you\u2019re out, as far as commercial opportunities and influence in the future.\u201d</p> <p>The groundwork for the al-Yamamah deal was laid during Britain\u2019s imperial era. In the 1960s, the House of Saud financed an off-the-books war against Egyptian troops that had occupied Yemen, threatening both Saudi rule and Britain\u2019s colony in Aden. David Stirling, the founder of the SAS, used his sway with the Saudi King to broker a deal for the kingdom to buy British Lightning jets, radar systems and in-country services.</p> <p>A decade later, events swung Saudi Arabia and Britain even closer together. In 1979, religious zealots seized Mecca\u2019s Grand Mosque to demand the overthrow of the Saudi monarch \u2013 months after the Iranian revolution deposed the Shah and ushered in an Islamic Republic that openly challenged the House of Saud. Meanwhile, Britain was in financial disarray. It could not afford to buy the Tornado combat jet it had developed in a consortium with Italy and Germany. If Britain wanted an independent air deterrent, it would need a rich foreign buyer to subsidise the cost of its fleet. An insecure royal family sitting on the world\u2019s largest oil reserves was the perfect customer.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia wanted the best aircraft money could buy: the American F-16. Iran had the next model down, the F-14, but Israel was vehemently opposed to an Arab country getting planes that could challenge its own F-16s. The US found a workaround. Under a Nato framework, it would back the export of British Tornados to the House of Saud, which would keep the Soviets out of the Gulf and bring down the cost to Britain of upgrading its own fleet. Al-Yamamah was the result. It was the biggest arms deal in the world \u2013 and one that would save arms manufacturing in Britain.</p> <p>In a \u201csecret and personal\u201d letter to US president Ronald Reagan in 1988 \u2013 whose contents have not been previously reported \u2013 Thatcher confided that Saudi Arabia had given her assurances that it would not use British weapons aggressively against other states. According to <a href=\"http://www.mikelewisresearch.com/RSAFfinal.pdf\" title=\"\">a report</a> by Mike Lewis, a former UN weapons inspector, Thatcher\u2019s government overruled Foreign Office officials who advised against committing Britain to a clause that explicitly obliged Britain to rearm Saudi Arabia in the event it went to war. It would, they said, expose the country to accusations of involvement in \u201cunlawful military adventures\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In March, I attended a government-organised convention in Farnborough for arms companies that want to break into lucrative export markets. Executives talked shop with government officials in the Export Growth Zone over chicken paprika sandwiches. We watched an \u201cSAS motivational speaker\u201d extol the importance of positive mental attitude.</p> <p>The convention featured a slide presentation on the details of arms control law by a senior official from the UK government\u2019s export-licensing agency. \u201cIgnorance is no use for breaking the law,\u201d the official told the attendees. Afterwards, I asked the official how it was possible that his own department \u2013 the Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU) \u2013 had issued blanket approvals for arms exports used in Yemen. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it just is,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m doing what I\u2019m told and doing my job,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I\u2019m uncomfortably aware that Adolf Eichmann said the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>The head of the ECJU, Edward Bell, has also expressed discomfort with re-arming the Saudi air campaign. \u201cMy gut tells me we should suspend [exports to Saudi Arabia],\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/07/official-advised-uk-minister-to-suspend-saudi-weapons-exports-court-hears\" title=\"\">he wrote</a> in a 2016 email to Sajid Javid, who was then the minister responsible for arms licensing. Javid ignored Bell\u2019s advice.</p> <p>In 2015, Vince Cable, Javid\u2019s predecessor, delayed the export of a shipment of Saudi-bound Paveway bombs in the wake of reports alleging that the air campaign had targeted hospitals in Yemen. But Cable told me that he quickly came under pressure from the then defence secretary, Michael Fallon, and prime minister David Cameron, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/04/mod-seriously-misled-me-on-saudi-arms-sales-says-vince-cable\" title=\"\">release the shipment</a>.</p> <p>During the early phases of the air war, the British government replied to critics of its involvement by explaining that it conducted investigations into allegations of Saudi attacks on civilians in Yemen. But in 2016 \u2013 citing \u201cinfelicities of expression\u201d \u2013 the government reversed itself, and <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-07-21/HCWS125/\" title=\"\">revised</a> earlier ministerial statements that said it did investigate. Instead, when pushed on the use of British weapons in alleged war crimes in Yemen, the government pointed out that the Saudi-led coalition investigates itself.</p> <p>This work is done by the Joint Incident Assessment Team (JIAT), a body composed of around 20 military officers from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which is charged with investigating reports of civilian deaths in Yemen. Larry Lewis, the US official who urged the Saudis to establish the JIAT, told me that the team does not have researchers on the ground inside Yemen, so it must rely on the Saudi Royal Air Force to provide it with information. \u201cOccasionally they will take trips to Yemen to investigate high-visibility incidents,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lewis also said the JIAT was \u201cdesigned to reduce common mistakes\u201d such as hitting targets on the no-strike list \u2013 wells, hospitals, schools. Similarly, it was supposed to reduce the chances of Saudi forces \u201cfailing to deploy tactical patience\u201d \u2013 for instance, bombing Houthi militiamen when they stop at a market, rather than waiting for them to leave to minimise civilian casualties. But Lewis now says the JIAT failed on its own terms, because it was simply ignored by the Saudi defence ministry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6a966c75e8939750fb3fd41334168874006ca14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6a966c75e8939750fb3fd41334168874006ca14/0_166_5297_3179/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Saudi-led airstrike on the outskirts of Yemen\u2019s capital, Sanaa in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Saudi-led airstrike on the outskirts of Yemen\u2019s capital, Sanaa in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hani Mohammed/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the British government, however, the JIAT provides a convenient figleaf for the continued licensing of arms exports to Riyadh. Researchers at the open-source investigative agency Bellingcat have accused the coalition of dishonesty in \u201cthe vast majority of JIAT assessments\u201d. Rawan Shaif, who heads the group\u2019s Yemen project, told me that \u201cthe information that [the UK] has been relying on\u201d is coming from \u201ca partner you have been directly supporting in a conflict, who is lying to you about the majority of strikes\u201d.</p> <p>In the case of two particularly deadly attacks in May and July 2015 \u2013 in which more than 100 people were killed by airstrikes on outdoor markets in the town of Zabid and Fayoush, a suburb of Aden \u2013 the JIAT assessment simply insisted that the coalition had not bombed either location, in spite of reports by the UN, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-33408473\" title=\"\">BBC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/11/26/what-military-target-was-my-brothers-house/unlawful-coalition-airstrikes-yemen\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch</a>and Amnesty, as well as camera-smartphone footage from the sites making it clear that an airstrike had taken place.</p> <p>Elsewhere the JIAT has justified strikes by flatly asserting that the targets were military ones. After reports of civilian deaths in an airstrike in al-Jawf governorate in September 2016, JIAT released a statement claiming that the coalition had hit \u201cHouthi commanders\u201d travelling in a pickup truck. But when the UN and the Yemeni human rights group Mwatana made independent visits to the site, they <a href=\"http://mwatana.org/en/day-of-judgment/\" title=\"\">discovered</a> that the victims were a woman driving with her two sisters-in-law and their 12 children.</p> <p>Parliamentary scrutiny of Britain\u2019s compliance with arms export control laws is the responsibility of the Committees for Arms Export Controls (CAEC). This cross-party grouping, which includes 18 MPs, is chaired by Graham Jones, a Labour MP who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/04/uk-arms-export-ngo-claims-yemen-deaths-graham-jones\" title=\"\">has criticised</a> the \u201cdishonesty\u201d of NGOs reporting on human-rights violations in Yemen, written in support of Bin Salman and the Saudi-led coalition, and touted BAE\u2019s \u201cvital role\u201d for employment and the economy in his Lancashire constituency.</p> <p>Dr Anna Stavrianakis, an academic researching arms licensing at the University of Sussex, who has regularly given evidence to CAEC, accused Jones of keeping Yemen off the committee\u2019s agenda. \u201cThe government deliberately mobilises doubt and ambiguity when it comes to international humanitarian law violations in Yemen,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd the chair acts in support of government policy rather than acting impartially to scrutinise it.\u201d In an email to the Guardian, Jones replied that his critics were \u201cfar-left Marxists [who] back a violent, racist, Islamic fascist militia\u201d in Yemen, and said he had been \u201cat the forefront of discussions on Yemeni issues\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The ruling from the court of appeal, expected this Thursday, will determine whether the government\u2019s political will to arm Saudi Arabia has violated the law. The case, which was <a href=\"https://www.caat.org.uk/campaigns/stop-arming-saudi\" title=\"\">brought by</a> Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT), an NGO, was heard before three judges on April 9. The result hinges on the interpretation of two words: \u201cclear risk\u201d. British law bans the licensing of arms if there is a \u201cclear risk\u201d that they could be used in a \u201cserious violation of IHL\u201d. The three judges will decide if the government has broken this law.</p> <p>\u201cI struggle to think of a case where the evidence has been so overwhelming and compelling than this one,\u201d said Rosa Curling of Leigh Day, the legal firm instructed by CAAT. \u201cIf arms can be exported legally in this scenario, then when could they not?\u201d</p> <p>The government argued that it has information, shared with the judges in secret, that gives it confidence there is not \u201cclear risk\u201d of Saudi Arabia needlessly killing civilians. Lawyers for CAAT countered that there is more than enough evidence in the public domain to prove this risk is real. CAAT <a href=\"https://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2017/07/11/high-court-allows-uk-government-to-continue-exporting-arms-to-saudi-arabia/\" title=\"\">lost its first case</a> in 2017, when the high court ruled in favour of the government after hearing parts of the government\u2019s defence in secret.</p> <p>The QC Philippe Sands, who is not involved in this case, says that ministers should be personally concerned about the prospect of facing criminal charges for their role in arming Saudi Arabia. \u201cIf the United Kingdom is supplying weapons that are being used to commit crimes, then the possibility cannot be excluded that a minister who signs off on the sales in that knowledge could in the future be hauled before a court of law, national or international,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>British case law is clear that knowingly supplying a weapon that is used to commit a crime can mean that the supplier of the weapon is also liable for that crime. \u201cThe coalition claims that it only targets the Houthis and that it tries very hard to avoid civilian casualties, but the evidence suggests otherwise,\u201d said Dearbhla Minogue of the Global Legal Action Network, which is working with Bellingcat to investigate whether individual airstrikes in Yemen have violated international law. \u201cUK nationals involved in the transfer of arms in such a situation should be concerned about that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>According to Wayne Jordash QC, government officials would face a higher risk of prosecution if Britain is a \u201cparty to the conflict\u201d, an innocuous-sounding legal phrase that has exercised the civil service as evidence of civilian casualties has piled up. \u201cA lot of energy is spent on trying to keep us not a party,\u201d one Whitehall official remarked to me in April.</p> <p>Under international law, being a party to a conflict means providing military, financial or logistical support that directly degrades the military capacity of another belligerent and weakens their ability to conduct hostilities. A spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross told me it had made a determination as to whether Britain is a party to the Yemen war \u2013 but could not publicly disclose the result because it was still mediating between belligerents of the war and did not want to risk prejudicing relations.</p> <p>Ministers regularly tell parliament that Britain is not a party to the conflict. \u201cLet me make it very clear that we are not a party to the conflict \u2026 That is not the position of the United Kingdom,\u201d the then foreign minister Alister Burt told parliament in January, an assertion he repeated to me in an interview in April. The foreign office minister Mark Field similarly told parliament in March: \u201cWe still hold to the firm view that we are not a party to the conflict.\u201d</p> <p>But the senior British diplomatic source, citing internal Foreign Office legal advice, told me that \u201canybody who says that is is misspeaking\u201d. The cabinet decided to provide \u201cmilitary assistance\u201d to Saudi Arabia last year, he said, referring to the deployment of special forces, \u201cand by doing that we became a party to the conflict\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/21/yemen-uae-united-arab-emirates-profiting-from-chaos-of-civil-war\">Yemen on the brink: how the UAE is profiting from the chaos of civil war | Ghaith Abdul-Ahad</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The contortions of the British government to obscure its involvement in the Yemen war are nothing short of acrobatic.

      "bodyText": "For more than four years, a brutal Saudi air campaign has bombarded Yemen, killing tens of thousands, injuring hundreds of thousands and displacing millions \u2013 creating the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. And British weapons are doing much of the killing. Every day Yemen is hit by British bombs \u2013 dropped by British planes that are flown by British-trained pilots and maintained and prepared inside Saudi Arabia by thousands of British contractors. The Saudi-led military coalition, which includes the UAE, Bahrain and Kuwait, has \u201ctargeted civilians \u2026 in a widespread and systematic manner\u201d, according to the UN \u2013 dropping bombs on hospitals, schools, weddings, funerals and even camps for displaced people fleeing the bombing. Saudi Arabia has in effect contracted out vital parts of its war against Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement to the US and the UK. Britain does not merely supply weapons for this war: it provides the personnel and expertise required to keep the war going. The British government has deployed RAF personnel to work as engineers, and to train Saudi pilots and targeteers \u2013 while an even larger role is played by BAE Systems, Britain\u2019s biggest arms company, which the government has subcontracted to provide weapons, maintenance and engineers inside Saudi Arabia. \u201cThe Saudi bosses absolutely depend on BAE Systems,\u201d John Deverell, a former MoD mandarin and defence attache to Saudi Arabia and Yemen, told me. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t do it without us.\u201d A BAE employee recently put it more plainly to Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches: \u201cIf we weren\u2019t there, in seven to 14 days there wouldn\u2019t be a jet in the sky.\u201d The British bombs that rain down on Yemen are produced in three towns: Glenrothes in Scotland, and Harlow and Stevenage in south-east England. Bombs roll off production lines owned by Raytheon UK and BAE Systems, firms contracted by the government to manufacture Paveway bombs (\u00a322,000 apiece), Brimstone bombs (\u00a3105,000 apiece), and Storm Shadow cruise missiles (\u00a3790,000 apiece) for the Saudi Royal Air Force. BAE, under government contract, also assembles the jets that drop these bombs in hangars just outside the village of Warton, Lancashire. Once these weapons arrive in Saudi Arabia, Britain\u2019s involvement is far from over. The Saudi military lacks the expertise to use these weapons to fight a sustained air war \u2013 so BAE, under another contract to the UK government, provides what are known as \u201cin-country\u201d services. In practice, this means that around 6,300 British contractors are stationed at forward operating bases in Saudi Arabia. There, they train Saudi pilots and conduct essential maintenance night and day on planes worn out from flying thousands of miles across the Saudi desert to their targets in Yemen. They also supervise Saudi soldiers to load bombs on to planes and set their fuses for their intended targets. Around 80 serving RAF personnel work inside Saudi Arabia. Sometimes they work for BAE to assist in maintaining and preparing aircraft. At other times they work as auditors to ensure that BAE is fulfilling its Ministry of Defence contracts. Additional RAF \u201cliaison officers\u201d work inside the command-and-control centre, from where targets in Yemen are selected. Aircraft alone have never defeated a guerrilla insurgency. Despite atrocities committed by the Houthis on the ground, the rebel group\u2019s domestic support has only been bolstered by outrage over years of Saudi bombing. Facing up to this reality, last year Saudi Arabia decided to deploy significant ground forces across the border \u2013 and here too, the British have joined the mission. In May 2018, an unknown number of British troops were sent to Yemen to assist Saudi ground forces. Since then, multiple newspapers have published reports of British special forces wounded in gun battles inside Houthi-controlled territory. Under British law, it is illegal to licence arms exports if they might be used deliberately or recklessly against civilians \u2013 or in legal terms, to violate international humanitarian law. There is overwhelming evidence that the Saudis are flagrantly in violation, and yet when questions are raised in Parliament about Britain\u2019s role in the atrocities occurring in Yemen, Conservative ministers typically limit themselves to three well-worn responses. First, they claim that Britain operates \u201cone of the most robust arms export regimes in the world\u201d. Second, they say that while Britain may arm Saudi Arabia, it does not pick the targets in Yemen. Third, they say that the Saudi-led coalition already investigates its own alleged violations of international humanitarian law. These responses have long since been overtaken by the bloody reality of the Yemen war. In fact, as the conflict has continued, the killing of civilians has actually accelerated. According to Larry Lewis, a former US State Department official who was sent to Saudi Arabia in 2015 in an attempt to reduce civilian harm, the proportion of strikes against civilians by Saudi-led forces almost doubled between 2017 and 2018. The UK government\u2019s argument that it does not pick the targets in Yemen resembles nothing so much as the logic of the American gun lobby, with its infamous claim that it\u2019s not guns that kill people, but the people who use them. Since 2016, many countries have revoked or suspended arms sales to Saudi Arabia \u2013 including Austria, Belgium, Germany, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. But Britain and the US, whose planes constitute the backbone of Saudi Arabia\u2019s combat fleet, are still holding out. This could soon change. Three of Britain\u2019s most senior judges are now mulling whether the government\u2019s licensing of billions of pounds of arms to the Saudi Royal Air Force has been legal. The court of appeal\u2019s judgment, expected this week, could force the government to suspend the licences that keep the bombs and spare parts flowing to Saudi Arabia, which would ground half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s fleet in a matter of weeks. The judiciary may now decide to curtail Britain\u2019s ability to sustain Saudi Arabia\u2019s doomed and destructive air war. The British and Saudi governments may also decide to send more aid to help the 24 million Yemenis now dependent on an underfunded UN relief fund. But a generation of Yemenis who have lost their families, their homes, educations and livelihoods will not get them back. On a 2016 trip to Yemen, the Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell visited a school in the capital. It had been built, he said, with British aid \u2013 only to be destroyed, in all likelihood, by a British bomb. \u201cI asked my host what the children were chanting,\u201d he recalled to me in his Westminster office. His host translated for him: \u201c\u2018Death to the Saudis\u2019, \u2018Death to the Americans\u2019 \u2013 and in respect for your visit today, they have cut out the third stanza.\u201d * * * On 27 March 2015, one day after the first bombs fell on Yemen, foreign secretary Philip Hammond told reporters that Britain would \u201csupport the Saudis in every practical way short of engaging in combat\u201d. This would prove to be an understatement. BAE and Raytheon production lines in Britain sped up to keep up with Saudi bombing. It is impossible to say how many bombs the UK has sent to Yemen, because the government in 2013 and 2014 granted BAE three special arms-export licences that permit the sale of an unlimited number of bombs to Saudi Arabia without requiring disclosure of how many have been sold. As a result, the full scale of the UK\u2019s rearmament programme has remained hidden. But even discounting this secret trade, British military exports to Riyadh multiplied almost 35-fold in one year, from \u00a383m in 2014 to \u00a32.9bn in 2015. Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter, can afford to buy these weapons, but it has traditionally lacked the skills and manpower to deploy them. A retired US defence official joked that in the past, all the kingdom\u2019s pilots were selected from the king\u2019s immediate family \u2013 because \u201conly they could be trusted not to drop a bomb on his palace\u201d. British personnel have played a major role in picking up the slack. Government contractors carry out around 95% of the tasks necessary to fight the air war, one former BAE employee told Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches \u2013 an estimate confirmed to me by a former senior British official who worked in Saudi Arabia during the air war. Inside Saudi forward operating bases, there are thousands of British contractors working to keep the war machine moving. British contractors coordinate the distribution of bombs and aircraft parts. They manage climate-controlled armories and work in shifts to ensure bombs are dispatched in a timely manner for fresh raids. Alongside RAF personnel, British contractors train Saudi pilots to conduct hazardous bombing raids in Yemen\u2019s rugged northern mountains and over its cities. They also manage avionics and radar systems to ensure that Saudi planes can get to and from their targets, and conduct the deep aircraft maintenance necessary to keep them circling over Yemen. The British government is keen to stress that it has no role in targeting, and insists that only Saudi Arabia chooses what to hit in Yemen. But there is no disputing the fact that British contractors enable Saudi Arabia to hit its targets \u2013 and that Britain is well aware of the nature of these targets. Michael Knights, a Gulf military expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, has made two visits since the war began to the Saudi airbase at Khamis Mushayt, near the border with Yemen. Planes from this base, he told me, had waged an \u201cout-and-out coercive air campaign\u201d of \u201cterror bombing\u201d over the city of Saada in 2015 and 2016. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have hit more civilian targets,\u201d he said. Saudi military chiefs \u201cworked their way down a list of all the national infrastructure targets like we did [when the US and UK bombed Iraq during the Gulf war] in 1991 \u2026 that meant everything: cranes, bridges, ministries \u2026 water treatment plants.\u201d Human rights groups have criticised the Saudi-led coalition for its use of so-called \u201cdouble-tap\u201d attacks \u2013 in which a second bomb is dropped a few minutes after the first, targeting civilians and emergency responders who have rushed to the site of the first explosion. One such staggered attack on 8 October 2016 hit a funeral in Sana\u2019a, killing 155 mourners and wounding at least 525. Another double-tap strike hit a wedding party in the remote village of Al-Wahijah on 28 Sept 2015, killing 131 civilians. \u201cThe corpses were scattered among the trees,\u201d the father of the groom, Mohammed Busaibis, told the Yemeni human rights group Mwatana, adding that he learned his own mother had died when he saw her familiar scar on a disembodied leg. \u201cWhy did they attack us? There is nothing around here. No military camps, not even a police station.\u201d The former senior British official told me he was aghast at the recklessness of Saudi targeting. \u201cThis is what would happen regularly,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019d be sitting down for lunch and a Yemeni [from the government in exile] would get a WhatsApp message with a pin on Google Maps saying that there will be Houthis here. On that basis, an awful lot of the targeting was conducted without any verification whatsoever.\u201d Larry Lewis, the State Department advisor for civilian protection, described Saudi targeting to me as \u201cincredibly loose\u201d. \u201cIn the US and the UK,\u201d he explained, \u201cwe have very formal processes\u201d for airstrikes, but \u201cthis coalition is not using them \u2026 And when you mess up, bad things happen.\u201d Lewis says that in September 2016 \u2013 a few weeks before the funeral strike \u2013 he took his concerns to the chairman of the Saudi armed forces. \u201cI laid out all of the very actionable things he could do to reduce civilian harm,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe chairman didn\u2019t really seem very interested \u2026 he just didn\u2019t respond.\u201d Last July, crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), the architect of the air war, issued a royal decree \u201cpardoning all military personnel who have taken part in Operation Restoring Hope of their respective military and disciplinary penalties.\u201d After Saudi Arabia realised it could not defeat the Houthis with airstrikes alone, it launched a ground operation in northern Yemen, which includes thousands of Saudi troops, a wide assortment of Yemeni and foreign fighters, and British special forces. The presence of British special forces in Yemen has not been officially acknowledged, but has become an open secret in defence circles. A senior British diplomatic source told me that the decision to approve military assistance to Saudi Arabia emerged from a meeting in London between British ministers and Bin Salman during his state visit to the UK in March 2018 \u2013 when he met the Queen and signed a memorandum of intent to buy 48 more jets worth \u00a310bn to upgrade his war-ravaged fleet. Two months later, on 23 May 2018, Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, released a carefully worded statement committing an undisclosed number of UK troops to provide \u201cinformation, advice and assistance\u201d to \u201cmitigate\u201d the threat to Saudi Arabia from Houthi missiles. The UK government refuses to confirm or deny whether it has deployed troops inside Yemen. In April, when asked in parliament about allegations published in the Mail on Sunday that British special forces were fighting in Yemen alongside Saudi-backed child soldiers, foreign minister Mark Field called for an investigation, while refusing to confirm whether British troops were in the country at all. * * * In March of this year, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, marked the fourth anniversary of Saudi Arabia\u2019s intervention in Yemen with an audacious defence of Britain\u2019s role in the conflict. In an opinion piece for Politico, Hunt insisted it would be \u201cmorally bankrupt\u201d to cut off the Saudis, with the counterintuitive argument that Britain\u2019s pursuit of peace in Yemen requires the government to continue selling weapons to one of the combatants. Otherwise, he warned, we would \u201csurrender our influence and make ourselves irrelevant to the course of events in Yemen.\u201d In short, UK arms sales buy Britain influence with Saudi Arabia; influence that it can use to sue for peace. Hunt refers obliquely to \u201cfrank conversations\u201d about human rights with his Saudi counterparts, while the government has defended its arms sales in court by citing \u201cextensive UK training\u201d provided to Saudi pilots and targeteers in order to reduce civilian harm, along with the presence of RAF liaison officers who work inside the Saudi air operations centre to \u201csupport Saudi compliance with International Humanitarian Law\u201d. But the notion that Britain is a benign influence on the air war is betrayed by the stark fact that the rate of civilian attacks has risen throughout the war, according to a report analysing air-strike data, authored by Larry Lewis for a US government-backed thinktank and published in May. Other British officials with first-hand experience of Saudi military operations dismiss suggestions that our role on the ground in Saudi Arabia makes any difference. \u201cBollocks\u201d is how the former senior British official who worked in Saudi Arabia put it. \u201cWith MBS, our influence was gone. He was in a hurry, and surrounded himself by people who are not prepared to question his judgment. \u201cMilitaries are like onions. At the very centre is where the final decisions are made on targeting \u2026 but we only had access to the fourth or fifth layer,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe had no access at all to the Saudis who selected the targets. Not even the Yemenis did,\u201d he said \u2013 referring to members of the Yemeni government government in exile, on whose behalf this war is ostensibly being fought. Engagement at senior levels, the official recalled, amounted to reminding the Saudis that Britain had \u201cconcerns\u201d about civilian deaths. \u201cYou\u2019ll say: \u2018My government wants me to stress how important it is that you comply with international humanitarian law \u2013 and if you haven\u2019t got it, here it is printed out in Arabic.\u2019 That will be it.\u201d \u201cWe Brits tend to pussyfoot around, despite having considerable leverage on the Saudis,\u201d I was told by John Deverell, the former director of defence diplomacy at the MoD, who was defence attache to Saudi Arabia and Yemen between 2001 and 2003. Unless Britain is willing \u201cto use the threat of pulling arms sales and personnel linked to the war in Yemen\u201d, Deverell added, any gestures of concern will be ineffectual. \u201cWe are worried that if we do speak truth to power, we will endanger the commercial relationship.\u201d It is this commercial relationship that is keeping Britain firmly ensnared in the Yemen war. Its foundation is an multi-billion pound, government-to-government arms deal signed in 1985 called al-Yamamah. This guarantees British maintenance, training and rearmament of any British aircraft sold to Saudi Arabia, in war and peacetime. The deal is open-ended, which means that its terms, which in the 1980s applied to Tornado aircraft, now cover the export of BAE\u2019s newer Typhoon jets. In response to a recent parliamentary question, the government refused to disclose the total income from the Al-Yamamah contract because it \u201cwould, or would be likely to, prejudice relations with another State\u201d \u2013 but former BAE CEO Mike Turner put it at more than \u00a340bn in 2005. Nick Gilby, a researcher who has written a book on the deal, estimates the current sales figure to be \u201cconservatively, \u00a360bn\u201d based on BAE statements and annual reports. Under the terms of the deal, Saudi Arabia reimburses the British Ministry of Defence for the costs it incurs by paying BAE to arm and maintain the Saudi air force, plus a 2% fee for the time of civil servants administering the procurement. BAE depends on this state contract for its survival, but it also wields enormous sway with the government as the principal executor of this multi-billion dollar deal. (The former foreign secretary Robin Cook once described the firm as having \u201cthe key to the garden door to No 10\u201d.) Although al-Yamamah does not generate any income per se for the British treasury, it is the bedrock of a deeper financial relationship between London and Riyadh. The House of Saud uses its oil revenues to buy British stocks, bonds and luxury property; it currently has \u00a393bn invested in the British economy. David Wearing, a specialist on UK-Saudi relations at Royal Holloway University, estimates that a fifth of the UK current account deficit is financed by Saudi cash, which \u201cstabilises an increasingly vulnerable pound\u201d. A former Conservative minister told me that just before Saudi Arabia started bombing Yemen in 2015, Riyadh privately communicated that it would squeeze Britain financially if the government wavered in its military cooperation. \u201cAt the outset, the imperative was conveyed that they saw British support of its war as a key test,\u201d the minister recalled. \u201cIf you fail, you\u2019re out, as far as commercial opportunities and influence in the future.\u201d The groundwork for the al-Yamamah deal was laid during Britain\u2019s imperial era. In the 1960s, the House of Saud financed an off-the-books war against Egyptian troops that had occupied Yemen, threatening both Saudi rule and Britain\u2019s colony in Aden. David Stirling, the founder of the SAS, used his sway with the Saudi King to broker a deal for the kingdom to buy British Lightning jets, radar systems and in-country services. A decade later, events swung Saudi Arabia and Britain even closer together. In 1979, religious zealots seized Mecca\u2019s Grand Mosque to demand the overthrow of the Saudi monarch \u2013 months after the Iranian revolution deposed the Shah and ushered in an Islamic Republic that openly challenged the House of Saud. Meanwhile, Britain was in financial disarray. It could not afford to buy the Tornado combat jet it had developed in a consortium with Italy and Germany. If Britain wanted an independent air deterrent, it would need a rich foreign buyer to subsidise the cost of its fleet. An insecure royal family sitting on the world\u2019s largest oil reserves was the perfect customer. Saudi Arabia wanted the best aircraft money could buy: the American F-16. Iran had the next model down, the F-14, but Israel was vehemently opposed to an Arab country getting planes that could challenge its own F-16s. The US found a workaround. Under a Nato framework, it would back the export of British Tornados to the House of Saud, which would keep the Soviets out of the Gulf and bring down the cost to Britain of upgrading its own fleet. Al-Yamamah was the result. It was the biggest arms deal in the world \u2013 and one that would save arms manufacturing in Britain. In a \u201csecret and personal\u201d letter to US president Ronald Reagan in 1988 \u2013 whose contents have not been previously reported \u2013 Thatcher confided that Saudi Arabia had given her assurances that it would not use British weapons aggressively against other states. According to a report by Mike Lewis, a former UN weapons inspector, Thatcher\u2019s government overruled Foreign Office officials who advised against committing Britain to a clause that explicitly obliged Britain to rearm Saudi Arabia in the event it went to war. It would, they said, expose the country to accusations of involvement in \u201cunlawful military adventures\u201d. * * * In March, I attended a government-organised convention in Farnborough for arms companies that want to break into lucrative export markets. Executives talked shop with government officials in the Export Growth Zone over chicken paprika sandwiches. We watched an \u201cSAS motivational speaker\u201d extol the importance of positive mental attitude. The convention featured a slide presentation on the details of arms control law by a senior official from the UK government\u2019s export-licensing agency. \u201cIgnorance is no use for breaking the law,\u201d the official told the attendees. Afterwards, I asked the official how it was possible that his own department \u2013 the Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU) \u2013 had issued blanket approvals for arms exports used in Yemen. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it just is,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m doing what I\u2019m told and doing my job,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I\u2019m uncomfortably aware that Adolf Eichmann said the same thing.\u201d The head of the ECJU, Edward Bell, has also expressed discomfort with re-arming the Saudi air campaign. \u201cMy gut tells me we should suspend [exports to Saudi Arabia],\u201d he wrote in a 2016 email to Sajid Javid, who was then the minister responsible for arms licensing. Javid ignored Bell\u2019s advice. In 2015, Vince Cable, Javid\u2019s predecessor, delayed the export of a shipment of Saudi-bound Paveway bombs in the wake of reports alleging that the air campaign had targeted hospitals in Yemen. But Cable told me that he quickly came under pressure from the then defence secretary, Michael Fallon, and prime minister David Cameron, to release the shipment. During the early phases of the air war, the British government replied to critics of its involvement by explaining that it conducted investigations into allegations of Saudi attacks on civilians in Yemen. But in 2016 \u2013 citing \u201cinfelicities of expression\u201d \u2013 the government reversed itself, and revised earlier ministerial statements that said it did investigate. Instead, when pushed on the use of British weapons in alleged war crimes in Yemen, the government pointed out that the Saudi-led coalition investigates itself. This work is done by the Joint Incident Assessment Team (JIAT), a body composed of around 20 military officers from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which is charged with investigating reports of civilian deaths in Yemen. Larry Lewis, the US official who urged the Saudis to establish the JIAT, told me that the team does not have researchers on the ground inside Yemen, so it must rely on the Saudi Royal Air Force to provide it with information. \u201cOccasionally they will take trips to Yemen to investigate high-visibility incidents,\u201d he said. Lewis also said the JIAT was \u201cdesigned to reduce common mistakes\u201d such as hitting targets on the no-strike list \u2013 wells, hospitals, schools. Similarly, it was supposed to reduce the chances of Saudi forces \u201cfailing to deploy tactical patience\u201d \u2013 for instance, bombing Houthi militiamen when they stop at a market, rather than waiting for them to leave to minimise civilian casualties. But Lewis now says the JIAT failed on its own terms, because it was simply ignored by the Saudi defence ministry. For the British government, however, the JIAT provides a convenient figleaf for the continued licensing of arms exports to Riyadh. Researchers at the open-source investigative agency Bellingcat have accused the coalition of dishonesty in \u201cthe vast majority of JIAT assessments\u201d. Rawan Shaif, who heads the group\u2019s Yemen project, told me that \u201cthe information that [the UK] has been relying on\u201d is coming from \u201ca partner you have been directly supporting in a conflict, who is lying to you about the majority of strikes\u201d. In the case of two particularly deadly attacks in May and July 2015 \u2013 in which more than 100 people were killed by airstrikes on outdoor markets in the town of Zabid and Fayoush, a suburb of Aden \u2013 the JIAT assessment simply insisted that the coalition had not bombed either location, in spite of reports by the UN, the BBC, Human Rights Watchand Amnesty, as well as camera-smartphone footage from the sites making it clear that an airstrike had taken place. Elsewhere the JIAT has justified strikes by flatly asserting that the targets were military ones. After reports of civilian deaths in an airstrike in al-Jawf governorate in September 2016, JIAT released a statement claiming that the coalition had hit \u201cHouthi commanders\u201d travelling in a pickup truck. But when the UN and the Yemeni human rights group Mwatana made independent visits to the site, they discovered that the victims were a woman driving with her two sisters-in-law and their 12 children. Parliamentary scrutiny of Britain\u2019s compliance with arms export control laws is the responsibility of the Committees for Arms Export Controls (CAEC). This cross-party grouping, which includes 18 MPs, is chaired by Graham Jones, a Labour MP who has criticised the \u201cdishonesty\u201d of NGOs reporting on human-rights violations in Yemen, written in support of Bin Salman and the Saudi-led coalition, and touted BAE\u2019s \u201cvital role\u201d for employment and the economy in his Lancashire constituency. Dr Anna Stavrianakis, an academic researching arms licensing at the University of Sussex, who has regularly given evidence to CAEC, accused Jones of keeping Yemen off the committee\u2019s agenda. \u201cThe government deliberately mobilises doubt and ambiguity when it comes to international humanitarian law violations in Yemen,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd the chair acts in support of government policy rather than acting impartially to scrutinise it.\u201d In an email to the Guardian, Jones replied that his critics were \u201cfar-left Marxists [who] back a violent, racist, Islamic fascist militia\u201d in Yemen, and said he had been \u201cat the forefront of discussions on Yemeni issues\u201d. * * * The ruling from the court of appeal, expected this Thursday, will determine whether the government\u2019s political will to arm Saudi Arabia has violated the law. The case, which was brought by Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT), an NGO, was heard before three judges on April 9. The result hinges on the interpretation of two words: \u201cclear risk\u201d. British law bans the licensing of arms if there is a \u201cclear risk\u201d that they could be used in a \u201cserious violation of IHL\u201d. The three judges will decide if the government has broken this law. \u201cI struggle to think of a case where the evidence has been so overwhelming and compelling than this one,\u201d said Rosa Curling of Leigh Day, the legal firm instructed by CAAT. \u201cIf arms can be exported legally in this scenario, then when could they not?\u201d The government argued that it has information, shared with the judges in secret, that gives it confidence there is not \u201cclear risk\u201d of Saudi Arabia needlessly killing civilians. Lawyers for CAAT countered that there is more than enough evidence in the public domain to prove this risk is real. CAAT lost its first case in 2017, when the high court ruled in favour of the government after hearing parts of the government\u2019s defence in secret. The QC Philippe Sands, who is not involved in this case, says that ministers should be personally concerned about the prospect of facing criminal charges for their role in arming Saudi Arabia. \u201cIf the United Kingdom is supplying weapons that are being used to commit crimes, then the possibility cannot be excluded that a minister who signs off on the sales in that knowledge could in the future be hauled before a court of law, national or international,\u201d he told me. British case law is clear that knowingly supplying a weapon that is used to commit a crime can mean that the supplier of the weapon is also liable for that crime. \u201cThe coalition claims that it only targets the Houthis and that it tries very hard to avoid civilian casualties, but the evidence suggests otherwise,\u201d said Dearbhla Minogue of the Global Legal Action Network, which is working with Bellingcat to investigate whether individual airstrikes in Yemen have violated international law. \u201cUK nationals involved in the transfer of arms in such a situation should be concerned about that,\u201d she said. According to Wayne Jordash QC, government officials would face a higher risk of prosecution if Britain is a \u201cparty to the conflict\u201d, an innocuous-sounding legal phrase that has exercised the civil service as evidence of civilian casualties has piled up. \u201cA lot of energy is spent on trying to keep us not a party,\u201d one Whitehall official remarked to me in April. Under international law, being a party to a conflict means providing military, financial or logistical support that directly degrades the military capacity of another belligerent and weakens their ability to conduct hostilities. A spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross told me it had made a determination as to whether Britain is a party to the Yemen war \u2013 but could not publicly disclose the result because it was still mediating between belligerents of the war and did not want to risk prejudicing relations. Ministers regularly tell parliament that Britain is not a party to the conflict. \u201cLet me make it very clear that we are not a party to the conflict \u2026 That is not the position of the United Kingdom,\u201d the then foreign minister Alister Burt told parliament in January, an assertion he repeated to me in an interview in April. The foreign office minister Mark Field similarly told parliament in March: \u201cWe still hold to the firm view that we are not a party to the conflict.\u201d But the senior British diplomatic source, citing internal Foreign Office legal advice, told me that \u201canybody who says that is is misspeaking\u201d. The cabinet decided to provide \u201cmilitary assistance\u201d to Saudi Arabia last year, he said, referring to the deployment of special forces, \u201cand by doing that we became a party to the conflict\u201d. The contortions of the British government to obscure its involvement in the Yemen war are nothing short of acrobatic. The government has tethered Britain, its military and its economy to the richest nation in the Arab world as it brutalises the poorest. Saudi Arabia is estimated to have spent $60-70bn every year on its failing war, nearly four times the current GDP of Yemen, and enough money to have secured the livelihoods of a generation of Yemenis. Farea Al-Muslimi, the son of a Yemeni farmer who now works at Chatham House, Britain\u2019s pre-eminent foreign-affairs thinktank, described to me the toll that war has taken on his country. \u201cTomorrow you\u2019re going to end up with a dead body called Yemen,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd no one will want to clean or bury it \u2013 and the Saudis, the Houthis, the British will realise they are fighting for something that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Arron Merat was a Tehran correspondent for the Economist between 2011 and 2014.

      "bodyText": "Australian butchers in the 19th century preferred to read thrillers, miners loved novels about horse racing, while the most popular author among doctors \u2013 and the Adelaide working class in 1861 \u2013 was Charles Dickens. These are just some of the insights gleaned from the Australian Common Reader, a publicly accessible database of historical library borrowing data launched this week by the Australian National University. The database tracks the borrowing habits of mostly working-class Australians between 1861 and 1928, and contains circulation records from six mechanics institute libraries, pre-dating most Australian public libraries. The project was first established by Curtin University professor Tim Dolin in 2008 before being acquired by ANU in 2013. Julieanne Lamond from ANU, who manages the project, told Guardian Australia that it was her goal to make the \u201crevolutionary\u201d database easily searchable and publicly accessible. \u201cThere\u2019s been a real difficulty getting this kind of data anywhere in the world,\u201d Lamond said. \u201cI think we\u2019re very lucky in Australia that we have so much of it and that someone had the foresight to digitise it.\u201d The libraries were based in regional areas with an intensive industry presence \u2013 coalmining, logging, wheat farming and exporting. Most of the records come from South Australia but there is also data from institutes in New South Wales, Western Australia and Victoria. Members of the public could join the libraries, despite them often being set up by companies to placate their workers. While male borrowers far outweigh women, Lamond she does not believe this is a reflection of literacy but rather the origins of the institutes themselves. \u201cThe ostensible aim for these libraries really was workers\u2019 education,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were often set up by the big employers in these towns, often mining companies, to give the workers something to do, to try and educate them and edify them. And of course the workers used them for their own purposes, and the women in the communities used them too.\u201d Miners are the most abundant profession represented in the data, making up 12.95% of borrowers, followed closely by those whose occupation was home duties \u2013 both men and women \u2013 at 10.79%. The data shows that our modern assumptions about men and women\u2019s different reading habits can\u2019t be readily applied to the past, Lamond said. \u201cThe data that we have shows that men and women read very widely across all these kinds of genres that now we think of as being quite gendered.\u201d Fiction was vastly preferred to nonfiction by all. The most voracious reader was a South Australian miner named John Pellew, who borrowed 877 books during his time with the Port Germein Institute. \u201cPeople\u2019s reading was very diverse, much more diverse than I think most of our reading is now,\u201d Lamond said. \u201cThese people just read incredibly widely. They were reading sporting novels and political thrillers, they were reading George Eliot and Jane Austen at the same time.\u201d Many of these communities had migrants from mining communities in Cornwall and Wales, places with a very strong culture around reading and self-education, Lamond said. That may explain why Cornish Christian novelist Joseph Hocking was the most popularly borrowed author, followed closely by prolific genre novelist Edward Phillips Oppenheim, and Henry Rider Haggard, who wrote adventure stories, with Charles Dickens coming in fourth. Periodicals and magazines were also circulated widely.

The face mask was black. The long tail looked black. Down the back ran a shelf of military-grey feathers and around the white front was a belt of warmth tinged minutely rose. The species breeds no nearer than northern Spain and is more at home on the arid steppes of Asiatic Russia or the bush-dotted pasture of Romania. It is, in truth, mostly African, living eight months a year by hunting beetles or grasshoppers among the thorn scrub and drylands near, or south of, the Kalahari. Here in Norfolk\u2019s green fields, it hopped from post to post. It dipped down from the wire for moths and bees. As it fizzed through the rain, the white wing bars blurred and the long tail darts flickered brilliant white. Then it would land and as we watched, our vision barred with the rain\u2019s unending static, this little bird would shake and wreath itself briefly in a shiver of rain diamonds.",

We need to win a game of football against Jamaica and we will see where the path takes us.\u201d With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/17/lottery-of-permutations-matildas-can-still-finish-top-or-bottom-of-world-cup-pool\">a myriad of permutations</a> open to the Matildas, coach Ante Milicic is trying to keep things simple against a tricky opponent, irrespective of current placings.</p> <p>Jamaica\u2019s prospects of progressing are slim \u2013 yet within that dangerous sweet-spot of being remote enough that any burden of expectation is off \u2013 but not entirely impossible and a surprise early goal or VAR intervention the Reggae Girlz could yet pose headaches.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/17/matildas-show-resilience-in-face-of-adversity-both-on-and-off-the-pitch\">Matildas show resilience in face of adversity both on and off the pitch | Joey Peters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In terms of preparation therefore, it\u2019s almost the hardest game for Australia\u2019s coaching staff as they look to balance several goals at once. Firstly they need to secure the result, secondly to rest key players for later in the tournament and thirdly to give key minutes to those needing either the kilometres under the bonnet or the confidence. But most importantly, none of this can jeopardise the first key priority, qualifying.</p> <p>It\u2019s a tricky task. Rest too many key players and it smacks of disrespect \u2013 even the most unfancied of opponents often rise to such provocations. But roll out a first choice XI and you miss a golden opportunity to secure marginal gains for later in the tournament through clever management of workloads.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fairly detailed process,\u201d Milicic said. \u201cWe always said when we started camp in Turkey that we had to individualise our periodisation, and now even though we are all together as a group there are still areas that we look at daily. That\u2019s the reason behind a few girls not training and they completed a different type of session this morning.\u201d</p> <p>Under perfect skies in Grenoble two of those to play every minute so far, Emily van Egmond and Ellie Carpenter sat out, as did player of the match from the Brazil game, Chloe Logarzo, while Elise Kellond-Knight also opted out of training after warm up.</p> <p>None are definite injury scratchings, with Milicic suggesting Clare Polkinghorne as perhaps the only player not 100% for the Jamaica game, but there are plenty waiting in the wings who could see vital match time.</p> <p>Chasing her 150<sup>th</sup> cap, veteran Lisa De Vanna will be champing at the bit for the opportunity to score at a fourth World Cup and could come in for Caitlin Foord who has got through a power of work so far. Katrina Gorry is another knocking at the door \u2013 she could come into the engine room allowing the hard-working Tameka Yallop or Van Egmond a rest.</p> <p>Gema Simon is also a chance at left-back, should Kellond-Knight not pull up well from her first 90 minutes in three months against Brazil, with Mary Fowler a potential cameo late on, perhaps giving skipper Sam Kerr an early respite \u2013 should things be tracking well for the Matildas.</p> <p>As for Jamaica, it\u2019s very hard to know where this team is at.

      "bodyText": "\u201cAs we stand here today, we haven\u2019t qualified for the next round, let\u2019s not forget that. We need to win a game of football against Jamaica and we will see where the path takes us.\u201d With a myriad of permutations open to the Matildas, coach Ante Milicic is trying to keep things simple against a tricky opponent, irrespective of current placings. Jamaica\u2019s prospects of progressing are slim \u2013 yet within that dangerous sweet-spot of being remote enough that any burden of expectation is off \u2013 but not entirely impossible and a surprise early goal or VAR intervention the Reggae Girlz could yet pose headaches. In terms of preparation therefore, it\u2019s almost the hardest game for Australia\u2019s coaching staff as they look to balance several goals at once. Firstly they need to secure the result, secondly to rest key players for later in the tournament and thirdly to give key minutes to those needing either the kilometres under the bonnet or the confidence. But most importantly, none of this can jeopardise the first key priority, qualifying. It\u2019s a tricky task. Rest too many key players and it smacks of disrespect \u2013 even the most unfancied of opponents often rise to such provocations. But roll out a first choice XI and you miss a golden opportunity to secure marginal gains for later in the tournament through clever management of workloads. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly detailed process,\u201d Milicic said. \u201cWe always said when we started camp in Turkey that we had to individualise our periodisation, and now even though we are all together as a group there are still areas that we look at daily. That\u2019s the reason behind a few girls not training and they completed a different type of session this morning.\u201d Under perfect skies in Grenoble two of those to play every minute so far, Emily van Egmond and Ellie Carpenter sat out, as did player of the match from the Brazil game, Chloe Logarzo, while Elise Kellond-Knight also opted out of training after warm up. None are definite injury scratchings, with Milicic suggesting Clare Polkinghorne as perhaps the only player not 100% for the Jamaica game, but there are plenty waiting in the wings who could see vital match time. Chasing her 150th cap, veteran Lisa De Vanna will be champing at the bit for the opportunity to score at a fourth World Cup and could come in for Caitlin Foord who has got through a power of work so far. Katrina Gorry is another knocking at the door \u2013 she could come into the engine room allowing the hard-working Tameka Yallop or Van Egmond a rest. Gema Simon is also a chance at left-back, should Kellond-Knight not pull up well from her first 90 minutes in three months against Brazil, with Mary Fowler a potential cameo late on, perhaps giving skipper Sam Kerr an early respite \u2013 should things be tracking well for the Matildas. As for Jamaica, it\u2019s very hard to know where this team is at. Showing glimpses of quality in attack against Brazil, through the bustling industry of Khadija Shaw they remain good for a goal \u2013 even if that\u2019s eluded them so far. In goals, teenager Sydney Schneider has been a revelation, 17-year-old striker Jody Brown is a rising talent, while Cheyna Matthews\u2019 return to the NWSL after giving birth shows remarkable determination. Overarching all of this is the inspirational story of Cedella Marley \u2013 daughter of Bob \u2013 whose salvation of the team has been well documented. With nothing to lose, Jamaica could put in their strongest performance yet \u2013 especially after an early adverse VAR call handed Italy vital early momentum during their 5-0 win. In Australia\u2019s favour the need not just for a strong performance but also to reverse a +6 goal difference in comparison with current Group C leaders Italy, should spur the Matildas on. \u201cWe feel like we definitely didn\u2019t play our best football in the first game,\u201d Emily Gielnik said. \u201cAnd it definitely wasn\u2019t our best in the second game, but it was better. So we have got momentum and we\u2019re getting stronger and stronger.\u201d And having played just seven games under Milicic it\u2019s unlikely complacency will have set in among the squad \u2013 especially given the shock loss in Valenciennes coming as it did, just nine days earlier. With their backs against the wall, Australia performed admirably against Brazil. But backed in as favourites against Italy, the Matildas flattered to deceive. With fans and pundits expecting Australia to dominate this final group stage game becomes another kind of challenge. A win in Grenoble, and a handsome one at that, may just show another important maturation for the Matildas, as they look to keep their finals target on track.

      "bodyText": "One of the asylum seekers the Norwegian cargo ship Tampa rescued in 2001 has won a prestigious Fulbright scholarship to undertake postgraduate studies in the US. Abbas Nazari was seven years old when his family boarded a fishing boat from Indonesia to Australia. He was one of 433 people, predominantly of the ethnic minority Hazaras of Afghanistan, who were caught up in an international standoff when the boat foundered. Australia was in the midst of an election and many analysts believe the Tampa affair helped John Howard retain government. Ultimately it was New Zealand which gave Nazari\u2019s family a chance to start a new life. \u201cNew Zealand put up its hand,\u201d Nazari joked, in a TedX talk in Christchurch in 2012. \u201cWho or what is a New Zealand? That\u2019s what we were thinking, but we didn\u2019t care that New Zealand was the end of our six-month journey from [a tiny village in Afghanistan].\u201d After only six years of speaking English, Nazari ranked third in New Zealand\u2019s national spelling bee. In 2016 he graduated with a first-class honours degree in international relations and diplomacy from the University of Canterbury. Now is Nazari bound for New York to complete a masters of international affairs at Columbia University. Tampa refugees resettled in New Zealand are now small business owners, home owners, doctors, nurses, public servants, students and keen rugby players, Nazari wrote in a piece for the Spinoff. \u201cGiven the chance at a new life, we have grabbed it with both hands,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to call myself a Kiwi. I have been back to Afghanistan twice in the years since we arrived in New Zealand, and I have seen what life would have been like had my family stayed in war-torn Afghanistan.\u201d The former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and Phil Goff, who served as her foreign minister, who took the refugees to New Zealand have heaped praise on Nazari. \u201cWelcoming the Tampa refugees was one of my proudest moments as foreign minister,\u201d Goff said on Twitter. Nazari and 11 other New Zealanders will be awarded their scholarships at a ceremony at NZ parliament on Tuesday night.",

In anticipation, a Democratic super political action committee, Priorities USA, is beginning a six-figure digital advertising effort to \u201chelp cut through his noise and give voters a look at the truth about Trump\u2019s policies.\u201d </p> <p>The attention is a recognition that, despite its expensive media markets and polarized politics, neither party can ignore Florida. </p> <p>For Trump, there are few ways for him to remain in the White House without keeping Florida\u2019s 29 electoral votes. For Democrats, a win here would validate the party\u2019s emphasis on building diverse coalitions, not to mention all but obliterate Trump\u2019s reelection prospects. </p> <p>Florida Democrats say it\u2019s wrong to interpret recent election results as the state slipping away. </p> <p><strong>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re red. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re purple. I think we\u2019re simply unorganized,\u201d said former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor who lost by fewer than 33,000 votes. </strong></p> <p>Gillum\u2019s race was one of several in recent years decided by a tiny sliver of the electorate, leaving the state a veritable graveyard of broken Democratic dreams. </p> <p>Earlier this year, he launched Forward Florida, a political group meant to help Democrats retake the state in 2020, to keep Florida from being left by the wayside as Democrats try to sort out how the Trump-era political realignment has remade the presidential map. </p> <p>While both parties seem convinced of the importance of the upper Midwest, fresh questions are being raised over whether the path to the White House must still run through other long-standing battlegrounds and whether others might be emerging. The Democratic super PAC Priorities USA revealed last month that its polling shows Ohio, an erstwhile swing state, now appears safer for Trump than deep-red Texas. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88699e6b79f3167572d9263690cdb77f557b3861\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88699e6b79f3167572d9263690cdb77f557b3861/0_691_4834_2901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Broward resident Joannie James counter protests along with other Gillum supporters as supporters of Rob DeSantis and Rick Scott protest the handling of election results.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Broward resident Joannie James counter protests along with other Gillum supporters as supporters of Rob DeSantis and Rick Scott protest the handling of election results.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Witlen/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d07d8578f08374cc578fe48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-17T18:16:25.174Z\">7.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Next candidate up in the forum is Andrew Yang, a Silicon Valley and New York entrepreneur.

The court ruled that baker Jack Phillips was subjected to anti-religious bias in the Colorado Civil Rights Commission\u2019s determination that he violated state anti-discrimination in refusing to bake the couple\u2019s wedding cake.

They met with Aaron Klein, who asked for the date of the ceremony and the names of the bride and groom. </p> <p>When told there was no groom, Klein said he was sorry but the bakery did not make cakes for same-sex weddings. According to documents from the case, Rachel and her mother left the shop, but returned a short time later. As Rachel remained in the car, in tears, her mother went in to speak with Klein. </p> <p>The mother told Klein she had once thought like him, but her \u201ctruth had changed\u201d when she had two gay children. Klein responded by quoting Leviticus: \u201cYou shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.\u201d </p> <p>The justices already have agreed to decide in their election-year session whether federal civil rights law protects people from job discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d07b4518f08263b930f13a5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-17T15:46:38.734Z\">4.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile in Orlando, Florida, supporters of President Trump have started lining up in hopes of getting into a rally announcing his re-election bid Tuesday at 8pm in the Amway Center. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bycarolineglenn/status/1140632000396767233\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People are already lined up outside the Amway Center in Orlando for the Trump rally tomorrow.

      "bodyText": "The US is sending an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East \u201cfor defensive purposes.\u201d Acting defense secretary Pat Shanahan said that the \u201crecent Iranian attacks validate the reliable, credible intelligence we have received on hostile behavior by Iranian forces,\u201d but that the US \u201cdoes not seek conflict with Iran\u201d. The Trump administration will cut hundreds of millions in aid to to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. President Trump had blasted these three countries because thousands of their citizens had sought asylum at the US border. Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Kamala Harris closed out the Poor People\u2019s Campaign Presidential Forum. The New York Times is reporting that the Justice Department has intervened to keep former Trump adviser Paul Manafort out of the notorious Rikers Island jail complex. Manafort was set to be transferred to Rikers this month to await trial on a separate state case, according to the New York Times. But then Manhattan prosecutors received a letter from Jeffrey Rosen, the top deputy for attorney general William Barr, that indicated that \u201che was monitoring where Mr. Manafort would be held in New York\u201d. And then, on Monday, federal prison officials weighed in, telling the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office that Mr. Manafort, 70, would not be going to Rikers. Instead, he will await his trial at a federal lockup in Manhattan or at the Pennsylvania federal prison where he is serving a seven-and-a-half-year sentence for wide-ranging financial schemes, according to people with knowledge of the matter. A senior Justice Department official said that the department believed Mr. Manafort\u2019s treatment was appropriate, but several former and current prosecutors said the decision was highly unusual. Most federal inmates facing state charges are held on Rikers Island. The intervention of Mr. Rosen was just the latest twist in the case of Mr. Manafort, whose campaign work for Mr. Trump and political consulting in Ukraine put him in the cross hairs of a two-year investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election. He was convicted of financial fraud in two separate federal cases that came out of the investigation, which was led by the former special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. While that might have been the end of his criminal problems, in March, he was indicted on 16 New York state felonies, including mortgage fraud and falsifying records to obtain millions of dollars in loans. The charges, which are based on some of the same actions in the federal cases, were brought by the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. Mr. Manafort is expected to be arraigned next week in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Speaking of acting defense secretary Pat Shanahan, it appears his confirmation hearing has been delayed: From the article: Despite informally announcing more than a month ago acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan as his pick to get the Pentagon job on a permanent basis, President Donald Trump has yet to formally nominate Shanahan, forcing the Senate Armed Services Committee to postpone a confirmation hearing it had tentatively scheduled for Tuesday June 18. Senators were told that the postponement was because the committee had yet to receive documents from the FBI\u2019s background check, according to a staffer for a committee member. With Shanahan\u2019s confirmation on hold, press reports have questioned his relationship with the president, and the Pentagon has been fielding press queries about his personal life, including a messy divorce that involved an accusation of domestic violence from his ex-wife. Shanahan did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story. The Pentagon declined to comment. The Department of Defense authorized the deployment of an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East, the acting defense secretary announced today, in response to last week\u2019s attacks on oil tankers last week, which the US believed Iran was behind. Here are some comments from acting defense secretary Pat Shanahan: My, the difference a few months can make: Just for some context, the latest Quinnipiac poll has former vice president Joe Biden leading at 30%, Senator Bernie Sanders at 19%, Senator Elizabeth Warren at 15%, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (who was virtually unknown in December 2018) at 8% and Senator Kamala Harris also at 7%. Beto O\u2019Rourke trials at 3%, with Senator Cory Booker and Senator Amy Klobuchar tied at 1%. Senator Kamala Harris has now taken the stage at the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. Here\u2019s more on the 1,000 additional troops that the US is sending to the Middle East: Senator Bernie Sanders is now on stage at the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. Looks like we have more details on the additional troops the US is sending to the Middle East: Reuters is reporting that the US is preparing to send more troops to the Middle East in response to mounting concerns over Iran, which Washington blames for attacks on oil tankers last week. Further details, such as how many troops and when they will be deployed, were not disclosed. The Trump administration will cut hundreds of millions in aid to to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras after President Trump blasted the three countries because their citizens had sought asylum at the US border, Reuters is reporting. The administration reportedly told congressional aides that it would reallocate $370m in aid that Congress approved for fiscal 2018, and suspend $180m approved for fiscal 2017. The administration said in March it would cut aid to the three countries after Trump expressed unhappiness with the their immigration policies. No funds will be provided until the administration is satisfied the countries are reducing the number of migrants reaching the U.S. border, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus told reporters. \u201cThis is consistent with the president\u2019s direction and with the recognition that it is critical that there be sufficient political will in these countries to address the problem at its source,\u201d she said. Without elaborating, she added: \u201cWorking with Congress, we will reprogram those funds to other priorities as appropriate.\u201d Hey all, Vivian Ho taking over for Jessica Glenza. Let\u2019s see where the day takes us. The Poor People\u2019s Campaign in Washington DC honed 2020 Democratic candidates\u2019 positions on progressive issues, including single-payer healthcare, universal childcare and a tax on America\u2019s wealthiest. Warren had a receptive audience, talking about progressive issues central to her campaign. Biden said he would make poverty a focus. Trump supporters are already lining up at a stadium in Orlando, Florida in preparation for a rally tomorrow, and a Democratic super PAC is spending heavily on digital ads in the Sunshine state. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with rightwing populist Matteo Salvini. The US Supreme Court issued a significant legal victory to Democrats in Virginia, and a defeat to a lesbian couple in Oregon who were denied a cake because they are gay. Sen. Michael Bennett of Colorado is speaking now at the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Kamala Harris of California. MSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid asked Warren how she would win: Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s communications director will become the Vice President for communications at Lockheed Martin, one of the largest defense contractors in the US. The crowd at Poor People\u2019s Campaign is reacting to Warren\u2019s message. Senator Elizabeth Warren is on a roll on matters that are core to her platform \u2013 a tax on people earning more than $50m, free universal childcare, free pre-kindergarten, canceling student loans and $100bn over 10 years for the opioid crisis. \u201cAsking those at the very top to put in 2 cents is enough to be able to help all of our children build a future, not just some of our children, but all of our children,\u201d said Warren. US Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now stepping on stage at the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. Earlier today, as the US Supreme Court released its decisions, Justice Clarence Thomas took a noteworthy stand: he said the court should \u201cnot follow\u201d precedent he viewed as \u201cdemonstrably erroneous\u201d. The legal concept of stare decisis, a Latin phrase pronounced meaning \u201cstand by things decided,\u201d is a foundational principal for the court. It means, in general, once the court has spoken on an issue it is unlikely to take up a similar case. It also one of the ways law is made \u2013 lower courts must abide by precedent. That made his comments in a concurring opinion on a double jeopardy case today remarkable. For most legal analysts, the remarks called to mind one decision in particlar: Roe v Wade. Thomas says legal questions have objectively correct answers, and judges should find them regardless of whether their colleagues or predecessors found different answers,\u201d Jonathan Entin, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, told Reuters. \u201cEveryone is concerned about this because they\u2019re thinking about Roe v. Wade.\u201d The landmark 1973 US Supreme Court decision legalized abortion, and provided women with a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. That right has been under continuous attack from state legislatures this year, which have passed clearly unconstitutional laws in an effort to get the issue before the court again. When faced with a demonstrably erroneous precedent, my rule is simple: We should not follow it,\u201d wrote Thomas, who has long expressed a greater willingness than his colleagues to overrule precedents. The US Department of State just provided this statement about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s meeting with Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, a rightwing populist politician. Here is the statement from spokesperson Morgan Ortagus:\u200e Secretary Michael R. Pompeo met today in Washington with Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Matteo Salvini. They reiterated the value of the United States\u2019 longstanding relationship with Italy, including as NATO Allies and members of the G7. They also discussed confronting regional security risks from Russia and Iran, the threat posed by China\u2019s predatory investments in key infrastructure and technology in Italy and Europe, and the need for strengthened U.S.-Italy defense cooperation. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is expected to appear on the Poor People\u2019s Campaign presidential forum today, also spoke with The American Prospect today. Here is what she had to say about monopolies: We\u2019ve had a government that has kissed up to every giant corporation for decades. It has weakened antitrust enforcement, looked the other way on mergers, passed on deals that everyone knew were anti-competitive and would be bad for the economy and bad for competition but good for the bottom line of the companies that wanted it... The problem is not an overreaching government, the problem is a government that won\u2019t get in the fight on the side of the people. She focused in particular about tech platforms. So I have a plan to break up the big platforms. If a platform is doing more than a billion dollars in business, the platform has to be broken off from all of the ancillary businesses. And there\u2019s just\u2014We shouldn\u2019t have to litigate it. Just make it happen. It\u2019s too much concentration of power. Reverend William Barber is now working the crowd. MSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid asks him to respond to people who say caring for people in poverty should be the job of charities. Respond he said \u2013 \u201cWithout cursing?\u201d He goes on to say: \u201cWe have to say to folks \u2013 you\u2019re wrong.\u201d ... \u201cTo say all you need is charity to address 143 million people in poverty... It\u2019s like saying well all you need to do is fix slavery is have church in the slave quarters, or all you need to do to fix women not having the vote is to pray with them.\u201d ... \u201cPoverty is intentional and strategic and this nation needs to be intentional and strategic about it.\u201d Just want to return briefly to one of the Biden\u2019s more striking answers to MSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid at the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. The Poor People\u2019s Campaign is back and now discussing a striking figure often cited \u2013 that 140 million people in the United States are low-income or living in poverty. Here is Reverend William Barber talking about the number: The people impacted... must cry loud. We cannot wait for the system to be loud about the crisis, we have to be loud about the crisis.\u201d That figure \u2013 140 million people living in poverty \u2013 comes from what is known as the federal Supplemental Poverty Measure. That takes into account measures such as costs for food, clothing, housing as well as federal assistance. Here is the full report that describes the underpinnings of the campaign. As Trump gets ready to head to Florida tomorrow, here\u2019s a bit of perspective on the Sunshine State\u2019s importance in presidential politics. Democratic candidates, including early front-runner Joe Biden, have visited the state to tap donors and connect with voters, and will come to Miami later this month for their first round of debates. Trump returns on Tuesday for his latest reelection announcement. In anticipation, a Democratic super political action committee, Priorities USA, is beginning a six-figure digital advertising effort to \u201chelp cut through his noise and give voters a look at the truth about Trump\u2019s policies.\u201d The attention is a recognition that, despite its expensive media markets and polarized politics, neither party can ignore Florida. For Trump, there are few ways for him to remain in the White House without keeping Florida\u2019s 29 electoral votes. For Democrats, a win here would validate the party\u2019s emphasis on building diverse coalitions, not to mention all but obliterate Trump\u2019s reelection prospects. Florida Democrats say it\u2019s wrong to interpret recent election results as the state slipping away. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re red. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re purple. I think we\u2019re simply unorganized,\u201d said former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor who lost by fewer than 33,000 votes. Gillum\u2019s race was one of several in recent years decided by a tiny sliver of the electorate, leaving the state a veritable graveyard of broken Democratic dreams. Earlier this year, he launched Forward Florida, a political group meant to help Democrats retake the state in 2020, to keep Florida from being left by the wayside as Democrats try to sort out how the Trump-era political realignment has remade the presidential map. While both parties seem convinced of the importance of the upper Midwest, fresh questions are being raised over whether the path to the White House must still run through other long-standing battlegrounds and whether others might be emerging. The Democratic super PAC Priorities USA revealed last month that its polling shows Ohio, an erstwhile swing state, now appears safer for Trump than deep-red Texas. Next candidate up in the forum is Andrew Yang, a Silicon Valley and New York entrepreneur. He starts by talking about how the most common jobs will be \u201cautomated away\u201d. We need a guaranteed minimum income in the United States of America... If you know anything about me you know this \u2013 there\u2019s an Asian man running for president and he wants to give everyone $1,000 a month.\u201d Reverend William Barber asks former Vice President Joe Biden whether he will have a full debate on poverty in his campaign. Reverend that\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d said Biden. He continued, \u201cIt\u2019s not only systemic it is incredibly debilitating, it is the one thing that can bring this country down.\u201d We are now live-streaming the Poor People\u2019s Campaign Presidential Forum, where former Vice President Joe Biden is speaking now. To clarify, this blog earlier stated the wrong time for this forum. It is happening now, not this evening. A Democratic super PAC is launching ads in Florida, ahead of Trump\u2019s planned rally there on Tuesday (for which people are already lining up). The six-figure digital ad blitz is part of a larger $100m effort across four key states, also including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. \u201cDonald Trump wants to come to Orlando and kick off his 2020 campaign by deceiving voters about his record on health care and the economy. But the truth is, Trump\u2019s policies haven\u2019t helped many Floridians \u2013 billionaires and big corporations are thriving while the middle class foots the bill. These ads will show Floridians how out of touch Trump and his policies are with the concerns of Floridan families,\u201d said Guy Cecil, Chairman of Priorities USA. \u201cFlorida is a must-win state for Trump and he hopes to have the news to himself this week. These ads will help cut through his noise and give voters a look at the truth about Trump\u2019s policies.\u201d Here is an example of one of the ads. Today is the fourth anniversary of the shooting at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. In 2015, a white supremacist entered the historically black church, and shot and killed nine people during the final prayer at a Bible study. Harvard has rescinded the acceptance of Kyle Kashuv, a survivor of the school shooting at Majorie Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, and a pro-gun activist. Most of Kashuv\u2019s classmates pushed for stricter gun control laws. Kashuv said on Twitter his acceptance was rescinded because of \u201ctexts and comments made nearly two years ago\u201d. The Tampa Bay Times reported Harvard\u2019s move came after reports Kashuv used racial slurs in shared documents. More from the Times here: Kashuv, who graduated from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School earlier this summer, has been embraced by conservatives and the National Rifle Association in his rapid arc to fame since the Feb. 14, 2018 mass shooting that left 17 students and faculty dead and 17 other people injured at the Broward County school). Kashuv, who told us last year that his parents are from Israel, has also been castigated by those on the left for his conservative views and unwavering support of President Donald Trump. Here is an account from the Atlantic from this April, of how these lunches have gone in the past: For decades, presidents and vice presidents have held regular one-on-one lunches with no aides present. The ritual helps build trust and, because only two people are at the table, prevents leaks, veterans of past White Houses said. Trump ditched that tradition. Instead he has invited to the lunches both his and Pence\u2019s top aides. At the meals in the small dining room off the Oval Office, Trump keeps a big-screen TV tuned to cable news. Aides who have walked in have seen Trump yelling at the TV as he sits with Pence and their deputies over plates of chicken and cheeseburgers. When he sees something on the screen that he dislikes, Trump on occasion will interrupt the lunch and summon aides to discuss a response, people familiar with the lunches said. Here\u2019s a little more about the couple who were denied a cake by an Oregon bakery, and what happened after they filed a case. This week\u2019s New Yorker celebrates Pride Month. From the artist, Milan, Italy-based Olimpia Zagnoli: My job is to interpret what I see and translate it into images that evoke not only the subject but also the culture around it. Drawing two women kissing as colorful, strong, unapologetic, and free individuals is my way of contributing to a more honest representation of people, in the media. The US Supreme Court sent the case of an Oregon baker who refused to make cakes for gay people back to the lower court to be reconsidered. From the Association Press: The justices\u2019 action Monday keeps the high-profile case off the court\u2019s election-year calendar and orders state judges to take a new look at the dispute between the lesbian couple and the owners of a now-closed bakery in the Portland area. The high court\u2019s brief order directs appellate judges in Oregon to consider last term\u2019s Supreme Court ruling in favor of a baker from Colorado who would not make a cake for a same-sex wedding. The court ruled that baker Jack Phillips was subjected to anti-religious bias in the Colorado Civil Rights Commission\u2019s determination that he violated state anti-discrimination in refusing to bake the couple\u2019s wedding cake. The Oregon appellate ruling came before the court\u2019s decision in Phillips\u2019 case. The larger issue weighing the rights of LGBT people against the religious objections of merchants remains unresolved. Another dispute involving a florist from Washington state who would not create flower arrangements for a same-sex wedding is headed to the Supreme Court. The Oregon case had been in Supreme Court limbo for months, sometimes signaling behind-the-scenes negotiation over what to do. The case involves bakers Melissa and Aaron Klein, who paid a $135,000 judgment to the couple for declining to create a cake for them in 2013. The dispute began when Rachel Bowman-Cryer went to the bakery with her mother in January 2013. They met with Aaron Klein, who asked for the date of the ceremony and the names of the bride and groom. When told there was no groom, Klein said he was sorry but the bakery did not make cakes for same-sex weddings. According to documents from the case, Rachel and her mother left the shop, but returned a short time later. As Rachel remained in the car, in tears, her mother went in to speak with Klein. The mother told Klein she had once thought like him, but her \u201ctruth had changed\u201d when she had two gay children. Klein responded by quoting Leviticus: \u201cYou shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.\u201d The justices already have agreed to decide in their election-year session whether federal civil rights law protects people from job discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Meanwhile in Orlando, Florida, supporters of President Trump have started lining up in hopes of getting into a rally announcing his re-election bid Tuesday at 8pm in the Amway Center. Supporters are lining up because a ticket does not necessarily guarantee entry to the rally. The Amway Center holds 20,000 people, but the president has already said far more ticket requests have been made. Trump has a history of lying about crowd sizes. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a bunch of people, and it\u2019s going to be pretty intense,\u201d Gary Beck, a Trump supporter from Panama City, Florida, according to local news outlet Click Orlando. \u201cThe electricity is going to be high. It\u2019s time for America to get back on its feet and be made better than it\u2019s ever been before.\u201d \u201cNobody ever recovers.\u201d More on Mulvaney being ushered out of room for coughing, during Trump\u2019s interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. The US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in racial gerrymandering in Virginia came with an interesting mix of justices in the majority. Trump-nominee Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the majority, lead by liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to rule against Virginia Republicans. Another important case from the US Supreme Court, this one on racial gerrymandering in Virginia. The court ruled state Republicans did not have the standing to sue in the case. The decision leaves intact a lower court\u2019s ruling that 11 districts were drawn to diminish the clout of black voters \u2013 and are therefore invalid. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote he decision for the 5-4 majority. More from Reuters: The state\u2019s House of Delegates \u201clacks authority to displace Virginia\u2019s attorney general as representative of the state,\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court\u2019s majority. \u201cIn short, Virginia would rather stop than fight on. One house of its bicameral legislature cannot alone continue the litigation against the will of its partners in the legislative process,\u201d Ginsburg added. The case involved a hot topic for the Supreme Court: a practice called gerrymandering involving the manipulation of electoral district boundaries to marginalize a certain set of voters and increase the influence of others. In this case, the Republican legislators were accused of racial gerrymandering to disadvantage black voters. In two other major cases from Maryland and North Carolina, the justices are considering whether courts can curb gerrymandering aimed at purely partisan advantage. They are due to rule in those cases by the end of this month. At issue in the Virginia case was the state legislative map drawn by Republicans after the 2010 national census. The new map is already being used. Since the Virginia maps that were challenged in the case were drawn, Democrats have made gains in Virginia in both state and federal elections. The White House National Security Council has just said Iran\u2019s plan to enrich more uranium is \u201cnuclear blackmail\u201d which must be met \u201cwith increasing international pressure,\u201d according to Reuters. Tensions are high between Iran and Washington DC after two oil tankers were damaged in the Gulf of Oman, in a critical shipping channel called the Strait of Hormuz. US Central Command released a video last week, which officials claimed to show men in an Iranian Revolutionary Guard Patrol Boat removing a magnetic limpet mine from the hull of one of the ships. Other leaders have contested whether the video alone is enough evidence of Iran\u2019s involvement. We\u2019ve also just got one of the first US Supreme Court rulings of the season, with implications for criminal cases involving Robert Mueller\u2019s probe on Russian meddling in the US election. The Associated Press reports a rule allowing state and federal governments to charge an individual for the same crime was upheld. The court\u2019s 7-2 decision Monday preserves a long-standing rule that provides an exception to the Constitution\u2019s ban on trying someone twice for the same offense. The court ruled against federal prison inmate Terance Gamble. He was prosecuted by Alabama and the federal government for having a gun after an earlier conviction for robbery. The case had been closely watched because a ruling for Gamble might have made it harder for states to pursue criminal charges against defendants in the Russia investigation in the event they are pardoned by President Donald Trump. New York authorities already have indicted Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman. A $15 federal minimum wage. Single-payer healthcare. Taxes on America\u2019s 75,000 wealthiest households. Restoring welfare funding. And cutting military spending. These are the proposals called for by the Poor People\u2019s Campaign\u2019s \u201cmoral budget\u201d. The report was released to coincide with the 10-candidate presidential forum tonight at 8pm ET. Here are the key findings, and the full report. We expect the Poor People\u2019s Campaign presidential forum to begin at 8pm ET tonight. Reverend William Barber, the charismatic co-leader from small town Greensboro, North Carolina, spoke to MSNBC on Sunday about what the forum represents. \u201cThis campaign is connected to tens and tens of thousands of people,\u201d Barber told AM Joy on MSNBC. When you look at the interlocking injustices of systemic racism, systemic poverty, ecological devastation, the war economy and the false moral narrative of religious nationalism \u2013 they are very real and impacting 140m people.\u201d ... \u201cWe are in a moral crisis and we cannot have another season of elections where we talk about the wealthy and the middle class and tax cuts and we do not talk specifically what are the agenda items for the poor.\u201d One of the most defining features of American campaigns is their expense. The 2016 presidential race between Hillary Clinton and President Trump cost an estimated $2.4bn, between spending from campaigns and outside advocacy groups. Hence, people are taking note of Pete Buttigieg\u2019s $7m April fundraising total. Of course, that tally is still far behind frontrunner and former Vice President Joe Biden, who raised $6.3m on the first day he announced his candidacy in April. One more note here \u2013 2016\u2019s campaign is also a vivid example that the wealthiest campaign does not always win. Clinton raised almost twice as much money as Trump, and although she received more popular votes, she still could not win the electoral college. Deputy Italian Prime Minister and far right leader Matteo Salvini meets with US Secretary of State and Vice President Mike Pence today. The Italian politician is in Washington DC to attend a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. Salvini has been seeking closer relations with the US since Trump\u2019s election. Salvini took no questions from reporters. Salvini will also meet with the powerful American special interest group Americans for Tax Reform, whose supremely well connected leader is Grover Norquist. In the early 2000s, Norquist successfully got dozens of Republican Congressmen to pledge not to raise taxes at all. Salvini is promoting a flat-tax in Italy. That clip we mentioned of Trump scolding Mick Mulvaney? Here it is. Wait for roughly the 20 second mark. Also, this is a friendly reminder of Mulvaney\u2019s time before he was chief of staff. In 2018, when Mulvaney led the watchdog Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he tried to gut the agency by firing all 25 members of its advisory committee. Good morning and welcome to the politics liveblog. Today we\u2019re looking ahead to the Poor People\u2019s Campaign Forum, where 10 Democratic candidates will square off. The candidates will answer questions from activists Reverends William Barber and Liz Theoharis and low-income Americans. We\u2019re also keeping an eye on who might replace the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, whose leaving (characteristically) was announced via tweet last week. Finally, we\u2019re all watching a clip of President Trump scolding his chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.",
